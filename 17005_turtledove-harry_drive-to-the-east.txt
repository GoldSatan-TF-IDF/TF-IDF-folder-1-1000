daughters alison rachel and rebecca i every antiaircraft gun in richmond seemed to thunder at once the sky above the capital of the confederate states filled with black puffs of smoke jake featherston the president of the csa had heard that his aviators called those bursts niggerbaby flak they did look something like black dollsand they were as dangerous as blacks in the confederacy too us airplanes didnt usually come over richmond by daylight any more than confederate aircraft usually raided washington or philadelphia or new york city when the sun was in the sky antiaircraft fire and aggressive fighter patrols had quickly made daylight bombing more expensive than it was worth the night was the time when bombers droned overhead today the united states was making an exception that they were surprised jake very little two nights before confederate bombers had killed us president al smith they hadnt done it on purpose trying to hit one particular man or one particular building in a city like philadelphia especially at night was like going after a needle in a haystack with your eyes closed try or not though theyd flattened powel house the president of the usas philadelphia residence and smashed the bomb shelter beneath it vice president la follette was vice president no more featherston wasnt sure he would have deliberately killed al smith if hed had the chance after all hed hornswoggled a plebiscite on kentucky and the part of west texas the usa had called houston and sequoyah out of smith and triumphantly welcomed the first two back into the confederacy but hed expected smith to go right on yielding to him and the son of a bitch hadnt done it smith hadnt taken the peace proposal featherston offered him after confederate armor sliced through ohio to lake erie either even though the usa remained cut in two the country also remained very much in the war the struggle wasnt as sharp and short and easy as jake had hoped so maybe al smith was better off dead maybe how could you tell like any vice president charlie la follette was the very definition of an unknown quantity but it was only natural for the united states to try to take revenge kill our president will you well kill yours us wright fighters no doubt diverted from shooting up confederate positions near the rappahannock escorted the bombers and danced a dance of death with cs hound dogs level bombers two and fourengined rained explosives down on richmond with them though came a squadron of dive bombers airplanes not usually seen in attacks on cities to jakes admittedly biased way of thinking the csa had the best dive bomber in the world in the mule otherwise known on both sides of the front as the asskicker but its us counterparts were also up to the job they had to do that job here was to pound the crap out of the confederate presidential residence up on shockoe hill the building was often called the gray house after the us white house if the flak over richmond as a whole was heavy that over the gray house was heavier still half a dozen guns stood on the gray house grounds alone if an airplane was hit it seemed as if a pilot could walk on shell bursts all the way to the ground he couldnt of course but it seemed that way a dive bomber took a direct hit and exploded in midair adding a huge smear of flame and smoke to the already crowded sky another trailing fire from the engine cowling back toward the cockpit smashed into the ground a few blocks away from the mansion a greasy pillar of thick black smoke marked the pilots pyre another bomber was hit and another the rest bored in on their target back before the great war started in lots of confederates believed the yankees were not only enemies but cowardly enemies theyd learned better to their cost the pilots in these us machines were as brave and as skilled as the men the csa put in the air yet another dive bomber blew up this one only a few hundred feet above the gray house flaming wreckage fell all around and even on the presidential residence the survivors did what they were supposed to do one after another they released their bombs pulled out of their dives and scurried back towards usheld territory as fast as they could go no antiaircraft defenses could block that kind of attack the gray house flew to pieces like an anthill kicked by a giants boot some of the wreckage flew up not out the damnyankees must have loaded armorpiercing bombs into some of their bombers if jake featherston took refuge in the shelter under the museum they aimed to blow him to hell and gone anyway but jake wasnt in the gray house or in the shelter under it jake wasnt within a mile of the gray house in fact as soon as he heard al smith was dead jake had ordered the presidential residence evacuated hed done it quietly making a fuss about it would have tipped off the damnyankees that he wasnt where they wanted him to be at the moment he was holed up in a none too fancy hotel about a mile west of capitol square his bodyguards kept screaming at him to get his ass down to the basement but he wanted to watch the show it beat the hell out of fourth of july fireworks saul goldman didnt scream the cs director of communications was both more restrained and smarter than that he said mr president please take cover if a bomb falls on you here the united states win just the same as if youd stayed up on shockoe hill the country needs you stay safe jake eyed the pudgy grayhaired little jew with something that was for a moment not far from hatred he ran the confederate states ran them more nearly absolutely than any previous north american ruler had run his countryand that included all the goddamn useless maximilians in the empire of mexico nobody could tell him what to do nobody at all saul hadnt tried unlike the freedom party guards whod bellowed at him no saul had done far worse than that hed talked sense all right dammit featherston said peevishly and withdrew he affected not to hear the sighs of relief from everyone around him sitting down in the basement was as bad as hed known it would be he despised doing nothing he despised having to do nothing he wanted to be up there hitting back at his enemies or else hitting them first and hitting them so hard they couldnt hit back at him hed tried to do that to the united states the first blow hadnt quite knocked them out the next one he vowed the next one would catching his foul mood goldman said dont worry about it mr president when you go on the wireless and let the united states know youre still here that will hurt them worse than losing a big city again the director of communications made sense jake found himself nodding whether he wanted to or not well youre right he said they cant afford to come after me like that all the time they wont have any airplanes or pilots left if they do on account of well blow em all to hell and gone he pointed to goldman make sure theres a studio waiting for me just as soon as these yankee bastards let up saul ill see to it sir goldman promised he was as good as his word too he always was that by itself made him somebody to cherish most people did what they could and gave excuses for the rest saul goldman did what he said hed do so did jake himself people hadnt believed him hed taken more than sixteen years a lot of them lean and hungry to get to the top now that hed arrived he was doing just what hed told folks he would some people had the nerve to act surprised hadnt they been listening dammit an armored limousine took him to a studio nothing short of a direct hit by a bomb would make this baby blink jake had already survived two assassination attempts not counting this latest one from the usa except when his blood was up the way it had been during the air raid he didnt believe in taking unnecessary chances by now sitting down in front of a microphone was second nature to him hed been a jump ahead of the whigs and radical liberals in figuring out what wireless could do for a politician and he still used it better than anybody else in the csa or the usa having saul goldman on his side helped he knew that but he had himself on his side too and he was his own best advertisement in the room next door the engineer held up one fingerone minute till airtime jake waved back at the glass square set into the wall between the rooms to show hed got the message he always acknowledged the competence of people like engineers they did their jobs so he could do his he took one last look around there wasnt much to see except for that glass square the walls and ceiling of the studio were covered in what looked like cardboard egg cartons that helped deaden unwanted noise and echoes the engineer pointed to him the red light above the square of glass came on he leaned toward the microphone im jake featherston he said and im here to tell you the truth his voice was a harsh rasp it wasnt the usual broadcasters voice any more than his rawboned craggy face was conventionally handsome but it grabbed attention and it held attention and who could ask for more than that nobody not in the wireless business truth is im still here he went on after his trademark greeting the yankees dropped bombs on the gray house but im still here they threw away god only knows how many airplanes but im still here they wasted god only knows how much money but im still here they murdered god only knows how many innocent women and children but im still here theyve thrown god only knows how many soldiers at richmond but im still hereand theyre not theyve had god only knows how many fine young men who couldve gone on and done other things shot and gassed and blown to pieces but im still here theyve had god only knows how many barrels smashed to scrap metal but im still here theyve given guns to our niggers and taught em to rise up against the white man but im still here and let them try whatever else they want to try ive taken it all and ill take some more on account of imstillhere the red light went out behind the glass the engineer applauded jake grinned at him he didnt think hed ever seen that before he raised his hands over his head fingers interlaced like a victorious prizefighter the engineer applauded harder when jake came out of the studio saul goldman stood in the hall with eyes shining behind his glasses that that was outstanding mr president he said outstanding yeah i thought it went pretty well featherston said around most people he bragged and swaggered goldman by contrast could make him modest no one in the united states will have any doubts goldman said no one in the confederate states will either thats what its all about jake said i dont want anybody to have any doubts about what ive got in mind i aim to make the confederate states the grandest country on this continent i aim to do that and by god im going to do that even saul goldman whod heard it all before and heard it times uncounted nodded as if it were fresh and new aship of his own sam carsten had never dreamt of that not when he joined the navy in hed never dreamt of becoming an officer at all but he wore a lieutenants two broad gold stripes on each sleeve of his jacket the josephus daniels wasnt a battlewagon or an airplane carriernothing of the sort the us navy called her a destroyer escort in the royal navy she would have been a frigate she could do a little bit of everything escort convoys of merchantmen and hunt submersibles that menaced them lay mines if she had to though she wasnt specialized for that bombard a coast though that was asking for trouble if airplanes were anywhere close by and shoot torpedoes and her pair of fourinch popguns at enemy ships she was all his feet men commander cressy the remembrances executive officer had been surprised when he got hersurprised but pleased sams own exec was a lieutenant junior grade just over half his age a redheaded frecklefaced gogetter named pat cooley cooley was probably headed for big thingshe was almost bound to be if the war and its quick promotions lasted and if he lived of course carsten knew that he himself as a mustang had gone about as far as he could go he could hope for lieutenant commander he could he supposed dream of commanderas long as he remembered he was dreaming considering where hed started he had had a hell of a career cooley looked around with a smile on his face feels like spring doesnt it captain captain sam knew he couldnt even dream about getting a fourth stripe but he was by god captain of the josephus daniels always feels like spring in san diego he answered august november marchdoesnt make much difference yes sir the exec said another three weeks and well have the genuine article uhhuh sam nodded well think its summer by then i expect cruising off the coast of baja california got to let the damn greasers know they picked the wrong sideagain cooley said uhhuh sam repeated the empire of mexico and the confederate states had been bosom buddies ever since the second mexican war there was a certain irony in that since mexican royalty came from the same line as the austrohungarian emperors and austriahungary lined up with germany and the usa but confederate independence and confederate friendship with the first maximilian had kept the usa from invoking the monroe doctrinehad effectively shot the doctrine right between the eyes the emperors of mexico remembered that and forgot who their ancestors had been pat cooley was the one who took the josephus daniels out of san diego harbor sam knew damn near everything there was to know about gunnery and damage control his shiphandling skills were at the moment as near nonexistent as made no difference he intended to remedy that he was and always had been a conscientious man a plugger he went forward one step at a time and it wasnt always a big step either but he did go forward never back three other destroyer escorts and a light cruiser made up the flotilla that would pay a call on baja california sam could have wished they had some air support hell he did wish it hed heard that a swarm of light carriersconverted from merchantman hullswere abuilding he hoped like anything that was true true or not though the light carriers werent in action yet he smeared zincoxide ointment on his nose his cheeks and the backs of his hands freckled pat cooley didnt laugh at all sam was very blond and very fair even this early impression of san diego spring was plenty to make him burn he offered cooley the tinfoil tube no thank you sir the exec said ive got my own hed start to bake just about as fast as carsten did the long swells of the pacific swells all the way down from the gulf of alaska raised the destroyer escort and then lowered her she rolled a few degrees in the process here and there a sailor ran for the rail and gave back his breakfast sam smiled at that his hide was weak but he had a strong stomach he took the wheel when they were out on the open sea feeling the whole ship not just through the soles of his feet but also through his hands was quite something he frowned in concentration the tip of his tongue peeping out as he kept station zigzagging with his companions youre doing fine sir cooley said encouragingly ask you something go ahead sam watched the compass as he changed course ease it back just a littleyou dont want to overcorrect cooley said and then how bad are things over in the sandwich islands well they sure as hell arent good sam did ease it back with no carriers over there right now were in a bad way he remembered swimming from the mortally damaged remembrance to the destroyer that plucked him from the warm pacific remembered watching the airplane carrier on which hed served so long slide beneath the waves and remembered the tears streaming down his face when she did cooley frowned weve got plenty of our own airplanes on the main islands we should be able to make the japs sorry if they come poking their noses down there right as long as we can keep em in fuel and such sure carsten answered but the islandsoahu mostlyjust sit there and the japs carriers can go wherever they want theres a gap about halfway between here and the islands that we cant cover very well from the mainland or from honolulu if the japs start smashing up our supply convoys weve got big trouble because the sandwich islands get damn near everything from the west coast we ought to have airplanes with longer range the exec said yeah sam couldnt say the same thing hadnt occurred to him it had probably occurred to every navy man whod ever thought about the question only trouble is thats the one place where we need em the confederate states are right next door so the designers concentrated on guns and bomb load instead before the war i dont think anybody figured wed lose midway and give the japs a base that far east cooleys laugh was anything but amused surprise he cocked his head to one side and studied sam you think about this stuff dont you commander cressy had said almost the same thing in almost the same bemused tone of voice like cressywho was now a captaincooley came out of the naval academy finding a mustang with a working brain seemed to have perplexed both of them cooley had to be more careful about how he showed it sam outranked him shrugging sam said if you guess along youre less likely to get caught with your skivvies down oh you will some of the timeit comes with the territorybut youre less likely to the more you know the better off you are uhhuh cooley said it wasnt disagreement it was more on the order of well youre not what i thought you were going to be the first mexican town below the border had a name that translated as aunt jane in peacetime it was a popular liberty port the handful of mexican police didnt give a damn what american sailors didthis side of arson or gunplay anyhow if you couldnt come back to your ship with a hangover and a dose of the clap you werent half trying but it wasnt peacetime now the mexicans hadnt built a proper coastdefense battery to try to protect poor old aunt janes honor what point when overwhelming us firepower from across the border could smash up almost any prepared position the greasers had brought in a few threeinch pieces to tell the us navy to keep its distance some of them opened up on the flotilla sam called the josephus daniels to general quarters he laughed to himself as the klaxons hooted this was the first time he hadnt had to run like hell to take his battle station here he was on the bridge right where he belonged the mexicans fire fell at least half a mile short columns of water leaped into the air as shells splashed into the pacific sailors seeing their first action exclaimed at how big those columns were that made sam want to laugh again hed seen the great gouts of water near misses from fourteeninch shells kicked up next to those these might have been mice pissing beside elephants lets return fire mr cooley sam said aye aye sir the exec relayed the order to the gun turrets both fourinchersnothing even slightly fancy themselves not even secondary armament on a capital shipswung toward the shore they fired almost together at the recoil the josephus daniels heeled slightly to starboard she recovered almost at once the guns roared again and again shells began bursting around the places where muzzle flashes revealed the mexican guns the other members of the flotilla were firing too the bigger cannons on the ships could reach the shore even if the guns on shore couldnt touch the ships through binoculars sam could easily tell the difference between bursts from the fourinch guns on the destroyer escorts and the light cruisers sixinchers plucky if outranged the mexicans defiantly shot back i wouldnt do that cooley said it just tells us we havent knocked em out now morell come down on their heads theyre making a point i suppose sam peered through the binoculars again our gunnery needs work id say thats true for every ship here i cant do anything about the others but by god i can fix things on this one uh yes sir cooley looked at him plainly wondering whether he knew any more about that than he did about conning a ship sam grinned back son i was handling a fiveinch gun on the dakota about the time you were a gleam in your old mans eye oh the exec blushed between his freckles all right sir he grinned too teach me to keep my mouth shutand i hardly even opened it one of the bursts on shore was conspicuously bigger than the others had been there we go sam said some of their ammo just went up i dont know whether theyve got real dumps there or we hit a limber but we nailed em pretty good either way blew some gunners to hell and gone either way too cooley said thats the point of it carsten agreed they wont care if we rearrange the landscape after they bury jose and pedroif they can find enough of em left to burytheyll get the idea that we can hurt them worse than they can hurt us its about people pat its always about people uh yes sir pat cooley said again this time it wasnt doubt in his eyes as he looked sam over it was bemusement again sam laughed inside himself no the mustang isnt quite what you figured on eh kid the light cruisers skipper didnt choose to linger to continue the onesided gun duel the flotilla steamed south sam hoped the mexicans didnt have anything more up their sleeves than what theyd already shown for you the war is over the confederate officer who took major jonathan moss prisoner after his fighter got shot down over virginia had sounded like an actor mouthing a screenwriters lines in a bad film about the great war the only thing that had kept moss from telling him so was that the son of a bitch was likely right moss strolled near the barbedwire perimeter of a prisonerofwar camp outside the little town of andersonville georgia he didnt get too close to the barbed wire inside it was a second perimeter marked only by twofoothigh stakes with long flimsy bands supported on top of them the red dirt between the inner and outer perimeters was always rolled smooth so it would show footprints the goons in the guard towers outside the barbed wire would open up with machine guns without warning if anybody presumed to set foot on that dead ground without permission other officersfliers and ground pounders bothalso walked along the perimeter or through the camp the only other thing to do was stay in the barracks an even more depressing alternative the confederates had built them as cheaply and flimsily as the geneva convention allowed no doubt us accommodations for cs prisoners were every bit as shabby moss didnt care about that he wasnt in a us camp what he did care about was that when it rained herewhich it did all too oftenit rained almost as hard inside the barracks as it did outside clouds were rolling in out of the northwest which probably meant yet another storm was on the way moss looked down at his wrist to see what time it was then he muttered to himself hed been relieved of wristwatch and wallet shortly after his capture all things considered it could have been worse the food was lousygrits and boiled greens and what the guards called fatback a name that fit only too wellbut there was enough of it meals were the high points of the day considering how dreary they were that said nothing good about the rest of the time a captain came up to moss nick cantarella looked like what he was a tough italian kid out of new york city how ya doin he asked moss shrugged all things considered id rather be in philadelphia he wasnt above stealing a line from one of the more inspired film comics hed seen chuckling cantarella said yeah this place makes philly look good and thats sayin somethin he looked around the guard in the closest tower was watching the two of them but he couldnt hear a quiet conversation no prisoners were in earshot either it could happen one of these days could it moss said eagerly could i said cantarella left it at that and trudged away with his head down and the collar of his leather jacket turned up however much moss wanted to learn more he kept quiet trying to know too much and learn too fast only made people in the andersonville camp suspicious not all the inmates were prisoners so moss had been assured anyhow the united states and confederate states were branches off the same trunk theyd grown apart but not that far apart it wasnt impossible for a clever confederate to impersonate a us officer no one here was trusted with anything importantindeed with anything at alltill someone known to be reliable vouched for him till then he was presumed to be talking to the guards that had made it harder for moss to gain peoples confidence his squadron was fairly new in maryland and not many people fighting in the east knew him finally another pilot shot down over virginia proved to have flown with him in ohio and indiana and also proved to be known to a couple of pilots already in the andersonville camp once theyd assured their friends that joe was legit joe could do the same for moss so now he knew there were plans to stage an escape from the camp that was all he knew about them details would come sooner or later he had no idea whether hed be on the list of prisoners chosen to disappear he did think the breakout had a chance following geneva convention rules the confederates paid prisoners who were commissioned officers the same salary as they gave to men of equal grade in their own service escapees would have money then they spoke the local language even if their accent was odd if they could get outside the barbed wire get a little start for you the war is over moss could hope not anyhow he didnt know what the hope was worth in the meantime in the meantime the rain arrived about half an hour later it drove moss back into the barracks the red dirt outside rapidly turned to a substance resembling nothing so much as tomato soup inside rain dripped between the unpainted pine boards of the roof some of the leaks were over bunks makeshift cloth awnings channeled away the worst of them moss mattress and pillow were cheap cotton sacking stuffed with sawdust and wood shavings eight wooden slats across the bed frame supported the bedding the mattress was every bit as comfortable as moss had thought it would be when he first set eyes on it he might have had worse nights sleeping on the slats then again he might not have a poker game was going on in one corner of the barracks a poker game was always going on in one corner of the barracks the prisoners had little on which to spend the brown banknotesnot bills not down herethe confederates gave them they could buy cigarettes at what passed for the camp canteen they could pay guards a little extra to bring them something besides grits greens and fatback past that past that they could play poker and redistribute the wealth every once in a while moss sat in but only every once in a while the gods might have designed poker as a way to separate him from his money in a poker game you were either a shark or you were bait in the courtroom hed been a shark in the air hed been a sharktill a confederate took a bite out of his fighter at the poker table he was bait other captured officers came in out of the rain some of them sat down on their bunks some of them lay down two or three went to sleep some men seemed to go into hibernation here sleeping fourteen or sixteen or eighteen hours a day geneva convention rules said officers didnt have to work the sleepy ones took not working to an extreme moss didnt know whether to envy them or to give them a good swift kick in the ass to get their motors started as it happened he didnt have to boot them today confederate guards took care of that they burst into the barracks submachine guns at the ready everybody up they shouted out of the sack you lazy fuckers even the yelling didnt roust one pow he could have slept through the trump of doom but not through getting thrown out of bed onto the floor what the hell he said plaintively picking himself up no one paid any attention to him the guards didnt pay attention to any of the prisoners once they were out of the bunks they paid attention to the bunks themselves and to the number of slats that held each one up they were not topquality human material to put it mildlyif they had been they would have been up at the front some of them seemed to have trouble counting to eight good thing there arent eleven slats moss thought theyd have to take off their shoes how come this here ones only got seven one of them demanded because one of em damn well broke because you damn well used cheapshit wood when you made it answered the lieutenant whose bunk that was his accent was identical to cantarellas though he looked irish rather than italian he also had the new yorkers way of challenging anything he didnt like moss didnt give the guards a hard time it struck him as cruising for a bruising hed seen the guards rough people up that violated the geneva convention but you couldnt call them on it they would say the roughee had it coming and the camp commandant would back them right down the line here though the guards didnt push things they grumbled and they fumed and then tramped out of the barracks what the hell was that all about asked a captain whod been in andersonville only a few days beats me somebody else answeredan officer whod been a prisoner longer than moss had it beat moss too when he got the chance to ask nick cantarella he did cantarella started laughing ill bite whats funny moss asked the confederates know what theyre doing thats all cantarella answered he was still laughing and didnt care who heard him he thought it was funny as hell if were digging a tunnel those slats are about the best thing we could use to shore it up oh a light dawned and if theyre not missing then were not digging a tunnel i didnt say that cantarella was nothing if not coy you said that with a little luck the guards think that then we are digging a tunnel moss persisted i didnt say that either i didnt say anything its the waddayacallitthe fifth amendment thats it moss hadnt had much to do with the fifth amendment while practicing law in occupied ontario it hadnt crossed the border with the us army it wasnt as strong as it might have been in the usa either from the s until the great war the united states had geared up for a rematch against the confederacy nothing had got in the way of gearing upand thanks to a pliant supreme court that nothing included big chunks of the us constitution when he expressed his detailed opinion of the fifth amendment and of the horse it rode in on he just made cantarella laugh some more dammit you know im legit now moss groused the least you could do is tell me whats going on who says i know cantarella answered i just work here had he put a pot full of cold water on moss head it would have boiled in about thirty seconds moss face must have told him as much when he laughed again it was in some embarrassment dont ask for what i shouldnt give you buddy why shouldnt you moss went on steaming only reason i can see is that you still think i might not be the goods then you arent looking hard enough the new yorkers voice took on a hard edge i dont give a shit if youre as legitimate as teddy roosevelt the more people who know more stuff than they ought to the better chance featherstons fuckers have of tearing it out of them have you got that through your goddamn thick head now or shall i draw you a picture oh jonathan moss temperature abruptly lowered he didnt like security concerns but he understood them sorry captain i was out of line there dont worry about it like most people cantarella was more inclined to be magnanimous after hed got his way when the time comesif the time comesyoull find out whatever you need to know till then just relax let jake featherston pay your room and boardand your salary too he needs to learn something about the hotel business youre not supposed to have to lock up your customers to get em to stay moss said nick cantarella thought that was funny as hell moss would have too if hed been on the other side of the barbed wire for quite a while after rejoining the confederate army brigadier general clarence potter had worked underground in war department offices that officially didnt exist intelligence tended to get quartered in places like that for one thing it was supposed to be secret for another if you didnt have to look at spies you could use what they gave you and still pretend to yourself that your hands were clean when he got the wreath around his three stars that meant promotion to generals rank he also got his unfortunate predecessors upstairs office being able to look out at richmond instead of just walls was very nice that is it had been very nice till us bombers started coming over richmond in large numbers these days only the foolhardy and those who had no choice worked above ground in the heart of the city a lot of war department operations had moved to the suburbs those that couldnt had gone underground potters new office was only a few doors down from the one hed had as a colonel returning to the subbasement hed displaced a captain not the colonel who had the old room as long as the electricity kept working he could get the job done he stared at the papers on his desk through the bottoms of his bifocals he was an erect soldierlylooking man nearer sixty than fifty with irongray hair a stern expression and the same style of steelrimmed glasses hed worn as a major in intelligence in the army of northern virginia during the great war they hadnt been bifocals then the spectacles softened what would otherwise have been some of the coldest gray eyes anyone ever owned one of the reasons he glowered at those papers was that they should have got to him weeks before they did before the shooting started hed run confederate espionage operations in the usa two countries hardly separated by language made spying here easier in many ways than it was in europe some confederate operatives had been in place in washington and philadelphia and elsewhere since before the great war there were two problems with that shooting and moving armies and closed ordinary channels of mail and telegraphy made it harder for information to get across the borderwhich was why these papers were so late the other problem was what were the damnyankees doing in the csa ease of spying cut both ways worse luck formally counterintelligence was on brigadier general cummins football field not his he wasnt sorry about that or most of him wasnt even guzzling coffee as if theyd outlaw it day after tomorrow he did have to sleep every once in a while he didnt see how he could conjure up enough extra hours in the day to do a proper job if more responsibility landed on his head jake featherston and nathan bedford forrest iii the head of the confederate general staff thought he could handle it if he had to he had a hard time quarreling with either of them because they both had more in their laps than he did but he was a relentless perfectionist in ways they werent and couldnt let go of things till they were exactly as he wanted them he had enough insight to understand that that wasnt always a desirable character trait understanding it and being able to do anything about it were two different things someone knocked on the door down here the rule was that you didnt walk in till you were invited potter checked to make sure nothing sensitive was out in the open before he said come in thank you it was nathan bedford forrest iii potter started to come to attention forrest waved him back into his chair before the motion was well begun saying dont bother with that silly nonsense the greatgrandson of the cavalry raider in the war of secession had a fleshier face than his famous ancestor but his eyes hooded under strong dark brows proclaimed the relationship good morning sir or afternoon or whatever time of day it is out there potter said what can i do for you instead of answering right away forrest cocked his head to one side an odd sort of smile on his face i purely love to listen to you talk generalyou know that you may be the only person in the confederate states who does potter answered hed gone to college up at yale before the great war us speech patterns and accent had rubbed off on him not least because even then the yankees had made things hard for confederates in their midst hed wanted to fit in there and he hadand hed had a certain amount of trouble fitting into his own country ever since but i know how useful it is to be able to talk like that forrest said quite a few of the cs spies potter ran in the usa were confederates whod been raised or educated on the other side of the border sounding like a damnyankee helped a lot it made real yankees believe you were what you said you were and was often more convincing than the proper papers if you sounded right you might never have to show your papers with a sour chuckle potter said its almost got me shot for a spy here a few times well thats some of what i want to talk to you about nathan bedford forrest iii sank into the chair in front of potters desk he pulled a pack of cigarettes from the breast pocket of his butternut tunic stuck one in his mouth and offered potter the pack after potter took one forrest lit them both they smoked for a couple of drags apiece potter knocked ash into a brass astray on the desk he said if you think youve intrigued me youre right dammit the chief of the general staff grinned at him unabashed i hoped i might to tell you the truth im getting up a volunteer battalion im going to want you to help me vet are you a battalion of our people who can sound like damnyankees potter asked forrest nodded potter sucked in smoke till the coal at the end of his cigarette glowed a furious red after he let it out he aimed another question at his superior are you putting them in us uniforms too nathan bedford forrest iii didnt jump instead he froze into immobility he clicked his tongue between his teeth after fifteen seconds or so of silence well general he said at last you didnt get the job youve got on account of youre a damn fool if i didnt know that already you just rubbed my nose in it like im a puppy getting housetrained if theyre captured in enemy uniform the united states will shoot them for spies potter said we wont be able to say boo about it either under the laws of war theyll have the right i understand that everybody who goes forward with this will understand it too forrest answered you have my word on that general i already told you once this is a project for volunteers all right potter said but i did want to remind you as a matter of fact for something like that i was obliged to remind you so where exactly do i fit in youre the fellow whos been running people who can sound like damnyankees and act like damnyankees forrest stubbed out his smoke and reached for the pack to have another one when he offered it to potter this time potter shook his head the chief of the general staff lit up again he sucked in smoke then continued if they can be halfway convincing to you theyll be good enough to convince the enemy too its not just accent potter scratched his chin as he thought you can get away with flattening out the vowels some even swallowing rs might make the yankees think youre from boston or somewhere up therewhat even the yankees call a yankee but some things will kill you if the usa hears em coming out of your mouth banknote is one forrest said i know they say bill instead just about everybody knows that onejust about everybody thinks about money a good deal potter agreed nathan bedford forrest iii laughed though potter hadnt been kidding or not very much he went on they dont say tote up there eitherits carry and they mostly say bucket instead of pail though you might get by with that one you wont ever get away with windscreen they always say windshield they might think somebody who says windscreen is an englishman but that wont help anybody in a us uniform much either no not hardly forrest laughed once more a grim laugh what will you be using them for potter quickly held up his right hand no dont tell me let me figure it out he thought for a little while then noddedat least as much to himself as to his superior infiltrators they have to be infiltrators get them behind the lines giving false directions sabotaging vehicles putting explosives in ammunition dumps and theyll be worth a lot more than a battalion of ordinary men again forrest gave him a careful onceover before speaking when he did he said shall i put you in an operational slot potter if you want your own division its yours for the asking i think i can do the damnyankees more harm right where i am sir potter replied nathan bedford forrest iii didnt argue with him he thought a bit more do you know what the really elegant part of the scheme is as soon as the damnyankees realize weve got men behind their lines like that nobody in a greengray uniform will trust anybody he doesnt know and thatll last for the rest of the goddamn war forrest slowly nodded he looked like a man trying to show nothing on his face at a poker table did that mean he or whoeverd come up with the notion hadnt thought so far ahead potter would have bet it did he almost asked but checked himself that might have looked like showing off one other thing did occur to him though you know theyll do the same thing to us they just about have to if for no other reason than to make us as scared of our own shadows as they will be ill take that up with the president forrest said were the raiders in yankee uniform jake featherstons idea potter wouldnt have been surprised featherston had a genius for making trouble in nasty ways he also had the gifted amateurs problem of not seeing all the consequences of his troublemaking this long war for instance he really thought al smith would make peace potter muttered unhappily if only the yankees would have quit jake featherston would have gone down in history then no doubt about it things wouldnt be so easy now he asked forrest what do you think of charlie la follette well just have to see the chief of the general staff replied so far he sounds like smith but who knows what hell be like once he gets out from under the other fellows shadow how about you you probably know more about him than i do i doubt it who pays attention to the vice president potter said and forrest laughed again for all the world as if hed been joking he went on i think youve got it about right doesnt look like hes going to pack in the war no it sure doesnt too bad itd make our lives easier if he did thats for damn sure forrest saidone more thing potter thought he had about right theyd pulled armstrong grimes regiment or what was left of it out of the lines in utah for a while the corporal and his buddies had to march away the powers that be saved most of their trucks to haul men to and from fights they thought more important than the one against the mormon rebels marching out meant he and his fellow survivors tramped past the men coming up to take their places in provo telling who was who couldnt have been easier the new fish had fresh uniforms and carried very full packs on their backs they were cleanshaven they looked bright and eager armstrong and the rest of the veterans stank he couldnt remember when hed last bathed or changed his underwear he was as whiskery as any of the others his uniform had seen better days too he carried nothing he couldnt do without and his eyes went every which way at once they were the eyes of a man who never knew which way trouble was coming from only that it was coming most of the soldiers pulling out had eyes like that the rest just stared straight ahead as they trudged along the thousandyard stare belonged to men whod seen and done too much maybe rest would turn them back into soldiers again maybe nothing would the way war was these days it had no trouble overwhelming a man some of the veterans jeered at the rookies arent you pretty arent you sweet do your mothers know youre here where do you want your body sent the men going into the line didnt say much in return they eyed the troops they were replacing like people in a zoo eyeing tigers and wolves but no bars stood between them and the veterans they plainly feared theyd get bitten if they teased the animals they were right too got a cigarette sarge grimes asked he was a big manhed been a secondstring lineman on his highschool football team what seemed a million years ago and was actually just over one under the whiskers his face was long and oval like his mothers but he had his old mans dark hair and eyes here you go rex stowe pulled one out of a pack thanks armstrong lit up and sucked in smoke he was named for george armstrong custer his father had been born in the same little ohio town as the hero of the second mexican war and the great war armstrong was born in washington dc where merle grimes settled down and married after a war wound from which he still limped hed had a comfortable postwar career as a minor government functionary he and the rest of the family probably werent comfortable now washington was too close to the border with the csa to be safe though as far as armstrong knew his father and mother and younger sister were well a middleaged woman and a couple of little kids stood in the rubble by the side of the track and watched the us soldiers go by silent hatred burned in their eyes of itself armstrongs springfield swung a couple of inches toward them plenty of mormon women fought alongside their husbands and brothers and sons plenty of kids threw homemade grenades and firebombsfeatherston fizzes people called them you never could tell even with people behind the lines they dont like it that youre smoking stowe said no mere cigarette could have made them look like that they wished him straight to hell if theyd had weapons they would have done their best to send him there every civilian he saw looked at him like that he knew there were people in utah who werent mormons the mormon majority called anybody who wasnt one of them a gentile even jews were gentiles here one of armstrongs buddies was a new york city guy named yossel reisen he thought that was funny as the devil but a lot of the socalled gentiles had joined their mormon neighbors in rising up against the usa armstrong had trouble figuring that out what had the us government ever done to them had they hated the way utah was treated so much that they wanted to leave the usa werent they a little crazy or more than a little if they had yeah the rebels were brave no doubt about it but bravery had only so much to do with anything when it ran up against superior firepower the rebels were taking a while to lose because the united states had other things to worry about and werent giving them anything like their full attention but the mormons and their pals had to be chewing locoweed if they thought they had a chinamans chance of bailing out of the usa rex stowe said the way things are around here i dont even know if i want to come out of the line arent they likelier to jump us when our guard is down than when were looking for it who says our guards going to be down i dont know about you but im still watching all the goddamn time armstrong answered stowe considered shrugged and nodded youve got something there on they slogged past buildings pulverized in the slow brutal us advance armstrong wondered if thered be enough mormons left alive to keep their faith going after this rebellion finally got smashed there had been the last time around which struck him as a damn shame he marched for a solid day to get back to the recuperation center that had sprung up in thistle southeast of provo that put it out of range of mormon gunsunless the rebels got sneaky which they might well do barbed wire and machinegun nests around the center made the place seem like a prisonerofwar camp but the guns faced out not in once inside the perimeter armstrong followed signs to a bank of showers and then to a delousing station the showers were cold his father had talked about hot water as part of the delousing process but times had changed they sprayed him with something that smelled like poison gas instead of boiling him or soaking him or whatever theyd done in his old mans day what is this shit he asked the guy doing the spraying its like flit only more so it really kills bugs the other soldier answered and sprayed the naked man in line behind him they didnt bother trying to get his uniform clean that would have defeated jobs patience they issued him fresh clothes instead from long johns on out he felt like a new man the new man got a feed of bacon and real eggs and hash browns and toast and jam most of what hed eaten lately had come out of cans or cartons this felt like heaven especially since he could pile as much as he wanted on his mess tray after about three breakfasts worth he said thats a little better rex stowe had eaten at least as much yeah a little he agreed i expect ill be able to handle lunch though oh fuck yes armstrong took that for granted yossel reisen sat on armstrongs other side hed also put away a hell of a lot though he skipped the bacon he often swapped ration cans too so he wouldnt have to eat pork he gulped down a big white china mug full of coffee pale with fresh cream damn good he saidhe was at least as foulmouthed as anybody else ask you something armstrong said to him and waited for him to nod you already did your conscript time right and then they sucked you back in yeah thats true you know it is yossel answered so what so how come im a corporal when ive been in less than a year and you just made pfc armstrong asked they shouldve given you two stripes the minute you came back and you ought to be at least a sergeant by now reisen shrugged you know who my aunt is it wasnt a question well sure armstrong said everybody knew yossels aunt had been married to the president and was a congresswoman herself you dont make a big deal out of it the way a lot of guys would but that ought to get you promoted faster right not slower i dont want it to yossel reisen spoke with quiet emphasis i dont want anybody giving me anything on account of aunt flora i just want to be a regular guy and get what regular guys get i know damn well i earned the stripe ive got if somebody handed it to me what would it be worth armstrong was chewing a big mouthful of bacon so he couldnt answer right away if he were related to somebody famous he would have milked it for all it was worth a cushy job counting brass buttons five hundred miles away from guns going off sounded great to him yossel went on when my uncle david got conscripted in the last war my aunt was already in congress she could have pulled strings for him he wouldnt let her he lost a leg hes proud of what he did he wouldnt have it any different hes out of his fucking mind armstrong thought and yet his own father was unmistakably proud of his war wound too no doubt hed screamed his head off when he got it just like anybody else when a bullet bit him memory did strange things no doubt about it have it your way armstrong said when at last he swallowed you pull your weight anybody tells you anything else kick his ass for him thanks reisen said you too armstrong followed the bacon with a swig of coffee till he got in the army hed always been halfassed about things doing enough to get by and not another nickels worth you couldnt do that once you put on the uniform though it might get you killed even if it didnt it would make your buddies hate you if you let your buddies down theyd let you down tooand that would get you killed having somebody he cared about tell him he was all right felt damn good after they ate they went over to a barracks hall it was cheap plywood and probably better suited to prisoners on the us side armstrong wasnt inclined to be critical he threw his few chattels into a footlocker at the end of a real cot with a real mattress and real bedding then he took off his shoes and threw himself down on the mattress oh jesus christ he said ecstatically a real bed the first real bed since hed tried to remember not so long before he tried again harder he still couldnt nobody told him he had to get out of it he was full he was clean in a clean uniform nobody was shooting at him or even near him he allowed himself the luxury of taking off his shoes then blissfully he fell asleep as far as he could tell he hadnt changed position when reveille sounded the next morning he yawned and stretched he was still tired but he wasnt weary unto death anymore he was also starvedhed slept through the lunch that had sounded so inviting and dinner too damn near slept the clock around by the way the rest of the men in the hall rose theyd done nothing much in the nighttime either some of them had had the energy to strip to their shorts and get under the covers instead of lying on top of them maybe tonight armstrong told himself he made an enormous pig of himself again at breakfast then he went back to the barracks and flopped down again he didnt fall asleep right away this time he just lay there marveling he didnt have to go anywhere he didnt have to do anything he didnt have to have eyes in the back of his headthough having them doubtless was still a good thing he could just ease back and relax he wondered if he still remembered how he aimed to find out for as long as he had in this wonderful place jefferson pinkard hadnt been in texas since he headed home to birmingham after the great war ended hed fought north of where he was now but the country around snyder wasnt a whole lot different from what hed known half a lifetime earlier plains cut by washes with low rises here and there the sky went on forever and the landscape seemed to do the same bulldozers were kicking dust up into that endless sky right now along with their diesel snorting the sounds of saws and hammers filled the air camp determination would seem to go on forever when it got finished too jeff had run camp dependable near alexandria louisiana for years once determination got done youd be able to drop dependable into it and not even know the older camp was there the barbedwire perimeter stretched and stretched and stretched a lot of people would go through camp determination it had to be able to hold them all and pinkard had to make sure nobody got out who wasnt supposed to guard towers outside the walls had gone up before the barracks inside machine guns were already in place inside the towers anybody who tried to escape would be real sorry real fastbut probably not for long stalking along outside the perimeter jeff looked up at each tower he passed hed climbed up into all of them checking their fields of fire if you wanted something like that done righthell if you wanted anything done rightyou were better off doing it yourself his black shiny boots scuffed still more dust into the air he wore three stars on each collar tab the equivalent of a colonels rank but he was called standard leader not colonel he had a freedom party rank not one from the army his uniform was of the same cut as a colonels but gray rather than butternut tunic and trousers both had some extra room for his belly he still carried muscle under the fat though hed been a steelworker till he got conscripted and for a while after the war and no weakling ever went into the sloss works if he scowled more often than he smiled that was true of most people who bossed other people around after he got done prowling the perimeter he went inside the camp he carried a submachine gun with a full magazine when he did so did all the whites who went inside he had another man with him too the rule was that no white man went in alone hed made the rule he lived up to it the constructiongang bosses were white negroes did most of the actual work building the barracks where they would later live for a while if they did a lousy job they had only themselves to blame pinkard checked with the straw bosses he could tell by looking that things were pretty close to being on schedule the bosses blamed the rain that had come through a few days earlier for what delays there were make it up jeff told them well open on time or ill know the reason why and if we dont i wont be the only one whos sorry have you got that he was bigger than most of the gang bosses and he had a loud rasping voice and everybody knew he was in good odor in richmond people might grumble about him behind his back but nobody had the nerve to get mouthy to his face there was also another reason for that jeff pinkard didnt just talk to the constructiongang bosses he poked his nose in everywhere as had been his habit ever since he started taking care of prisoners during the civil war between the emperor of mexico and the usbacked republican rebels after the great war ended he went up to a colored man nailing boards to the side of a barracks unit you got everything you need to do your job he demanded yes suh sure do the negro answered got me a hammer an plenty o nails he looked pinkard in the eye you give me a rifle an plenty o bullets i do a job on you i bet you would pinkard said but you tried that and they caught you most of the laborers were men taken in rebellion against the csa if you try and you lose this is what you get i aint got my population reduced yet the black man said and went back nailing up boards population reduction and its variants had been confederate slang for a little while now ill reduce your population you bastard an angry man might shout when he meant no more than ill fix you used that way the phrase wasnt so heavily freighted with meaning but like a lot of slang it sprang from something that was literally true more negroes many more were going into camps all over the csa than were coming outcoming out alive anyhow jeff pinkard eyed the colored man with the hammer in his hand how did he mean what hed just said was it only slang in his mouth or had he seen enough to understand exactly where the slang came from jeff wondered but he didnt ask as long as it was possible for negroes to stay optimistic they made more docile more cooperative prisoners men who were sure they were doomed anyhow had nothing to lose they caused trouble no matter what it cost them better to keep them as happy as you could that wasnt real happy several negroes asked jeff if they could have bigger rations he just shook his head and kept walking they didnt complain too much the grits and occasional beans or biscuits they got didnt quite amount to a starvation diet the ration was just small enough to remind people it should have been larger the workers had no shortage of building supplies ferdinand koenig the cs attorney general had promised pinkard a railroad spur would run to camp determination and hed kept his word everything jeff needed came right to his front door as soon as the camp was finished trainloads of prisoners would come right to his front door too it wouldnt be very long more colored prisoners were paving the road that led into camp determination and the big parking area at the end of it along with the railroad spur thered be plenty of truck traffic going in and out of the camp jeff smiled to himself that had been his idea back at camp dependable but there he hadnt had the room to do things right here he did and if anybody came up with something better than trucks hed have room for that too whatever it turned out to be nobodyd improved on trucks yet but you never could tell what someone might think up you make sure you get that concrete nice and smooth jeff barked to a negro working on the lot oh yes suh i do dat you dont gots to worry none everything be fustrate we takes care of it as any negro would when a white boss bore down on him this one was quick and ready to promise the moon whether hed deliver was liable to be a different question pinkard didnt care so much about the barracks halls but the parking lot and the roadthey really counted the trucks were important and expensive they had to be well taken care of ill have my eye on you pinkard growled you think im kidding youll be sorry yes suh the negro didnt get up from his hands and knees he probably wanted to show jeff how diligent he was dont you fret none as things advanced here more barbed wire with gates in it would separate the road and the lot from the rest of the camp he had everything planned the blueprints for camp determination had come out of richmond but he had permission from ferd koenig to modify them as he thought best this was going to be his camp and by god it would work the way he wanted it to guards saluted as he and his silent guntoting companion left the perimeter hed need more manpower when the camp got going but he didnt expect that to be a problem the confederate veterans brigades had a guardtraining center not far outside of fort worth the way jeff saw things the men who came out of it would probably do better than the cops and tough guys who made up most of the guard force now theyd really know what they were supposed to do he had his own office by the growing camp telephone and telegraph lines connected it to the outside world that was more so richmond could send him instructions than so he could reach other places but the powers that be back in the capital didnt mind if he did when he walked up to the telegrapher the young man didnt quite sit at attention but he came close jeff said billy ray i want you to send a wire to edith blades in alexandria louisiana youve got the address right yes sir standard leader billy ray said if he didnt have the address of his bosss fiancee handy hed be in trouble he grabbed a message pad and poised a pencil over it go ahead sir right jeff paused a moment to work out what he wanted to say before he said it he always felt like a damn fool when he had to mumble and stumble and backtrack here we go dear edith all well here progress on schedule will be back to visit in about two weeks expect things to start up in less than two months miss you and the boys see you all soon love jeff he tried to keep things short even if he wasnt paying for the wire out of his own pocket let me read that back for you sir billy ray did he had it right the boys had surprised him the first time he heard it he hadnt known edith was a widow now he took them for granted send it off jeff told him the telegraph key started clicking jeff went into his inner office hed been careful about more than keeping things short suppose the damnyankees got their hands on this wire he hadnt given his last name or his rank he hadnt said anything specifically about the camp either anybody who didnt already know what he was talking about wouldnt be able to make much sense of it he sounded like a drummer or an efficiency expert not a camp commandant i damn well am an efficiency expert he thought a lot of the changes hed made to the blueprints involved smoothing things out clearing up bottlenecks avoiding trouble wherever he could the parking area was bigger than it had been in the original drawings and the road leading to and from it better laid out a lot of trucks would go in and out of camp determination a hell of a lot of negroes would come in and go out he knew where the road out of camp led at the end of it there was another barbedwire enclosure that one kept people out not in texas had a hell of a lot of prairie if you put some dozer crews on the job they could dig a lot of trenches without drawing much notice fill those trenches full of bodies bulldoze the dirt back over them and dig some new ones jeff nodded to himself the negroes who got into trucks would think they were on their way to some other camp so would the ones who stayed behind they wouldnt know the exhaust fumes were routed into the airtight passenger box not till too late they wouldnt camp determination was big the burial ground was even bigger the freedom party waswas determined by god to solve the negro problem in the csa once and for all it would take a lot of work but jeff figured they could do it ii brigadier general irving morrell wished to god he could get out of the hospital his shattered shoulder was improving but there was an unfortunate difference between improving and improved morrell a rawboned weathered man of fifty had found out all about that when he was wounded in the great war an infection after he got shot in the leg had kept him on the shelf for months and kept the doctors darkly muttering about amputation in the end they didnt have to go in there with a hacksaw for which hed never stopped being grateful no wound infection this time or none to speak of they had drugs now they hadnt dreamt of a generation earlier but he still needed to heal and that took time however much he wished it didnt he could use his right hand again though he feared the arm would never regain all its strength and dexterity when can i go back to work doc he asked the army physician who was tending his wound he might have been a roofer whod taken a fallmost wounds in war werent that different from industrial accidents mostbut not his the sniper whod wounded him hadnt been aiming at anybody else two more bullets had cracked past him as the gunner on the barrel he commanded hustled him out of harms way like any army doctor conrad rohde held officers rank so he could tell enlisted men what to do he had a majors gold oak leaves on the greengray tunic he wore under his white hospital coat he was big and blond and slowmovingslowtalking too after his usual careful consideration he answered well sir it shouldnt be too long now gee thanks a lot thanks a hell of a lot morrell said rohded been telling him the same thing for a while now before that hed said a few weeks for a few weeks im sorry i cant be more exact as usual the sawbones sounded not the least bit sorry you arent ready yet not unless you dont intend to do anything more strenuous than stay behind the linefar behind the lineand move pins on a map since morrell intended no such thing he swore under his breath a barrel commander who didnt lead from the front wasnt worth much so he told himself anyhow it was true enough the other half of the truth was that hed always been a man who liked to mix it up with the enemy rohde knew what that muttering meant he didnt even smirk and look superior he had a deadpan that probably won him money in poker games he did say you see the arms not too bad morrell insisted honest to god its not dr rohde didnt come right out and tell him he was a liar he thought for a moment then said youre in a barrel it gets hit it starts to burn you have to bail outright now can you open a hatch with that arm morrell thought about it he raised the injured member it hurt that didnt bother him so much hed learned to live with pain what bothered him was how weak the arm was savagely he said i wish i were lefthanded i cant do anything about that you should have talked to god or to your parents rohde was maddeningly unhelpful since you arent lefthanded do i take it youve answered my question yes dammit morrell couldnt have been more disgusted he was even willing to make what was for him not far from the ultimate sacrifice if they need me on light duty behind the lines for a while ill do that anything to get out of here rohde looked at him you dont like it in beautiful romantic syracuse now that you mention it no and if i turn you loose how do i know you wont head straight for the front thats the reputation youve got the reputation was well deserved morrell knew as much he said i could sign a pledge but you probably wouldnt believe me or you could take your chances and let me take mine im a big boy doc i can take my own chances if i think i ought to and if i think the country needs me part of my job general is to see that you dont endanger yourself without good reason dr rohde replied and do you really think youre as indispensable to the united states as all that as a matter of fact yes morrell said go call philadelphia and find out what the war department thinks they wouldnt have given me stars if they didnt think i was good for something call them if they say i can sit on the shelf a while longer ill sit ill even stop bitching about it but if they say they need me he was rolling the dice not everybody in the war department loved him he also had a reputation for being right in spite of people highranking officers were supposed to be right they werent supposed to rub their superiors noses in it as morrell had done but if even the confederates thought him worth killing his own side ought to be able to figure out he was worth a little something that was how hed got promoted to generals rank ill take you up on thatsir dr rohde lumbered out of the room he didnt say anything to morrell about the war department for the next several days with some men that would have made morrell suspect he hadnt got on the horn to philadelphia at all the barrel officer didnt believe that of rohde the doctor struck him as honest if stuck in a rut and the war department never had been wasnt and probably never would be an outfit that could make up its mind in a hurrywhich was part of the reason the united states were in the current mess ill give him a week then ill ask him morrell thought nobody could get huffy about his asking after a week and if rohde hadnt made the call or if the war department was still twiddling its thumbs well at least he would know what was what come the day he got ready to beard rohde but the doctor forestalled him wearing an uncommonly sour expression the big blond man said pack your bagssir philadelphia is dying to have you and i dont suppose youll die if you go there thanks doc morrell grinned as if hed just stuck in his thumb and pulled out a plum uhwhat bags all i came here with was the uniform i got shot in and thats never going to be the same a point dr rohde said nothing to flabble about though im sure we can fix you up this sort of thing happens now and again the hospital proved to have a good selection of uniforms for both officers and enlisted men some of them bore signs of being repaired others seemed as fresh as the day they were made morrell didnt care to think about how theyd been obtained or about what had happened to the men whod formerly worn them he chose an officers tunic and trousers that fit well enough and pinned his stars on his shoulder straps and the purple heart with oakleaf cluster above his left breast pocket he got his own shoes back the hospital had cleaned off whatever blood hed got on them and polished them to a higher gloss than he usually achieved himself getting dressed was tougher and more painful than hed thought it would be it left him feeling worn as a kitten and without the kittens sharp claws and teeth he did his best not to show dr rohde weakness the doctor didnt say a word but morrell doubted he was fooling him a driver took him to the train station in an ordinary auto hed wondered if rohde would stick him in an ambulance and gain a measure of revenge for getting overruled by philadelphia maybe the doctor was too nice a man to do something like that on the other hand maybe it just hadnt occurred to him coming down from upstate new york brought morrell back to the war a little at a time it hadnt touched syracuse the farther east and south the train went the more bomb damage he saw before long the train started sitting on sidings or just on the tracks when it should have been moving he wondered whether that was bomb damage or sabotage whatever it was it slowed him to a crawl a sergeant waited for him on the platform when he finally pulled into philadelphia in the middle of the night the man wasnt standing there in plain sight he dozed on a bench near the far wall morrell shook him awake horror spread over the noncoms face when he saw a general looming over him im sorry sir he cried and sprang to his feet its all right dont blow a gasket morrell returned a rather frantic salute you werent on sentry duty nobodys going to shoot you for sacking out how late was i anyway before answering the sergeant looked at his watch uhjust over three and a half hours sir thats about what i thought morrell said are things always that bad around here well the sergeant didnt want to admit it theyre not what youd call real good whether he wanted to admit it or not he didnt seem to have much choice reality spoke for itself take me to the war department morrell said yes sir the sergeant did the short journey was slow and roundabout philadelphia had a battered look months of bombing hadnt knocked it out of action though traffic still moved even if it had to detour around craters in the street repairmen swarmed over damaged buildings even if the next raid might hit them again men and women filled the sidewalks and the shops philadelphia ran around the clock they didnt seem beaten or intimidated just determined to get on with the job no matter what antiaircraft guns were everywhere their snouts poking up from vacant lots and street corners and roofs searchlight batteries would do what they could to find the guns targets signs pointed the way to airraid shelters the war department was one of the buildings under repair that didnt surprise morrell it was a big target and the confederates knew where it was even bombing by night they were bound to score some hits here we go sir the sergeant jumped out of the auto and held the heavy bronze doors that led inside for morrell the barrel officer was gladder of that than he cared to admit he wasnt sure he could have opened them with his right hand though his left would have done the job even in the war department brigadier generals were uncommon birds morrell got whisked to the offices of the assistant to the chief of the general staff a much more senior onestar general named edward mccleave how are you feeling mccleave asked sir ill do morrell answered thats why i wanted to get out of the damn hospital i wasnt doing anybody any good there except yourself mccleave pointed out morrell shrugged it didnt hurttoo much sitting on the shelf was worse than getting shot can you send me to virginia sir if were going to make a real run at richmond i want to be part of it your attitude does you credit the older man said although general macarthur has forced a crossing of the rappahannock he does not anticipate an immediate armored assault on the confederates the terrain is not conducive to such movements youre telling me hes stuck morrell said thats not what i said brigadier general mccleave sounded prim its what you meant though morrell said and mccleave didnt deny it morrell went on do you want me to take over the barrels down there and see what i can shake loose macarthur has not requested your presence mccleave said if however the war department were to order you to the virginia front he waited morrell nodded the two men exchanged smiles that were downright conspiratorial and so much for staying behind the lines morrell thought lieutenantcolonel tom colleton knew his regiment helped hold an important position his soldiers defended confederate positions east of sandusky ohio on the southern shore of lake erie as long as the confederate states held a corridor from the ohio river to the lake they cut the united states in half the damnyankees couldnt ship anything or anybody by rail or road from east to west or west to east within their own territory they had to take the long way around through occupied canadaand canada didnt have nearly so many lines or roads as the usa did no matter how true that was though tom colleton wasnt happy he didnt like standing on the defensive hed reveled in the push north from the border that was what war was supposed to be about hed fought in virginia the last time and hated stalemates with the grim and bitter passion of a man whod seen too many of them barrels meant soldiers didnt have to huddle in trenches this time around they didnt have to nobut too often they did anyway fortunately the yankees were as preoccupied with virginia these days as the confederates had been with ohio and indiana at the start of the war even more fortunately us forces werent doing as well in virginia as the confederates had here farther west in sandusky tom couldnt help hearing both cs and us wireless reports when both sides told the same story it was probably true when they diverged he had to try to figure out who was lying and who wasnt no matter what his sister had thought about jake featherston tom had no great love or admiration for him his mouth tightened anne had died in the opening days of the war if she hadnt been down in charleston when that damnyankee carrier raid hit the town but she had and nobody could do anything about it now his own wife and boys were safe in st matthews not far from columbia the capital of south carolina the last of the colletons he thought hed never felt that way while anne was alive even though shed been childless shed bossed the family ever since their parents died now everything rode on his shoulders he laughed as he looked east toward the damnyankees lines the colletons were a family with a fine future behind them before the great war marshlands was one of the leading plantations in south carolina with hundreds of colored hands working in the cotton fields the mansion went up in flames in the negro uprising in and not even anne could make a go of cotton after the war up ahead the yankees and some of toms men started banging away at one another telling which side was which by ear was easy the us soldiers used boltaction springfields rifles much like the tredegars cs troops had carried in the last war in this fight soldiers in butternut had either automatic rifles or submachine guns the damnyankees were always going to outnumber them so each confederate soldier needed to have more firepower than his us counterpart the only trouble was rifles and submachine guns werent the sole weapons involved us and cs machine guns were as near identical as made no difference so were the two sides artillery barrels and aircraft add all that in and what had been a goodsized edge for the confederate foot soldier shrank considerably sure as hell machine guns from both sides joined the conversation within a couple of minutes mortar rounds didnt make much noise leaving their tubessoldiers on both sides called them stove pipesbut the harsh flat crump of the bursting bombs was unmistakable colleton shouted for his wireless man when the small soldier with the large pack on his back came up tom said what the hells going on there this was a pretty quiet sector up until a few minutes ago get me one of the forward company command posts yes sir the wireless man did his job without fuss or feathers heres captain dinwiddie sira company first battalion dinwiddie tom called into the mouthpiece who went and pulled on the damnyankees tails other way round sir the captain answered yankee sniper potted lieutenant jenks hes not dead but hes hurt pretty bad some of our boys spotted the muzzle flash up in a tree they started shooting at him and some of those greengray fuckers shot back and now its hells half acre up here you want artillery you want gas tom asked he hated gas as every great war veteran did which didnt mean he wouldnt use it in a redhot minute god only knew the damnyankees werent shy about throwing it around not right now sir dinwiddie said theyre just shooting theres no real attack coming in if we stir em up though lord only knows what they might try all right colleton wasnt particularly sorry about the response his job now was to keep the usa out of sandusky no matter what if that meant not stirring up the enemy he didnt mind he didnt much feel like getting stirred up himself it was a cold miserable day and he would sooner have stayed inside by a nice hot fire the firefight lasted about half an hour well before then confederate medics with red cross armbands and red crosses on their helmets went up to the front to bring back the wounded a couple of medics came back on stretchers themselves tom swore but without particular fury hed never yet seen the yankees make a habit of picking off medics any more than the confederates did but neither machinegun bursts nor mortar bombs were fussy about whom they maimed after the shooting eased a us captain came across the line under flag of truce an officer at the front sent him back to tom the yankee gave him a stiff little nod id like to ask you for a twohour truce lieutenantcolonel so the corpsmen on both sides can bring in the dead and wounded do you think theyll need that long tom asked been a lot of shooting going on up there the us captain answered he had a flat harsh midwestern accent far removed from colletons south carolina drawl they spoke the same languagethey had no trouble understanding each otherbut they plainly werent from the same country tom considered then nodded all right captain two hours commencing athe looked at his watchat that gives you half an hour to get back to your own line and pass the word that weve agreed suit you all right down to the ground two hours starting at thank you lieutenantcolonel youre a gentleman the captain stuck out his hand tom hesitated but shook it the man was an enemy but he was playing by the ruleswas in fact making a point of playing by the rules as the us officer left tom had his wireless man tell the forward positions that the truce was coming he sent runners up to the front too to make sure no platoon with a busted wireless set failed to get the word once the truce started his men would probably swap cigarettes with the damnyankees for some of the ration cans the us army issued tom didnt intend to issue an order forbidding it less than no point in issuing an order bound to be ignored like everybody on both sides of the front he knew the usa made horseshit cigarettes but had rations better than their cs counterparts it wont make a dimes worth of difference who wins the war he consoled himself that same sort of illicit trading had gone on in the great war and in the war of secession too then it was tobacco for coffee that wasnt a problem these days not with the caribbean a confederate lake at the guns on both sides fell silent the sudden quiet made tom jumpy he didnt feel he could trust it but the truce held confederate medics brought back more bodies and pieces of bodies than wounded men though they did save a couple of soldiers who might have died if theyd been stuck where they were graves registrationusually called the ghoulstook charge of the remains colleton was damned if he knew how they would figure out just whose leg came back in a stretcher especially since it had no foot attached that thank god wasnt his worry sure as hell he saw men in butternut chowing down on cornedbeef hash and creamed beef and something tomatoey called goulash all from cans labeled with the us eagle in front of crossed swords the only thing he wished was that he had some of those cans for himself at both sides started shouting warnings to their opposite numbers at firing picked up again neither side shot as ferociously as it had earlier in the morning though tom thought the gunfire was as much an announcement that the truce was over as anything else that didnt turn out to be quite right at about the yankees started shelling his frontnot just with the mortars theyd been using before but with real artillery too shouts of gas rang out through the chilly air dismayed wireless calls came in from the front and from his reserves the us guns seemed to know just where to hit tom started swearing horribly enough to startle his wireless man who asked whats the matter sir ill tell you whats the matter goddammit colleton ground out furious at himself im an idiot thats what that yankee son of a bitch who came back here to dicker the truceto hell with me if the bastard didnt spy out our dispositions on the way here and back nothing in the rules against it of course but fuck me if i like getting played for a sucker us forces followed the bombardment with an infantry push and drove toms regiment from several of the positions it had been holding he got on the field telephone with division hq in sandusky warning them what had happened and how sneaky bastards was the comment he got from the major to whom he talked how much ground have they gained looks like about a mile tom said ruefully hed be kicking himself for weeks over this one he hadnt thought he was a trusting soul but that yankee captain had sure made a monkey out of him the major back in sandusky didnt seem all that upset dont get your balls in an uproar lieutenantcolonel he said well see what we can do about it later that afternoon eight or ten butternutpainted barrels came rumbling up the road and across the fields to either side of it confederate foot soldiers loped along with them the armored fighting vehicles started shelling the ground the us forces had gained just seeing and hearing them was enough to make soldiers whod been huddling in foxholes ready to get out and fight some more the confederates still sometimes called their battle cry the rebel yell though theyd been their own country not rebels at all for eighty years the shrill ululation resounded now way up here in yankeeland the surge that had gone west reversed course once more but nothing came cheap today the yankees had brought a couple of antibarrel cannons to the front the sound of an armorpiercing round smashing into steel plate reminded tom of an accident in a smithy the stricken barrel burst into flames a couple of men managed to get out the other three didnt the blazing barrel sent up a plume of greasy black smoke some of what burned in there had been alive moments before colleton cursed softly see if i give those sons of bitches another truce he muttered just see if i do ever mary pomeroy always liked driving out from rosenfeld and visiting the farm where shed grown up her mother was all alone on the manitoba prairie these days maude mcgregor still had her health but she wasnt getting any younger mary felt good checking up on her every so often the visits did remind her how much time had passed by marys mother had had hair as red as her own no more it was almost all gray now as mary neared thirtyfive the first silver threads were running through her copper too she and her mother sat in the kitchen drinking coffee and eating sweet rolls her mother had baked oh ma mary said the smells in here take me back to when i was a little girl the oilcloth on the table the coal fire the kerosene lamps all the cooking she shook her head lost in a world that would never come back again a world where her father and older brother were alive a world where the yanks hadnt occupied canada for a generation it does smell different in your apartment her mother agreed quickly she added not badnot bad at allbut not the same either no not the same mary said she had a gas stove and electricity the one didnt smell like coal while the other didnt smell like anything and what she cooked just wasnt the same as what her mother made she couldnt put her finger on the difference but she knew it was there how are the frenchies maude mcgregor asked theyre there mary made a sour face these days the united states needed all the soldiers they could scrape up to fight the confederate states the men now occupying rosenfeld and a lot of other canadian towns came from the republic of quebec they wore bluegray uniforms not us greengray mary couldnt stand them they should have been canadians too but instead they helped the yanks oppress their countrymen most of themalmost all of the young ones whod grown up in the socalled republicspoke nothing but french and jibberjabbered in it all the time as far as she was concerned that added insult to injury any trouble with them her mother asked no mary said tonelessly no trouble at all she wondered where her mother would go with that but maude mcgregor didnt go anywhere at all she only nodded and got the teapot and filled her own cup she held the pot out to mary who nodded her mother refilled it the milk mary added came from one of the cows in the barn hows alec her mother asked mary smiled she didnt have to consider her answers and watch every word about her son hes fine ma hes growing like a weed he raises trouble every chance he gets and hes doing good in kindergarten of course he already pretty much knew how to read and write before he started i should hope so her mother said you and julia and alexander did too alec was named for marys dead older brother remembering him took the smile off her face she said you know what the bad thing is about school these days of course i do maude mcgregor said the yanks pound their lies into the heads of children who arent old enough to know malarkey when they hear it thats it thats just it mary didnt know what to do about it either her mother and father had pulled her out of school when the americans started throwing propaganda around instead of teaching about what had really happenedthat was how canadians saw it anyhow no one had raised a fuss back then but rules were stricter now and mary didnt want the yanks paying attention to her for any reason her mother said and mort hows the diner doing pretty well mary answered one of the cooks burned his hand so hell be out a few days morts filling in behind the stove must be strange having a man who knows how to cook her mother remarked it is it keeps me on my toes all the time mary said but its all right im glad i found anybody and mort and i get along real good shed had a young man courting her when her father was killed by his own bomb trying to blow up general custer as he passed through rosenfeld afterwards the young man dropped her as if she were explosive herself nobody looked at her for years after that not till mort pomeroy did was it any wonder shed promptly fallen in love her mother said im glad you do its nice your father and i we hardly had a harsh word between us i know ma mary also knew why her mother noticed everything and said nothing if she didnt complain how could pa have found fault with her mary wasnt like that shed never believed in suffering in silence if something was wrong she let the world know about it she didnt always restrict herself to words either any more than her father had she asked how are things here oh i get along maude mcgregor answered ive been getting along for years and years now i expect im good for a little while longer the farm lacked not only electricity but also running water and indoor plumbing mary had never noticed what was missing when she was growing up shed taken the pungency of the outhouse as much for granted as the different pungency of the barn kerosene lamps had always seemed good enough so had the potbellied coalburning stove now the stinks and the inconveniences though still familiar jolted her when she visited little by little shed got used to an easier life in town even so she said im going out to the barn for some chores oh you dont need to do that her mother said quickly its all right i dont mind mary did intend to gather eggs and feed the animals while she was out there she wasnt dressed for mucking out the place that wasnt all she would do though her mother knew as much knew and worried but being who and what she was she couldnt bring herself to say much a motorcar rolled along the dirt track that ran in front of the mcgregor farm as mary went from the farmhouse to the barn the dirt road didnt see much traffic these days though mary remembered endless columns of soldiers in greengray marching along it when she was a little girl us soldiers heading for the front that had stalled between rosenfeld and winnipeg then the front wasnt stalled anymore the yanks got what theyd always wanted and hard times descended on canada they werent gone yet the barnyard stink wasnt as sharp and oppressive as the one from the privy it made mary smile instead of wrinkling her nose her shoes scrunched on straw as she walked back toward the chickens she proved to herself that she still knew how to get eggs out of nests without ruffling feathers and without getting pecked a few hens clucked complaints but that was all smiling a selfsatisfied smile she put the eggs in a basket that done she fed all the livestock she could still handle a pitchfork too she didnt have much need to do that in the apartment in rosenfeld come to think of it though sometimes a pitchfork would come in handy for prodding alec along in the right direction off in one corner of the front of the barn lay an old wagon wheel its iron tire was red with rust it had been lying there for at least twenty years probably longer anyone who saw it would figure it was just a piece of junk nobodyd bothered getting rid of mary had thought the same thing for years now grunting she shoved it off to one side and scraped away at the straw and dirt under it before long her fingernails rasped against a board she got the board free and looked down into the neat rectangular hole in the ground it and the wagon wheel concealed her father had dug out that hole to hide his bombmaking tools the us occupiers had long suspected him theyd searched the farmhouse and the barn again and again despite their suspicions theyd never found a thing arthur mcgregor had known what he was doing in explosives as in everything else these days the bombmaking tools belonged to mary she hadnt used them as often as her father had but shed bombed the general store in town owned by a yank killed a traitor in ontario she thought of it that way not as blowing up a woman and a little girl and derailed a train not far from coulee the next town west of rosenfeld with ohio lost the united states depended on rail traffic through canada doing the train had proved easier than shed expected she thought she would go in some other direction when she planted her next bomb she was so intent on her work she didnt hear the running feet till they were just outside the barn she looked up in horror as half a dozen men in greengray some with pistols in their hands others with rifles burst in shouting hold it right there youre under arrest in the name of the united states of america it was over after all these years it was over mary lifted one of the sticks of dynamite that had sat in her lap if you want to take the chance of shooting this instead of me she began if the dynamite went up the yanks would go up with ita good enough last exchange as far as she was concerned but one of the riflemen said maam ive been on the national rifle team at ranges a lot longer than thisthey didnt know if theyd need a sharpshooter to take you if i shoot i wont miss and i wont hit the explosives he sounded coldly confident confident enough to make mary believe him she set down the dynamite and slowly got to her feet raise your hands two americans shouted at the same time she obeyed why not nothing mattered anymore one of the yanks said out of the barn now slow and easy dont do anything cute or you wont last long enough to stand trial oh yes im sure youre worried about that mary said they didnt answer her why should they theyd won when she got outside she saw two more yanks holding her mother back theyd slapped a gag on her so she couldnt scream and warn mary two motorcars were parked by the side of the house she thought one was the auto shed seen driving along the dirt road they must have been keeping an eye on her all along then leave my mother alone she said dully she never had anything to do with this it was all me well see about that one of the yanks said but he turned to the men holding maude mcgregor take the gag off her jack she can yell her head off now it wont make any difference as soon as jack removed the gag marys mother said shes lying to save me i was the one who set the bombs that isnt so mary exclaimed how about that one the other side of coulee ma you dont even drive i took the wagon her mother said with stubborn hopeless defiance and thats how come we caught your daughter in there with dynamite in her lap right said the yank who seemed to be in charge of things he waved to his men get her into the auto well take her up to winnipeg and tend to business there as the other americans obeyed one of them asked how about the old broad both mary and her mother squawked irately the yanks ignored them leave her alone for now their boss said looks to me like weve got the one we want they shoved mary into a chevrolet as it sped off down the dirt road she knew how right he was chester martin had known rejoining the us army would make his wife furious he hadnt known how furious rita had lost her first husband in the great war and seemed sure she would lose her second in this one when chester reupped hed asked for a month to get his affairs in order before he went in the army gave it to him they werent conscripting middleaged retreads even if they were glad to have them and so theyd acted accommodating as all getout now he wished he hadnt asked for so long it was the longest month of his life you said theyd shot you last time and that was plenty for you rita said over and over again you lied she might have accused him of falling off the wagonor maybe falling into the arms of an old girlfriend came closer to the mark and maybe he was he had no romantic illusions about war nobody whod been a noncom in the trenches all the way through the great war could possibly have any illusions about it but he kept saying the country needs me and that was no illusion the united states needed all the help they could get from anywhere have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately rita would ask that stung not least because he had his hair once sandybrown was graying and thinning at the temples there were lines on his forehead and more beside his pointed nose he had a double chin and something of a belly he still had muscles though nobody could hold a construction job without them his son carl who was six didnt know whether to be proud of him or worried about him carl knew people could get shot you wont let that happen to you will you dad he would ask not me chester would answer gravely that kind of stuff always happens to the other guy carl accepted that chester knew better but didnt want to burden the boy with worries he couldnt do anything about rita knew better too and wasted no time pointing out to chester what a liar he was with all that going on then he wasnt altogether unhappy escaping the little rented house in east los angeles and heading to the recruiting station a few blocks away when the time finally came he took the oath there which officially put him back in uniform they gave him just enough of a physical to make sure he had a pulse and could see out of both eyes if hed flunked the second half he suspected they would have worked something out they gave him a uniform too the tunic was too tight and the trousers were baggy the tailoring hadnt changed a bit since the great war they gave him a first sergeants stripes on his left sleeve he knew what that meant youre going to have me nursemaid some officer who was still spitting up sour milk when the confederates tossed in the sponge the last time he got exactly no sympathy which was exactly what hed expected the sergeant whod talked him into rejoining said well martin what about it are you going to tell me youre not qualified for the job ill say bullshit to your face if youve got the brass to try it martin didnt have that kind of brass maybe he could keep a kid from getting some good men killed he might even save the kids neckand with luck his own in the process his orders were to report to a replacement depot in virginia accompanying them was a travel voucher for rail transportation from los angeles to milwaukee he asked the noncom who gave him the voucher how the devil do i get from milwaukee to where im supposed to go stick out my thumb beats me that worthy said cheerfully for all i know hitchings faster than any other way once you get to milwaukee i promise theyll tell you what to do next i hope so martin didnt trust army bureaucracy while the people in wisconsin were figuring out how to get him past the confederate corridor that split the usa in two the people in virginia were liable to decide he was awol if he didnt show up on time and throw him in the guardhouse when he finally did he knew that was unreasonable he also knew the army had some strange notions about what was reasonable and what wasnt he had a brandnew greengray duffel bag slung over his shoulder when he went to remembrance station the big new railroad depot in downtown los angeles rita and carl came along to say goodbye if rita cried she wasnt the only wife with a husband in uniform who did he squeezed her and kissed her one last time kissed carl on the forehead and climbed into a secondclass car maybe officers got pullman berths sergeants or at least one sergeant in particular didnt more than half the men in the car were soldiers either coming back from leave or reporting to duty for the first time chester listened the chatter sounded much like what he remembered from the last goround nobody seemed to want to talk to him that didnt surprise him he had a lot of stripes on his sleeve and he was at least twice the age of most of the men in greengray when night came the train slowed down to a crawl he hadnt thought about how the blackout applied to trains he realized he should have if locomotives went tearing along at full speed behind the beam of a big bright light they shouted hey come shoot me up at whatever enemy airplanes happened to be in the neighborhood that made perfect senseonce you worked it out conductors went through the cars making sure blackout curtains were in place on every window light leaking out the sides was as bad as any other kind chester wondered how likely an attack was he shrugged if it could happen at all you didnt want to take needless chances about half an hour after the blackout curtains came down chester went back to the dining car the featured entree was something called swiss steak it struck him as a good reason for emigrating from switzerland he looked at the private at the table next to his and said im not back on duty yet but now i feel like im back in the army by god yeah the kid was pushing the gravysmeared meat around with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm this is pretty lousy isnt it he eyed martins heavily striped sleeve have you uh been in the army all along by the way he said it he might have meant since the war of secession or possibly since the war of the roses chester laughed and shook his head nope i got out in undoubtedly before the private was bornand went on with my life oh the youngster digested that which had to be easier than digesting the swiss steak he risked another question how come you came back they conscripted me i had to go but you mustve had it made well not quite martin said i was doing all right but i wasnt rich or anything but i didnt want to see jake featherston kicking us in the slats and so here i am uhhuh the private seemed surprised anybody who didnt have to would put on the uniform maybe he was what was wrong with the usa part of the reason the country was having so much trouble with the csa on the other hand maybe he just had a good deal of common sense chester wondered how the chicagobound train would go to avoid both the mormon uprising and the chance of bumping into confederate raiders it headed east through kingman and flagstaff new mexico and on to santa fe where it turned north for a run through the mountains to denver it got hung up there for two days though at a little colorado town called salida somebody said salida meant exit in spanish but there was no exit from the place till damaged track up ahead was repaired avalanche sabotage no one seemed to want to say which left chester suspecting the worst he dug a greatcoat out of his duffel and used it to stay warm sleeping in his seat was anything but delightful everybody grumbled nobody could do anything but grumble misery might not have loved company but had a lot of it once they got going again they made pretty good time till they came to chicago the confederates had done what they could to bomb the railroad yards given the accuracy of night bombing that meant the whole city had caught hell but the crawl at which the train proceeded showed the enemy had hurt the tracks and the stations to which they led following signs that said military passengers for the transfer to milwaukee chester stood in line for twenty minutes and then presented his voucher to a boredlooking corporal who eyed it and said youre late my whole goddamn train is late so sue me chester said the corporal looked up wondering who could be so cavalier about this business seeing a man with a lot more stripes than he owned instead of a scared young private he kept his mouth shut chester went on i knew i was late before i got here now i want to know how to get where im going ill fix it sergeant the corporal promised and he did if he took it out on some luckless kid later on chester didnt find out about that from chicago to milwaukee was a short hop like the one from toledo to cleveland naturally whatever eastbound transport theyd planned from milwaukee was also obsolete another noncom did some more fixing an hour and a half later martin found himself taking off in a twentytwoseat boeing transport bound for buffalo the first airplane ride of his life he didnt like it it was bumpyworse than bumpy in fact several people were airsick and not all of them got all of it in their sacks there was a snowstorm over buffalo the pilot talked about going on to syracuse or rochester he also talked about how muchor rather how littlefuel he had the kid next to chester worked his rosary beads hard they did put down in buffalo snowstorm or not the transport almost skidded off the end of the runway but it didnt quite the rosary beads got another workout during and after that give em some for me too chester said when the airplane finally decided it did intend to stop the only thing that could have made the landing more fun would have been hound dogs shooting up the transport while it came in he wondered if the army would try to fly him down to virginia if they did he might have found out more about confederate fighters than he ever wanted to know but he got on another train again instead and he got delayed again twice once from bombedout rails and once from what they actually admitted was sabotage somebody in the car said christ i hope were doing the same thing to the confederates if we werent we wouldve lost the goddamn war by now i expect somebody else replied chester suspected that was true he also suspected the united states were using negro rebels to do a lot of their dirty work down there he knew theyd done that in the last war hed led a negro red through us lines to get whatever he needed in the way of arms and ammunition blacks now had even less reason to love the csa than theyd had then youre late a sergeant growled at him when he finally got where he was going thats right chester said im damn lucky im here at all the other sergeant stared at him he stared back hed had three years of guff the last war enough by god was enough cincinnatus driver sat in the brass monkey soaking up a bottle of beer the brass monkey wasnt the best saloon in covington kentucky it wasnt even the best saloon in the colored part of covington but it was the closest one to the house where he lived with his father and his senile mother he walked with a cane and had a permanent limp close counted a couple of old black men sat in a corner playing checkers they were regulars and then some as far as cincinnatus could tell they damn neardamn nearlived at the brass monkey theyd nurse a beer all day long as they shoved black and red wooden disks back and forth every so often they would stick their heads up and join in some conversation or other more often though they stayed in their own little world maybe they were smart the one outside looked none too appetizing to any negro in the confederate states of america talk in the saloon reflected that a middleaged man named diogenes blew cigarette smoke up at the ceiling smiled and said shoulda got outa here when the gettin was good too damn late now do jesus yes another man said and knocked back his shot he set a quarter on the bar for another one we is nothin but the remnantsthe stupid remnants i should oughta say remnants he repeated the fancy word with an odd somber relish he wasnt wrong after kentucky voted to return to the csa in early a lot of blacks voted with their feet heading across the ohio to states that remained in the usa cincinnatus had intended to do that with his father and mother hed been sure ahead of time how the plebiscite would go if he hadnt stepped in front of a car searching for his mother after she wandered off diogenes savagely stubbed out his cigarette god damn al smith to hell and gone reckon he fryin down there now lousy stinkin son of a bitch several men nodded cincinnatus among them al smith hadnt had to give jake featherston that plebiscite he hadnt had to but hed done it cincinnatus wasnt sorry he was dead not even a little bit the bartender ran a rag over the smooth top of the bar the rag was none too clean but neither was the bar cincinnatus couldnt tell what if anything went on behind that expressionless face nodding while somebody else cursed al smith had probably been safe enough he wouldnt have cursed smith himself not where people he didnt know could hear even if everybody here was black that was asking for trouble anybodyanybody at allcould be an agent or a provocateur and sometimes trouble came without asking the doors to the brass monkey flew open in stormed half a dozen freedom party guards all in what looked like cs army uniforms but in gray cloth rather than butternut they all had submachine guns and mean looks on their faces when the one with a sergeants stripes on his sleeve said dont nobody move the saloon suddenly became a still life the white men fanned out they werent quite soldiers but they knew how to take charge of a situation the threestriper he wasnt officially a sergeant the freedom party guards had their own sillysounding names for ranks barked lets see your passbooks niggers no black in the csa could go anywhere or do anything without showing the book first it proved he was who he was and that he had the governments permission to be where he was and do what he was doing cincinnatus dug his out of the back pocket of his dungarees he handed it to the grayuniformed white man who held out his hand the guard checked to make sure his photo matched his face then checked his name against a list hey clint he exclaimed heres one were looking for clint was the noncom in charge of the squad he pointed his submachine gun at cincinnatus then gestured with the weapon over here nigger move nice and slow and easy or that spook back of the bars gonna have to clean you off the floor cincinnatus couldnt move any way but slowly the noncom was careful not to let him get close enough to lash out with his cane he hadnt planned to anyhow he might knock the gun out of the mans hand but then what he wasnt likely to shoot all the freedom party guards before one of them filled him full of holes he couldnt run either not with his ruined leg he was stuck they hauled him away in a paddy wagon he felt some small relief when they took him to a police station not a freedom party meeting hall the police still stood for law no matter how twisted the party was a law unto itself and beyond anyone elses reach and a police captain rather than a freedom party guard questioned him you know a man named luther bliss the cop demanded that told cincinnatus which way the wind was blowing i sure do an i wish to jesus i didnt he answered oh yeah how come the policeman exuded skepticism on account of he lured me down here and threw me in jail back in the twenties cincinnatus said which was nothing but the truth he didnt like and didnt trust luther bliss he never had and never would the us secret policeman and secret agent with the huntinghound eyes was too singlemindedly devoted to what he did his reply seemed to take the policeman by surprise how come the cop repeated he reckon you was a red nigger hell no cincinnatus sounded as scornful as a black man in a confederate police station dared before his interrogator could get angry he explained why reds didnt bother luther bliss none back then they werent out to overthrow the usa bliss was afraid i was too cozy with confederate diehards nigger we can look all this shit up if youre lyin youre dyin the cop growled why you reckon im telling you this stuff i want you to look it up cincinnatus said then you see i aint done nothin to hurt the csa the one didnt follow from the other but he hoped with all his heart that the policeman wouldnt see that his attitude did confuse the white man anyhow he sounded a little less hostile when he asked you seen bliss since that was a dangerous question because the answer was yes since luther bliss was one of the worst enemies the confederates had in kentucky cincinnatus would be suspected for not reporting that hed spotted him cautiously he said i done heard tell he was in town but i aint set eyes on him dont want to set eyes on him neither the last sentence at least was true if the confederates asked the right questions of the right people they could show the rest was a lie the cop pointed a warning finger at cincinnatus dont you go nowhere im gonna check up on what you just told me what happens next depends on whether you were tryin to blow smoke up my ass you got me oh yes suh i surely do cincinnatus said an i aint goin nowhere he almost laughed at the policeman if the fellow thought he could just waltz out of the station that didnt say much for how alert the covington police usually were he sat there in the little interrogation room and worried after a while he needed to use the toiletthe jax hed drunk was taking his revenge he stuck his head out the door and asked another cop if he could he was afraid the white man would say no if only to pile more discomfort and indignity on him but the cop took him down the hall let him do his business and then led him back cincinnatus had almost started to doze when his interrogator came back well looks like you werent lying about your runin with bliss he said grudgingly he pointed an accusing finger at cincinnatus why didnt you tell me youd been living in iowa why the hell didnt you get your black ass back there when you had the chance what have you been doin here since you came back he seemed sure cincinnatus answer would have to be something incriminating suh i been takin care o my mama an my pas been taking care o me cincinnatus explained how hed returned to kentucky to get his parents out and what had gone wrong he finished you dont believe that go check the hospital i seen you walk i know youre screwed up some kind of way the cop said do jesus that is the truth cincinnatus said i know what we ought to do with you the policeman told him we ought to send you over the damn border if the yankees want you theyre welcome to you sounds like all you want to do is get the hell out and take your ma and pa with you the longer you stay here the more likely you are to get in trouble hope flowered in cincinnatus he needed a moment to recognize it he hadnt felt it for a long time he said suh you do that for me i get down on my knees to thank you you want me to kiss your foot to thank you i do that i was laid up when i could have taken my folks out of here by the time i could get around even a little bit the border with the usa was closed ill see what we can cook up the policeman said we deal with the damnyankees every now and then under flag of truce if they want to let you cross the border well let you go suh when them guards grabbed me i reckoned i was a dead man cincinnatus said which was also nothing but the truth but you are a christian gentleman an i thank you from the bottom of my heart dont get yourself all hot and bothered yet the police captain said these things dont move fast when weve got to talk to the yankees or theyve got to talk to us though youre on the list for now go on home and stay out of trouble yes suh god bless you suh cincinnatus had dished out a lot of insincere flattery to white men in his time he didnt know any negroes in the csaor for that matter in the usawho hadnt it was part of life for blacks in both countries here though he meant every word of what he said this confederate cop hadnt had to do anything for him cincinnatus had expected the man to do things to him maybe the policeman thought he would turn subversive if he stayed in the csa fortunately the man didnt know hed already turned subversive whatever his reasons he wanted cincinnatus out of the csa and back in the usa since cincinnatus wanted the same thing since he wanted the same thing he didnt even complain about the long walk home it didnt hurt as much as it might have either when he got there he found his father almost frantic what you doin here seneca driver exclaimed eyes almost bugging out of his head in disbelief some damnfool nigger done tol me them freedom party goons grab you they did pa cincinnatus answered and his fathers eyes got bigger yet he went on an then they let me go he told what had happened at the station you believe this here policeman his father didnt sound as if he did but cincinnatus nodded uhhuh i believe him on account of he didnt have no reason to lie to me i was there he had me he coulda done whatever he pleased whos gonna say boo if a cop roughs up a nigger whos gonna say boo if a cop kills a nigger even nobody an you know it as well as i do the older man thought it over he screwed up his face in what was almost a parody of cogitation he dont mean nothin good by it he said at last he wouldnt believe a confederate cop could be decent and cincinnatus had a hard time blaming him cincinnatus had a trump card though im here he said and his father couldnt very well quarrel with that congresswoman flora blackford clicked on the wireless set in her philadelphia office she usually left it off turning it on at the hour and half hour to get what news she could she had littleno she had nouse for the music and advertising drivel that came out of the speaker most of the time some people were saying televisionwireless with moving pictureswas the next big thing the war had put it on hold and might have derailed it altogether flora wasnt sure she was sorry the idea of having to watch advertisements as well as listen to them turned her stomach she wasnt listening to news now though or not directly she looked at the clock on the wall it was a quarter to five what were they waiting for the announcer said ladies and gentlemen live from new york city and newly escaped from the confederate states of america we are proud to present satchmo and the rhythm aces out of the wireless poured music the likes of which was almost unknown in the united states negroes in the confederate states had been oppressed for hundreds of years and had no hope of anything else anything better they poured their wish for a different lifeand a jaunty defiance of the life they were forced to liveinto their music those sly rhythms and strange syncopations had no parallel in the usa satchmo might almost have been playing his trumpet in portuguese rather than english and yet a great singer could make an audience feel what he felt even in a foreign languagewould opera have been so popular if that werent true satchmo had the same gift nobody in the united states played his kind of music but joy and despair and anger came through just the same when the rhythm aces finished their number the announcer said you know folks will hear this program in the csa as well as the usa what do you have to say to the people of the country you chose to leave aint got nothin much to say to the white folks there satchmo answered sounding like a gravelly bullfrog white folks down there dont listen to the niggers anyways if you is colored an you is in the confederate states i gots one thing to tell yougit out if you can you stays dere you gwine end up dead i hates to say it but its de lawds truth his english was almost as foreign to floras ear as his music white confederates had their own accent or group of accents she was used to those people from the usa though seldom got to hear how uneducated confederate negroes spoke how did you get out of the csa the announcer asked flora already knew that story shed met satchmo after he and his fellow musicians came to philadelphia knowing what he was going to say helped her follow his account we was up in ohio playin fo de sojers dere we done decided we better run on account of we never gits no better chance so we steals a command caryou know one o dem wid a machine gun on it his accent got even thicker as excitement filled his voice we drives till we comes to de front its de nighttime so de confederate pickets dey reckons wes ossifers till we commences to shootin an drives on by one of the other rhythm aces broke in they all laughed at the memory good for you good for you the announcer said flora didnt like his fulsome tones she thought he was laying it on with a trowel the idea wasnt to patronize the negroes it was to show the world they were human beings too human beings abused by their white confederate masters she couldnt think of a better word than that even though the confederates had formally manumitted their slaves in the s neither sides propaganda was subtle these days the announcer asked what will you play for us next as usual satchmo spoke for the band this here is a song dat show we is glad to be where wes at they broke into the starspangled banner it was not the national anthem as francis scott key had written it it was not the national anthem as flora had ever imagined it either they did things with and to the rhythm for which she had no names but what they did worked it made the staid old tune seem new and fresh to her again most of the time she listened to the starspangled banner with half an ear if that she knew it too well to pay much attention to it not here not now she had to listen closely because she couldnt be sure just what was coming next she didnt think even the rhythm aces knew before the notes flowed from their instruments after the last proud wail of satchmos trumpet even the bland announcer seemed moved when he murmured thank you very much you is mighty welcome suh satchmo said you is mighty welcome an we is mighty glad to be in de land o de free an de home o de brave if we was still in de csa maybe they fixin to kill us the announcer still didnt seem to know what to make of that getting people in the usa to believe that whites in the csa were systematically killing blacks wasnt easy getting people in the usa to care even if they did believe was harder yet people in this country wanted as little to do with blacks as they could and wanted as few blacks here as possible flora wondered if satchmo and his fellow musicians had bumped up against that yet they werent valued for themselves they were valued because their escape gave the confederates a black eye what will you do now that youre in our great country the wireless man asked at last play music by the way satchmo said it he could conceive of no other life wherever folks wants us to play music we do dat how many people would want them to play music as alien to the us tradition as that national anthem had been flora couldnt know one way or another satchmo and his band would find out they wouldnt starve the government wouldnt let them and they wouldnt have to worry about pogroms and worse people might not like them but their lives werent in danger anymore after farewells and commercials the news did come on it wasnt good the big us push in virginia remained bogged down us counterattacks in ohio hadnt come to much the fight to grind down the mormon uprising remained stalled in provo if the united states could have thrown their full might at utah the revolt would have been crushed in short order the mormons of course had the sense not to rebel when the usa could do that flora hoped yossel stayed safe other fronts were sideshows confederatesponsored indian uprisings in sequoyah kept the occupied territory in an uproar that wouldnt have mattered much if sequoyah didnt have more oil than you could shake a stick at as things were the united states had trouble using what they could get and sabotage ensured that they didnt get much sequoyah was one more piece of trouble left over from the great war and the harsh peace that followed if the peace had been milder maybe someone like jake featherston never would have arisen in the confederate states the smoldering resentments and hatreds that fueled the freedom partys growth wouldnt have existed on the other hand if the peace had been more draconianmore on the order of what the united states had visited on canadaany sign of trouble would have been ruthlessly suppressed before it could turn dangerous which would have been better flora didnt know all she knew for sure all anyone in the battered usa knew for sure was that what theyd tried hadnt worked that was particularly bitter to her because so much of what theyd tried had been under socialist administrations including her own late husbands the democrats had ruled the usa almost continuously between the disaster of the war of secession and the bigger disaster of the great war teddy roosevelt hadnt seen the great war as a disaster hed seen it as a vindication a revenge toward which the country had worked for two generations maybe hed even been right but the voters thought otherwise theyd elected socialists ever since except for one fouryear stretch and what had that got them the economic collapse while hosea blackford was in the white house and the rebirth of confederate military power while al smith was if only he hadnt agreed to the plebiscites in kentucky and houston and sequoyah but he had and hed won reelection on the strength of it and none of jake featherstons solemn promises turned out to be worth the paper it was written on we arent immune from mistakes either flora thought and laughed bitterly there were times when the socialists seemed to go out of their waya long way out of their wayto prove that the telephone rang dropping a bomb on her train of thought not sorry to see it go she picked up the handset and said yes what is it bertha mr roosevelt is on the line congresswoman her secretary answered is he flora could hear the pleasure in her voice put him through of course hello flora how are you today the assistant secretary of war said franklin roosevelt always sounded jaunty even though poliomyelitis left him paralyzed from the waist down he was only a distant cousin to theodore and had always been a solid socialist im fine franklin how are you what can i do for you today flora said im about as well as can be expected he replied id be better if the war were better but i expect thats true of the whole country reason i called is i wondered whether youd listened to satchmo and his pals on the wireless just now i certainly did flora told him i dont think i ever heard the national anthem sound like that before roosevelt had a big booming laugh a laugh that invited everyone who heard it to share the joke neither did i by god he said but it didnt sound bad you knowjust different had he been a democrat like his late cousin the two words would have meant the same thing to him flora said i liked the way he and the rhythm aces talked between numbers theyll make some people thinkhere and in the csa thats the idea roosevelt said we made sure this broadcast went out over a big web featherstons boys could try till they were blue in the face but they couldnt jam all our stations people on the other side of the border will have got the message good excellent in fact flora said featherston says he tells the truth his peoplewhite and blackneed to know better she knew white confederates wouldnt pay much attention to anything negroes said but plenty of blacks in the confederate states had wireless sets too they sure do franklin roosevelt paused it seemed very casual then he went on president la follette wanted me to pass on to you that as far as hes concerned the bargain you had with al smith still holds hell meet his end of it he wants me to check and see that you will too if he does i will flora hoped she hid her bemusement two presidents now had agreed to speak out against confederate atrocities on negroes if she didnt speak out on a strange budget item shed found stranger still she didnt even know what the item was for iii when scipio was anne colletons butler back in the days before and at the start of the great war hed got an education less formal but more thorough than he would have had at most colleges he knew the name for a group of people forced to live in a walledoff part of a town they formed a ghetto the terry had been augusta georgias colored district for god only knew how long blacks lived there and nowhere else whites didnt live there no matter what but it hadnt been a ghetto negroes had worked all over augusta waiting tables cleaning houses cutting hair and doing all sorts of backbreaking lowpaying jobs that were beneath whites dignity but the terry was a ghetto now barbed wire surrounded it armed guardspolice and freedom party stalwartspatrolled the perimeter the only people who got out were the ones who showed their passbooks at the gates and were approved reentering was controlled just as rigidly even before the barbed wire went up the authorities swept outemptiedone big chunk of the terry word was that the people removed had been resettled somewhere else scipio didnt know of anybody whod heard from any of them though his guess was that theyd gone to a camp negroes went into camps he didnt know of anybody whod come out of one either all he could do was live his life one day at a time try to get through try to get by every afternoon he put on the tuxedo he wore to his job at the huntsmans lodge and headed for the nearest gate hed been waiting tables there for a long time the cops and the stalwarts knew him theyd known him long enough that most of them had even stopped teasing him about the penguin suit he woreand for a white man or even a black to abandon that particular joke required a forbearance not far from the superhuman better still theyd even known him long enough to let him back into the terry when he got off work after the usual curfew hour for negroes that he worked at the huntsmans lodge in particular undoubtedly helped him and his fellow waiters and cooks and busboys acquire their immunity from the curfew the place was the finest and fanciest restaurant in augusta it was where the towns most important whites gatheredand of course they had to be well served of course as usual scipio arrived for his shift about twenty minutes early showing up early and showing up all the time no matter what were two of a restaurant workers chief virtues reliability counted for more than anything else he could think of he ducked into the staff entrancecustomers had a much fancier oneand hung his ratty overcoat on a hook he didnt think hed need it much longer spring came early to augusta and summer followed hard on its heels in the subtropical heat and humidity of a georgia summer his wing collar and tailcoat became a torture and a torment hello xerxes that was jerry dover the manager at the huntsmans lodge the sharpfaced white man made a pretty good boss good day to you suh scipio responded to his alias more readily than he would have to his own name as scipio he was still a wanted man in south carolina he hadnt thought the red uprising during the great war had a prayer of success which hadnt kept him from becoming a prominent and visible part of the shortlived congaree socialist republic as far as he knew the others who could say that were long dead his son cassius was named for one of them he expected jerry dover to go on his way after the greeting the manager ran himself ragged making sure the huntsmans lodge stayed the best place in town however much dovers bosses paid him it wasnt enough instead though dover said grab yourself some grub and then come see me in my office ive got something i want to talk to you about i do dat suh what you need itll keep till then jerry dover did hurry off after that scipio scratched his head something was on dovers mind the manager hadnt seemed anxious or upset so it probably wasnt anything too dreadful you couldnt get rich waiting tables if you were a negro in the csa you were most unlikely to get rich any which way but you sure wouldnt by waiting tables the job had its perquisites though the meals the cooks fixed for themselves and the rest of the help werent so fancy as the ones they made for the paying customers but they werent bad and they were free scipio ate fried chicken and string beans and buttery mashed potatoes smothered in gravy and washed them down with coffee with plenty of cream and sugar thus fortified he went to jerry dovers office tapped on the open door and said what kin i do fo you suh come on in dover told him close that thing will you yes suh as scipio did he beganoh not to worry but to wonder what didnt jerry dover want anybody else hearing the restaurant business had few secretsfewer most of the time than the people who believed they were keeping them imagined jerry dover pointed to the battered chair in front of his battered desk sit down sit down he said impatiently you dont need to stand there looking down at my bald spot ive got something i want you to take care of for me i do dat scipio said assuming it was something that had to do with the restaurant ask you one mo timewhat you need something a little special dover answered scipio still didnt worry later he realized he should have started right then but he just sat there politely and waited his mama had raised him to be polite going on seventy years ago now and anne colletons relentless training reinforced those early lessons dover went on i need you to take something to somebody down in savannah for me savannah suh automatic deference tempered even the horror scipio felt do jesus suh how i gonna git to savannah things like they is now i is lucky i kin git outa de terry ill get you authorized to leave town dont you fret about that jerry dover said which only made scipio more alarmed than ever what is this thing he demanded you cant go your ownself you cant put it in de mail let de postman bring it no and no the manager answered if i go out of town people will notice right now i cant afford to have anybody notice me leaving town and the mails not as safe as it used to be a lot of people are mighty snoopy these days he doubtless meant people who worked for the freedom party he doubtless meant that but he didnt say it you reckon nobody care about some raggedyass nigger scipio said quite calmly jerry dover nodded his very coolness infuriated the black man suh this here ass o mine may be raggedy but it be the onliest one i got then youll be careful of it wont you scipio there it was hed feared it was coming anne colleton had known who he was had known what his right name was shed eaten at the huntsmans lodgewas it really less than a year earlier and recognized him naturally shed wanted him arrested brought back to south carolina and shot jerry dover had forestalled her hed shown her that a colored waiter named xerxes had worked at the lodge before the great war it was of course a different xerxes but she couldnt prove that anne colleton had always been a woman who got her own way she couldnt have liked being thwarted here maybe she would have done something about it had she lived thanks to the us raid on charleston she hadnt scipio was free of her forever but shed told jerry dover his right name it was a gun in dovers hands no less than it had been in hers dover opened a desk drawer and reached inside what did he have in there a pistol probably what had scipios face shown what he was really thinking a negro in the csa could do nothing more dangerous dover said you know what im talking about dont you i know what you talkin bout yes suh scipio said then he let the accent hed used only once or twice since the downfall of the congaree socialist republic the educated white mans accent anne colleton had made him learn come out i know exactly what you are talking about and i wish to heaven that i didnt jerry dovers eyes widened you are a sandbagging son of a bitch how many times did you tell me you could only talk like a swamp nigger as many times as i needed to to keep myself safe scipio answered bitterly he added but i see there is no safety anywhere nowsuppose you eliminate the nonsense what must i deliver and to whom and why accent was almost as important in the csa as color scipio remained black he couldnt do anything about that but his skin said he was one thing now suddenly his voice said he was something else his voice proclaimed that he was not just a white man but someone to be reckoned with a lawyer a judge a senator jerry dover shook his head trying to drive out the illusion plainly he wasnt having an easy time of it he had to gather himself before he answered you dont need to know that you dont need to know why the less you know the better for everybody so you say scipio replied yeah i do and i say something else too you dont want to mess with me anything happens to me i got stuff written down youll wish you was dead by the time they get through with youand with your family too bathsheba whom hed loved since they met at a boarding house in the terry cassius who had reached the age when every boyalmost a manwas as much a rebel as the red hed been named for cassiuss older sister antoinette old enough for a husband nowbut in these mad times how much sense did marrying make scipio wasnt the only one whose life jerry dover held in the hollow of his hand everything in the world that mattered to himand if dover made a fist all right mr dover he said still with those white mens tones they helped him mask his feelings and his feelings needed masking just then i shall do what you require of me figured you would the restaurant manager said complacently talkin fancy like that may help you too but scipio held up a hand i had not finished i shall do what you requirebut you will pay my wife my usual wages and tips while i am away and wait a minute dover broke in you think you can dicker with me yes scipio answered i can bargain with you because i can read and write too you have a way to protect yourself against me that knife cuts both ways mr dover i shall do what you require and i shall carefully note everything i have done and i shall leave my notes in a safe place i have those and they have nothing to do with this restaurant dover glared at him i ought to turn you in now that is your privilege scipio masked terror with a butlers impenetrable calm but if you do you will have to find someone else to do your service someone on whom you do not have such a strong hold he waited jerry dover went on scowling scowling fearsomely but dover nodded in the end he hadnt intended to end up with a bargainhed intended just to impose his will as whites usually intended and usually did with blacksbut hed ended up with one after all dr leonard odoull was a tall thin man with a long jaw and a face as irish as his name he worked in a us army aid station a few hundred yards behind the line in virginia a few hundred yards in this case was enough to put him on the north side of the rapidan when the front was on the south side in the almost impenetrable secondgrowth country called the wilderness he didnt like that getting wounded men back over the river meant delay and delay sometimes meant a death that faster treatment could have stopped but there was no help for it the us bridgehead over the rapidan was small and under constant assault by air armor and artillery the confederates were no worse about respecting the red cross than their counterparts in greengray but there was nowhere in the bridgehead itself that an aid station could hope to escape the evil chances of war first sergeant granville mcdougald waxed philosophical when odoull complained we do what we can do doc not what we want to do yeah granny i know odoull had an md hed had a civilian practice up in riviereduloup in the republic of quebec where hed settled after a stint as an army surgeon there in the great war mcdougald had been a medic in the last goround and ever since odoull wasnt at all sure which of them knew more about medicine he went on just cause i know it doesnt mean i have to like it well no mcdougald allowed but theres not a hell of a lot of point to flabbling about things you cant help odoull grunted like any doctor he was an officerhe had a majors oak leaves on his shoulder straps like any longservice noncom mcdougald had ways of subverting the privileges rank gave to officers being right most of the time was not the least of them before odoull could do anything more than grunt a flight of northbound shells roared by overhead the sound put him in mind of a freight train rumbling down the track confederate artillery constantly tried to disrupt us supply lines disrupt supply lines that was a nice bloodless phrase what the confederates were really trying to do was blow up trucks and motorcars and trains to turn the vehicles into fireballs and the men inside them into burnt mangled screaming lumps of flesh that was what it boiled down to granville mcdougald also listened to the shells flying north didnt hear any gurgles that time he said happy day odoull answered and it was a happy day of sorts rounds filled with poison gas made a distinctive glugging noise on their way through the air mustard gas hardly ever killed quickly but the blisters it raised on the skin could keep a man out of action for weeks and the blisters it raised on the lungs could keep him an invalid for years strangling him half an inch at a time and making all his remaining days a hell on earth nerve agents on the other hand get a whiff of those or get even a little drop on your skin and the world would go dark because your pupils contracted to tiny dots your lungs would lock up and so would your heart and so would your other muscles toobut when your lungs and heart stopped working the rest of your muscles didnt matter a whole hell of a lot soldiers on both sides carried syringes full of atropine anyone who thought he was poisoned with a nerve agent was supposed to stab himself in the thigh and ram the plunger home if he was right the atropine would block the effects of the poison gas if he was wrong the antidote that would have saved him would poison him instead that wasnt usually fatal they claimed all the same it made for one hell of a war you know odoull said meditatively twentyfive years ago i thought wed hit bottom i thought we were doing the worst things to each other that human beings could think of to do he laughedin lieu of sobbing or screaming only goes to show what i know doesnt it well i dont suppose you were the only one with that idea mcdougald said kind of makes you wonder where we go from here doesnt it tabernac odoull said and granny mcdougald laughed at him when he didnt watch himself he swore in quebecois french why not hed spoken it every day for a quarter of a century english was the rusty language for him he was surprised it had come back as well as it had hed read it all through his time in riviereduloup to keep up with medical literature that had probably helped us counterbattery fire answered the cs artillery by the sound of things the us bombardment had plenty of poison gas in it intellectually odoull understood why the gas would either deny confederate guns to their gunners or force the men to don masks and heavy rubberized outfits that covered every inch of them those were unpleasant in cool weather in the summer there was some question whether gas or protection from it was more lethal as far as odoull was concerned though the intellect had little to do with gas he loathed it pure and simple hed never known a doctor or a medic who didnt how could anyone not loathe stuff made to incapacitate and torment people on both sides of the front seemed to have no trouble at all savagely odoull said i wish to god theyd test that shithe could swear in english tooon the people who invent it and the people who improve it and the people who make it then theyd be sure theyve got it just right works for me mcdougald said write up a memo and send it on to the ordnance bureau see what they have to say about it ill be damned if im not tempted to odoull said what can they do courtmartial me and throw me out of the army id thank em and go home and theyd never see my ass again do it mcdougald urged ill sign it they want to bust me down to private i dont care id be doing the same thing with a lot of stripes or without any and i wont get rich on army pay no matter what grade im in before odoull could say anything to that a shout from outside the aid station brought him back to the real and immediate world of war doc hey doc you there we got a casualty for you no im not here eddie odoull yelled back i went to los angeles for the sun funny doc funny like a crutch eddie and another corpsman a big burly taciturn fellow named sam carried a stretcher into the tent both medics wore smocks with red crosses fore and aft red cross armbands and red crosses painted on the fronts and backs of their helmets corpsmen on both sides sometimes got shot anyway the corporal on the stretcher wasnt at deaths door he was in fact swearing a blue streak he had most of one trouser leg cut away and a bloodsoaked bandage on that thigh his opinion of the confederate whod shot him wasnt far from sophocles of oedipus round tore out a big old chunk of meat eddie said missed the femoral artery though i guess it did granville mcdougald said hed be holding up a lily if the artery got cut odoull nodded a man could bleed out in a hurry if anything happened to his femoral artery lets get him on the table odoull said ill do what i can to patch him up but hes going to be on the shelf for a while he spoke to the noncom youve got yourself a hometowner buddy oh yeah just what i fuckin need the corporal said as eddie and sam lifted him off the stretcher and onto the operating table got a letter from my sis last weekmy wifes fuckin around with the fuckin milkman i go back to fuckin st paul ill beat the fuck out of her a man of strong opinions but limited vocabulary odoull thought he nodded to mcdougald pass gas for me granny before the corporal could editorialize about that mcdougald stuck an ether cone over his face he got out another couple of blurry fourletter words then went limp watch what the fuck youre doin with the fuckin scalpel doc eddie said everybodys a funny man odoull said mournfully eddie wasnt half so impassioned as the corporal of course he hadnt just stopped a bullet either odoull cut away still more of the trouser leg and the wound dressing too had the corporal stopped the bullet or had it just taken a bite out of him and kept on going odoull would have bet the round was long gone but he did some probing all the same you never could tell anything mcdougald asked doesnt look like it odoull answered they can xray him when they get him back to the division hospital but it sure as hell looks like a hometowner to me im going to try to spread his skin over as much of the wound as itll cover tie off some of the bigger bleeders dust him with sulfa and bandage him up and then send him on his merry way make sure you dont tie off the artery when youre fooling around in there mcdougald warned ill be careful odoull knew some doctors would have got their noses out of joint at a warning from a mere medic you wouldnt make a mistake like that if you were paying attention to what you were doing but you could if you got careless granny helped make sure odoull didnt the wound wasnt pretty after he got done with it but he thought the corporal had a good prognosis whether the noncoms wife had a good prognosis might be a different story when odoull said as much mcdougald said this guy wont enter the hundredyard dash in the olympics any time soon maybe she can outrun him olympics right odoull turned to eddie and sam take him back to division tell em to keep an eye on his blood pressure give him plasma if it falls i dont think it willhe looks pretty goodbut they should monitor it right doc eddie said sam noddeda paragraph from him odoull let out a sigh after they carried the wounded corporal away another miracle of modern medicine he said mcdougald clucked at his sarcastic tone hey you did good doc i think that guyll be fine and he lost a lot of meat off the bone only thing i did that a surgeon in the war of secession couldnt have was put sulfa powder on the wound odoull said that doesnt make me feel special believe me leg wounds are what they are mcdougald answered with a shrug nobody in the war of secession knew anything about xrays or plasma ill tell you that and the oldtimers couldnt do anything about chest or belly woundsthey had to watch people die of shock and blood poisoning weve got a real chance against themwell some anyhow hot damn but odoull shook his head sorry granny im tired as hell he didnt see that changing any time soon either honolulu was a nervous town these days with the japanese holding midway and with their airplane carrier probing down from the northwest all of the main sandwich islands were nervous these days the united states had taken them from britain at the start of the great war and it looked altogether too possible that they might change hands again in the not very indefinite future george enos jr understood exactly why the sandwich islands were nervous his destroyer the uss townsend was in dry dock at pearl harbor japanese carrier aircraft had pummeled her when she poked her nose up too close to midway there were no us airplane carriers in the pacific right now sending ships around the horn wasnt easy fast or efficientand the fight in the north atlantic was right at the usas front door us warships and what chunks of the german high seas fleet that could get out of the north sea squared off there against the british confederate and french navies the sandwich islands the sandwich islands were a long way from anywhere the chief of georges twin mm antiaircraft gun owned the rockribbed republican name of fremont blaine dalby his politics matched his name which made him a queer bird the republicans to the left of the democrats and the right of the socialists had won few elections since the s you coming into town with us george he asked the gun crew had got a twentyfourhour liberty the whole ships crew was getting liberty in rotation while repair teams set the destroyer to rights again i dunno george said uncomfortably i dunno dalby mocked not only his indecision but his flat boston accent which sounded especially absurd in the petty officers falsetto well you better make up your mind pretty damn quick yeah george didnt mind going into honolulu with his buddies he didnt mind drinking with them even if he got blind drunk part of him though did mind the idea of standing in line at one of honolulus countless brothels for a quick piece of ass he was married and had a couple of boys and hed never fooled around on connie of course hed never been so far from her either or had so little chance of seeing her any time soon when he was out on a fishing run he made up for lost time as soon as his boat got back to t wharf he wasnt coming back to t wharf or even to boston maybe for years and fremont dalby knew exactly what ailed him the guncrew chief gave him an elbow in the ribs what she dont know wont hurt her he said yeah george said again connie was a long way away his pals the men he ate and slept with the men he fought beside were right here he didnt want them to think he was a wet blanket and i dont have to stand in line at a whorehouse he told himself that helped salve his conscience he nodded sure ill come oh boy dalby made as if to bow thank you so much well come on then if youre coming along with the other ratings given liberty the gun crew showed their paperwork before leaving the barracks and then headed for the nearest trolley stop from the pearl city stop they rode east past custer field one of the many airstrips on oahu even as they passed wright fighters were landing and taking off an air umbrella floated over oahu at all times i wish wed had some of those guys up over our heads when the japs jumped us george said wouldve been nice agreed fritz gustafson the loader on the twin mm cannon the rest of the men from the gun crew nodded technically we were under air cover dalby said several people george enos jr among them let out snorts guffaws hoots and other expressions of derision and disbelief dalby held up his right hand as if taking oath in court so help me we were fighters could have flown up from here to the ship and got back big fucking deal george said others expressed similar opinions some even more colorfully yeah i know dalby said it wouldve taken em most of an hour to get there the fight wouldve been over by the time they did and they couldntve hung around anyway not if they did want to get back but we were under air cover by god thats how the brass sees it the way george saw it the brass was full of idiots he would have found formidable support for that view among ratingsand probably more than he would have imagined among officers as well flabbling about it would just have ruined the day so he made himself keep quiet the sandwich islands were too nice a place to waste time getting upset and fussing for no good reason it wasnt too hot it wasnt too cold from everything hed heard it never got too hot or too cold the air was moist without being oppressively sticky the way it got in boston in the summertime it could rain at any time of the day or night all year around but it rarely rained hard the hills north of honolulu were impossibly green the sky improbably blue the pacific bluer still i dont just want to be stationed here george said i want to live here in a little grass shack dalby jeered why not george said you dont need anything more than that civilians started getting on as the trolley stopped here and there the sailors eyed them suspiciously some were orientals and how could you tell if the japs were loyal to the usa and quite a few of the whites especially the older ones spoke with british accents they probably wouldnt be sorry to see the united states booted out of honolulu either well too bad george thought its not going to happen he hoped it wouldnt anyway the place where the islands were vulnerable was their dependence on the mainland for food and fuel if the japanese could cut off supplies holding them might not be easy no matter what the actual battle situation looked like then the trolley got into honolulu and he stopped worrying about things like that the city had a filigreed beforethegreatwar feeling to it not a whole lot had been built during the american occupation the hotels that had accommodated visitors before the new war shut down tourism were the ones that had accommodated them before even the redlight district had been there a long time the saloons and tattoo parlors and hotels that greeted sailors and soldiers had the look of places that might have greeted their grandfathers the lurid neon signs a lot of them sported seemed afterthoughts not essentials we need a few drinks fremont dalby declared and nobody presumed to disagree with him he swaggered into a dive called the swizzle stick the rest of the gun crew followed dalby ordered whiskey most of the other sailors followed suit george and fritz gustafson got beers instead what do you want to go and do that for somebody asked havent you got better things to do with your dick than piss through it its good for both gustafson said which quelled that in a hurry some of the barmaids were white others oriental they were all female and wore lowcut white blouses and short black skirts seeing them reminded george how long it had been since hed set eyes on a woman let alone touched one he stared down at his glass of beer he didnt want to be unfaithful to conniebut he didnt want to go without loving either the facsimile of loving you could buy for money wasnt as good as the real thing you didnt need to be an egghead to figure that out it was a lot better than nothing though was it enough better than nothing to make him decide to do it thats the question he thought and chewed on it as hard as hamlet had grappled with to be or not to be he didnt have to choose right away they werent going anywhere for a while some of the sailors had already knocked back their whiskeys they were waving their glasses for refills george didnt feel like drinking that fast if he drank that fast hed get drunk if he got drunk hed do something stupid he could feel that coming like a rash and if he did something stupid and he wasnt lucky hed end up with a goddamn rash too but his glass emptied as if by magic you want another a slanteyed tawnyskinned barmaid asked george found himself nodding the next beer appeared in short order it vanished in short order too so did the one after that and the one after that about then george stopped counting them fremont dalby got to his feet considering how much hed put down that he could get to his feet proved he was made of stern stuff the time has come he declared and were damn well going to drink up you bastards george knew all the reasons he didnt want to go to a brothel he knew all right but hed stopped caring connie was five thousand miles awaya lot farther if he had to sail it what she didnt know wouldnt hurt her dalbys words came back to him handy as could be everybody who went to stand in one of those lines told himself the same thing if he drank enough beforehand he might even make himself believe it the line moved forward at a good clip they hustle guys in and out dont they george said the rest of the gun crew laughed as if that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard george had to listen to himself before he realized what kind of joke hed made then he laughed too it cost three dollars payable in advance he didnt even get to choose a girl he got assigned a cubicle he went to it and there she lay already naked on the bed she was plump and had black hair she might have been part oriental hurry up she said you only got five minutes he wondered if hed drunk too much to perform he quickly discovered he hadnt and speaking of quickly it was over almost before it began he didnt need to worry about spending too much time in the nasty little room that was it he thought as he did up his pants i got all hot and bothered about that he had too whoever had designed the place knew his business the exit funneled customers into a pro station taking care of prophylaxis against venereal diseasesomething new for georgeproved nastier than the brief coupling had been enjoyable when he said so to a pharmacists mate the fellow shrugged and asked would you rather have vd couldnt be worse than this george said shows what you know shows you never tried pissing through a dose of the clap too the pharmacists mate jerked a thumb toward the door at the far end of the room i aint got time to argue with you go on get the hell out of here out george went the sordidness of what hed just been through far outweighed the pleasure the spasm of drunken guilt he felt didnt help either if connie ever finds out shell murder me ill have it coming too most of the other men from the gun crew were already out on the sidewalk some of them seemed as subdued as george not fremont dalby though twice he bragged two times nothing is still nothing george thought then he blinked hed never been anything special in school he wouldnt have bet he remembered how multiplying by zero worked not in a million years things came back in the strangest ways there were times when brigadier general abner dowling suspected he must have been a fire brigade in some past life not a member of a fire brigade but a whole brigade all by himself that was the only thing that could explain how many fires hed put out in his long career in the us army more than ten years as adjutant to general george armstrong custer made a good startor a bad one depending on how you looked at things custer was the hero of the great war but no man was a hero to his adjutant any more than he was to his valet dowling knew too well how vain how stubborn how petulant the old fool was and how those qualities went a long way toward making him the man who in spite of everythingincluding himselfmade the decisions that ended up beating the confederate states after the army finally put custer out to pastureover his vehement and profane objectionswhat had dowlings reward been eagles on his shoulders eagles and the post of commandant of salt lake city trying to hold the mormons down was even more fun than trying to hold custer down had been dowling had been in general pershings office when a sniper assassinated pershing no one had ever caught the murdererthe mormons took care of their own and after that utah was abner dowlings baby hed kept the lid on the permanently rebellious state had even seemed quiet enough to persuade president al smith in his infinite wisdom to lift military occupation and restore full civil rights to the inhabitants when dowling left the war department gave him stars on his shoulders he was immodest enough to think hed bloody well earned them too and his reward for that hed been sent to kentucky to hold down freedom party agitation thered been times when the freedom party maniacs made the mormons seem a walk in the park by comparison then president smith infinitely wise again agreed to jake featherstons demands for a plebiscite afterwards dowling got to preside over the us withdrawal over kentucky and the confederate reoccupation war plainly was right around the corner then theyd put dowling in ohio which turned out to be the confederate schwerpunkt the us war department had always had trouble seeing west of the appalachians dowling didnt have enough barrels or airplanes to counter confederate general pattons armored onslaught he still thought hed put up the best campaign he could given what he had to work with maybe the war department even agreed with him they recalled him from ohio after it fell but they didnt quitemake him the scapegoat for that fall after a spell in philadelphia counting rubber bands and making sure everyones necktie was on straight theyd put him back to work oh he wasnt an army commander anymore but they did give him a corps under major general daniel macarthur for the great us counterstroke the move against richmond forward to richmond was a rallying cry in the war of secession it didnt work then it didnt work so well this time as the usa hoped either it was the obvious us rejoinder to what the confederates had doneobvious enough for featherstons men to have anticipated it they hadnt stopped the us attack but theyd slowed it to a crawl and abner dowling commanding macarthurs right wing had had to face a second armored attack from general patton this one aimed at his flank patton plainly had wanted to roll up the whole us force facing him but he hadnt brought it off he wouldnt either but was it any wonder dowling felt the weight of the world on his broad shoulders yes those shoulders were broad his belly was thick he had a series of chins cascading down to his chest he was all things considered built like a barrel if he took to food to shield himself from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune well it was a wonder he hadnt taken to drink he sighed and stretched and yawned he hated paperwork hed earned the right hed done too much of it for too many years first for custer and then on his own hook the more rank he got the more paperwork went with it hed got good at the bureaucratic infighting too the sort of quiet warfare that measured itself as much by things prevented as by those accomplished that thought made him look east toward warrenton where daniel macarthur had his headquarters macarthur had wanted to pull one out of general mcclellans book from the war of secession land at the mouth of the james and go after richmond from the southeast it could have been a good plan in had mcclellan pursued it with energya word not often associated with his name in against aircraft and the cs navy it would have been an invitation to suicide well it wouldnt happen now a quiet coded message from dowling to the war department had made sure of that hed got good at what he did all right macarthur wasnt sure even yet whod put paid to the project he thought so wonderful but dowling remained convinced hed prevented western union messenger boys from delivering a lot of deeply regrets telegrams in a campaign that wouldnt have been worth them his own headquarters were in washington virginia a town with nothing to recommend it that he could see us soldiers walked through the place in groups of five or six or by squads even traveling in pairs wasnt enough to keep them from getting knocked over the head and having their throats cut the locals kept chalking freedom and csa on light walls and painting the slogans on dark ones there were rumors the local women of easy virtue deliberately didnt get their vd treated so they could pass it on to us soldiers for once the brass hadnt started those rumors the men had dowling went outside the sentries in front of the house hed commandeered came to an attention so stiff he could hear their backs creak as you were he told them and they relaxeda little relax too much in hostile territory and youd relax yourself right into the grave anything seem strange he asked them they looked at one another at last with unspoken common consensus they shook their heads no sir they chorused all right good in fact dowling said enlisted men had a feel for such things that all the fancy reports from intelligence often couldnt match they listened to what the locals said and to what they didnt if theyd been in enemy territory for even a little while they got good at adding two and twoand sometimes even at multiplying fractions guns boomed off to the south and east corps headquarters was supposed to be out of artillery range of the front so were divisional headquarters dowling had noticed though that the most effective divisions were the ones whose cos ignored that rule the closer to actual fighting an officer got the better the feel for it he came to have dowling did his best to apply that rule to himself as well as to the officers who served under him the guns boomed again and then again dowling cocked his head to one side studying the sound after due consideration he nodded that was just the usual exchange between a couple of us batteries and their confederate counterparts it was liable to smash up a few unlucky men on each side but it wouldnt change the way things turned out if it went on for the next million years it was just part of the small change of war somewhere overhead airplanes droned by dowling wasnt the only one who listened to the sound of their engines with a certain concentrated attention or who glanced around to see where the nearest trench was in case he had to dash for cover not this time one of the sentries delivered the verdict ours yeah another man nodded sounds like theyre going to drop some shit on featherstons head in richmond good dowling said the sentries nodded again we nail him we win big one of them said and then meditatively asshole chrissake jimmy hissed the soldier whod spoken first you dont say that in front of a general jimmy looked abashedor rather worried that he might get in trouble dont get yourself in an uproar about it son dowling said i guarantee you i have seen and worked with and worked for more people of the asshole persuasion than you can shake a stick at like who sir jimmy asked eagerly abner dowling could have named names the question was could he stop once he got started he was tempted to let all the resentment out at once in a great torrent that would leave the sentries eyes bugging out of their heads he wouldnt get in trouble for that a man with a silver star on each shoulder strap was allowed his little eccentricities that was what they called them for generals even if a lot of them would have landed lesser mortals in the stockade but it took a hell of a lot to make the powers that be decide to jug a general so it wasnt fear of consequences that kept dowlings mouth shut it was more the fear of seeming like a fouryearolda fat fouryearold with a white mustachein the middle of a temper tantrum dowling remembered too many times when hed had to calm general custer down after one of his snits what was distasteful in another man might also be distasteful in him he wagged a coy finger at jimmy and the other soldiers that would be telling the men looked disappointed but not toohe didnt suppose theyd really expected him to spill the beans he took out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one in his mouth then he held out the pack to the sentries they accepted with quick grins and words of thanks the raleighsspoil from a dead confederatebore sir walters face above an enormous and enormously fancy ruff damn but these are good jimmy said after his first drag stuff we call tobacco nowadays tastes like an old cowflop a real old cowflop one of the other sentries added one thats been out in the sun for a while and got all dried out dowling thought of burnt weeds and lawn trimmings when he smoked usmade cigarettes he blew out a cloud of smoke then said you boys want to make me give up the habit the sentries laughed jimmy said dont do that sir only thing worse than lousy tobacco is no tobacco at all besides when youre smoking you cant smell the goddamn war so much you cant smell the goddamn war so much dowling wouldnt have put it that way which didnt mean the kid was wrong even here in washington well back of the line you noted whiffs of that smell dowling didnt know what all went into it among the pieces though were unburied corpses unwashed men and uncovered latrine trenches cordite and smoke were two other constants the smell had a sharper note in this war for exhaust fumes had largely ousted the barnyard aroma of horses and there was one other stink that never went away it blew out of the war department with luck it blew out of the war department on the other side too and it usually did for most wars went on for a long long time no there was no escaping the allinvasive allpervasive reek of stupidity hipolito rodriguez had worn butternut in the great war the confederate conscription bureau had pulled him off his farm in the state of sonora given him a uniform and a rifle and rather more english than hed had before and sent him out to fight and fight he had first in georgia against the black rebels in one of the socialist republics theyd proclaimed there and then in west texas against the damnyankees he had a son in butternut in this war and two more bound to be conscripted before long and he was back in uniform himself hed signed up as a member of the confederate veterans brigades men who werent fit for frontline service anymore but who could still help their country and free fitter men for the fight now he found himself in texas again riding a bus across a prairie that seemed to stretch forever he wore uniform againof similar cut to the one hed had before but of gray rather than butternut cloth the rest of the new camp guards wore identical clothes only two or three of them besides rodriguez were from sonora or chihuahua the rest came from all over the csa being in texas was a mixed blessing for a man of mexican blood white texans often werent shy about calling their fellow confederate citizens greasers and dagos sometimes with unprintable epithets in front of the names but at least confederates of mexican blood were citizens in an odd way rodriguez thanked heaven for the negroes who would fill the camp where he was to become a guard if not for them mexicans would have been at the bottom of the hill and everything would have flowed down onto them as things were most of the trouble went past them and came down on the mallates heads that suited him fine the bus stopped once in a dusty little town whose nameif it had a namerodriguez didnt notice the place had a main street with a filling station a saloon that doubled as a diner and a general store that doubled as a post office it was even smaller than baroyeca the sonoran town outside of which rodriguez had a farm it looked to be even poorer too since sonora and chihuahua were and always had been the two poorest states in the csa that said frightening things about this place on the road to nowhere along with everybody else rodriguez lined up to use the toilet at the filling station it was dark and nasty and smelly the proprietor stared at the camp guards as if theyd fallen from another world some of them bought cigarettes and pipe tobacco at the general store rodriguez went into the saloon with others the bartender must have been used to three customers a day having a dozen all at once made his eyes bug out of his head somebody ordered a ham sandwich in an instant all the men in gray uniforms were clamoring for ham sandwiches the barkeeper worked like a man possessed slicing bread slicing ham slicing pickles slapping on mustard and mayonnaise the bus driver leaned on his horn screw him one of the camp guards said he aint gonna take off without all of us as if to contradict him the driver blew another long blast none of the guards paid any attention they stayed right there waiting for their sandwiches and slapping down quarters as they got them when rodriguezs turn came the man in the boiled shirt and the black bow tieas much a uniform as his own gray onegave him a funny look his dark skin and black hair said one thing while the outfit he had on said another rodriguez just waited the man handed him the sandwich gracias rodriguez said as he paid him he spoke more spanish than english but his english was more than good enough for thank you he wanted to make the texan twitch and he did when theyd all got their food and their tobacco they deigned to reboard the bus the driver muttered to himself he did no more than mutter though considering how badly he was outnumbered that was smart of him rodriguez sank down into his seat with a grunt of relief not long after his farmhouse got electricity hed almost electrocuted himself he hadnt been the same sinceotherwise he might have gone to the front himself and not into the confederate veterans brigades away went the bus rattling west down the imperfectly paved highway reckon im gonna pawn my fuckin kidneys when we finally get where were goin one of the men in gray said you been fuckin with your kidneys jack theres some shit your pappy never learned you another one replied goatish laughter erupted the rattletrap bus filled with cigarette smoke towards evening the bus came into snyder it looked like all the other texas towns through which rodriguez had passed on the way west bigger than some smaller than others then the bus rolled on a few miles farther somebody sitting up near the front who could see out through the big windscreen said son of a bitch it was an expression of awe not anger other soft oaths and a few not so soft followed rodriguez who was sitting somewhere near the middle tried to peer past the men in front of him to find out what they were getting excited about he didnt have much luck they were all shifting and moving too the bus stopped this was where they were going whatever this was the driver answered that saying welcome to camp determination everybody off with a tired wheeze the bus front door opened one by one the new camp guards filed out some of them gathered in front of the luggage bin waiting for the driver to unlock it so they could get out their duffels others rodriguez among them took a look at camp determination first he decided the fellow who said son of a bitch had known just what he was talking about i was eighteen years old and in the army in the last war before i saw a town that size said one of the grayhaired men in gray uniforms si me too rodriguez agreed you could drop baroyeca down in the middle of that camp and it wouldnt even make a splash barbed wire surrounded an enormous square of texas prairie machine guns poked their snouts out of guard towers outside the wire perimeter barracks halls built of bright yellow pine as yet unbleached by the sun and unstained by the rain and rusty nails rose in the middle distance there were a lot of them but the vast acreage inside the barbed wire had room for at least as many more somebody else pointed in a different direction holy jesus the man said will you look at all them trucks there they sat on an asphalted lot separated from the barracks by more barbed wire along with the rest of the guards hipolito rodriguez had become very familiar with those trucks they looked like ordinary army machines except that the rear compartment was enclosed in an iron boxan airtight iron box pipe the exhaust in there and people who got into the trucks didnt come out again not alive anyhow theyre gonna get rid of a hell of a lot o niggers in this place the man next to rodriguez said hell of a lot you want to shut your mouth about that roy somebody else told him we dont talk about that shit if we do it amongst ourselves were liable to do it where the coons can hear us and then well have trouble hed learned his lessons well the freedom party guards whod trained them at the much smaller camp near fort worth had rammed that home again and again far as the niggers know when they get on those trucks theyre always going somewhere else yeah yeah roy said impatiently far as i know theyre all goin to hell and it damn well serves em right come on come on the bus driver sounded even more impatient than roy did yall get your gear and get moving i got to get moving myself get the hell outa here and back towards where i live rodriguez found the gray canvas bag with his last name and first initial stenciled on it in black paint he slung it over his shoulder and joined the column of guards thumping toward what looked like the main gate at least on this side of the square extra guard towers watched over it anyone who tried attacking it without a barrel would get chopped to hamburger the camp was already manned a couple of the men at the gate lowered the muzzles of their submachine guns toward the ground new fish one of them remarked dont look so new to me his pal had the heartlessness of a man with all his hair and all his teeth sonny boy i learned to mind my own business before you were a hardon in your old mans dungarees said a man from the confederate veterans brigade i believe you pops the guard answered some people need as big a head start as they can get he didnt smile when he said it guards on duty and new arrivals glared at one another before anybody could get around to demanding papers and showing themand before anybody could get around to tossing out more insults like grenadesa man with a deep voice spoke from inside the gate whats going on here are these the new guards theyve been promising us about goddamn time thats all ive got to say as soon as the men at the gate heard that voice they became all business as soon as hipolito rodriguez heard it he had to look around to remind himself that he wasnt in a trench somewhere even farther west in texas with damnyankee machinegun bullets cracking by overhead and damnyankee shells screaming in out through the gate came jefferson pinkard he was older now but so was rodriguez he had a goodsized belly and two or three chins and harsh lines on his face that hadnt been there in back when rodriguez was training hed heard that a man named pinkard was high in the camp hierarchy hed wondered if it was the man hed known he didnt wonder anymore he took half a step out of line to draw pinkards eye to him then said how are you senor jeff pinkard eyed him for a moment without recognition then the big mans jaw dropped hip rodriguez or im a son of a bitch he exclaimed and thundered forward to fold rodriguez into a bear hug the two of them pounded each other on the back and cursed each other with the affection a lot of men can show no other way teachers pet said one of the guards whod ridden on the bus with rodriguez but he made sure he sounded as if he was joking if one of his comrades turned out to be a war buddy of the camp commandants he didnt want to seem to resent that not if he knew which side his bread was buttered on when pinkard let rodriguez go he said so youre here to help us deal with the damn niggers are you freedom freedom rodriguez echoed automatically he was used to saying it in english now instead of going libertad the way he had down in baroyeca si senor jeff that is why i have come good camp determinations commandant told him were gonna have us a hell of a lot of work to do and were just about ready to do it since coming to augusta near the end of the great war scipio hadnt gone far from his adopted home for one thing he hadnt cared to go anywhere else hed made his life there and hadnt wanted to wander off and for another travel restrictions on negroes had started tightening up again even before the freedom party came to power theyd got much worse since just how much worse he discovered in detail when he went to the train station to buy a ticket for savannah the line for whites was much longer than the one for blacks but it moved much much faster whites just bought tickets and went off to the platforms to board their trains blacks let me see your passbook uncle said the clerk behind the barred window scipio dutifully slid it over to him the man made sure the picture matched scipios face xerxes he muttered botching the alias the way most people did when they saw it in print whats the purpose of your visit to savannah uncle see my family there suh scipio said he had no family in savannah but it was the safest reason to give the clerk grunted you got permission from your employer to be away from work yes suh scipio produced a letter from jerry dover on huntsmans lodge stationery authorizing him to be absent for one week another grunt from the clerk he jerked a thumb to the left go on over there for search and baggage inspection scipio went over there to a storeroom now adapted to another purpose a railroad workera weathered fellow who couldnt have been far from his own agepatted him down with almost obscene thoroughness two more white men of similar vintage pawed through his carpetbag how come you do all dis scipio asked the man who was groping him so nobody sneaks a bomb on the train the white man answered matteroffactly its happened a couplethree times weve had to tighten up he turned to the men checking scipios valise hows it look hes clean one of them said bunch of junk but it aint gonna go boom stung by that appraisal of his stuff scipio said ask you one mo thing suh yeah the white man whod searched him spoke with barely contained impatience why are you bothering me nigger lay at the bottom of it but scipio had sounded properly deferential so the fellow let him go on what you do when a lady come in here oh the man laughed and gestured as if grasping a womans breasts from behind scipio nodded that was what hed meant the frisker said we got a couple of gals who take care of that dont you worry your head about it uncle just get on down to platform eight thank you suh scipio picked up the carpetbag and headed for the platforms the confederate authoritiesor maybe it was just the railroad employeeswere shrewd if they had white men groping black women they would stir up trouble they didnt need they already stirred up a whole great storm of troubles at best life for negroes in the csa was one long affront but it often wasnt the sort of affront that made people flash into fury back in the days of slaverythe days into which scipio had been bornwhite men did as they pleased with black women and with black men who presumed to object resentment still simmered ready to boil the railroads didnt turn up the heat under it the corridors were designed so that nobody could give scipio anything while he was on the way from the inspection station to the platform some of the barriers were of new unweathered wood weve had to tighten up lately the railroad man said they seemed to have done a good job several whites were already waiting on the platform a couple of them sent scipio suspicious glances do you have a bomb did you sneak it past the inspectors will you blow us up for his part he might have asked them if you send colored folks into camps why dont they come out again he didnt say anything any more than they did the questions hung in the air just the same despair pressed down heavily on scipio how were you supposed to make a country out of a place where two groups hated and feared each other and where anybody could tell to which group anyone else belonged just by looking the confederate states of america had been working on that question for eighty years now and hadnt found an answer yet the freedom party thought it had it said if only one group is left the problem goes away the trouble was the problem went away for only one group if you tried that solution for the other it got worse no one in the party seemed to lose any sleep over that more whites came onto the platform so did a few more negroes the blacks all grouped themselves with scipio well away from the whites had they done anything else they would have fallen into a category uppity niggers nobody in his right mind wanted to fall into that category these days a little blond boy pointed up the tracks here comes the train he squeaked with excitement it rumbled into the station departing passengers got off got their luggage and left the platform by a route different from the one scipio had used to get there he and the other negroes automatically headed for the last two cars in the train they wouldnt sit with whites either they knew better and if the cars in which they sat were shabbier than the ones whites got to use that was unlikely to be a surprise rattles and jolts announced the trains departure it rolled south and east the tracks paralleling the savannah river when scipio looked across the river he saw south carolina he shook his head even after all these years he wasnt safe in the state where hed been born then he shook his head again he wasnt safe in georgia either cotton country and pine woods filled the landscape between augusta and savannah scipio saw several plantation houses falling into ruin marshlands had done the same thing raising cotton on plantations wasnt nearly so practical when the colored workforce was liable to rise up against you people got on and off at the stops between the two cities scipio wouldnt have bet that god himself knew the names of hamlets like mcbean depot sardis and hershman and when the train was coming out of the pine woods surrounding savannah it rolled through a suburb called yamacraw that seemed to be the more southerly towns terry negroes did what they could to get by in a country that wanted their labor but otherwise wished they didnt exist drugstores in white neighborhoods sold aspirins and merthiolate and calamine lotionrespectable products that actually worked scipio saw a sign in yamacraw advertising vangvang oil lucky mojoe drops of love and mojoe incense he grimaced ashamed of his own folk here were the ignorant preying on the even more ignorant as soon as he got on the east side of broad street things changed the houses most of them of brick looked as if they sprang from the eighteenth century live oaks with beards of moss hanging from their branches grew on expansive lawns that moss declared that savannah its climate moderated by the atlantic only fifteen miles away was a land that hardly knew what winter was savannah the conductor barked hurrying through the colored cars as the train pulled into the station this heres savannah he didnt quite come out and snap now get the hell off my train you lousy coons he didnt no but he might as well have scipio grabbed his carpetbag and descended as at augusta the exit to the station kept him from having anything to do with boarding passengers he gave the system grudging respect that it should be necessary was a judgment on the confederate states but it did what it was designed to do once he got out of the station he stopped and looked at the sun orienting himself forsyth park was east and south of him he walked towards it wondering if a policeman would demand to see his papers sure enough he hadnt gone more than a block before it happened he displayed his passbook his train ticket and the letter from jerry dover authorizing him to be away from the huntsmans lodge the cop looked them over frowned and then grudgingly nodded and gave them back you keep your nose clean you hear he said yes suh i do dat suh scipio said his congaree river accent had marked him as a stranger in augusta it did so doubly here from what little hed heard of it savannah negroes used a dialect almost incomprehensible to anyone who hadnt grown up speaking it forsyth park was laid out like a formal french garden with a rosette of paths going through it with spring in the air squirrels frisked through the trees pigeons plodded the paths hoping for handouts flowering dogwood wisteria and azaleas brightened the greenery scipio had to find the albert sidney johnston monument the confederate general killed at pittsburg landing was something of a martyr with statues and plaques commemorating him all over the csa in this one he looked distinctly christlike scipio fought the urge to retch he sat down on a wroughtiron bench not far from the statue one of those importunate pigeons came up and eyed him expectantly when he ignored it he half expected it to crap on his shoes in revenge but it didnt it just strutted away head bobbing youll get yours it might have said and it might have been right a squirrel overhead chittered at him he ignored it too he had no certain notion how long hed have to wait here so he tried to look as if he were comfortable as if he belonged several white women and a few old men passed with no more than casual glances so he must have succeeded very few white men between the ages of twenty and fifty were on the streets if they werent at the front they were in the factories or on the farms how do i get to broad street from here asked a woman with brown hair going gray maam you goes west a few blocks an there you is scipio answered oh dear i was all turned around the woman said im afraid i have no sense of direction no sense of direction at all the code phrases were the ones scipio had been waiting for he hadnt expected a woman to say them he wondered why not jerry dover hadnt said anything about that one way or the other a woman could do this as well as a manmaybe better if she was less conspicuous scipio took a small envelope out of the hip pocket of his trousers as casually as he could he set it on the bench and looked in the other direction when he turned his head again the envelope was gone the woman was on her way toward broad street no one else could have paid any attention to or even seen the brief encounter in the park scipio wasnt sure what hed just done had he given the confederate states a boost or a knee in the groin he had no way of knowing but he had his hopes iv jefferson pinkard was a happy man happier than he had been since moving out to texas to start putting up camp determination for one thing edith blades was coming out to snyder with her boys before too long that would be nice she didnt want to marry jeff till her husband was in the ground for a year but hed still be glad to have her close by instead of back in louisiana and for another now he had a man he could trust absolutely among the guards hip rodriguez he murmured to himself in glad surprise he hadnt seen the little greaser for twentyfive years but that had nothing to do with anything after what theyd been through together in georgia and west texas he knew he could count on rodriguez he didnt know how many times theyd saved each others bacon but he knew damn well it was more than a few and he knew how important having somebody absolutely trustworthy was running prison camps was a political job though he wouldnt have thought so when he started it and the higher he rose the more political it got when the only man over you was the attorney general you found yourself in politics and maneuvering up to your eyebrows because ferdinand koenig was jake featherstons righthand manand about two fingers worth of the left as well back by alexandria mercer scott was heading up camp dependable these days scott had led the guard force when jeff commanded the camp hed had his own ways to get hold of richmond no doubt the guard chief here did too the freedom party people at the top wanted to make sure they knew what was going on so they had independent channels to help them keep up with things and if the guard chief started telling lies or if he started scheming having someone on your side in the guard force was like an insurance policy hip rodriguez couldnt have fit the bill better with a grunt pinkard got up from his desk and stretched he pulled a pack of cigarettes out of the top drawer lit one started to put the pack back and then stuck it in his pocket instead he was about to start his morning prowl through the camp when the telephone rang whos bothering me now he muttered as he picked it up his voice got louder this heres pinkard hello pinkard this is ferd koenig in richmond yes sir what can i do for you sir speak of the devil and he shows up on your front porch jeff thought i want to know how things are coming koenig said and whether you can make a few changes in the way the camps laid out things were coming fine sir theres been no problem on shipments out of here pinkard answered shipments was a nice bloodless way to talk about negroes sent off to be asphyxiated by the truckload it kept him from thinking about what went on inside those trucks he didnt feel bloodless toward ferd koenig if the son of a bitch thought he could run a texas camp from richmond he might be right because he had the authority to do it grinding his teeth pinkard asked what do you need changed way youve got the place set up now its just for menisnt that right the attorney general said yes sir thats how all the camps have been pretty much jeff replied not a hell of a lot of women and pickaninnies packing iron against the government there were some but not many he didnt know if there were separate camps for black women or what he guessed there were but asking questions about things that were none of your business was discouragedstrongly discouraged thats going to change koenigs voice was hard flat and determined you can bet your bottom dollar thats going to change in fact whats wrong with the csa is that weve got too many niggers period not troublemaking niggers but niggers periodcause any niggers liable to be a troublemaker am i right or am i wrong oh youre right sir no doubt about it jeff said koenig was just quoting freedom party chapter and verse jake featherston had been going on about niggers and what they deserved ever since he got up on the stump for the party now he was keeping his campaign promises all right koenig said if were gonna get rid of em weve got to have places to concentrate em till we can do the job that means everybody we clean out of the countryside and the cities everybody so can you separate off a section for the women i can if i have to pinkard replied you didnt come right out and tell the big boss no not if you wanted to hold on to your job you didnt thinking fast on his feet he went on itd mess things up here pretty bad though the way determination is laid out now aint that the truth he thought whatd be better i reckon is building a camp for women right alongside the one weve got now that way we could start from scratch and do it right the first time lord knows weve got the land we need to do it he waited for koenig to tell him all the reasons that wouldnt work not enough time was always a good one and often even true after perhaps half a minutes silence the attorney general said can you have a perimeter up and a place for shipments to go out of ready in ten days time they can sleep in tents or on the ground till you get the barracks built ten days oh hell yes sir jeff said trying not to show how pleased he was he would have agreed to five if he had to he hadnt expected koenig to say yes at all but koenig went on thats what i like to seea man wholl show initiative i told you one thing but you had a different idea and it looks to me like a better idea make sure you fix up this new camp so its the same size as the one youve got now itll need to be ill take care of it pinkard promised slightly dazed uhif you aim to do shipments out of two big camps like that im gonna need more trucks the ones ive got now wont begin to do the job more trucks koenig echoed across all those miles jeff heard his pen scratching across paper youll have em another pause instead of building the new camp right alongside why not put it across the railroad spur from the old one that way you can separate the niggers out soon as they get off the trains id have to run another side of barbed wire that way stead of using what weve got pinkard thought for a moment id need to get some dozers back again too to level out the ground over there cant you use the niggers youve got in the mens camp koenig demanded well i could yeah but dozersd be a hell of a lot faster jeff replied i figured that mattered to you if im wrong youll tell me ferdinand koenig paused once more no youre not wrong all rightfair enough youll have your bulldozers and im going to bump you up a rank to brigade leader that translates to brigadier general in regular army ranks youll get a wreath around your stars in other words congratulations when you were in the army the last time around did you ever reckon youd make general hell no i never even worried about making corporal jeff answered which was the gods truth thank you very much sir youre welcome a raise comes with the promotion i expect youll earn the money koenig said more responsibility comes with the promotion too youre going to be in charge of a really big operation out there and a really important one too i wouldnt do this if i didnt think you could swing it ill do my damnedest sir pinkard said its for the party and its for the country you can count on me i do so does the president youve shown youve got what it takes koenig said which made jeff buttonpopping proud the attorney general went on those bulldozers and their crewsll show up in the next few days you tell em what needs doing and theyll do it anything else you needbarbed wire lumber whatever it isyou holler and youll have it if you dont somebodys headll roll and it wont be yours freedom freedom jeff echoed the party slogan but he was talking to a dead line he got up from his desk stretched and went to the window out beyond the barbed wire and out beyond the railroad spur and the road that ran alongside it what was there to see nothing but more prairiesagebrush and tumbleweed and jackrabbits and little gullies that turned into torrents when it rained leveling them out would be the dozers main job they could do it and it wouldnt take long son of a bitch he said softly a womens camp they were serious back there in richmond hed known they were serioushe wouldnt have been a freedom party man if they werentbut he hadnt known they were that serious if they kept on the way they were going there wouldnt be a negro left in the csa before too long pinkard shrugged as he headed out the door he wouldnt shed a whole lot of tears if that happened if there werent any negroes white men wouldnt have to worry about them taking away their jobs they wouldnt have to worry about negroes eyeing white women and they wouldnt have to worry about red uprisings hed got his baptism of fire in against red negro rebels in georgia theyd fought harder than the damnyankees had of course the usa and csa took prisoners neither side in the black uprisings had bothered with that very often so good riddance to bad rubbish out into the sunshine he went spring was in the air but the sun wasnt biting down with full force yet hed grown up in alabama and spent time in louisiana texas summer was no fun for anybody but it wouldnt be any worse than what he was used to with several submachineguntoting guards at his back he did his usual prowl through camp determination that he did it was normal how he did it wasnt he tried not to make his rounds the same two days running hed stick his head into barracks halls or hed go through the kitchens or hed go around just inside the perimeter checking for signs of tunneling or hed talk with prisoners or he never knew ahead of time he just followed whatever gut feeling he had the negroes had found they could complain to him if they stayed respectful suh we needs mo food a skinny black man said he didnt ask for better food that was obviously a lost cause youre getting what i can give you jeff said which was more or less true if i get more in youll get more too that was also true although he didnt expect to see the camps supply increased to drive the point home he added i cant make you any promises mind do what you can suh please the black man said pinkard nodded and went on to the next barracks hall the negroes there grumbled about the food too jeff listened and nodded and again said hed do something if he got the chance as long as they were grumbling about the food and not about the trucks that transported them to other camps everything was fine the trucks were what really matteredand the negroes didnt seem to know it for once cincinnatus driver felt as if he were leading a charmed life the confederates had arrested himand theyd let him go to him that went a long way toward proving white men werent as smart as they thought they were he might even find himself on the us border one of these days before too long he dared hope anyhow meanwhile meanwhile life went on in covingtons colored quarter it wasnt much of a life even compared to what he remembered of times before the great war it wasnt much of a life he shrugged he couldnt do much about that he couldnt do anything about it in fact all he could do was try to get through from day to day he thought about staying away from lucullus woods barbecue place he thought about it but found he couldnt do it his showing up there wouldnt make alarm bells go off at the police station the only negroes who didnt show up there were the unlucky ones too poor to afford any of lucullus barbecue he hopedhe prayedhe wouldnt see luther bliss at the barbecue place anymore he hated despised and feared the former head of the kentucky state police of course he also hated despised and feared the confederate states of america bliss was one of the csas sincerest and ablest enemiesand gave cincinnatus the cold horrors just the same if the confederate police didnt have informers posted in the barbecue joint they were missing an obvious trick despite the risk talk there was freer than anywhere else in covington that cincinnatus knew about by now everybody who worked in the place recognized him when he came in more than a few people also recognized that he had a special connection with lucullus they would always find a seat for him even when the ramshackle restaurant was packed he got extra barbecue when he ordered and some of the time they didnt bother charging him hed always been a man who paid his own way but he appreciated that now because he didnt have a whole lot of money policemen and freedom party stalwarts came into lucullus place too they also recognized cincinnatusrecognized him and left him alone theyd caught him once and it hadnt stuck not all of them understood why it hadnt stuck but they knew it hadnt they were no more energetic than most mere mortals they didnt feel like doing anything they didnt have to lucullus came up to cincinnatus while he was eating a big plate of beef ribs the barbecue cook was a massive man muscle more overlain by fat with each passing year who could blame him for liking his own cooking everyone else did too his father apicius had been even wider and thicker cincinnatus set down a rib afternoon he said afternoon lucullus had a big deep voice that went with his bulk mind if i join you you throw me out on my ear if im dumb enough to tell you yes in your own place cincinnatus said i done plenty o dumb things in my time but nothin dumb as that glad to hear it lucullus squeezed into the booth across the table from him he waved to one of the waitresses bring me a cup of coffee would you aspasia honey when you git the chance nodding the woman waved back the coffee arrived faster than when you git the chance cincinnatus hadnt expected anything different when the boss asked for something only a fool kept him waitingand lucullus wasnt the sort to put up with fools casually cincinnatus asked so what do you hear from luther bliss hed timed it well lucullus was just taking a sip the cook choked but the coffee didntquitego up his nose after managing to swallow lucullus sent him a reproachful stare damn you you done that on purpose who me cincinnatus was innocence personifiednot easy for a black man on the wrong side of fifty with a ruined leg but hed been only partly malicious what do you hear from him he asked again lucullus didnt bother pretending he hadnt had anything to do with the white man with the mahogany eyes of a hunting hound says he owes you one on account of you done that truck for him the truck had held mines that went into the licking river at least one of them had blown a confederate gunboat skyhigh the news should have gladdened cincinnatus heart and so it did in fact all the same he said reckon i owe luther bliss moren one mebbe lucullus calmly filched one of the ribs off cincinnatus plate and took a bite out of it fiery barbecue sauce ran down his chinan occupational hazard how come you didnt spill your guts to the confederates when they done grabbed you you feel that way cincinnatus couldnt squawk at lucullus scrounging not after all the free food the other man let him have as for the other well i didnt know where the bastard was at or i might have better be more to it than that lucullus said severely there was no matter how little cincinnatus wanted to admit it scowling he said dont reckon id tell the confederates where a dog was at let alone a son of a bitch like that one laughing lucullus said thats better he lit a cigarette gimme one o them things cincinnatus said lucullus did and leaned across the table so cincinnatus could take a light from his after a long satisfying drag cincinnatus added you dont know youre playin with a rattlesnake there on account of i aint told you he is one sure enough lucullus sounded more pleased than otherwise he explained why dat man be a serpent sure enough but he be our serpent he dont bite niggers he bites confederates an they shrivels up an dies that wasnt quite literally true but it made a telling metaphor cincinnatus wanted no part of it or of luther bliss he done bit me he said angrily well but he reckon mebbe you got somethin to do with them confederate diehards back then lucullus cocked his head to one side and studied cincinnatus plenty other folks reckon the same thing my pa he was one of em and cincinnatus had had something to do with them not that he intended to admit it now that man steal two years outa my life he growled you reckon i gonna trust him far as i can throw him after that trust him to give the freedom party a boot in the balls lucullus said he do dat every chance he git before cincinnatus could answer a grayhaired stooped wearylooking black man came into the barbecue place one of the small hells of cincinnatus injuries was that he couldnt jump to his feet he had to make do with waving pa im over here what is it but he knew what it was what it had to be seneca driver didnt only look weary he looked as if hed just staggered out of a traffic accident she gone son he said as cincinnatus did fight his way upright your mama gone tears ran unnoticed down his face lucullus had risen too he set a hand on cincinnatus shoulder sorry to hear the news he said in a low voice why dont you set your pa down he tell you what happened numbly cincinnatus obeyed as numbly his father accepted the cup of coffee aspasia brought him his hands added cream and sugar cincinnatus didnt think he knew they were doing it he said she done laid down for her nap i know cincinnatus broke in wanting to say something she was asleep when i went out uhhuh his father nodded he sipped from the coffee then stared at it in surprise as if wondering how it had got there sometimes im glad when she go to sleep on account of i dont got to worry none fo the nex little while i understand that cincinnatus said feel the same way my ownself but she dont usually sleep this long seneca said i go in to see how she is an he wrinkled his nose i dont think nothin special of it on account of she makin messes a while now yeah cincinnatus looked down at the gnawed ribs on the plate in front of him his mother had cleaned him when he was a baby hed found cleaning her one of the cruelest parts of her slide into senility i put my hand on her shoulder an she gettin cold his father said jus like somebody blowed out a candle she go easy i bless the good lord fo dat pray to jesus i go so easy when my time come cincinnatus made himself nod grief and relief warred inside him along with shame that he should feel relief its over now he said and choked on his own tears aspasia brought seneca a plate of ribs why thank you child he said in mild surprise you didnt have to do nothin like that on the house she said softly you need anything else you jus sing out you hear she hurried away as automatically as hed fixed the coffee to suit him seneca started to eat he said what am i gonna do without your mother got to let the undertaker know cincinnatus said i do dat his father sounded impatient almost irritable yeah i do dat but so what your mama an me we been together close to sixty years now she aint there no more he waved before cincinnatus could speak so cincinnatus didnt i know she aint hardly been here this las couple years but it aint the same it just aint he started crying again as unknowingly as he had before maybe we get you up into iowa cincinnatus said start everything all over up there you got greatgrandchildren you never seen i dont believe no ofays i especially dont believe no confederate ofay policeman seneca driver replied with a shrug even if he lied maybe we get there on our own cincinnatus knew it would be easiernot easy but easierwith his mother gone he didnt say that even thinking it gave his relief and shame fresh ammunition we see his father sounded altogether indifferent got other things to fret about right now with cincinnatus at his side he arranged them the funeral was four days later on a bright spring day cincinnatus wore a suit hed brought down from des moines it wasnt funereally dark but it was the only one he had none of the neighbors and friends whod come presumed to say anything about it ashes to ashes dust to dust the preacher intoned god bless and keep livia driver who is free of the evils of this world and free to enjoy a kinder one beyond we pray for her in jesus name amen amen cincinnatus echoed preachers always said such things he knew that but for a negro in the csa the evils of this world were altogether too real part of clarence potter wished he hadnt gone to school in the usa it wasnt that he begrudged the education he didnt yale was a firstrate school back before the great war quite a few confederates and yankees had studied in each others homelands some people had thought that would bring the csa and usa closer together it hadnt it never would they were as different as chalk and friday so it seemed to a patriot from either one anyhow potter despite his own differences with the government he served certainly qualified but not even the most ardent patriot from either country could deny that they were similar in some important ways too language high on the list potter listened to a sergeant talking where did you learn to sound like a damnyankee he asked sir i grew up in pittsburgh the noncom answered my father was in the tobacco business and he lived up there wasnt much fun when i came down here because i already had the accent and people got on me for it i believe that potter said somebody else would have to check the mans story if it was true it accounted for the accent if it wasnt it was outstanding cover for the yankees to sneak one of their own into a secret confederate operation but that wasnt potters worry or not directly all he could do was note the possibility somebody else would have to deal with it his job was checking the way the sergeant sounded and the man sounded pretty good to him he scribbled notes in a looseleaf binder then nodded to the sergeant i think you may well hear back from us he said i hope so sir the man said still sounding much too much like a damnyankee for comfort this sounds like a good way to give the united states a good stiff kick in the nuts potter hadnt said much about the operation the sergeant however plainly had the brains to add two and two and get something close to four if you do hear from us youll get the details then potter told him he also had the brains not to ask too many questions he said i hope i do sir saluted and left the underground room in the war department instead of calling in another candidate potter telephoned nathan bedford forrest iii the chief of the confederate general staff said forrest here what can i do for you general youve already done it sir potter said youve got me playing god for these fellows youre recruiting and so forrest said this isnt the first time youve had to select people for a dangerous mission thats part of your job oh yes sir potter agreed usually though the men i pick and choose from arent so eager as these kids theyre going to get killed some of them will get a blindfold and a cigarette if theyre lucky or a bullet in the back of the head if they arent but they dont care i could give you a division if willingness were all it took well willingness damn well isnt forrest said these man have got to be good theyll have to convince yankees that theyre yankees we dont want just anybody here we want men who can get well behind enemy lines and raise hell i understand that there was a fellow a couple of days ago whod played a yankee two or three times in amateur theatricals down in mississippi potter sighed he was every bit as bad as that would make you think but he didnt believe it he got mad as hops when i told him hed have to fight the war the regular way forrest laughed not that it was really funny amateur theatricals eh i believe youyou couldnt make that up he must have convinced somebody he could sound like he came from the usa or he never would have got as far as you i suppose he did potter drummed his fingers on the binder have to see who he did convince and weed that man outwhoever he is hes got a tin ear he wrote himself another note you think of everything dont you forrest said admiringly dont i wish i did if im so smart how come im not rich potter said forrest laughed though again he wasnt joking he went on im just trying to stay one step ahead of the damnyankees well be farther ahead of them than that if things go the way i hope they do lieutenant general forrest said potter almost asked what kind of things the chief of the general staff had in mind he refrained at the last moment at least as much because he feared forrest would tell him as because he feared forrest wouldnt he didnt have a need to know no matter how badly he wanted to know he didnt want to make forrest responsible for breaching security i really have spent too much time in intelligence he thought instead of prodding at things that werent his proper concern he asked something that was relevant any sign the united states are training infiltrators who wear butternut he got silence on the line for about half a minute then forrest said thank you for reminding me that anything we can do to the usa the usa can do to us no general i havent had any reports like that but just because i havent had them doesnt mean the damnyankees arent doing something like that they could couldnt they oh yesmaybe more easily than we could potter answered kentuckians loyal to the usa had no trouble sounding as if they came from confederate tennessee men from the less mountainous parts of west virginia sounded like their virginia neighbors and the united states had their share of people whod grown up in the confederate states or gone to school here one more thing well have to watch out for forrest said mournfully the president wont be jumping up and down when he hears about it no he wont potter agreed but ill tell you one thing hell be a lot angrier if you dont tell him about it till it ups and bites you if it does youre likely right forrest said yes i think so potter said hed known jake featherston longer than even the presidents oldest freedom party buddies he didnt know featherston so deeply but hed spent a lot of time brooding over what the head of the freedom party was likely to do next and hed been right more often than hed been wrong all right then i will pass it along forrest said and ill try to make sure no more ham actors get as far as you so long he didnt quite suppress a snort before hanging up it was funny potter couldnt deny that though hed been annoyed at the inept mississippian and even more annoyed at the officer whod passed the man that officer would soon find himself in a new assignment potter didnt know whether it would be defusing mines with his teeth or just counting thumbtacks in georgia or alabama or somewhere else far away from the real war wherever it was the fellow wouldnt have anything to do with this project at the moment clarence potter didnt want to have anything more to do with this project either he suddenly seemed to feel the weight of the whole war department pressing down on him if he didnt get out he thought hed suffocate that set of symptoms had afflicted other men who worked in the subbasement but never him not till now rank had its privileges if he felt like getting out he could and he didnt have to ask anyones permission he blinked a little when he came out into richmond in broad daylight he might have been a suddenly unearthed mole when was the last time hed been out and about with the sun in the sky he couldnt remember which wasnt a good sign propaganda posters sprouted everywhere on walls on fences on doors they cursed the enemy and exhorted people to work hard and keep their mouths shut one of them an idealized portrait of jake featherston and potter who saw featherston fairly often knew how idealized it was simply said the president knows that gave potter something to think about he suspected it would have given anybody something to think about another one showed two bestiallooking negroes with knives sneaking up on a house where a blond woman slept look out it warned the intelligence officer nodded to himselfthere was a good piece of propaganda the city of richmond now that he was actually looking around seemed to have taken a worse beating already in this war than it had all through the great war clarence potter didnt know why that surprised him but it did bombers could rain far more death down onto the ground than theyd been able to a generation earlier they carried bigger bombs farther faster and higher so they were harder to shoot down and there were more of them than there had been it showed buildings that still had glass in their windows were the lucky ones some people had replaced the glass with sheets of plywood others made do with cardboard which was fine till it got wet quite a few hadnt patched the wounds with anything those buildings even when otherwise undamaged seemed to look out on the world with dead eyes a lot of motorcars were missing glass from their windows too patching them with plywood wasnt practical people made do not that they had much choice bomb damage beyond broken windows was scattered almost at random throughout richmond here a building would have a chunk bitten out of it or a street would be cordoned off with sawhorses to keep automobiles from diving into a hole in the pavement eight feet deep and thirty feet across gangs of negroes directed by whites with submachine guns worked with picks and shovels to clear rubble and repair roads every now and then most of a city block of buildings was gone smashed to matchsticks and bricks and rubbish men and women sifted through the rubbish trying to find fragments of the lives theyd just had blown to smithereens a girl of about six clutched in her arms a rag doll shed just picked up and did a triumphant defiant dance take that potter thought looking north the damnyankees might have wrecked her home but shed found her best friend again despite the wreckage morale seemed good men and women on the street often greeted potter with calls of freedom he had to return the same answer too which made his sense of irony twinge his rank drew notice well get em general one man said dont you worry about it yankees cant lick us a woman declared were toughern they are potter made himself nod and agree whenever someone said something like that he also thought any one confederate was likely to be tougher than any one yankee did that mean the usa couldnt lick the csa he wished he thought so there were a lot more yankees than confederates jake featherston had hoped to knock the united states out of the fight in a hurry it hadnt quite worked now it was a grapple the confederates still had an edge but it wasnt so big as potter would have liked the united states can lick us he thought theyd just better not is all mary pomeroy sat in a jail cell in winnipeg waiting for the other shoe to drop that it would she had no doubt theyd caught her redhanded this time and of course now that they had caught her redhanded wilf rokebys charges looked a lot different they hadnt believed the retired postmaster when he said shed sent a bomb through the mail they hadntbut they sure did now a rugged matron in a greengray blouse and skirta womans us uniformled two male guards up the corridor toward her your lawyer is here she announced you have half an hour to talk with him thanks a lot mary said sarcasm rolled off the matron like rain off a goose she opened the door mary came out through it if she hadnt the matron would have slammed it shut again anything was better than just sitting on the rickety cot in there the guards pointed the rifles at mary as she went up the hall they looked ready to start shooting at any excuse or none they no doubt were too she almost wished they would if she went up before a real firing squad shed have to try to be as brave as alexander was maybe ill see him up in heaven she thought heavy wire mesh kept her from doing anything but talking with the lawyer his name was clarence smoot the military judge in charge of her case had appointed him he was plump and bald and looked prosperous maybe that meant he got clients off every once in a while mary didnt expect hed be able to do much for her she knew she was guilty and so did the yanks half an hour the matron barked again from now clocks ticking oh shut up you miserable dyke clarence smoot muttered loud enough for mary but not for the matron to hear the lawyer raised his voice then shall we talk about your chances mrs pomeroy have i got any mary asked bleakly well you may smoot said fiddling with the knot on his gaudy necktie they cant prove you blew up laura moss and her little girl they may think soand they may be right too mary thoughtbut they cant prove it all they can prove is that you had explosives when they caught you and that those explosives were well hidden you wont get away with saying you were going to blow up stumps or anything like that they wont listen to me no matter what i say mary was more nearly resigned than bitter im arthur mcgregors daughter and im alexander mcgregors sister and now theyve got me they may not apply the maximum penalty shoot me you mean clarence smoot looked pained well yes but you dont have to come right out and say it his attitude suggested colonel colby is a fairly reasonable man for a military judge oh boy mary put in he is smoot insisted compared to some of the tartars theyve got his shudder made his jowls wobble if you throw yourself on the mercy of the court i think hed be glad enough to let you live in jail for the rest of my life mary said reluctantly smoot nodded she shook her head no thanks id sooner they gave me a blindfold and got it over with are you sure smoot asked do you want your husband to have to bury you do you want your mother and your husband and your sister and your son to have to go to the funeral if you do youll be able to get what you want i dont think theres any doubt of that mary winced he was hitting below the belt alec was too little to understand what all this meant his mother was in a wooden box and they were putting her in the ground forever that would have to be a bad dream except it wouldnt be it would be real and when he grew up he would hardly remember her but some things were more important if shed thought they would let her out one day before too long she might have weakened with nothing but endless years in a cell as an alternative though my brother didnt beg my father didnt beg ill be damned if im going to clarence smoot exhaled heavily and lit a cigarette you dont give me much to work with mrs pomeroy im sorry she said then she shook her head again im sorry they caught me thats the only thing im sorry for theyve got no business being here youve got no business being here youre a yank eh you talk like one im from wisconsin up till now i didnt know that made me a bad person smoots voice was dry he eyed her would you rather have a canadian lawyer bumping up against an american military judge i dont think that would do you an awful lot of good but you can probably find one what i want mary took a deep breath what i want is for all you yanks to get out of canada and leave us alone to mind our own business thats what ive wanted since im sorry mrs pomeroy but thats not going to happen its way too late to even worry about it clarence smoot said were not going to go away and the reason we wont is that you wouldnt mind your own business if we did youd start playing footsie with the confederates or england or japan and youd make all kinds of trouble for us we dont aim to let that happen can you blame us mary exclaimed after everything the united states have done to my country can you blame us smoot spread his pudgy hands he wore a wedding ring mary hoped he wasnt married to a canadian woman whether i can blame you doesnt matter he said whether the united states are going to take that kind of chance well they wont so theres no point even thinking about it that was how a yank would think before mary could tell him so the matron stuck her formidable face into the room and said times up marys time nearly was up she felt it very strongly smoot said well do the best we can at your hearing the less you say the better your chances i can see that plain as day in tramped the guards they didnt point their rifles at mary this time but they looked as if they were just about to when i say thats it thats it the matron barked her voice almost as deep as smoots take it easy ilse the lawyer said soothingly but the matron wasnt inclined to take it easy she jerked a muscular thumb toward the door mary got up and went if she hadnt the matron would have made her pay for itoh not right there where smoot could see but later on the food would be worse or mary wouldnt get to bathe or maybe the matron would just come in and thump her she didnt know what would happen only that it wouldnt be good they took her to the hearing in an armored personnel carrier a snorting monster of a vehicle only one step this side of a barrel if they had to use it here they werent using it against their foreign enemies that consoled her a littleas much as anything could colonel colby was a yank in a uniform that was all that registered on her at first another younger yank a captain named fitzwilliams prosecuted her he laid out what her family connections were clarence smoot objected irrelevant and immaterial he said overruled the military judge said this establishes motive the worst of it was mary knew he wasnt wrong she hated the yanks for what theyd done to her country and what theyd done to her family captain fitzwilliams set out the case linking her to the bombing at karamanlides general store she thought theyd forgotten all about that one and to the one that killed laura and dorothy moss smoot objected to that too the only kind of evidence youve got is the testimony of a man who is obviously biased he insisted why obviously fitzwilliams asked because he doesnt agree with you it doesnt matter much anyhow she was caught with explosives in the barn on the farm where her mother lived bombmaking isand should bea capital crime all by itself the other charges are icing on the cake by the pained way smoot grunted he knew that only too well does the defendant have anything to say in mitigation or extenuation the judge asked he sounded as if he hoped she did that surprised her as clarence smoot had said he wasnt a monster only a man doing his job smoot nudged mary this is your chance he whispered think of your little boy she hated him then for trying to deflect her from what she intended to do she had to steel herself to tell the judge no i did what i did and youll do what you do if you think i love my country any less than you love yours youre wrong colonel colby looked at her a plea for mercy might affect the verdict this court hands down it wasnt that he wanted her to beg he wanted her to live you can give me the same mercy you showed alexander she said the military judge sighed why do you want to martyr yourself it wont change anything one way or the other you have no right to be here you have no right to try me mary said we have the best right of all we won colby said if your side had would you have been gentle to the united states i doubt it mary hadnt even thought about that it didnt worry her either colby let out a long sad sigh i have no choice but to pronounce you guilty mrs pomeroy the punishment for the infraction is death by firing squad we will appeal your honor smoot said quickly no mary overruled him or tried to an appeal in a capital case is automatic colby told her part of me hopes i will be overruled i must say though i dont expect to be they took mary back to her cell they allowed her no visitors that was more a relief than a torment she didnt want to see mort and she especially didnt want to see alec he might have made her weaken she didnt think she could stand that not when shed come so far colonel colby knew what he was talking about the appeal was denied the panel that heard it ordered the sentence carried out and so it was on a sunny day with spring in the air mary knew she should have been afraid when they tied her to the pole but she wasnt they offered her a blindfold she shook her head saying this is for canada ill take it with my eyes open a minister prayed she wondered why the yanks had him here when they were doing something so ungodly an officer commanded the men in the squad ready aim fire the noise was shattering so was the impact and then it was over guards at the andersonville prison camp often let us pows see confederate papers sometimes they would offer their own editorial comments too they jeered whenever the csa did something good if the usa scored a success it never showed up in the news in the confederate states the guards also jeered at what they called us atrocities look at this here one of them said waving a newspaper at major jonathan moss now you people are shooting women up in canada moss glared at him are you going to let me see it or are you just going to flap it in my face the guard blinked then handed him the paper which came from atlanta where confederate newspapers came from hardly mattered they all had the same stories in them whatever the freedom party wanted the confederate people to hear moss read the story the way the reporter told it mary pomeroy was a martyr whose like the world hadnt seen since st sebastian that the damnyankees alleged shed blown up a woman and a little girl in berlin ontario only proved what a pack of liars and murderers came out of the united states so the reporter said anyhow it proved something different to jonathan moss he thrust the paper under his arm without a word well the confederate asked him what have you got to say about that there she had it coming moss voice was hard and flat the guard gaped at him how can even a damnyankee say such a heartless thing as that because she murdered my wife and my daughter you cracker son of a bitch moss braced himself if the guard wanted to mop the floor with him he could the fellow was bigger than he was and only half his ageand carried a submachine gun besides but the guards gape only got wider she killedyour kinfolk he sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears thats what i told you moss answered its the gods truth too if she hadnt done that id probably still be up in canada id be a damn sight happier than i am now too i wish id been up there even now id have stood in that firing squad id have pulled that trigger you bet your life i would have he wondered if the guard would call him heartless again the man didnt he just went off shaking his head thatll teach you to wave a newspaper in somebodys face you knownothing bastard moss thought savagely he was avenged after a couple of years without any movement hed doubted he ever would be and so he wondered was he any happier because this woman was dead he would gladly have killed her yes but was he happier slowly he shook his head that wasnt the right word hed never be happy not thinking of laura and dorothy dead but he had a sense of satisfaction he hadnt known before it would have to do of course it will you fool its all youll ever get his wife and his daughter wouldnt come back and neither would the woman whod sent them the bomb from what the confederate newspaper said she had a husband and a little boy theyd miss her the way he missed his wife and daughter there was no end to this try as you would to find one there wasnt any he read the story over and over rosenfeld manitoba that rang a bell he nodded to himself wasnt that where that fellow tried to blow up general custer and ended up blowing himself up instead moss was pretty sure it was though it had happened almost twenty years earlier was this gal any relation to that bomber he didnt remember the fellows name but he was pretty sure it wasnt pomeroy but then the woman was married and the paper didnt say anything about her maiden name it wouldnt if she was related to the other rosenfeld bomber that would make her a murderer from a family of murderers somebody like that wouldnt draw sympathy even from the confederates and so if it was true the cs propaganda machine just ignored it here came that guard again he had another one in tow the second man as jonathan saw when he got closer was an officer he strode up to moss whats this i hear he demanded i dont know moss answered what do you hear conley here tells me youre related to the people this woman the yankees shot is alleged to have blown up alleged the word made moss furious i heard the explosion i saw the buildingand some of the other people she hurt while they were getting out i buried what was left of my wife and little girl dont you talk to me about alleged goddammit the guard officer gave back a pace he hadnt expected such vehemence well too bad for him moss thought weakly he said how do you know she really did it i dont know for sure now moss did some paperwaving of his own but im a lawyer it sure looks beyond a reasonable doubt to me a lawyer howd you get captured couldnt run away fast enough the officer laughed at his own wit im a fighter pilot i fought at the front line or on your side of it moss answered coldly i wasnt making like a hero in a prison camp hundreds of miles away the guard officer retreated in disorder moss started to throw the atlanta paper to the ground then checked himself it might not be anything hed wanted to keephe had his vengeance and now he knew it but the price hed paid but that didnt mean the paper was useless torn into strips it would come in handy at the latrine trenches he didnt intend to say anything about the story to his fellow pows it was none of their business but either the guard whod given him the paper or the officer hed routed must have blabbed for the other prisoners found out about it even though he kept his mouth shut every so often one of them would come up to him clap him on the back and say something like you got your own back thats good they meant well he knew as much that didnt keep him from losing patience finally after about the fourth time it happened he snapped what do you mean got my own back he growled at a luckless first lieutenant if i had my own back id still be married id still have my little girl and id probably still be up in canada sorry sir the lieutenant said stiffly and he retreated as fast as the confederate guard officer had after that fewer prisoners sounded sympathetic which suited moss fine in fact fewer prisoners wanted anything to do with him that also suited him finetill he got a summons from the senior us officer a colonel named monty summers see here moss he said no man is an island sir isnt it a little early in the morning for john donne moss asked its never too early for the truth summers said which proved hed never been a lawyer we dont want you solitary its not good for you and its not good for the camp either ill worry about me sir moss said and the camp can take care of itself as far as im concerned summers snorted in exasperation he was a cornfed midwesterner whod been captured in ohio when the war was new he had sandy hair going gray ruddy cheeks blue eyes and a rock of a chin that he stuck out whenever he wanted to make a point he stuck it out now you havent got the right attitude he said sorry sir said moss who wasnt its the only one ive got well youd damn well better change it summers sounded as if that were as easy as changing a flat tire he aimed his chin at moss again were still in the war were still fighting the confederates were all in this together were a team dammit and you let the team down if you dont play along dont you want to help drive these fucking goons nuts well moss nodded all right colonel maybe youve got a point youd better believe i have summer said if we werent all on the ball for instance wed have confederate spies raising all kinds of trouble how do you know we dont moss asked there are ways the senior us officer spoke with assurance there are ways but they dont work unless everybodys on the ball have you got that yes sir moss said all right then monty summers nod seemed amiable enough i wont say anything more about it then a word to the wise you know he seemed to like other peoples distilled wisdom moss went on much as he had beforebut not quite hed never been a backslapping gladhander he never would be either but he did try to stop making his fellow captives actively dislike him they seemed willing enough to meet him halfway he started hearing more camp gossip which gave him something to chew on if nothing else nick cantarella sidled up to him one warm spring morning how you doing major he asked not too bad moss answered hows yourself ive been worse of course ive been better too this isnt exactly my favorite place cantarella said i wouldnt come here on vacation either moss said and cantarella laughed moss added the only people who like it here are the guards theyre too dumb not toand they get to carry guns but nobodys going to shoot back at them he was thinking of the officer hed routed cantarella laughed again even more appreciatively this time moss started to laugh too but swallowed the noise in a hurry captain cantarella was somehow involved in escape plansif there were any escape plans to be involved in as casually as moss could he asked what is your favorite place new york city cantarella replied at once with his accent that didnt surprise moss at all still casually the fighter pilot asked how soon do you expect to see it again cantarella didnt answer right away he scratched his cheek whiskers rasped against his fingernails he was a man who got five oclock shadow at half past one then he said well sir i hope i dont have to sit out the whole goddamn war here who doesnt moss agreed let me know if you have any other thoughts along those lines ill do that major cantarella said you can count on it off he went he gave the impression of still being very much in the war even though he was hundreds of miles behind the lines and on the wrong side of the barbed wire and machinegun towers moss looked after him how long did he intend to stay on the wrong side of the barbed wire will he take me with him when he goes that was the question that mattered most to moss hello general brigadier general irving morrell said walking up toward the frame house that held brigadier general abner dowlings headquarters hello general dowling replied good to see you again and its high time you had stars on your shoulders if anybody wants to know what i think thanks thanks very much morrell said they do make me think i havent wasted the past thirty years anyway i know what you mean dowling said and no doubt he did hed been in the army even longer than morrell had before trading his eagles for stars he went on how are you feeling sir ill do morrell answered his shoulder chose that moment to twinge he did his best not to show how much it hurt it would sting him if he tried to move it too farto move it as if he werent wounded in other wordsor sometimes for no reason at all certainly none he could find with a wry chuckle he continued one of the socalled advantages of my new exalted status is that they dont expect me to push back the confederates singlehanded dowling snorteda rude noise to come from a general you cant fool me ive known you too long first chance you get youre going to climb back into a barrel five minutes later youll stick your head out of the cupola because you cant see a damn thing through the periscopes who me morrell said as innocently as he could both men laughed dowling had him pegged all right morrell added i dont know that i like being so predictable hed thought dowling would go on laughing but the fat officer sobered instead you probably shouldnt be that predictable as a matter of fact if you are the confederates are liable to take another shot at you morrell grunted the other general might well be right morrell said its an honor i could do without i never minded getting shot at because i was a us soldier i minded getting shot that time in sonorait hurt like blazes and it left me flat on my back for a hell of a long time but it was one of those things that happen you know what i mean but if theyre shooting at me because im me thats assassination it isnt war theyre doing it dowling said i know they are morrell answered weve lost some good people because theyre doing it toolost them for good i mean not just had them wounded the way i was unofficiallyand you havent heard this from mewere doing it too dowling said that made morrell grunt again well i cant even tell you im very surprised he said at last its the only thing we can do pretty much if they hit us like that we have to hit back the same way or else they get an edge but ill be damned if i like it it makes this business even filthier than it has to be personally i agree with you youll find those who dont though dowling paused ruminating on that after a bit he went on when you were in ohio you met captain litvinoff didnt you the skinny fellow with the little mustache that looked like it was penciled on the poisongas specialist oh yes i met him he gave me the cold chills now it was morrells turn to pause he let out a long sorrowful sigh all right general you made your point over in richmond or wherever they keep them the confederates have men just like dear captain litvinoff dowling said morrell realized the other general liked the poisongas expert even less than he did he hadnt imagined such a thing was possible dowling went on now were finding assassins under flat rocks and things are liable to get worse before they get better how could they morrell asked in honest perplexity well i dont exactly know but i can tell you something i heard from somebody i believe dowling said im all ears morrell liked gossip no less than anyone else you ever hear of that german scientist named einstein you knowthe jew with the hair that looks like steel wool in a hurricane morrell nodded sure who hasnt heard of him hes the one they always make absentminded professor jokes about whats he got to do with the price of beer though hes a hell of a sharp man no matter how absentminded he is i never said he wasnt you dont get to be famous like that if you havent got a lot on the ball but what about him hes disappeared dowling said portentously not disappeared as in his apartment building got hit by a bomb while he was in the bathtub disappeared as in fallen off the map quite a few of the other highforehead fellows in germany and austriahungary have quietly dropped out of sight too theyre working on something morrell didnt phrase it as a question hed been in the army a long time he recognized the signs when a lot of people who did the same kind of work quietly dropped out of sight somethingprobably something bigwas going on behind the scenes he pointed a finger at dowling do you know what it is not me dowling said when i need to count past ten i take off my shoes he was sandbagging he was nobodys fool morrell paused one more time then he asked whatever the kaisers boys are working on are we working on it too dowling had started to light a smokea confederate brand no doubt captured or confiscated here in virginia he froze with the cigarette in his mouth and the match still unstruck in his hand you know general i asked my friend the very same question and what did he tell you he told me to mind my own goddamn business and get the hell out of his office dowling did light the cigarette then he took a long deep drag as if he wanted to escape the memory of his friends reply so you can take that any way you want to either we arent or we are and we dont want to talk about itreally dont want to you pays your money and you takes your choice you sound like that colored band that got away from the confederates morrell said they put them on the wireless enough dont they oh you might say so dowlings voice was dry yes you just might but propaganda is where you find it and isnt that the sad and sorry truth morrell looked west from culpeper the town where dowling presently made his headquarters the blue ridge mountains sawtoothed the horizon the mountains didnt worry morrell so much what the confederates might have lurking in them did is patton going to try to hit us from the flank again hes welcome to by god hell have even less fun than he did the last time abner dowling growled but things seem pretty quiet off to the west if what the spies say is true the enemys pulled some forces away from there where have they gone then morrell asked the immediately obvious questionnot only was it obvious it was important best guess is to attack our salient on the other side of the rapidan the wilderness morrell made a discontentedalmost a disgustednoise ive been down there ive looked it over you couldnt come up with worse country for barrels if you tried for a year what on earth possessed general macarthur to get a foothold there dowling considered before answering well general youll have to understand that he and i are not on the most intimate terms by the pained expression he bore that was an understatement my guess is only a guess then i suppose thats where we have the foothold because its the only place we could get one i see morrell saidtwo words that covered a lot of deeply regrets telegrams from the war department after a meditative pause of his own he added do you suppose that salient does us more good than it does the confederates i hope so dowling answered which wasnt quite what morrell had asked if we can ever get out of that nasty second growth the terrain gets better but the confederates know that as well as we do and they dont want to turn us loose how many casualties are we taking down there morrell asked they can hit us from three sides at once its bothersome dowling admitted which meant it was probably a lot worse than that what we need to do is get barrels over onto the other side of the rapidan in country where we can really use them im glad youre hereif anyone can arrange that youre the man thanks morrell said im just glad im anywhere right now as if to underscore that his shoulder twinged again ive been thinking about that particular problem myself and ive got a few ideas youll want to talk with a map in front of you dowling said proving hed done a good deal of planning in his time too he waved back toward the frame house shall we in a minute morrell said let me scrounge another one of those nice cigarettes off you if you dont mind not a bit dowling stuck another one in his mouth too really taste like tobacco dont they not like he paused searching for a simile morrell supplied one horseshit dowling laughed well now that you mention it yes he lit it his cheeks hollowed as he inhaled damn things are supposed to be hell on the wind you couldnt prove it by mei never had any wind to begin with he patted his belly as if it were an old friendand so no doubt it was i dont think theyve hurt mine much morrell said unlike dowling he was usually in good hard shape though his stay in the hospital had set him back he took another drag planes buzzed by overhead morrell automatically looked around for the closest trench and spotted one less than ten feet away he could jump into it in a hurry if they dove on him but they kept going they were us fighters heading south to strafe the confederates and shoot up cs dive bombers and whatever else they could find good luck boys he called to the pilots once he was sure they wouldnt come after him amen abner dowling agreed adding we could use the lord on our side considering what featherstons people are up to hed better be well yes morrell said but you know what they say about the lord helping people who help themselves wed better do some of that too or were in real trouble he almost wished dowling would have told him he was wrong but dowling didnt v second lieutenant thayer monroe wasnt even a bulge in his pappys pants when the great war ended he was just out of west point and so new an officer he squeaked he really did squeak he had a thin tenor voice that often didnt seem to have finished breaking he went tomatored whenever something he was saying came out especially shrill first sergeant chester martin hadnt expected anything different so he wasnt disappointed the recruiters back in california had as much as told him this was what hed be doing veteran noncoms held pipsqueak officers hands till the pipsqueaks either figured out what they were doing or got wounded or killed in the first case the blooded officers commonly won promotion in the second they left the platoon for less pleasant reasons either way the platoon got a new green co and the first sergeants job started all over again at the moment lieutenant monroes platoon sprawled on the ground under some oaks not far outside of falmouth virginia on the other side of the rappahannock the confederates held fredericksburg scuttlebutt said general macarthurs next try at dislodging the enemy from his defenses in front of richmond would go through the cs forces here what do you think sarge asked charlie baumgartner a corporal who led one of the squads in the platoon they gonna send us over the river beats me martin answered i hope to god they dont i dont like getting shot at any better than the next guy yeah well thats on account of youve got your head screwed on tight baumgartner said he was more than twenty years younger than chester but hed been in the army for a while some people he didnt go on he didnt need to either lieutenant monroe was telling anybody whod listen what a howling waste they were going to make out of fredericksburg and its confederate defenders since he outranked everyone close by people had to listen whether they believed him was liable to be a different story our bombardment will stun them it will paralyze them monroe burbled theyll never know what hit them well get over the river without the least little bit of trouble baumgartners grunt was redolent of skepticism so was chester martins hed seen lots of bombardments which thayer monroe plainly hadnt not even the fiercest one knocked an enemy out altogether as soon as the bombing and the shelling let up the survivors ran for their machine guns and popped up out of their holes with rifles in their hands the noncoms in the platoon all plainly knew as much but rank had its privileges no one told monroe to shut up chester thought about it he would have been more diplomatic than that if hed decided to do it in the end he kept quiet with the rest the young lieutenant was heartening new men who hadnt been through the mill yet that counted for something but when thayer monroe said we ought to be in richmond a week after we break through at fredericksburg chester cleared his throat for a wonder the lieutenant noticed you said something sergeant well no sir not exactly sir chester knew he had to be polite to the snotnose with the gold bar on each shoulder strap he wasnt convinced monroe deserved such courtesy but the military insisted on it only sir it might be better if you dont make promises we cant keep monroe stared at him failure had plainly never crossed the shavetails mind he said sergeant once we cross the river we will go forward he might have been propounding a law of nature he might have been but he wasnt chester knew it too well yes sir he said meaning no sir maybe monroe wasnt altogether an idiot he heard what martin wasnt saying stiffly he said when the order comes sergeant we will go forward oh yes sir martin agreedhe couldnt quarrel with that not without ending up in big trouble himself but he did want to persuade the lieutenant not to take on faith everything his superiors told him sir when you were at west point did you study the battles on the roanoke front sure monroe chuckled all twelve or fourteen of them or however many there were to him those fights were just things hed studied in school he could laugh about them chester couldnt his memories were too dark sir i was there for the first six or eighttill i got wounded i was lucky it was just a hometowner but before every attack they told us this would be the one that did the trick do you wonder that after a while we had trouble jumping up and down when they told us to go over the top i hope weve got better at what were doing since then by the way thayer monroe said it it was a forgone conclusion that the army had so do i by the way chester martin said it it was anything but the bombardment started on schedule regardless of martins opinion it didnt go on for days the way it would have during the great war the men in charge of the guns had learned something long bombardments did more to tell the enemy where the attack was going in than they did to smash him flat make him keep his head down then strike hardthat was the prevailing wisdom these days martin would have liked it better if they hadnt had to throw bridges across the rappahannock before they could cross he and the rest of the platoonthe rest of the regimentwaited by the river for the engineers to do their job martin liked and admired military engineers they were good at their specialized trade and when they had to they made pretty fair combat soldiers too they did their damnedest on the rappahannock but they never had a chance even though us artillery kept pounding fredericksburg confederate machine guns and mortars started pounding the engineers right back guns up in the hills behind the town guns that had stayed quiet so the us cannon wouldnt spot them and knock them out ahead of time added their weight of metal to the countershelling and they added more than metal the us engineers had to try to do strenuous work in gas masks us guns had thrown poison gas at fredericksburg along with everything else and the cs artillery replied in kind martin was wearing his mask well before the order went out to put them on hed seen mustard gas the last time around he hadnt seen what they called nerve agentsthose were new but he didnt want to make their acquaintance the hard way confederate mulesus soldiers more often called them asskickersswooped down on the bridges these days the gullwinged dive bombers werent the symbol of terror they had been when the war was new they were slow and ungainly us fighters hacked them out of the sky with ease when they ventured into airspace where the csa didnt have superiority but they still had a role to play they screamed down put bombs on three bridges and zoomed away at just above treetop level i hate those bastards but theyve got balls because of corporal baumgartners mask his voice sounded distant and otherworldly you want to know what i think i think we have to be nuts to try to cross here at all martin said baumgartner didnt argue with him he wished the other noncom would have us raiders in rubber boats tried crossing the rappahannock to quiet the mortar crews and machine gunners and riflemen on the other side despite smoke screens and heavy us fire a lot of the boats got sunk before they made it to the south bank of the river the raiders who managed to cross no doubt did their best but chester couldnt see that confederate fire diminished even a little about every half hour lieutenant monroe would say well get the order to cross any minute now men or it wont be long or be ready knowing how stubborn the high brass could be chester feared the platoon leader was right but kept hoping he was wrong the order never came towards evening the units that had been pushed forward drew back out of enemy artillery range martin wondered how many casualties theyd taken and how many theyd inflicted on the confederates he would have bet the first number was a lot bigger than the second one dont worry men thayer monroe said invincibly optimistic well get them soon even if we didnt get them today chester had never known a common soldier who worried about not going into battle no doubt such men existed you heard stories about them stories often prefaced there was this crazy bastard who but hed never run into one himself like other lower forms of life second lieutenants were too dumb to know better martin thought some more about telling this particular lieutenant to put a sock in it but refrained monroe had a job too he was supposed to make soldiers enthusiastic about going out there and getting maimed having led that company in the great war chester knew what a nasty job it could be at the moment he worried more about whether the regiment would get its field kitchens set up after all the marching and countermarching it had done he wasnt especially surprised when it didnt canned rations he told the men in his platoon thayer monroe had a different opinion about whose it was but what did second lieutenants know that shit again somebody said it wasnt the only grumble sullying the sweetness of the evening air canned rations ranged from boring to actively nasty the labels usually peeled off too so you didnt know ahead of time whether you were getting spaghetti and meatballstolerableor chicken with stewed prunesdisgusting as with men who liked combat there were a few who liked the chicken concoction and would trade for it but chester didnt think any were in his platoon charlie baumgartner plopped down beside him hows that gonna look in the newspapers sarge us army pulls back from fredericksburg does not cross he made the headline very convincing chester opened his can it was hashnot very good not very bad he dug in after the first mouthful he said they can print that if they want to i dont care as long as they dont say us army massacred at fredericksburg im not going to worry about it you got a good way of looking at things baumgartner said bettern some people i could namethats for damn sure hes nothing but a puppy martin said identifying one of those unnamed people without undue difficulty you know what a puppy is the corporal said he waited for chester to shake his head then answered the rhetorical question just a little son of a bitch ouch martin said to his own surprise he found himself defending lieutenant monroe hes not so bad he just needs experience he needs a good swift kick in the ass baumgartner said odds are hell get one lets just hope he lives through it chester said yeah baumgartner nodded lets hope we do too armstrong grimes didnt know where the mormons got all their machine guns he supposed the confederates had sneaked some to them and theyd taken others from us arsenals when they started their latest uprising or for all he knew maybe they had secret machine shops out in the desert somewhere and men with green eyeshades working lathes to turn out their own wherever the machine guns came from they had a hell of a lot of them the one in front of armstrong and his companions now was firing from the window of a house in orem utah us forces had finally managed to drive the mormons out of provo an enormous canning plant dominated orem the rebels were holed up inside the factory too but the americans were going to have to clear them out of the buildings in front of the place before they could even think about attacking it clearing them wouldnt be easy nothing that had to do with mormons ever was the machine gun spitting death in front of armstrong for instance hadnt just been set in that window as soon as it started up sergeant stowe called artillery fire in on it the guns had turned the house to rubble they hadnt bothered the machine gun or its crew one bit crouched in a hole that didnt feel nearly deep enough with bullets cracking past just overhead armstrong turned to yossel reisen and said bastards have that thing all sandbagged either that or theres a real cement bunker inside the place reisen answered wouldnt surprise me a bit me neither armstrong agreed with a sour sigh they were probably getting ready here while they were still fighting down in provo i bet youre right reisen said they both swore part of the automatic obscenity that made up the small change of any conversation between military men to armstrong the idea of preparing a position long before you fell back into it felt like cheating a runner scrambled into the hole with the two of them when the whistle blows pop up and start shooting at that machine gun as hard as you can he said and then climbed out to pass the word to the next few us soldiers whats going on armstrong called after him the runner didnt answer armstrong did some more swearing this time in earnest he didnt like orders he didnt understand especially when they were liable to get him killed like them or not he had them about fifteen minutes later an officers whistle shrilled he popped up and fired a shot then ducked down again to work the springfields bolt he felt like a jackinthebox after a while or maybe like a jackass but everybody else in front of the machine gun was doing the same thing so the mormons manning the piece didnt aim all their attentionto say nothing of all their fireat him ha yossel reisen spoke with a certain somber satisfaction i see whats going on yeah said armstrong who didnt what guy with a flamethrower sneaking up on that house reisen answered is that what it is armstrong said well no wonder were supposed to keep em busy then the only drawback to a flamethrower was that the fellow who used it had to get close to his target before opening upand had to get close while he was lugging a tank of jellied gasoline on his back armstrongs opinion was that the men who carried flamethrowers had to be nuts if say a tracer round hit that tank of fuel and one did just when armstrong was squeezing off a round the fireball made him blink oh fuck he said softly nobody would ever bury that soldier because there wouldnt be much left of him armstrong hoped it was over in a hurry hed got hardened to a lot of war but that was a nasty way to go the poor bastard hadnt had time to scream anyhow maybe his silence meant something after the flamethrower mans untimely demise firing at the mormon strongpoint eased off that made perfect sense as far as armstrong was concerned why take a chance on getting killed when you wouldnt accomplish anything doing it yossel reisen summed it up in four words so much for that yeah you said it armstrong sagged back down into the hole they shared you got a cigarette as reisen gave him one the enemy machine gun cut loose with a defiant burst to tell the world its crew was alive well and sassy that machinegun position had to go if us troops were to advance armstrong hoped a barrel would waddle up and blast the nest to kingdom come but barrels even the oldfashioned waddling kind were in short supply in utah these days a lot of them had gone up in flames in the housetohouse fighting in provo without them the soldiers still might have been stuck down there but none seemed to be close by right now what would you do if you were a general yossel reisen asked me find another line of work armstrong answered reisen laughed but waved to show hed really meant the question armstrong thought about it then said probably another guy with a flamethrower cheapest way there is to make those fuckers say uncle if we dont have a barrel ready and it doesnt look like we do he guessed wrong which didnt much surprise himhed never wanted to be a general the powers that be decided to try shelling the machinegun nest out of existence again as soon as armstrong heard the first couple of shells gurgle by overhead he knew they werent just counting on explosive power to do the job this time gas he shouted gas he jammed the mask over his head as fast as he could some of those shells were bound to fall short the artillery being what it was and even if they didnt the breeze what there was of it came from the north and would blow some of the poison back towards us lines a big stretch of the world disappeared with the pigsnouted mask over his face what was left he saw through two portholes of none too clean glass the air tasted of rubber he didnt feel as if he could get quite enough of it that was an illusion hed proved as much plenty of times but he did have to work harder to suck breaths through the activatedcharcoal filter cartridge so the illusion persisted sure as hell a couple of rounds were short which meant they came down among the soldiers stuck in front of the machine gun armstrong hoped they werent carrying what people called nerve agents that crap could kill you if it got on your skin everybody had rubberized coveralls nobody wanted to wear them they were unbearably hot with infinite caution armstrong stuck up his head the machinegun nest was catching hell no doubt about it with a little luck that officers whistle squealed again forward he shouted aw shit armstrong muttered they were going to find out if theyd got rid of the mormons all right armstrong thought of spraying flit all over an ants nest mormons stung even harder than red ants though they were harder to kill too the us soldiers ran toward the machinegun nest in little scuttles from one bit of cover to the next the gun that had held them up stayed silent some of them the green ones whooped and got a little less cautious figuring the rebel gunners were dead armstrong kept his belly on the dirt and the snout of his gas mask banging the ground he trusted mormons no farther than he could throw them they were as sneaky a bunch of bastards as you could imagine he tried not to show himself as he scooted up toward that battered house beside him yossel reisen took no chances either he snaked ahead he didnt walk he didnt even crawl he snaked on his belly pulling himself along with his elbows and their wariness and distrust paid off for the mormons inside the machinegun nest must have had masks and must have got them on in time the gunners waited till they found good targets then opened up with a savage burst that cut down half a dozen american soldiers after that the advance congealed everybody knew you couldnt charge a wellserved machinegun nest if armor or artillery didnt take it out infantry would just keep piling up corpses in front of it quite suddenly the mormon machine gunners ceased fire armstrong didnt even twitch he suspected another nasty trick then somebody behind him shouted flag of truce flag of truce coming forward that didnt make armstrong move either mormons sounded just like anybody else they looked just like anybody else too and they had no trouble getting greengray uniforms from dead or captured us soldiers they often pretended to be ordinary americans and they caused a lot of trouble when they did but a flag of truce was coming forward the us captain who carried it shouted to the men in the machinegun nest i have a message for your leaders he had trouble being as loud as he wanted through his mask but he managed come ahead the mormon who answered was also yelling through a gas mask we wont shoot as long as nobody in front of us tries moving forward agreed the captain said waving the white flag so the rebels could see who he was he picked his way through the wreckage towards and then past the machinegun nest other mormons emerged from concealment that didnt look big enough to hide a cat one of them blindfolded the us officer which struck armstrong as a sensible precaution then they led him north wonder what thats all about yossel reisen said are they flabbling so much about this one strongpoint they wouldnt call a truce just on account of it would they christ i hope not armstrong said wish i had a cigarette no matter how much he wished he did he didnt take off his mask and light up there was bound to be gas still floating in the air if he saw somebody else smoking and getting away with it hed try till then no he went on most of the damn mormons dont smoke makes em harder to spot he didnt stick his head up or expose himself unduly the rebels were good about honoring ceasefires but they werent perfectand theyd said they would open up if anybody on the american side got frisky after the truce had stretched for a couple of hours americans got up and stretched and began to move around the mormons let them when someone was dumb enough to start to go toward the machinegun nest the gunners fired a warning burst well over his head he got the message and drew back in a hurry a little before sunset the captain returned this time he waved the flag of truce so his own side wouldnt shoot him with him came a little old man in a somber black suit he looked like a grandfather who was having a tough day nimble as a mountain goat he followed the captain through the rubble of what had been orem what the hells going on here armstrong asked neither yossel reisen nor anybody else had a good answer for him what the hells going on here senator robert taft demanded he was a thoroughly reactionary democrat whod run against al smith in flora blackford didnt think along with him very often when they met together with the rest of the joint committee on the conduct of the war she didnt very often but she did now the chairman rapped loudly for order you were not recognized senator he said in tones of bureaucratic severity im very sorry mr chairman taft sounded anything but i must say that i have trouble recognizing what the present administration is up to bang the chairman rapped again you are out of order sir your remarks will be stricken from the record he pointed to flora congresswoman blackford thank you mr chairman flora said george norris smiled in relief like her the senator from nebraska was a socialist he judged she was likely to go easy on president la follette and his henchmen not today though she continued mr chairman i would also like to know what the hell is going on here several people exclaimed in surprise in the philadelphia meeting room thank you mrs blackford senator taft said in glad surprise senator norris looked as if hed stepped on a land mine i didnt do it for you senator i did it for me flora replied that made the chairman no happier shed hoped it wouldnorris was an old man and a party warhorsebut hadnt really expected it to turning to him she went on what is the administration doing by negotiating with the mormons what have they done that makes them deserve negotiation i couldnt have put that better myself taft said congresswoman i am not the right person to answer your question as i trust you are aware the chairman said certainly flora said that is why i move that we call the secretary of the interior to come before the committee and explain this extraordinary action second robert taft wasnt the only one to call out the word it came from half a dozen throats some were democrats some socialists here people were breaking party lines seeing as much senator norris looked even more pained than he had before with talks in progress i am not sure the secretary would respond to such a summons he replied i am not sure he should respond to such a summons there mr chairman i must respectfully disagree flora said the language of congress was marvelously polite anywhere else she would have said something like my god youre an idiot polite language or no the message came through norris turned a dull red flora went on if the secretary does not respond to an invitation to come before us i will move that we subpoena him we need to know why the administration thinks it can offer concessions to a group now rebelling against the us government not for the first not for the second but for the third time you will not need to look far to find a second for that motion either congresswoman senator taft said flora nodded back to him he was only half the man his father had been he was on the lean side where william howard taft had been as round as the golf balls hed loved to whack william howard taft had also had the fat mans gift of being or at least seeming goodnatured most of the time his son was far more acerbicwhich had probably helped him lose the last election george norris coughed you do realize that publicizing disagreements over policy may give aid and comfort to the confederate states oh no you dont flora said sharply im sorry sir but no one is going to get away with that you cant say im not a proper patriot if i dont agree with everything this administration does thats jake featherstons way of doing things and hes welcome to it why have we got a joint committee on the conduct of the war if we cant ask questions that have to do with the way were conducting the war several senators and representatives clapped their hands the chairman licked his papery lips he spoke carefully we are at war with the confederate states congresswoman and with the empire of mexico and with britain france japan and russia we are not at war with the state of utah flora curtsied thank you for informing me of that mr chairman you might do better to inform the state of utah which seems unaware of the fact she got a laugh loud enough to make norris ply his gavel with might and main she continued by all precedent it is a war congress established a joint committee on the conduct of the war during the war of secession long before we had to recognize the csa as an independent nation will you tell me im wrong sir by his expression george norris would have liked nothing better but knew he couldnt call the question on the motion someone yelled looking even more unhappy the chairman did it passed with only a couple of dissenting votes when flora walked into to her office her secretary said mr roosevelt called a little while ago congresswoman hed like you to call him back thanks bertha ill bet he would flora said how angry would the assistant secretary of war be only one way to find out she went into the inner office and made the call this is franklin roosevelt as always his voice conceded nothing to the illness that left him in a wheelchair when flora gave her name roosevelt started to laugh youve been naughty today havent you he said i dont think so i think the administration has flora said talking with the mormons its madness is it president la follette doesnt think so neither do i roosevelt said if he did you would too flora thought but a lot of politics worked that way roosevelt went on dont you think the confederate states would be better off if jake featherston tried talking with his colored rebels instead of doing his best to put them all six feet under i dont want the confederate states better off flora said roosevelts laugh invited everyone who heard it to share the joke you cant duck me like that and expect me not to quack he said youre too smart not to know what im talking about we can talk to the mormons till were blue in the face flora said what good will it do if they dont want to listen thats what ferdinand koenig would say all right roosevelt was being as exasperating as he could what can we possibly give the mormons that would satisfy them and us flora asked i dont know roosevelt admitted but the president thinks we ought to find out and not go on till everyone who could fight us is dead pointedly he added and he thinks his own party ought to back him while hes doing it i will happily back the president when i think hes right or even when im not surei havent said a word about whatever is going on in western washington and i dont intend to flora said but when i think hes wrong im sorry franklin but party loyalty doesnt go that far a lot of people thought it did presidents were usually of that opinion roosevelt just sighed i might have known youd say that as a matter of fact i did know youd say that it doesnt make things any easier for me you know im the one whos in charge of keeping you from running wild flora translated mentally tell me what sort of terms were offering the mormons then maybe ill change my mind and believe this is worth doing she said not my bailiwick roosevelt told her but id hope youd trust charlie la follette far enough to believe he wouldnt make terms that are bad for the country i trusted al smith not to make a deal that was bad for the country flora said look how that turned out good god she thought i sound just like my reactionary brother david but that didnt mean she thought she was wrong now however much she wished it did low blow franklin roosevelt said is it well see what the secretary of the interior has to say flora answered some people are disappointed in the stand youre taking though roosevelt couldnt see her flora shrugged they can put up another socialist candidate when my district nominates this summer or they can back the democrat against me this fall no one would do anything like that roosevelt said hastily flora also knew nobody would do anything like that shed represented her district for most of the past twentysix years and she was a presidents widow theyd need better reasons than this to oppose her treason say a few days later the secretary of the interior did appear before the joint committee on the conduct of the war harry hopkins came from iowa and still spoke with a flat midwestern accent but hed gone to new york as a young lawyer hed got to know al smith there and had risen with him now he had to defend the policies of another president what terms has the administration offered the mormon insurgents in utah senator norris asked the question reluctantly he knew the other members would be sharper than he if he faltered no more than a return to the status quo ante bellum if they lay down their arms hopkins answered if they want peace we will give them peace no treason trials no persecutions but that is absolutely as far as we will go demands for autonomy and independence for the socalled state of deseret have been and will continue to be rejected out of hand and what is the response of the mormon representative to this proposal the chairman asked uhwhat is the gentlemans name he plainly wanted to call the mormon representative something else something less polite but refrained rush hyrum rush hopkins spelled the mormons first name having done so he let out a resigned sigh mr rush does not feel our proposal goes far enough and fears it leaves his people vulnerable to further us aggression those are his words not mine flora raised her hand with a certain amount of trepidation norris recognized her she said mr hopkins why does mr rush think utah would be any safer as an independent country surrounded by the united states than as one state among many this makes little sense to me he said you gave kentucky and houston and sequoyah plebiscites but you wouldnt give us one you thought we were a bunch of perverts and we didnt deserve one hopkins replied hyrum rush wasnt so far wrong flora said dont you think we ought to get rid of an abscess like that instead of putting a bandage on it normally congresswoman id say yes right now weve got bigger things to worry about than an abscess flora winced with the country cut in half she couldnt very well disagree with the secretary of the interior the rebels show no sign of agreeing to these terms she asked thats correct maam harry hopkins said good flora thought but she kept it to herself she nodded to the chairman no further questions brigadier general abner dowling studied confederate dispositions on a large map pinned to a wall of the house in culpeper he used as a headquarters if the us army ever moved deeper into virginia the houses owner would get it back and would probably be unhappy about the holes in his plaster dowling whose own disposition was none too good intended to miss not a moment of sleep worrying about that he called captain toricelli in to look at the latest dispositions his adjutant was a sharp young officer tell me what you make of this dowling said as neutrally as he could he left it there he wanted to see if the junior officer noticed the same thing he hadand if it was truly there to notice angelo toricelli eyed the map with unusual care he knew dowling wouldnt have asked him for no reason after a thoughtful pause he said they really are thinning out their positions a bit arent they it looks that way to me dowling answered its got to the point where we cant ignore it hasnt it his adjutant nodded id say so but the bastards in butternut dont want us to spot it just by the way theyre doing it id bet money on that does seem so doesnt it dowling said and why not for fear well pour through they arent weakening themselves that much where are those men going toricelli asked if i knew i would tell you dowling scratched his head his hair was thinningone more indignity of age he sighed we ought to send out raiders bring back some prisoners they may know where their pals are headed it doesnt seem to be down toward the wilderness that was what i guessed when i conferred with general morrell if it turns out to be over toward fredericksburg instead well have to alert general macarthur assuming such a thing is possible eryes sir captain toricelli said these days dowling didnt bother hiding his scorn for his superior macarthur didnt like him either and manifested it by withholding men and materiel from his corps that was how things looked to dowlings jaundiced eye anyhow draft the orders dowling said send them by runner not by telegraph or telephone or wireless not even in code i dont want the confederates getting wind of what were up to and priming some men to lie like ananias maybe he had what the smart alienists these days were calling a persecution complex he didnt intend to worry about it an army officer who didnt worry that the enemy was out to diddle him didnt deserve his shoulder straps and toricelli didnt think his orders were anything out of the ordinaryor if he did he had the sense to keep his mouth shut about it ill have them on your desk in twenty minutes sir he promised that sounds good dowling said as if further to disguise whatever they were up to the confederates in front of dowlings corps suddenly turned aggressivenot in any big way but with lots of raids and artillery barrages and all the other things that made it look as if a major offensive might be brewing several regimental commanders sent panicky messages back to culpeper one thing dowling was good at was not getting excited at every little thing had he got excited at every little thing while serving under general custer he would have jumped out a window early in his career he managed to calm down his subordinates too had he been wrong had the confederates been planning a big push he might have ended up with egg on his face for calming them down too well but no big push came in due course the interrogation reports did dowlings eyebrows rose toward his retreating hairline when he read them he looked up to captain toricelli whod given him the transcripts the questioners think this is reliable and accurate he asked yes sir i talked to one of them theyre pretty certain toricelli replied all right well relay it to general macarthurs headquarters and well also relay it to the war department dowling said in code mind you oh yes sir his adjutant agreed this is too hot to go out in clear for once he showed none of the quiet scorn with which adjutants often greeted their superiors ideas i hope my notions arent as bad as a lot of custers were dowling thought and yet one of custers ideasas foolish at first sight and as stubbornly maintained as any of the othershad gone a long way toward winning the great war you never could tell a few hours later dowlings telephone jangled he picked it up first corps headquarters dowling speaking hello sir this is john abell the general staff officer didnt give his rank or affiliation that was no doubt wise a lot of telephone wire lay between philadelphia and culpeper if the confederates werent tapping it somewhere dowling would have been amazed abell went on you have confidence in the information you sent us would i have sent it if i didnt dowling returned youd be amazed abell said and that was probably true he continued we still have to confirm it at the other end i dont know anything about that dowling said but i do know what ive seen and i knowor i think i knowi wasnt imagining it you werent not if these reports are even close to accurate abell said have you heard anything from general macarthur yet no not a word dowling said the general staff officer sniffed disdainfully why am i not surprised ive alerted him to the possibility thats all i can do dowling said thats all i want to do he added to himself if i could have found any way to keep from doing even that much i would have grabbed it like you wouldnt believe i hope something good comes of it abells tone suggested he didnt think that was likely so long sir take care of yourself he hung up so did dowling muttering to himself daniel macarthur didnt want to talk to him any more than he wanted to talk to macarthur so he thought anyhow but when the telephone rang again and he picked it up what he heard was an abrupt rasp this is macarthur yes sir dowling unconsciously came to attention in his chair what can i do for you sir its really true that the confederates are draining men away from this entire front macarthur demanded sir thats the way it looks from here dowling didnt intend to commit himself any further than that assert that something was really true and it was only too likely to come back and haunt you what he did say seemed to satisfy macarthur in that case im going to take one of the divisions out of your corps and bring it east what the word burst from dowlings throat as a pained yelp what do you want to do that for we mounted an attack at fredericksburg that could have succeededthat should have succeeded in fact macarthur answered i intend to send more men in this timesend them in and have them break through from everything dowling had heard the attack on fredericksburg hadnt come anywhere near as close to succeeding as macarthur claimed from everything dowling had heard us forces hadnt even got over the rappahannock and into fredericksburg itself would throwing in more men help dowling didnt know custer had always liked to smother fires by burying them in bodies hed had his share of bloody fiascoes but hed also finally had his breakthrough maybe daniel macarthur would too maybe one thing was certain if macarthur wanted one of dowlings divisions he had the right to take it dowling did what he could saying well be spread thin here if you do shift it east so are the confederates youre facing you found that out yourself since they are why worry it seems to me that you spend too much time carping and complaining and not enough figuring out how to strike the foe it seemed to dowling that macarthur spent too much time figuring out stupid ways to strike the foe he didnt say so what point to it hed just get macarthur angry at him again he wouldnt change his superiors mind no one except macarthur could do that and he wasnt in the habit of doing so suppressing a sigh dowling said sir ill do my best with whatever men you leave me you can rely on that there you see daniel macarthur actually sounded pleased you can be cooperative when you set your mind to it by be cooperative he meant do exactly what i tell you without asking any inconvenient questions no matter what dowling knew that only too well again though what could he do about it not much as he knew all too well he tried his best to keep resignation out of his voice as he answered yes sir good macarthur said dowling wondered if it was macarthur went on youll have your orders soon thin their lines against me will they i am going to bury those confederatesbury them i tell you theres no doubt in my mind yes sir dowling said maybe he would but how many us soldiers would they bury too no way to know not till it happened dowling had long since abandoned optimism along with the other illusions of his youth he had thought before that macarthur had more in common with george custer than either of the two generals would ever have admitted a complete lack of doubt and a strong belief in their own brilliance running neck and neck as if to underscore that macarthur said see you in richmond then and slammed down the telephone dowling slowly replaced his own handset in its cradle see you in richmond macarthur would either make good on the boast or an awful lot of young men would die trying dowling knew which way he would bet he couldnt say anything about that not to anybody not without being accused of deliberately damaging morale he couldnt even get on the telephone to philadelphia the way he had when macarthur proposed the amphibious operation aimed at the mouth of the james that had been madness this might work dowling didnt think it would but he had to give his superior the benefit of the doubt he said something filthy however much hed longed for combat posts hed spent much of his career either as custers adjutant or on occupation duty in utahhis main job there in fact had been to keep that from turning into a combat post and hed done it now he had what hed always wanted he had it and he hadnt covered himself with glory in it maybe he wasnt cut out to be a hero or maybe he should have been more careful about what he wished for lest he get it jake featherston peered down from maryes heights over the town of fredericksburg toward the rappahannock and the damnyankees on the other side he turned to nathan bedford forrest iii who stood by his side i was right about here when the last war ended the president of the csa said yes sir replied the chief of the confederate general staff whod been too young to fight in the great war well i was goddammit featherston said when the order to cease fire came i waited till the very last minute then i took the breech block out of my piece and chucked it in that creek over yonder he pointed i was damned if the united states were gonna get anything they could use from me yes sir forrest repeated adding that sounds like you good it ought to jake said more than a little smugly maybe what pissed me off most about having to quit though was that i could have killed every damnyankee in the world from right here if the bastards kept coming at me and my ammo held out its a good position forrest allowed not as good as it would have been in the great warartillerys better now than it was then and barrels and bombers are a hell of a lot better but its still mighty good i know it is jake said thats how come i was more than half disappointed we didnt let the enemy get into fredericksburg and then try to storm these heights wed have been shooting em till they got sick of trying nathan bedford forrest iii frowned conventional wisdom says you dont want to let them have a bridgehead if you can help it you can get around conventional wisdom a lot of the time but not always that foothold theyve got south of the rapidan in the wilderness still worries me one of the reasons forrest headed the general staff was that he wasnt afraid to speak his mind even to the president of the confederate states jake asked are you telling me they might break through if they cross the river here we couldnt hold em and drive em back forrest scratched his mustache with his right thumb odds are we could but its not a sure thing remember sir they kept fighting after we thought they wouldnt after you thought they wouldnt he meant featherston couldnt even swear at him not when he wasnt wrong because forrest spoke his mind jake handled him more carefully than he would have dealt with some party yesman whats your judgment then general if you reckon the risk is too high we wont take it but if you dont this looks like a dandy place to bleed the damnyankees white if everything goes well sir we ought to be able to do that forrest said at last if things go wrong though if things go wrong weve given ourselves a lot of trouble that we didnt have to and remember mr presidentwell need more men here to bleed the yankees than we would if we just kept em on the north bank of the rappahannock those are men we wouldnt be able to use for other operations the one thing the yankees always have is more men than we do so which is more important to you featherston smiled he almost laughed out loud hed put the burden on forrests shoulders and the chief of the general staff had put it right back on his and forrests question was a serious one jake hated nothing worse than being deflected from any purpose of hisindeed hed made a hallmark of being impossible to deflect here though nathan bedford forrest iii was speaking plain good sense much too plain to ignore all right dammit jake said grudgingly hold em on the other side of the rappahannock if you can he didnt fail to note how relieved forrest looked well do that sir or well do our best to do it anyhow the general said if they try to force another crossing they may get over whether we want them to or not in that case well do our best to give you the killing ground you have in mind hes trying to let me down easy again jake almost laughed he said all right thats how well do it then make your orders out that way and make sure the other thing coalscuttle is going forward the way its supposed to i want to make the united states feel the pinch goddammit things are moving into place on that one mr president forrest said keeping a smaller presence here will help that too i dont think youd find anyone whod disagree there all right all right you made your point no jake didnt like being balked it didnt happen very often not when he was both president of the confederate states and head of the freedom party hed thought he knew just how al smiths mind worked but then the son of a bitch decided to go on with the war and now this mr president we simply arent big enough to do two big things at once forrest said thats a nuisance but its the truth if we try to pretend we are well end up in trouble if you try to teach your grandma how to suck eggs youll end up in trouble jake said nathan bedford forrest iii chuckled though jake hadnt been joking the president went on lets get back to richmond then he all but spat out the words hed wanted to take off his shirt and serve a gun the way he had in the great war things were simple then with the enemy right in front of you you went ahead and blew him up you didnt need to worry about anything else these days enemies were everywhere not just the damnyankees not just the niggers who tormented the csa but fools and bunglers who wouldnt go along and traitors who wanted to see him fail just because that would mean they were right and he was wrong ill settle them allevery last one of them jake thought by the time im through this country will look the way its supposed to the way i want it to as usual he went back to richmond in an ambulance if us airplanes appeared overhead the red crosses on the vehicle ought to keep the yankees from shooting it up also as usual he had an ordinaryalthough armoredmotorcar take him the last leg of the journey so no yankee reconnaissance aircraft or spies on the ground would spot an ambulance going into the gray house bomb craters turned the grounds around the presidential residence into a lunar landscape and repairmen swarmed over the building itself jesus jake exclaimed how come nobody told me it got hit again probably didnt want to get you all upset sir his driver answered probably didnt want to make you blow a gasket that meant the driver was probably right too jake had succeeded in making people afraid of him men who would tell him what they thought men like nathan bedford forrest iii and clarence potter were rare the rest said what they thought he wanted to heareither that or they hunkered down and didnt tell him anything that last looked to be what had happened here is lulu all right he demanded when he got inside if his secretary wasnt and theyd kept that from him theyd be sorry and pretty damn quick too but the flunky hed asked nodded she sure is mr president just about everybody got down to the shelter before the bombs started falling well thats good anyway featherston said the bomb shelter below the gray house was as elaborate as the one under the confederate war department no doubt the shelter under powel house in philadelphia was just as fancy but it hadnt done al smith one damn bit of good jake preferred not to dwell on that when he got to his office lulu greeted him with a nod hello mr president she said as calmly as if nothing had happened while he was away hello sweetie he said and gave her a hug she was one of the tiny handful of people he cared about as people and not as things to order around or otherwise manipulate if hed lost her he didnt know what he would have done her sallow cheeks turned pink you worry about running the country sir she said you dont need to worry about me in such things she could give him orders or thought she could ill worry about whatever i darn well want to he said he swore like the old soldier he was around everyone else but tried not to around her her disapproving sniffs were too much for him to take he went on can i still work at my desk or did it get blown to uh smithereens im afraid it did sir lulu answered but everything down below came through just fine jake made a discontented noise down deep in his throat he didnt want to run the war from down in the bomb shelter even if its air conditioning made it a comfortable place in the hot weather that lay ahead it felt like being cooped up inside a submarine actually jake had never been inside a sub so he couldnt prove that but it felt like what he thought being cooped up in one would feel like and what he wanted to do wasnt always the same as what he needed to do the shelter bristled with telephone and wireless links he could run the war from it if he didnt like itwell too bad this was war and people all over the continent were putting up with things they didnt like a young man in a state department uniform came up to him waited to be noticed and then said sir may i speak to you for a moment youre doing it jake told him eryes for some reason that flustered the state department fellow he needed a moment to gather himself then he said sir weve heard from the emperor of mexico his majesty will provide the three divisions you requested good thats good featherston tried to make his smile benign instead of tigerish maximilian hadnt wanted to cough up the men jake had been blunt about what would happen to his miserable gimcrack countryand to himif he didnt evidently the message had got through the president went on weve saved the greasers bacon a few times only fitting and proper they pay us back yes sir the state department man said he looked as if he would have been more comfortable in striped trousers and cutaway coat too damn bad for him anything else sonny jake asked the puppy shook his head featherston jerked a thumb toward the front door which hadnt been damaged all right then get lost the kid from the state department disappeared jake stared after him either they really were making them younger than they had once upon a time or he himself was starting to get some serious mileage on him he suspected the problem did not lie with the state department whether he was getting old or not he still had a war to run he could do that better than anybody else in the csa better than anybody else in the usa too by god he thought and those three mexican divisions would help especially since now that maximilian had agreed once hed have a harder time saying no if jake asked again and jake intended to do just that dr leonard odoull wondered what was going on when he and his aid station got pulled out of their position across the rapidan from the wilderness and shifted east now he knew theyd left the frying pan and gone straight into the fire most of the frying was getting done on the other side of the rappahannock in and just beyond fredericksburg the us army had battered out a foothold there as it had in the wilderness it was trying to feed in enough men and machines to make the foothold mean something whether it could was very much up in the air whether the kid on the table in front of odoull would make it was also up in the air a piece of shrapnel had torn the hell out of his chest he was bleeding faster than odoull could patch him keep pouring in the plasma odoull barked to granville mcdougald gotta keep his blood pressure up pretty soon there wont be any blood in the pressure mcdougald said that exaggerated but not by much an awful lot of blood had come out and an awful lot of plasma had gone in shit mcdougald exclaimed we havent got any pressure now yeah odoull had no trouble figuring out why eitherthe kids heart had stopped he grabbed it and started cardiac massage once in a blue moon that worked most of the time a heart that stopped would never start again this was one of those times after a few minutes he let it go and shook his head weve lost him mcdougald nodded afraid youre right that was a nasty wound we did everything we could he beckoned to a corpsman get him off the table eddie hes graves registrations business now right granny eddie said one more deeply regrets telegram one more time when everybody hopes the western union delivery boy stops next door the corpse was hardly out of the tent before a groaning sergeant with a shattered knee came in on a stretcher granny you do this one and ill pass gas odoull said youre neater at orthopedic stuff than i am ive had more practice doc thats all but mcdougald sounded pleased he wasnt an md despite his vast experience to have a real doctor defer to him had to make him feel good gas the sergeant said when odoull pressed the ether cone down over his nose and mouth odoull had seen that before he and eddie kept the wounded man from yanking off the cone till the anesthetic took hold eddie shook his head as the sergeants hands finally went limp thats always so much fun he said yeah odoull agreed hows he look granny its a mess in there kneecaps smashed medial collaterals cut mcdougald answered can you get him down a little deeper i want those leg muscles as relaxed as i can get em will do odoull opened the valve on the ether cylinder a little more after a minute or so mcdougald gave him a thumbsup the medic worked quickly and skillfully repairing what he could and removing what he couldnt repair when he was through he said hell never run the mile but i think hell walk pretty well looked that way to me too odoull said that medial collateral was nicely done i dont think i could have got it together anywhere near as neat as you did thanks doc mcdougalds gauze mask hid most of his smile but his eyes glowed had to try it a knees not a knee without a working medial collateral its not a repair that would do for a halfback but for just getting around it ought to be strong enough they play football in quebec too well sort of football theyve got twelve men on a side and the end zones are big as all outdoors but its pretty much the same game guys get hurt the same way thats for sure odoull said ive had to patch up a couple of wrecked knees i told the men id come after em with a sledgehammer if i ever caught em playing again did they listen to you mcdougald asked amused interest in his voice are you serious quebecois are the stubbornest people on the face of the earth leonard odoull knew he sounded disgusted repairing a knee once isnt easy repairing it twice is damn near impossible he flexed his none too impressive biceps im getting pretty good with a sledgehammer though i believe that mcdougald and eddie eased the wounded sergeant off the table he would finish recovering farther back of the line mcdougald caught odoulls eye want to duck out for a butt before the next poor sorry bastard comes in doc id love to lets but odoull stopped in midsentence because the next poor sorry bastard came in right then one look made odoull wonder why the hell the corpsmen had bothered hauling him all the way back here he had a bullet woundpretty plainly an entry woundin his forehead just below the hairline and what was as obviously an exit wound horrible with scalp and blood in back seeing odoulls expression one of the stretcherbearers said his pulse and breathing are still strong doc maybe you can do something for him anyways fat chance odoull muttered military hospitals still held men whod got turned into vegetables by head wounds in the great war some of them had a strong pulse and breathed on their own too some of them would die of old age but none would ever be a functioning human being again then the wounded man sat up on the stretcher and said have any aspirins buddy ive got a hell of a headache jesus christ everybody in the aid tent except the fellow with the head wound said the same thing at the same time one of the bearers and eddie and odoull crossed themselves odoull had seen a lot of things in his time but never a man with a throughandthrough head wound who sat up and made conversation granville mcdougald strode forward he bent low and looked not at the soldiers injuries but at the scalp between them then he shook his head in slow wonder i will be damned he said ive heard of wounds like this but i didnt think id ever run into one myself what is it granny odoull asked he wanted to latch on to something anything but the idea of a dead man talking look doc you can see for yourself mcdougalds finger traced the injury the slug must have gone in then slid around the top of this guys skull under the scalp till it exited back here it didnt do a damn thing more it couldnt have or hed be dead as shoe leather im fine the soldier said except for that headache anyhow i asked you guys for aspirins once already well ill be a son of a bitch odoull said ignoring him youre right youve got to be right that is the luckiest thing i have ever seen in my life i thought he was a ghost for a second i swear to god i did the rational part of his brain started working again wed better send him back for xrays once we clean him up he could have a fracture in therethough his heads so hard he might not what the hells that supposed to mean the wounded man demanded if you didnt have a thick skull pal that bullet mightve gone through instead of around odoull told him can you get up on the table by yourself were going to want to get some disinfectant on that and stitch you up and bandage you youve got a story you can tell your grandchildren thats for sure the soldier walked to the table and sat down you aint doin nothin to me till i get my aspirins you hear give him a couple eddie odoull said wearily hell give him a slug of the medicinal brandy too if anybody ever earned it he did that produced the first thing besides loud indignation hed got from the wounded man who exclaimed now youre talkin doc want a smoke i got these off a dead confederatefuck of a lot bettern what we make odoull grabbed his hand before he could light a match you dont want to do that in here the doctor said in gentle tones that camouflaged the panic inside youre liable to blow us sky high if you do after the little white pills and the knock of honeycolored hooch the wounded man was willing to sit still while odoull patched him up he grumbled about the way the doctors novocaine burned before it numbed he grumbled that he could feel the needle even after the novocaine started working except for complaining about his headache he didnt grumble at all about getting shot in the head dont get the bandages over my eyes dammit he said odoull had to coax him back into the stretcher so the corpsmen could take him awayhe wanted to walk once he was gone odoull let out a long sigh and said now i am going to have that smoke by god me too granville mcdougald said they both left the tent to light upand they both smoked confederate tobacco too odoull blew out a long plume of smoke great god in the foothills he said now i really have seen everything yeah well you know whats gonna happen as well as i do doc mcdougald said theyll patch him up and theyll send him home till he finishes healing and hell be a nine days wonder while hes there and then hell come back to the front and hell stop a shell burst with his nuts and he wont have to worry about telling his grandchildren stories anymore christ whatever odoull had expected him to say that wasnt it and i thought this war was making me cynical mcdougald shrugged you got out after you found yourself a nice little french gal and you settled down ive worn the uniform all that time ive got a long head start on you the shit ive seen he shook his head but then he shook it again in a different way id never seen anything like that before though talk about beating the odds id heard of it i knew it was possible but id never seen it and i never thought i would you sure were one up on me odoull said when he rose up on the stretcher there i figured he was lazarus gave me a turn too and i wont try to tell you any different mcdougald took a last drag on his cigarette and crushed it out under his boot well at least we can feel good about things for a while lazarus is going to get better some of the ones like that help make up for the sorry bastards we lose on the other side of the rappahannock confederate guns started pounding asskickers screamed down out of the sky bombs burst odoull stamped out his cigarette too theyll be bringing more back to us before very long he predicted either that or theyll move us forward up into fredericksburg gotta keep us close to the source of supply mcdougald said the source of supply odoull echoed right that was cynical too which didnt mean it was wrong vi snyder texas was a long way north of baroyeca sonora it could get just as hot though hipolito rodriguez didnt know how or why that was so but he knew it was hed seen as much in the summertime in texas during the great war it wasnt summer yet but the hot weather had arrived ahead of the season down in baroyeca hed have worn a broadbrimmed straw sombrero a loosefitting cotton shirt baggy trousers and sandals he would have been a lot more comfortable than he was in his gray guard uniform too the cap he had on didnt keep the sun off him nearly well enough and he especially hated his shiny black boots he didnt think he would ever get used to them they pinched his feet at every step he took nothing he could do about it though guards had to stay in uniform that was one of the rules and nobody who didnt stick to the rules had any business being a guard along with the rest of his squad he stood by the train tracks that ran between camp determination and the new womens camp alongside it officially the womens camp was part of camp determination brigade leader pinkardrodriguezs old war buddywas in charge of it too unofficially the guards called the womens half camp undecided despite being married to a thoroughly decisive woman rodriguez thought that was pretty funny all the guards carried submachine guns towermounted machine guns also bore on the disembarking point prisoners who tried anything cute ended up dead in a hurry the overwhelming firepower on display helped persuade incoming negroes that acting up wasnt smart a big swagbellied alabaman named jerry pointed east down the track look at the smoke he said another load of niggers coming in the sergeant in charge of the squad said well what the hell would we be cookin our brains for out here if there wasnt another goddamn train comin in tom porter like the men he led was a freedom party guard so his formal rank was troop leader not sergeant but he wore three stripes on the sleeve of his gray tunic and he acted like every senior noncom rodriguez had ever known up in the towers the machine guns swung toward the train when it was still a good half a mile off a couple of the men in rodriguezs squad hefted their weapons other guards along the track also grew alert dog handlers patted their coon hounds the dogs were called that because they were most often used to hunt raccoons the men who used them here had a different sort of fun with the name wheezing and groaning the train slowed and then stopped the locomotive had to date back to the turn of the century if not further even in sleepy sonora it would have been an antique more modern machines served closer to the front this one would do for hauling mallates the passenger cars and freight cars it pulled had also seen better decades again they were good enough for this the passengers cars had shutters hastily nailed up outside their windows that kept the blacks inside from looking out and people outside from looking in all the cars were locked from the outside tom porter pointed to the two closest to his squad well take em one at a time he said the front one first as he set his beefy hands on the latch he added be ready for anything niggers comin out theyre liable to be a little crazy or more than a little when he opened the door the first thing that rolled out was a ripe rich stench shit and piss and puke and stale sour sweat rodriguez wrinkled his nose far too many people had been packed inside that passenger car for much too long they came spilling out now a jumble of misery blinking and shading their eyes against the sudden harsh sunlight if you got the jump on them early they usually didnt get it back move porter screamed and the other guards echoed him men to the left women and pickaninnies to the right move god damn you they movedthe ones who could some just collapsed by the railroad car kicks and punches drove most of those to their feet the rest were too far gone for even brutality to rouse water one of them croaked in a dustchoked voice i gots to have water aint had no water since i dunno when rodriguez kicked himnot hard enough to cripple just hard enough to make sure the mallate knew who was boss get up he yelled no water here water inside the camp slowly the negro struggled upright and stood swaying a plump black woman said deys dead folks inside de car dere poor souls there usually were casualties on a journey like this the cars carried six or seven times as many people as they were designed to hold food was whatever the negroes managed to smuggle aboard the train the windows wouldnt open and the shutters would have kept out most of the air if they had and all things considered this carload of blacks had it easy they could have come to camp determination in a cattle car the way a lot of negroes in this train had nobody bothered cleaning cattle cars very well before loading people into them they had no windows shuttered or otherwise they had no toilets either only a honey bucket or two and they were so jammed with men women and children that getting to a honey bucket would have taken a small miracle a striking young woman with a dancers walk and high cheekbones that argued for an indian grandparent sidled up to rodriguez you keep me safe in here i do anything you want she purred in a bedroom voice anything at all my names thais you look for me im real friendly go on get moving he said stonily and her face fell like most of the guards he heard something like what shed said at least once whenever a train came in women thought it would help sometimes they were even right not here not now form lines bring your luggage form lines bring your luggage like every squad leader tom porter yelled the same thing over and over you gotta be searched you gotta be deloused you gotta be searched you gotta be deloused the searchers would take away all the weapons and all the valuables they found that stuff was supposed to go back into the war effort some of it maybe even most of it did the rest stuck to the searchers fingers searchers were senior men theyd paid their dues and now they were getting their reward some of them were getting to be wealthy men slowly the lines formed even more slowly they moved forward men and women too weak to rise in spite of calculated brutality lay by the railroad cars get the stretcher parties out an officer shouted well move them to the transfer facility none of the guards laughed or winked or nudged one another theyd got lessons about that never do anything to spook the spooks one trainer had put it the transfer facility was a killing truck the only place theyd be transferred was the mass grave not far away all the prisoners in camp determination were heading that way the ones too weak to rise got an express ticketthat was the only difference black men carried away the weaklings the story the bearers got was that the trucks would take them to an infirmary a couple of miles away the infirmary existed every once in a while a negro came back from it that kept the inmates from flabbling about what happened to the ones who didnt more guards with submachine guns kept an eye on the stretcher bearers but guards kept an eye on everybody all the time so that didnt seem out of the ordinary guards went through the cars to bring out the dead the dying and anybody who thought hed get sneaky and try to hide it was nasty work but they couldnt trust it to the stretcher bearers who were too soft on their own kind some of the dead ones had money or jewelry worth lifting you never could tell shouts farther down the train said another squad had caught a lurker more shoutsthese of painsaid he was getting what was coming to him the guards would beat him to within an inch of his life then hed get thrown on the first available truck to the transfer facilityand that would take care of the last inch theyre such damn fools said a guard heaving bodies out of the car with rodriguez they think were not gonna check the fuckin cars gotta be dumb as rocks if they do thats right rodriguez said damn straight it is the other guard said buchanan thornton was his namehe told people to call him buck he had no doubts about anything not as far as rodriguez could see few whites in the csa did and buck thornton was as white as they came sandy hair with a lot of gray in it blue eyes pointy nose freckles if there werent blacks around to revile he probably whiled away the time cussing at greasers where he was though he didnt have the time or energy to worry about anything but negroes as a sonoran rodriguez knew he was on the bottom rung of the social ladder but he was on the ladder down below lay the ooze and the muckthe blacks on whose back the ladder stood he looked down on them all the more because he was closer to them than people higher up the ladder in an odd way though negroes were an insurance policy for people of mexican blood as long as they were there nobody except a few texans got excited about his kind the first trucks rolled out of camp determination when they came back the mallates aboard them wouldnt be there anymore rodriguez wouldnt miss them a bit either the first negroes hed ever met had had guns in their hands theyd done their level best to kill him hed hated and feared them ever since if jake featherston wanted to get rid of them more power to him and to the freedom party as more stretcher bearers hauled away dead and dying blacks rodriguez had an odd thought suppose camp determination and others like itfor there were bound to be others like itsucceeded suppose they made the confederate states negrofree what would the country be like then it would be a lot safer was the first answer that sprang into his mind mallates were nothing but trouble even now they left car bombs in cities and bushwhacked whites in the countryside good riddance to them but if they were goneif they were all gonewhat would that social ladder be like people always needed someone at whom they could look down their noses who would fall into that unenviable role people like me rodriguez thoughtpeople with brown skin and black hair people who spoke english with an accent that might not be so good he wondered why the question hadnt occurred to him sooner he shrugged that would come later much later if it ever happened at all it wasnt anything he had to lose sleep over and he didnt intend to he had a job to do and he was going to do it the best way he knew how and maybe he shouldnt have looked down his nose at that thais she wasnt bad and he hadnt seen magdalena for a long time now he shrugged again it wasnt as if there werent plenty of fish in that particular sea airraid sirens howled tumbling george enos jr out of bed much too early on a sunday morning either somebody with a sadistic sense of humor had picked the time for a drillalways a possibility in the navyor the japs were feeling friskier than usual when antiaircraft guns not far from the barracks started banging away george got his answer he also heard several anguished groansgunfire and hangovers mixed poorly he took the time to throw on tunic and trousers and shoes before running for the closest slit trench not everybody bothered some people dashed out in nothing but skivvies nobody ragged them for it either in combat what you had to do came first with everything else a long way behind a fighter swooped low machinegun bullets chewed up the grass and sent dirt jumping some of them kicked into the trench too somebody howled like a coyote when a bullet found him george scrunched himself up as small and as low as he could his whites got filthy but that was the least of his worries most of the action though was well away from the barracks the japs were aiming for the harbor and the nearby airfield warships and airplanes could hurt them mere men were an afterthought fremont blaine dalby jumped into the trench and just missed pulverizing georges kidneys with his big feet he must have dodged the strafing fighters bullets like a halfback dodging tacklers bastards are going to pay for this he panted crashing down beside george something blew up with force enough to make the ground shake looks like theyre dishing it out not taking it george pointed out in a bellow that under those circumstances did duty for a whisper yeah but if they want to yank the lions tail they gotta stick their head in his mouth dalby said that wasnt the way george would have gone about pulling a lions tail assuming he were mad enough to try such a thing but he knew better than to criticize a cpos choice of metaphors and when dalby went on he was as concrete as boulder dam if their airplanes can reach us ours can reach their carriers and we must have known they were coming unless every goddamn yrange operator in the sandwich islands is asleep at the switch so we oughta be good and ready for em heres hoping george said an airplane smashed to the ground not far enough away he stuck his head up hoping to watch a japanese pilot fry in the wreckage but the burning fighter was american he could still make out the eagle and crossed swords painted on the fuselage he hoped the pilot had bailed out before his machine crashed then the warm tropical breeze brought him the stink of burning meat his stomach did a flipflop worse than any in the north atlantic in wintertime dalby stuck his head up too he was looking along the trench weve got a lot of our crew here he said we ought to find us a gun to man the prospect of getting out of the trench did not fill george with delight he wanted to tell dalby as much what came out of his mouth was ill follow you chief the desire not to look bad before ones fellow man is a strange compelling and terribly powerful thing when dalby yelled fritz gustafson answered the call right away george might have known nothing would faze the loader even if he was scared he was too damn stubborn to show it probably even to himself dalby looked around again the rest of the gun crew were either out of earshot or sensibly keeping their heads down and their mouths shut screw it dalby said we got a shellheaver a loader and i can damn well aim come on he scrambled out of the trench george did follow him if he muttered about how many different kinds of damn fool he was then he did that was all there was still a hell of a lot of racket all around dalby either didnt hear him or had a good enough excuse to pretend he didnt plenty going on gustafson said a novels worth of words from him he wasnt wrong american and japanese warplanes tangled overhead if anybody had an edge george couldnt tell who it was both groundbased antiaircraft guns and those mounted on ships in pearl harbor were throwing shells up as fast as they could shrapnel was starting to come down pattering and clattering off roofs and sidewalks and thumping into bare ground george wished he had a helmet that stuff would rearrange your brains if it hit you in the head come on fremont dalby said again lets find us a gun he trotted off as if he knew exactly where to do it and damned if he didnt twin mm mounts were almost as thick as fleas on land as well as aboard ship this one had fallen silent because a bomb burst behind it turned the crew to tattered red rags george gulped blood splashed the guns breech ends and dappled the shells dalby looked at the fallen gunners theyre dead he said which was almost an understatement not a damn thing we can do for emexcept maybe pay the japs back you guys feed and load ill aim and well all hope like hell george got blood on his hands when he passed shells to fritz gustafson the loader got more on his when he shoved them home dalby aimed at a bomber the gun roared shell casings leaped from the breeches and clanged on the cement sidewalk with only three men to serve the piece it couldnt fire as fast as it would have with a whole crew nobody cared they were hitting back not just taking a pounding the way they had been george had no idea whether they hit anything he didnt have time to look up he was too busy doing his job trying to pass as much ammunition as two men would the loader didnt complain and neither did fremont dalby he couldnt have done too badly then only when the gun fell silent did he pause blinking in surprise no more targets dalby announced theyve flown the coop when george glanced at his wristwatch he blinked in amazement he also took a good long look to make sure the second hand was going around weve only been here fifteen minutes he said time flies when youre having fun dalby said i think maybe we ran em off other question is what did they do to us whenever george moved his shoes left bloody footprints he didnt want to look at what was left of the guns original crew but in a fight like this men were small change how many airplanes had the japs lost would they lose any carriers measure that against the damage theyd done and youd get some idea of whod come out on top maybe you men that was an unmistakable officers bark along with his shipmates george turned came to attention and saluted the unmistakable officera lieutenant commander no lesskept on barking i havent seen you before and i know damn well this isnt your proper station explain yourselves sir were from the townsend dalby answered we were looking for a way to hit back at the enemy you can see for yourself what happened to the men who were posted here we fought this gun as well as we could sir he spoke calmly quietly respectfully only his eyes asked what were you doing while all this crap was going on the lieutenant commander had some mileage on him by the fruit salad on his chest hed started out during the great war he knew what the petty officer wasnt saying knowing he turned rednot so red as georges footprints but red enough carry on he said in a choked voice and got out of there in a hurry you showed him george said yeah fremont dalby didnt sound happy you shouldnt have to show officers though especially not the ones whove been around the block but some of em just have to make like theyre god when stretcher bearers came by the men from the townsend waved to them they hurried over but they didnt stay were supposed to be looking for wounded one of them said those birds aint goin anywhere if we leave em where theyre at sooner or later the meat wagon will deal with em not right george said these guys were doing everything they could till their number came up shouldnt just leave em like garbage actually they reminded him of what was all over the decks of the sweet sue after the men on the fishing boat had been gutting big cod but dalby cut the stretcher bearers more slack than hed given the officer wounded count for more he allowed you can still save them thanks chief said the man whod spoken before the bearers hurried away dalby looked at his shipmates either one of you notice if we had bombers taking off not me george said at once i was too busy trying not to let the japs blow me to kingdom come and then trying to shoot em down we did fritz gustafson said they were already airborne when i hit the trench two consecutive sentences from him were a telephone book an unabridged dictionary from a noisier man fremont dalby nodded thats pretty good we ought to be hitting back pretty damn quick then those bastards need to pay bombers should have taken off the minute we picked up the japs airplanes on the yrange set george said yeah dalby said thoughtfully and then in deeper gruffer angrier tones yeah he kicked at the sidewalk yeah goddammit somebody was asleep at the switch again that would have been the best way to do it sure as hell christ there are times when i really do think we want to lose this fuckin war hey dalby you still in one piece the shout came from the direction in which the gunners had come only another cpo would have used the gun chiefs naked surname with such relish yeah were here burnett dalby gave back what hed got leastways we didnt stay in the trench sucking our thumbs and hanging on to our theodore bears chief burnetts reply offered an improbable and uncomfortable destination for both thumbs and theodore bears dalby suggested that burnetts mother already resided there burnett gave forth with an opinion on certain habits of dalbys mother about which he was unlikely to have personal knowledge then in the same unruffled tone of voice he asked you cocksuckers hit anything damfino dalby answered also without much heat we gave it our best shot thats all he slapped gustafson and george on the back staggering them bothand george was not a small man and fritz gustafson was a big one you already knew the squareheads solid and this guy here aint half bad george shuffled his feet on the bloodsplashed sidewalk thanks chief he mumbled a naval cross from the hands of an admiral wouldnt have meant nearly so much as that laconic praise from a man who mattered to him well well tom colleton said what have we here what they had there was a company of confederate barrels big snorting machines painted in butternut with swirls and splotches of dark green and dark brown to make them harder to spot and harder to hit but they were barrels the likes of which hadnt been seen up in ohio before lieutenantcolonel colleton strolled over for a closer look at the new monsters they were plainly related to the beasts that had spearheaded the confederate thrust to lake erie the summer before they were just as plainly bigger and meanertyrannosaurus rex next to the earlier allosaurus they seemed more squat lower to the ground as tom colleton got up to them he realized they werent but the impression remained instead of going straight up and down most of their armor was cleverly sloped to help deflect shells and their turret guns were bigger and longer than those of the earlier models one of the barrel drivers was head and shoulders out of his machine no point in buttoning up when the damnyankees werent close thats a twoandahalfinch cannon youve got there colleton asked three inches sir the man answered proud as if hed said eight inches of himself some of those yankeesll never know what hit em seventeenpound shell sweet jesus tom exclaimed yeah thatll make you sit up and take notice all right how many of these bastards have we got many as we need i reckon the driver said oh yeah ill believe that when i see it tom colleton said in his experience nobody ever had as many barrels as he needed the enemy wrecked a few some more broke downand then just when they would have come in handy to take out some wellsited wellprotected machinegun nests there wouldnt be any for miles around but the driver nodded why not he could duck down inside all that lovely armor plating he didnt have to look longingly at it from the outside he didnt have to worry about machine guns either no matter how well protected they were he said sir dont you fret this time by god were going to get the job done heres hoping tom said the drivera cocky kidjust grinned at him he found himself grinning back it wasnt as if barrel crewmen didnt have worries of their own when they were in the field they were cannon magnets all the enemys heavy weapons bore on them the armor that kept out smallarms fire could turn into a roasting pan to cook soldiers if something did get through youll see yeah the kid was cocky he also sounded like somebody who knew more than he was letting on what is the job were going to get done tom asked he commanded a regiment nobodyd bothered to tell him anything he should have been miffed that a noncom from another unit knew more about what was going on than he did he should have been but he wasnt or not very hed seen enough in both the great war and this one to know that kind of crap happened all the time before the barrel driver could answer somebody inside the machine said something to him through the intercom tom heard the squawk in the kids earphones but he couldnt make out any words the driver said sorry sirgotta go orders are to push up a little closer to the front be careful tom warned the damnyankees have started sneaking in more and more infiltrators they like to plant mines and their snipers try and blow the heads off drivers and commanders who dont stay buttoned up sir weve got us this big ol cannon and two machine guns i reckon we can make any old infiltrators knuckle under the driver answered he ducked down into the barrel but didnt close the hatch the engines note deepened as the machine rattled forward with its companions tom stared after them coughing a little from the noxious exhaust fumes he would have bet everything he owned that the kid had never seen combat nobody who had was that casual about snipers if the other guy shot first how big your gun was or how many rounds per minute you could put out didnt matter luck tom muttered if that smiling puppy lived through his first couple of brushes with us soldiers he had a good chance of living quite a while longer you got experience in a hurryor if you didnt they buried you somewhere up here with a helmet stuck on a stick or on a rifle to mark where you lay that fancy barrel the kid was driving couldnt help but improve his odds if wed had these when the war started tom shook his head the csa hadnt had them and he couldnt do a thing about it the damnyankees hadnt had them either how long would they need to come up with barrels that matched these how long before both sides sported land dreadnoughts behemoths that laughed at danger and squashed antlike mortal men under their tracks without even knowing they were there tom shook his head again nothing he could do about it except try to make sure he wasnt one of the poor sorry bastards who got squashed he had no guarantees of that either and he knew it the barrels had rolled east out of sandusky not west that said something anyhow hed expected them to go in that direction but nothing was carved in stone it did look as if the csa would have to hit the usa another lick to make the bigger country fall over cutting the united states in half hadnt quite done the job why hadnt al smith thrown in the sponge dammit everybody could have gone home tom would rather have been in st matthews than in sandusky he didnt know anybody who wanted to be here but needing to be here was a different story not all the reinforcements that came in were armored units the infantrymen tom saw made him raise an eyebrow they werent raw troops in fresh uniforms they wore butternut frayed at the cuffs and the elbows and knees faded by the sun and deprived of all possibility of holding a crease by hard use their weapons were well tended but a long way from factorynew they were in other words just as much veterans as the men he commanded where had they come from virginia seemed the only likely answer outside of ohio it was the only place that could have produced men like this fighting went on here and there in the west but neither side put full force into that effort the csa and the usa both seemed sure the decision would come where they were strongest not at the periphery as far as tom could see the big brains on both sides were likely right but the damnyankees were still pounding away in virginia could the confederate states pull men out of there and go on holding them off tom had to hope so a day or two later he realized that wasnt necessarily the right question an even more pressing one was couldnt the confederate states do anything in ohio without bleeding virginia of men the answer to that one looked to be no and it wasnt the answer tom wanted to find robbing peter to pay paul wasnt a good way to fight a war but what choice did the csa have none tom could see this was the downside of getting into a fight with a country that had a lot more manpower than you did he called down more curses on al smiths head the whole idea of storming up through ohio of cutting the united states in half had been to knock the usa out of the fight before numbers really mattered the confederates had tried it theyd succeeded as well as theyd hoped to everything had been perfect except the united states hadnt quit now the confederate states faced the same sort of grinding struggle as theyd seen in the great war what should have been a onepunch ko was a noholdsbarred wrestling match now airplanes droned by overhead tom colleton cast a wary eye up to the heavens he knew where hed jump if they turned out to be us airplanes he looked for shelter as automatically as he breathed that he looked for shelter so automatically helped keep him breathing but they were cs machines even when the silhouettes were tiny he recognized them he wondered what hed do when his sideor the damnyankeesbrought out new models he had a pretty good notion too the first few times hed dive for cover whether he needed to or not after that hed be able to tell friend from foe again the day was coming it was probably coming soon the confederate states had new improved barrels before long they were bound to have new improved airplanes too so were the united states where would it end probably with both sides flying to the moon with guns that could strike from five hundred miles away and with bombs that could blow up whole counties if not whole states tom laughed at himself but then he wondered why back in he couldnt have imagined the weapons the csa and the usa were using now what would the state of the art be in or in he shivered standing there under the warm spring sunshine things were much deadlier now than they had been a generation earlier if that went on for another twentyfive years wouldnt wars end almost before they started and if not why not sir tom started he wondered how long the sergeant standing beside him had been trying to get his attention by the exaggerated patience on the mans face hed done everything but wave wigwag flags what is it meyers tom asked im herei really am thats good sir sergeant meyers said i was going to ask you if you knew when the balloon was going up not officially you understand but if you knew itd help the men get ready i wish to god i did sergeant but whatever were doing nobody has bothered to tell me about it yet you can take that for whatever you think its worth toms laugh was half rueful half furious one of the drivers for those new barrels had a pretty good notion or reckoned he did he had to pull out before he could tell me what it was damned impressive barrel though oh yes sir meyers was not a man given to wild enthusiasms few sergeants were that sort of man was much more likely to be a private or a lieutenant but the sergeant waxed enthusiastic now we have enough of those critters well make the damnyankees say uncle for sure i hope youre right sergeant tom meant it after what the cs army had been through the year before though and after what it had accomplished he took nothing for granted that any one weapon no matter how wonderful could knock the usa out of the war struck him as unlikely he kept his mouth shut if sergeant meyers thought the yankees would fall over dead as soon as the confederates kicked them back one more hill fine that made him a more cheerful soldier a better soldier at least until the damnyankees did get pushed back past that last hill if they ever did if they got pushed back and didnt fall over dead well in that case meyers and the other men like him would have some rethinking to do he might not be such a terrific soldier for a while after that wherever were going were going east tom thought right into the heart of yankeeland wed better make em say uncle by god steady as she goes mr cooley sam carsten told his executive officer steady as she goesaye aye sir pat cooley replied his freckled face intent on keeping the josephus daniels as steady as she could possibly go the destroyer escort crept through the hot muggy night towards a shoreline that was carsten didnt like to think about how very ready to receive them that virginia shoreline probably was keeping anything secret in these crowded waters required a miracle beyond the power of any navy department functionary to provide sam wasnt altogether certain the holy ghost could have given him one as big as he needed sneaking into chesapeake bay without getting either mined or torpedoed hadnt been the smallest of miracles all by itself he spoke into the telephone that connected the bridge with the gun turrets everything ready there you have your targets yes sir the gun chiefs answered together all right then sam smiled there in the darkness even as a rating hed been in charge of bigger pieces than these fourinch popguns at my order and give it everything youve got fire twin tongues of flame belched from the turrets lighting up the night for a heartbeat with a hellish orange glow recoil made the ship shudder those tongues thrust out again and then again and again as each gun crew did its best to prove it was faster than the other first the bow turret took the lead then the stern all told judging a winner was next to impossible splashes of fire inland told of shell hits sam knew where the target was but not what it was that evidently wasnt necessary for the mission he kept an eye on the luminous hands of his watch when exactly five minutes had gone by he said cease firing into the telephone an aching silence fell he turned to the exec mr cooley i do believe we may have worn out our welcome get us out of here all ahead full course all ahead full course cooley rang the engine room the josephus daniels put on as many revolutions and as much speed as she had sam was used to ships with a lot more dash he felt nailed to the surface of the bay despite the phosphorescent wake streaming from the bow destroyer escorts were cheap and easy and fast to build considering their liabilities they needed to be on the shore the confederates were waking up first one field gun and then a whole battery started firing at where the josephus daniels had been those were sguns of about the same caliber as the destroyer escort carried the bridge telephone rang when sam picked it up one of the turret chiefs said sir permission to return enemy fire permission denied sam answered in lieu of screaming are you out of your frigging mind he went on weve done what we came to do here now our job is to get out in one piece so we can come back and do it again one day before long shooting back makes us much too visible and they have more guns than we do we just scoot got that yes sir the turret chief said sullenly carsten found it hard to fault a man who wanted to raise hell with the enemy but you needed a sense of proportion no i need a sense of proportion thats why im the old man there were times when he felt like a very old man indeed pat cooley eyed him from the wheel cooley was ten times the ship handler he would ever be sam hadnt taken the wheel of any ship till he became the skipper here your thoughts mr cooley sam asked sir id like to shoot back at those bastards the exec answered sam stiffened but after a moment cooley went on youre right though probably a good idea that we dont theyre missing us pretty badif i were in charge of that battery id be reaming em out right now but the man in charge of that cs batterya sergeant or lieutenant tumbled from his blanket when the josephus daniels opened uphad a better idea two of his guns fired star shells that lit up the bayand the destroyer escortwith a cold clear terrible light men at the antiaircraft guns started shooting at the star shells if they could wreck the parachutes that supported them in the air the blazing shells would fall into the sea and sizzle out the bow turret no longer bore on the confederate battery the stern turret opened up without orders sam only nodded to himself with the josephus daniels out there in plain sight a muzzle flash or three didnt make a rats ass worth of difference and she was out there in plain sight the confederate guns on the coast wasted no time correcting their aim shells began bursting around and on the destroyer escort most of the ships on which sam had served would have laughed at mm shells but the josephus daniels like any destroyer was thinskinned she had no armor to protect her screams made sam grind his teeth men serving the antiaircraft guns topside were vulnerable aboard any ship that floated he knew that knowing it left it no easier to take smoke mr cooley he said well see how much good it does smoke aye aye sir more star shells lit up the night smoke blossomed around the josephus daniels it helped less than it might have under other circumstances sam had feared as much she was the only thing afloat in this part of chesapeake bay if the smoke screen moved she had to be at the front end of it knowing that the confederate gunners didnt lose a whole lot of accuracy from not being able to see their target anymore nothing to do but take the pounding and try to get away sam had heard great war stories about how raiders caught between their trench line and the enemys hated star shells with a purple passion now he understood exactly how they felt there you were all lit up naked as a bug on a plate a big boom and a flash of light from the shore said the daniels gun had hit something worthwhileprobably the ammunition store for one of the guns shooting at the ship before sam could let out a whoop a confederate shell burst just forward of the bridge he watched a machinegun crew blown to cats meat fragments whistled and screeched past him after pausing to make sure he was still in one piece he asked you all right mr cooley everythings copacetic here skipper cooley said and then well almost everything he displayed his left sleeve which had a brandnew gash in it an inch farther in and he would have gone down to the sick bay with a wounded arm six inches farther in and they would have had to carry him to sick bay with a belly wound even with all the fancy drugs they had these days belly wounds were very bad news good for you pat that sliced sleeve made sam less formal than usual you dont really want a purple heart no matter how pretty the ribbon would look on your uniform yes sir cooley said another shell screamed in he and sam both ducked automatically not that ducking was likely to do a hell of a lot of good the shell was a clean miss bursting a good hundred yards to starboard a little hesitantly the exec asked are we going to get out of this sir sam thought of talking about the battle of the three navies when the british and the japanese hit the dakota with everything but their purse he thought about the remembrances last fight when japanese air power finally sank the tough old carrier in the end though he just stuck to business unless we take one in the engine room that leaves us dead in the water we will otherwise those s may hurt us but they wont be able to kill us before we get out of range cooley considered that then nodded he looked at his wristwatch at flank speed weve got to stand the gaff forwhat about another fifteen minutes carsten checked his watch too he laughed ruefully yeah thats about right i didnt think it would be so long arent we lucky lucky right cooley managed an answering grin but one of a distinctly sepulchral sort a confederate shell burst just behind the stern those near misses were dangerous because fragments still flew screams from that direction said some of these had struck home can you give us any more down there sam yelled to the engine room through a speaking tube sir shes flat out the chief engineer said shit weve got the valves tied down the way they did on the old paddlewheel riverboats all rightthanks sam sighed he shouldnt have expected anything different he hadnt really but hed hoped for something like oh yes sir well dreelspayl the paragore and get you two more knots easy as you please two more knots he snorted he wanted ten more well sonny boy you aint gonna get em he turned back to the exec do you think we ought to throw some zigzags into the course straight gets us out of range faster cooley said doubtfully yeah but it lets them lead us too sam answered ever hunt ducks once or twice but i didnt like it its not all its quacked up to be ouch dont do that again i think id rather sam broke off however bad cooleys occasional puns were he didnt prefer being under confederate gunfire to listening to them the exec did start zigzagging at random that would have been better with another ten knots too but you did what you could with what you had sam thought it helped they took another hit and a couple of more near misses but nothing that slowed them down and even though those were some of the longest fifteen minutes of sams life they finally ended by then all the shells were coming in astern of the josephus daniels when the confederates realized as much they ceased fire now were home free if one of their airplanes doesnt find us sam said youre full of cheerful thoughts arent you sir cooley said like a sardine can is full of sardines son sam answered straighten out and head for home im gong to assess the damage keep straight unless were attacked if they jump us before im back to the bridge he broke off again belay that ill take the conn you go assess the damage and report back aye aye sir cooley didnt question him the josephus daniels was his sam carstens no one elses responsibility for her was his too he couldnt stand the idea of anything happening if he wasnt there when it did cooley said ill hustle sir sam stared at the yrange screens as the ship sped up toward maryland no aircraft heading his way nothing on the water he didnt think the confederates had anything bigger than a torpedo boat operating in the bay but a torpedo boat could ruin you if you didnt spot it till too late cooley came back sir looks like four to six dead a couple of dozen wounded weve got one wrecked mm mountthats the worst of the damage the rest is mostly metalwork all things considered we got away cheap thank you mr cooley sam said we got away cheap the dead and the maimed would not agree with the exec sam found that he was inclined to war measured what you dished out against what you took by that grim arithmetic the josephus daniels had got away cheap hyrum rush had gone back to utah and been passed through the lines into mormonheld territory under flag of truce as far as flora blackford was concerned even that was better than he deserved his parting words before getting on the train that would take him west were you people will see what this costs you if he hadnt been under safeconduct that would have been plenty to make flora lock him up and throw away the key the nerve of the man she spluttered when his warninghis threat got back to the joint committee on the conduct of the war we should never have talked with him in the first place there i agree with you completely robert taft said you will have more luck persuading the administration than im likely to though taft was a famously acerbic man and also one given to understatement he remained the leading hardline democrat in the senate flora worried about agreeing with him he no doubt also worried about agreeing with her ive never said socialists cant make mistakes flora answered i have said they arent the only ones who can make mistakes some people dont recognize the difference he gave her a tight smilethe only kind his face had room for i cant imagine what youre talking about he said and she found herself smiling back they had plenty to do questioning officers and men about the bloody fiasco at fredericksburg about the most anybodyincluding daniel macarthurwould say to defend it was it seemed like a good idea at the time trying to pin down why it had seemed a good idea was like trying to scoop up water with a sieve the committee remained very busy and accomplished very little like anyone else these days hyrum rush had to go up through canada to travel from east to west flora kept track of his progress through franklin roosevelt i hope youre making him cool his heels up there she told the assistant secretary of war we thought about it congresswoman he said we thought about it long and hardbelieve you me we did finally though we decided that showing him how bad our bottleneck up there really is would only encourage him and so we hustled him through instead flora thought about that reluctantly she nodded youre inconveniencing him most by inconveniencing him least she said even over the telephone his laugh made her want to laugh along with him thats just what were doing flora he said between chortles the only thing is i didnt know it was what we were doing till you told me just now im going to steal your line every chance i get and most of the time im not going to give you any credit who in politics ever does give anybody else any credit flora said which only set him laughing again she stopped worrying about hyrum rush once she heard hed got back to what his people called deseret sooner or later the us army would grind it out of existencefor good this time she hoped utah and the mormons had been a running sore on the body politic for much too long the biggest question facing the joint committee was whether it would have the nerve to tell the war department to put somebody besides daniel macarthur in charge in virginia flora was convinced the man didnt deserve his command but she also saw he had an aura of invulnerability about himnot because of his battlefield talents but because of his personality george custer had had an aura like that during the great war even teddy roosevelt had moved carefully around him of course custer and rooseveltthe other roosevelthad been rivals for years ever since the second mexican war but no one in the present administration had anything close to trs own strength of character that being so any decisive steps without prodding from the joint committee struck even flora a good socialist as unlikely she was saying so pointedly enough to dismay chairman norris when an explosion made the building shake plaster pattered down from the ceiling somebody said that was a close one somebody else said damn confederates havent sent any day bombers for a whilebegging your pardon congresswoman oh i damn them too flora said you dont need to doubt that for even a minute believe me she looked down at her notes may i continue mr chairman you have the floor congresswoman senator norris looked as if he wished she didnt thank you sir the florid politeness that had once seemed so unnatural to her was now second nature as i was saying but before she could say it a man in a guards uniform stuck his head into the meeting room were evacuating the building that was an auto bomb near the front entrance we dont know if theyve got any more close by he grimaced we dont even know who they are dammit he didnt apologize for swearing in front of flora they the enemy within never went away who was it this time confederate saboteurs mormons living up to hyrum rushs promise rebellious canadians british agents any combination of those groups working together flora didnt know somebody was going to have to find out though please come with me the guard said before we do lets see your identification robert taft snapped flora reluctantly allowed that that made good sense if the man in the uniform was part of the plot people were going to start looking under beds before they went to sleep if this went on the guard showed senator taft his identity card without a word of protest satisfied flora nodded flora wondered what taft would have done if the man had gone for his pistol instead probably thrown himself at ithe had the courage of his convictions as well as plenty of courage of the ordinary sort following the guard the members of the joint committee hurried out of the massive building congress used in philadelphiawags called it the box the capitol came in they emerged on the side opposite the one where the auto bomb had gone off along with several others flora started around the building so she could see the damage for herself that isnt safe the guard exclaimed and how do you know standing here is she answered any one of these motorcars may be full of tnt and ready to blow up the guard looked very unhappy which didnt mean she was wrong you told him taft said approvingly so i did she said and hurried on a makeshift police and fire line stopped her and the others before they got very close to the site of the explosion even what they could see from there was bad enough bodies and pieces of bodies lay everywhere the front of the hall had taken heavy damage it all seemed worse than the aftermath of an air raid perhaps because the autos chassis turned into more and more lethal shrapnel than a bomb casing did one of floras colleagues was noisily sick on his shoes someone will pay for this robert taft sounded grim no sooner had he spoken than half the facade of the congressional hall crashed down to the cratered street a great graybrown cloud of dust rose soldiers and policemen rushed into it to rescue whoever lay buried under the rubble flora covered her face with her hands a reporter chose that moment to rush up to her and ask congresswoman what do you think of this explosion i hope not too many people got hurt i hope the ones who did will recover flora realized the man had a job to do but she didnt feel like answering foolish questions right now that didnt stop the reporter from asking them with an air of breathless anticipation he said who do you think is to blame for this atrocity i dont know im sure there will be an investigation flora said but if you had to guess who would be responsible he persisted if i had to guess right now i would be irresponsible flora told him the answer should have made him take a hint and go away no such luck he was not one of those reporters who recognized anything as subtle as a hint and that turned out to be just as well for his next question told flora something she didnt know what do you think of the explosions in washington and new york and boston and pittsburgh and chicago andother places too what explosions flora and robert taft spoke together in identical sharp tones whole bunch of auto bombs the reporter seemed as willing to give information as to try to pry it out of other people the capitol and wall street and the state house in boston and i dont know what all else lots of damage lots of people dead all about the same time as this one news was coming over the wire and by wireless when i got the call to get my uh fanny over here jesus christ taft burst out flora didnt echo him but her thoughts amounted to something similar he went on this has the smell of a conspiracy flora wouldnt have argued with that either the reported scribbled in his spiralbound notebook smell of a conspiracy he repeated and dipped his head thank you senatorthats a good line he hurried off a good line taft echoed bitterly thats all he cared about but my godif what he said about those other places is true that would be very bad flora said one of the larger understatements of her own political career the confederates have had a lot of trouble with auto bombs i wonder if theyre paying us back or if its someone else as she had to the reporter taft said i dont know she nodded but her conscience niggled at her all the same shed applauded when she heard about auto bombs going off in the confederate states the confederates after all deserved it for the way they treated their negroes again who thought the united states deserved it the confederates because the usa had had the gall to win the great war the mormons because the united states wouldnt leave their precious deseret alone she would have bet one them but what did she have for proof nothing and she knew it the canadians because the united states still held their land the british because the americans had taken canada away from them all of the above none of the above sounding both furious and frightened robert taft went on wed better get a handle on this business in a hurry if we dont any damn fool with an imaginary grievance will think he can load dynamite into a motorcar and get even with the world floras thoughts hadnt gone in that direction which didnt mean the senator from ohio was wrong she said wed better get a handle on this for all kinds of reasons two firemen carried a moaning bloody woman past her on a stretcher she pointed theres one yes taft tipped his fedora to her we have our differences you and i but we both love this country thats true not always in the same way but we do flora said cops helped a wounded man stagger by flora sighed at a time like this though what difference does party make sergeant michael pound was not a happy man his barreland in fact his whole unit of barrelshad finally escaped from the southern ohio backwater where theyd been stuck for so long they were facing the confederates farther north that should have done something to improve the gunners temper it should have but it hadnt no pound remained unhappy and made only the slightest efforts to hide it he was a broadshouldered burly man not especially tall but made for slewing a gun from side to side if the hydraulics went out he had a deceptively soft voice and used it to say deceptively mild things when he thought the men put above him were idiots as he often did he had a way of making sure they knew it what really irked him was that hed been the gunner on irving morrells personal barrel whatever morrell found out pound had learned shortly thereafter morrell hadnt minded his sarcastic comments on the way the brass thought if the brass thought at all always an interesting question and michael pound hadnt thought morrell was an idiot oh noon the contrary the only thing wrong with morrell was that his superiors hadnt seen how good he was the confederates had after their sniper put a bullet in morrell pound was the one whod carried him out of harms way and back to the aid tent scuttlebutt said morrell was finally back in action that was good the csa would be sorry but morrell wasnt back in action here that wasnt good and it especially wasnt good for michael pound hed declined a commission several times now he was paying for it because of his reputation as a mouthy troublemaker he didnt even command his own barrel though a lot of sergeants did theyd put him under a young lieutenant instead pound didnt know if theyd deliberately intended to humiliate him but theyd sure done the job bryce poffenberger might have been born when pound joined the army but probably hadnt but he owned a little gold bar on each shoulder strap and pound had only stripes on his sleeve that meant poffenberger was godand if you didnt believe it all you had to do was ask him he never asked for pounds opinion he didnt seem to think the war department had issued opinions to enlisted men if hed had a better notion of what he was doing himself pound wouldnt have minded so much but he never had been able to suffer fools gladly and he never had been able to suffer in silence either when poffenberger ordered the barrel to stop on the forward slope of a hill pound said sir we would have done better to halt on the reverse slope oh the second lieutenants voice already had a defensive quaver to it and hed known pound for only a few days at that point why pray tell pray tell pound thought had anyone since the puritans really said that bryce poffenberger just had by god patiently the sergeant answered because on the reverse slope were hulldown to the enemy sir this way the whole barrel makes a nice juicy target lieutenant poffenberger sniffed i dont believe there are any confederates close by he stood up in the turret to look out through the cupola that was something good barrel commanders did it took a certain nerve poffenberger might have been a moron but he wasnt a cowardly moron not half a minute later a round from a confederate antibarrel gun assassinated an oak tree just to the barrels left poffenberger ducked back down with a startled squeak sometimesnot oftensergeant pound was tempted to believe in god this was one of those times reverse poffenberger ordered the driver back up the confederates got off one more shot at the barrel before it put the hill between itself and the gun lieutenant poffenberger eyed michael pound how did you know that was going to happen sergeant i have more combat experience than you do sir pound answered matteroffactly so does my cat and i havent got a cat they warned me about you poffenberger said they told me you had a big mouth and were insubordinate they were right sir pound knew he shouldnt sound so cheerful but he couldnt help it the young lieutenant went on as if he hadnt spoken they told me you were all puffed up because youd served with colonel morrell for so long and he used to let you get away with murder they told me youd started to think you were a colonel yourself that did hold some truth which sergeant pound also knew he said sir there was one difference between when i talked to colonel morrell and when i talk to you oh whats that poffenberger sounded genuinely intrigued when i said something to the colonel sometimes hed believe me before the barrel almost blew up poffenberger was a fairhaired fairskinned youngster from somewhere in the upper midwest when he turned red it was easy to see he turned red as a traffic light now maybe you have a point sergeant he choked out maybe but i command this barrel you dont theres no getting around that i dont want to get around it sir pound answered earnestly i dont want to be an officer i could have been an officer years ago if i wanted to put up with the bother watching lieutenant poffenbergers jaw drop was amusing but only for a little while pound added i dont want to be an officer but i dont want to get killed either not even sergeants like getting killed sir i didnt think they did poffenberger couldnt have sounded any stiffer if hed been carved out of marble pound pretended not to notice he said well in that case sir dont you think we ought to scoot to one side or the other were hulldown here but were not turretdown and if those butternut bastards get a halfway decent shot at us theyll remind us the hard way he waited how stubborn was the lieutenant stubborn enough not to listen to somebody with a lower rank even if not listening made getting nailed with a highvelocity armorpiercing round much more likely some officersmore than a few of themwere like that they wanted to be right themselves even if it meant being dead right short of knocking them over the head what could you do but poffenberger spoke to the driver and the barrel shifted position quietly pound said thank you sir i didnt do it for you the lieutenant was testy i did it for the sake of the barrel like a man whod sweettalked a girl into bed with him sergeant pound cared little about the whys and wherefores all he cared about was that it had happened he didnt point that out to lieutenant poffenberger he didnt want the lieutenant thinking hed been either seduced or screwed and if poffenberger hadnt done it for love well so what no steel dart came hurtling toward them that was the only thing that mattered a little later a platoon of us foot soldiers went over the hill and chased away the antibarrel cannon a tiny triumph no doubt but anything that looked even a little like a victory pleased pound lieutenant poffenberger had an extra circuit on his wireless set one that hooked him to division headquarters when he started saying yes sir and i understand sir and well be careful sir pound started worrying something had gone wrong somewhere and what was even a tiny triumph worth whats up sir the sergeant prompted when his superior showed no sign of passing along whatever hed learned poffenberger gave him a resentful look but maybe the lesson from the antibarrel gun was sticking at least for a little while there are reports the confederates are stirring around the lieutenant said unwillingly even more unwillingly he added there are reports theyve got a newmodel barrel too michael pound nodded yes sir ive heard about that did they give you any details on the beast what do you mean youve heard about it poffenbergers eyes seemed ready to start from his head i just this minute got word of it well yes sir pound smiled that only unnerved the lieutenant more which was what he had in mind trouble is you have to wait for the wireless to tell you things enlisted men have their own grapevine you might say from what ive heard the new enemy barrels supposed to be very bad news bigger gun better armor maybe a bigger engine too jesus poffenberger muttered more to himself than to his gunner what the hell do we bother with espionage for put a few corporals on the job and theyd have jake featherstons telephone number in nothing flat its freedom sir pound answered seriously poffenberger stared at him convinced for one wild moment that he meant it that told pound everything he needed to know about how much hed intimidated the lieutenant in a gentle voice he said im only joking sir eryes lieutenant poffenberger gathered himself the process was very visible and so funny that pound had to bite down on the inside of his lower lip to keep from laughing out loud carefully poffenberger asked how did colonel morrell ever put up with you oh we didnt have any trouble sir pound answered colonel morrell wants to go after the bad guys just as much as i do i hear theyve sent him to virginia the people over there must be keeping him under wraps or else we would have heard a lot more out of him i see poffenberger eyed pound the way a man wearing a suit made of pork chops might eye a nearby bear more than a little plaintively the lieutenant said i want to go after the enemy too of course sir pound said in tones meant to be soothingbut not too soothing the point is though to be as sure as we can that we get them and they dont get us poffenberger started to say something after what had almost happened on the forward slope of the hill though he couldnt say a whole lot not unless he wanted pound to blow a hole in it the way the antibarrel cannon had almost blown a hole in the machine he commanded what he finally did say was you are a difficult man sergeant why thank you sir pound exclaimed which only seemed to complete lieutenant poffenbergers demoralization an officer who needs to be an officer pound thought more than a little smugly as long as youve got the fellow whos supposed to be in charge of you eating out of the palm of your hand you have the best of both worlds bombers rumbled by overhead antiaircraft guns started up behind the us linesthey were confederate airplanes by the way poffenberger looked up at them through the cupola they didnt worry him nearly so much as the man with whom he shared a turret michael pound smiled vii mail call like most of his buddies armstrong grimes perked up when he heard that it wasnt even so much that he expected mail the only person who regularly wrote to him was his father and merle grimes letters werent the most exciting in the world but being reminded that people back home remembered the soldiers here in utah were alive counted for a good deal jackson called the corporal with the mail bag hes on sentry duty somebody said ill take em for him the soldier with the sack handed him half a dozen letters held together with a rubber band he pulled out another rubberbanded clump reisen im here yossel reisen answered and grabbed his mail he had a lot of family back in new york and got tons of letters donovan the noncom with the mail held up some more letters and a package he got wounded last tuesday one of the gathered soldiers answered the man with the mail bag started to put back the package the soldier said if thats cake or candy well keep it depends the corporal said how bad is he etiquette required an honest answer to that question after brief consultation another soldier said he can probably eat it send it back to the field hospital some more names were called including armstrongs he had a letter from his father and he was surprised to see one from aunt clara his aunt a child of his grandmothers old age was only a couple of years older than he was theyd fought like cats and dogs ever since they were tiny he wondered what the devil she wanted with him now before he could open it the guy with the sack called appleton tad appletons birth name was something polish and unpronounceable that at the moment didnt matter three men put what did matter into two words hes dead one of them added stopped acaliber round with his face poor bastard armstrong found himself grinding his teeth when appletons body got back to milwaukee theyd bury him in a closed casket no undertaker in the world could fix up what that bullet had done to him here then the soldier with the mail tossed a package to the men gathered around him that also followed etiquettesuch things shouldnt go to waste more letters and packages got passed out till the sack was empty except for mail belonging to the wounded and the dead the corporal with the sack bummed a cigarette and stood around talking with the men to whom hed delivered the mail a few soldiers who hadnt got anything stood there dejectedly their buddies consoled them as best they could that wasnt just for politeness sake armstrong had seen more than one man forgotten by the folks back home stop caring whether he lived or died he opened the letter from his aunt it turned out to be a wedding announcement clara was marrying somebody named humphrey baxter humphrey armstrong said who the hell names their kid humphrey theres that actor reisen said you know the fellow who was in the maltese elephant oh yeah him armstrong nodded this aint him though ill tell you that this guys probably a bad actoryou know what i mean hes our agegotta beand hes not in the army hes pulling some strings somewhere sure as hell he eyed the announcement with distaste damn papers too stiff to wipe my ass with he scaled it away the letter from his father mentioned claras upcoming wedding too merle grimes had little to say about claras intended armstrong nodded to himself his old man had seen the elephant and took pride in it he wouldnt have much use for somebody whod managed to wiggle out of conscription yossel reisen was methodically going through his mail he held up one letter my aunt was in a meeting room when that auto bomb went off in front of congress he always played down being the nephew of the former first lady if he hadnt downplayed it armstrong didnt suppose he would have had to put the uniform back on at all unlike this humphrey baxter item yossel pulled his weight she get out all right armstrong asked uhhuh not a scratch she says reisen answered she wasnt near the front of the building thank god thats good armstrong said and then goddamn mormons the latterday saints hadnt claimed responsibility for the recent wave of auto bombs but deseret wireless didnt go out of its way to deny anything either its tone was take that serves you right too they look just like anybody else yossel said that makes them hard to catch hard to stop dont it just armstrongs agreement was ungrammatical but heartfelt he added i dont like the way confederate connie goes on and on about it well who would yossel paused even when you know shes full of crap though shes fun to listen to oh hell yes armstrongs agreement there was heartfelt too nobody he knew took confederate connie even a quarter of the way seriously like every wireless broadcaster from the csa she was jake featherstons mouthpiece but a doozie of a mouthpiece she was and she sounded like a doozie of a piece periodshe had the sexiest voice armstrong had ever heard she spent a lot of time between records gloating about the auto bombs that had us cities so on edge now youall know how we feel she would say weve been putting up with these contraptions for years you laughed when it happened to us do youall reckon were laughing now she would pause she would giggle well you know what youre right yossel reisen opened another letter whos this one from armstrong asked having already gone through his meager mail my uncle david which ones he again armstrong askedyossel had a lot of relatives the one who lost a leg in the last war reisen answered hes a rightwing democrat now it drives aunt flora nuts oh yeah armstrong nodded yes his own father was inordinately proud of the wound that made him walk with a cane yossels uncle david overtrumped dads wound in a big way come to that yossels father had got killed before he was even born sure as hell some people had had a tougher time of it than merle grimes even if he wouldnt admit it this side of the rack armstrong asked whats he got to say hes talking about the auto bombs in new york city yossel answered not looking up from the letter he says there were four of themone on wall street one in the lower east side where i grew up and two in times square two armstrong said two yossel repeated his face grim one to make a mess and then another one that went off fifteen minutes later after the cops and the firemen showed up oh armstrong grimaced thats a dirty trick confederate connie hasnt talked about anything like that probably doesnt want to give the shvartzers in the csa ideas if theyre listening to her yossel said armstrong nodded that made pretty good sense yossel went on waste of time i bet if the mormons can figure it out youve got to figure the shvartzers can too bet youre right its a goddamn lousy war thats all ive got to say poison gas and blowing the other guys cities to hell and gone and both sides with maniacs blowing their own cities to hell and gone some fun armstrong said and these fucking mormons wont quit till the last ones deadand his ghostll haunt us as if on cue somebody shouted incoming armstrong threw himself flat even before he heard the shriek of the incoming round it was a terrifying wail the mormons had something homemade and nasty artillerymen called it a spigot mortar most soldiers called the projectileseach about the size of a wastebasket with finsscreaming meemies when they hit they made a roar like the end of the world they were stuffed with explosives and scrap iron to the point where they were almost flying auto bombs themselves the only drawback they had that armstrong could see was that like most of the mormons improvised weapons they couldnt reach very far but when they did get home blast picked him up and slammed him down again as if a professional wrestleror possibly godhad thrown him to the canvas he tasted blood when he brought a hand up to his face he found his nose was bleeding too he felt his ears but they seemed all right after he spat his mouth seemed better his nose went on dripping blood down his face and as he straightened onto the front of his tunic that was all right or not too bad anything more and he would have worried about what the screaming meemie had done to his insides instead he worried about what the horrible thing had done to other people the corporal whod brought the mail forward was torn to pieces if not for the sack armstrong wouldnt have recognized him poor bastard wasnt even a frontline soldier wrong place wrong time and hed make another closedcasket funeral shouts of corpsman rose from half a dozen places there werent enough medics close by to see to everybody at once armstrong bandaged wounds and tied off one tourniquet and gave morphine shots with the syrettes in the soldiers firstaid kits all the things hed learned how to do since he got thrown into battle the summer before yossel reisen was doing the same sorts of things he also had a bloody nose and hed put a bandage on the back of his own left hand more blood soaked through it theres a purple heart for you armstrong said reisen told him where he could put the purple heart and suggest that he not close the pin that held it on a uniform armstrong gave back a ghastly grin same to you buddy only sideways he said they both laughed it wasnt funnynothing within some considerable distance of where a screaming meemie went off was funnybut it kept them both going and it kept them from shrieking sometimes men whod been through too much would come to pieces in the field armstrong had seen that a few times it was even less lovely than what shell fragments could do they only ruined a mans body when his soul went through the meat grinder belatedly us field guns started shelling the place from which the screaming meemie had come odds were neither the men whod launched it nor the tube from which it started its deadly flight were there anymore bastards even armstrong wasnt sure whether he was talking about the mormons on the other side of the line or the gunners on his own it fit both much too well need to talk to you for a minute in my office xerxes jerry dover said when scipio walked into the huntsmans lodge scipio was already sweating from the walk to work in formalwear under the hot augusta sun when his boss told him something like that he started sweating all over again but he said the only thing he could be right theah suh maybehe dared hopethis had to do with restaurant business even if it didnt though he remained at the white mans beck and call dovers office was as crowded and as filled with lists of things to do as ever the restaurant manager worked hard scipio never would have presumed to think otherwise the ashtray on the desk was full of butts a couple of them still smoldering dover paused to light yet another cigarette sucked in smoke blew it out and eyed scipio whats your address over in the terry he asked that wasnt what scipio had expected same one you got on all my papers suh he answered i aint moved or nothin for true jerry dover said no bullshit no getting cute and cagey cross my heart an hope to die mistuh dover scipio made the gesture how come you needs to make sure o dat his boss didnt answer not right away he smoked the cigarette down to a little dogend in quick savage puffs then stubbed it out and lit a new one when he did speak he went off on a tangent i dont reckon your wife and your young uns have ever seen the inside of this place no suh they aint never scipio agreed wondering what the hell dover was going on about the restaurantby which he naturally thought of the part the customers never sawwas crowded enough with the people who had to be there cooks waiters busboys dishwashers others would have fit in as well as feathers on a frog the manager had to know that better than he did no matter what jerry dover knew he said why dont you bring em by tomorrow night when you come in for your shift they get bored they can spend some time here in the office suh my missus she clean white folks houses she already be at work when i comes in here scipio said dover frowned maybe you tell her to take the day off tomorrow so she can come in with you people she work fo aint gwine like dat scipio predicted dolefully blacks in the csa never had been able to risk antagonizing whites with things the way they were now even imagining such a thing was suicidal the second cigarette disappeared as fast as the first one had dover lit a third he blew a stream of smoke up at the ceiling scipio he said softly this is important scipio froze there in the rickety chair across the desk from the restaurant manager jerry dover used that name to remind scipio who had the power here by why he would want to use that power for this purpose baffled the negro sending him down to savannah made sense this this seemed mere whim a man who expended power on a whim was a fool in the tones of an educated white man scipio said perhaps you will be good enough to tell me why you require my familys presence sir dovers eyes widened he laughed out loud goddamn he said she told me you could do that but i plumb forgot thats fucking amazing you ought to go on the wireless instead of some of those muttonheads theyve got as may be sir scipio answered and jerry dover laughed again the black man added you still have not answered my question he dared hope dover would skin color was the most important thing in the csa no doubt about it but accent ran color a close second if he sounded like an educated white man the presumption that he was what he sounded like ran deep but not deep enough not here dover set the live cigarette in the ashtray steepled his fingertips on the desk and looked at scipio over them it would be a good idea if you got em here was all he said his own way of speaking didnt come close to matching scipios by his nervous chuckle he knew it too scipio wanted to ask a good idea how why he wanted to but he didnt hed pushed the white man as far as dover was willing to go returning to the congaree dialect that was his natural speech scipio said reckon i do it den good dover said i knew you were a smart fellow if i didnt think so i wouldnt have wasted my time banging my gums at you in the first place now get your ass out there and go to work yes suh scipio said relieved to be back on familiar ground when his shift ended policemen let him through the barbedwire perimeter surrounding the terry they knew him he had a dispensation to be out after curfew he made it back to his block of flats without getting knocked over the head then he had his next hurdle persuading bathsheba not to do what she usually did why for he want us there she demanded dunno scipio answered but he want it bad enough to use my fotrue name did he that made bathsheba sit up and take notice worry in her voice she asked you reckon he do somethin nasty if we dont come dunno scipio said again more unhappily than ever but i reckons yall better do it bathsheba sighed heavily miz kent she aint gonna be real happy with me miz bagwell neither but we come when his children got up the next morning they were even more bemused than his wife was somethin bad liable to happen pa cassius said his hands bunched into fists can we fight back he was more like the hunter and guerrilla for whom hed been named than he had any business being odds is bad was all scipio said that gave his son very little to react against dont know that i ever wants to go into the ofay part of augusta no more antoinette said they hates us there they hates we here too scipio answered you should oughta come though i dont reckon mistuh dover playin games that wasnt quite true but he didnt know what kind of game the manager was playing and he couldnt afford not to play along his wife and children dressed in their sunday best for the unusual excursion since he was in his own formalwear the family looked as if they were bound for a fancy wedding or a banquet when they got to the barbedwire perimeter the cops and freedom party stalwarts and guards stared at them there seemed to be more whites manning the perimeter than usual or is it just my nerves scipio wonderednervously the policeman who checked passbooks had sent scipio through any number of times he raised an eyebrow to see the black mans family accompanying him but didnt say anything about it he was within the limits of his job and his race a decent fellow a stalwart came up to talk to him scipio wondered if they would yell at him to halt and send bathsheba and the children back they didnt though when scipio got to the huntsmans lodge he found that aurelius also had his wifea plump dignified grayhaired woman named delilahwith him something was going on he still didnt know what and wished he did they all got suppers of the sorts the cooks turned out for the waiters two or three other waiters and cooksall of them men whod worked at the lodge for a while and all of them also men who lived not far from scipio and his familyalso had family members with them jerry dover hovered over the huntsmans lodges uncommon customers he was foxquick foxclever and also scipio judged foxwary thank yall for being here today he said ive worked with your husbands and fathers for years and ive never met yall before hope i do again before too long he was saying something between the lines but not even scipio who knew he was doing it could make out the words behind the words he wanted to scratch his head instead he had to go out and work his shift as if everything were normal it only seemed to last forever in fact it went as smoothly as most of the shifts he put in he pocketed a few nice tips and got stiffed once by a lieutenantcolonel with his left arm in a sling scipio hoped the next yankee who shot him took better aim when he left the dining room after the lodge closed he found his family on the ragged edge of mutiny if i was any more bored id be dead cassius snarled thanks for bringin em by xerxes jerry dover saidnow he used the alias that seemed to fit scipio better than his real name these days glad you could do it uhhuh scipio said still puzzled about what was going on something yesbut what he nodded to bathsheba who was yawning lets go the streets of the white part of augusta were quiet and peaceful when they got back to the fence around the terry another cop who knew scipio let them through without any trouble about being out after curfew he laughed as he opened a barbedwire gate much like the one that would keep livestock in a pen you aint hardly gonna know the place he said the rest of the goons at the gate thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard only little by little did scipio and his family discover what they meant at first he just thought things seemed too quiet curfew or no curfew there was usually a lot of furtive life on the dark streets of the terry a lot of it was dangerous life but it was life tonight no tonight cassius figured it out first from the number of doors standing open that shouldnt have do jesus he exclaimed his voice echoing in the empty street they done had another cleanout as soon as he pointed it out it was obvious he was right the northern part of the terry had been scooped up and sent off to campsor somewheremonths before as far as scipio knew nobodyd come back either now the heart had been ripped out of the colored part of augusta and all in one day scipio thought dazedly all in half a day in fact how long had they been planning this to bring it off with such practiced efficiency and where had they got the practice bathsheba squeezed his hand hard if it wasnt fo jerry dover theydve got us too she whispered and that was as true as what cassius had said somehow dover had known ahead of time hed done what he couldor what hed wanted to do now scipio owed him not just one life but four he thanked the god he mostly didnt believe in for the debt and he wondered how jerry dover would want it repaid for there would be a price there was always a price scipio knew that in his bones in his belly in his balls for a negro in the csa there was always a price after his mother died cincinnatus driver had watched his father like a hawk he knew the stories about old longmarried couples where when one spouse died the other followed soon after as if finding life alone not worth living but seneca driver seemed as well as ever if anything he seemed better than he had for some time his shoulders came up his back straightened i is free of a burden he said once that werent your mama we laid in the ground your mama was gone a long time ago what we buried that there was just the husk cincinnatus nodded i saw that pa i saw that real plain and clear wasnt sure you could oh i seen it his father said couldnt do nothin about it but i seen it if that last sentence wasnt a summary of negroes troubles in the confederate states cincinnatus had never heard one and the government and the freedom party had always moved more carefully in kentucky than rumor said they did farther south kentucky had spent a generation in the usa negroes here knew what it meant to be citizens not just downtrodden residents even some whites here were less hostile than they might have been that meant the barbedwire perimeter that went up around covingtons colored district came as a special shock cincinnatus had heard that such things had happened elsewhere he didnt think they could here finding he was wrong rocked him finding he was wrong also trapped him the perimeter included the bank of the licking river and included motorboats with machine guns on the river to make sure nobody tried cutting the wire there the first place cincinnatus went when he found out what was going on was inevitably lucullus woods barbecue shack he found the plump proprietor in a worse state of shock than he was they told me they wasnt gonna do this lucullus said they told me they fuckin lied he sounded as dazed as a man staggering out of a train wreck seeing lucullus struck all in a heap discomfited cincinnatus worse than the barbed wire itself what you gonna do about it he demanded what can you do about it do jesus i dunno lucullus answered they done ruined me when they done this odds were he had that right almost as many whites as blacks had come to his place no more that perimeter would keep people out as well as keeping them in you can still get word through that was a statement not a question cincinnatus refused to believe anything different what if i kin lucullus didnt deny it he just spread his hands pale palms up aint gonna do me a hell of a lot of good whos gonna pay any mind to a nigger all shut up like he was in jail they gonna haul us off to them camps nobody never comes out of that had a chilling feel of probability to cincinnatus even so he gave lucullus the best answer he could what about luther bliss he hated the man hated and feared him but bliss remained a name to conjure with he hoped hearing it would at least snap lucullus out of his funk and make him start thinking straight again and it worked lucullus very visibly gathered himself mebbe he said but only mebbe dammit freedom party fellas is hunting bliss right now like you wouldnt believe hell i wouldnt cincinnatus said if they know hes around theyll want him dead hes too dangerous for them to leave him breathin aint that all the more reason for you to git back in touch with him mebbe lucullus said again what kin he do though they gots police an them damn stalwarts all around anytime they wants to come in an start gettin rid of us we got guns you got guns you aint gonna tell me you aint got guns cause i know you lie if you do cincinnatus said they come in like that they be sorry oh yeah lucullus jowls wobbled as he nodded they be sorry but we be sorrier any kind o fight like that we loses guns we got is enough to make them fuckers think twice aint enough to stop em caint be and you got to know that too they uses barrels we aint got nothin cept featherston fizzes against em they sends in asskickers to bomb us flat we aint even got that we kin hurt em they kin fuckin kill us an i reckon they is lookin fo the excuse to do it cincinnatus grunted lucullus had to be right against the massed power of the csa the local negroes would lose and the confederate authorities might well be looking for an excuse to move in and wipe them out which meant you got to git hold o bliss cincinnatus said again what good it do me lucullus asked sourly i done told you yeah you told me but so what cincinnatus said and lucullus stared at him the barbecue cook usually dominated between them not now cincinnatus went on were all shut up in here bad things start happenin out past the wire how could we have much to do with em but you kin get hold of luther bliss and that son of a bitch got other ofays wholl do what he tell em to lucullus kept right on staring but now in a new way mebbe he said once more this time he didnt seem to mean youre crazy even so he warned luther bliss dont care nothin about niggers just cause theys niggers shit i know that luther bliss hates everybody under the sun cincinnatus said startling a laugh out of lucullus but the people luther bliss hates most are freedom party men and the confederates who run things we hate them people too so wes handy for him well yeah but the people he hates next most is reds lucullus said you got to remember that dont help me none you got any better ideas cincinnatus demanded and then you got any ideas at all lucullus glared at him if anything that relieved cincinnatus who didnt like seeing the younger man paralyzed cincinnatus would have done almost anything to get lucullus wits working again enraging him seemed a small price to pay lucullus said i kin git hold o him he kin do dat shit no doubt about it but how much good it gonna do us what do you mean cincinnatus asked they got the wire around us we is in here whatever they wants to do with uswhatever they wants to do to usthey got us where they wants us how we get out how we get away cincinnatus laughed at him they gonna let us out they gonna let a lot of us out anyways lucullus jaw dropped cincinnatus drove the point home whos gonna do their nigger work for em if they dont long as they need that we aint cooped up in here all the time you hope we aint lucullus said but a little spirit came back into his voice talk to luther bliss cincinnatus repeated hell they let me out for anything ill talk to him like he listen to you lucullus said scornfully you aint got no guns you aint got no people who kin do stuff i tells you somethinyou git outa the barbed wire you try an get your black ass back to the usa aint farjus over de river might as well be over the moon right now cincinnatus said with a bitter laugh confederate soldiers holdin that part of ohio by what i hear theyre worse on colored folks than the freedom party boys are here they reckon theyre united states colored folks an so they got to be the enemy cincinnatus thought that was a pretty good bet too he added sides i aint leavin without my pa you is the stubbornest nigger ever hatched lucullus said onliest thing that hard head good for nowadays is gittin you killed he made shooing motions with his hands go on git i dont want you round no mo cincinnatus didnt want to be in the barbecue place anymore he didnt want to be in covington anymore he didnt want to be in kentucky at all anymore the trouble was nobody else gave a damn what he wanted or didnt want cane tapping the ground ahead of him he walked out for a better look at what the whites in covington had done hed seen more formidable assemblages of barbed wire when he was driving trucks in the last war but those had been made to hold out soldiers not to hold in civilians for that what the cops and the stalwarts had run up would do fine normally making a fence out of barbed wire would have been nigger work whites had done it here though that worried cincinnatus if whites decided they could do nigger work what reason would they have to keep any negroes around in the csa a swagbellied cop with a submachine gun strolled along outside the fence he spat a brown stream of tobacco juice onto the sidewalk the sun sparkled from the enameled freedom party pin on his lapel hadnt jake featherston climbed to power by going on and on about how whites were better than blacks how could they be better than blacks if they got rid of all the blacks then they would have to work things out among themselves race wouldnt trump class anymore the way it always had in the confederacy that fat policeman spat again his jaw worked as he shifted the chaw from one cheek to the other did he care about such details did the countless others like him care cincinnatus couldnt make himself believe it theyd get rid of negroes first and worry about what happened after that later on cincinnatus suddenly felt as trapped as lucullus did up till now the rumors about what the confederates were doing to negroes farther south in the csa things hed heard at luculluss place and the brass monkey and in other saloons had seemed too strange too ridiculous to worry him now he looked out at the rest of covington through barbed wire it wasnt even rusty yet sunshine sparkled off the sharp points of the teeth he couldnt get out past it not unless that cop and his pals let him and they could reach into the colored district whenever they pleased he didnt like the combination not even a little bit except for trying to escape with his father as soon as he got even a halfway decent chance though he didnt know what he could do about it i need a rifle he thought reckon i can get one from lucullus they come after me they gonna pay for everything they get dead night again and the josephus daniels creeping along through the darkness sam carsten peered out at the black water ahead as if he could see the mines floating in it he couldnt and he knew as much he had to hope the destroyer escort had a good chart of these waters and that she could dodge the mines if she couldnt some of them were packed with enough tnt to blow a ship high enough out of the water to show her keel to anybody who happened to be watching out on the open sea he didnt worry much about mines here in the narrow waters of chesapeake bay he couldnt help it at the wheel pat cooley seemed the picture of calm were just about through the worst of it sir he said glad to hear it sam said if we go skyhigh in the next couple of minutes im going to remind you you said that the exec chuckled oh i expect ill remember it myself sam set a hand on his shoulder the kid was all rightnot a nerve in his body or none that showed and he was a married man too which made it harder for him family all right carsten asked oh yes sir cooley answered janes over the chicken pox and sally didnt catch em his wife had worried when his daughter came down with the ailment because she didnt remember having it as a little girl if she hadnt got chicken pox by now though she must have had them then because anybody who could catch them damn well would another twenty minutes crawled by in a day or two the soft throb of the engines came up through sams shoes the sound the feel were as important as his own pulse if they stopped the ship was in mortal peril as things were i think were out of it now sam said cooley nodded i do believe youre rightexcept for the little bastards that came off their chains and started drifting he paused and unless one side or the other laid some mines nobody knows about that arent on our charts youre full of cheerful thoughts today arent you sam said pat cooley just grinned either or both of those things was perfectly possible and both men knew it too well those werent the only nasty possibilities either and sam also knew that only too well he spoke into a voice tube you there bevacqua not me skip came the voice from the other end i been asleep the last couple weeks a snore floated out of the tube yeah well keep your ears open while youre snoozing this is good submarine country sam said will do skip vince bevacqua said the petty officer was the best hydrophone man the josephus daniels carried which was why he was on duty now back during the great war hydrophones had been as near worthless as made no difference the state of the art had come a long way since then now hydrophones shot out bursts of sound waves and listened for echoesit was almost like yranging underwater it gave ships like this one a real chance when they went after subs not the best submarine country cooley observed waters pretty shallow well sure pat but thats not quite what i meant sam said its good sub country because weve just made it past the minefields when some people get through something like that they go whew and forget theyre not all the way out of the woods they get careless let their guard down and thats when the bastards on the other side drop the hammer on them the bridge was dark showing a light in crowded contested waters like these was the fastest way sam could think of to get the hammer dropped on him in the gloom he watched the exec swing toward him start to say something and then think twice after a few seconds cooley tried again thats pretty sensible sir he sounded amazed or at least bemused carsten chuckled under his breath you live and learn he told the younger man youve got an academy ring you got your learning all boiled down and served up to you and thats great it gives you a hell of a head start by the time you get to my age youll be a fourstriper or more likely an admiral ive had to soak all this stuff up the hard waybut ive had a lot longer to do it than you have again pat cooley started to answer again he checked himself so he could pick his words with care slowly he said sir i dont think thats the kind of thing they teach you at annapolis i think its the kind of thing you do learn with experienceif you ever learn it at all yourenot what i expected when they told me id serve under a mustang no eh instead of chuckling sam laughed out loud now sorry to disappoint you my knuckles dont drag on the decknot most of the time anyway i dont dribble tobacco juice down my front and i dont spend all my time with cpos a lot of mustangs did hang around with ratings as much as they could those were still the men they found most like themselves sam had been warned against that when he got promoted he suspected every mustang did a lot of them though didnt listen to the warning he had sir youre doing your best to embarrass me cooley said after one more longish pause your best is pretty good too he laughed as sam had unlike sam though he sounded distinctly uneasy when he did it a tinny ghost vince bevacquas voice floated out of the mouth of the tube skipper ive got a contact somethings moving down theredepth about seventy range half a mile bearing seventy sam echoed thoughtfully that was below periscope depth if the hydrophone man had spotted a submersible the boat didnt know the josephus daniels was in the neighborhoodunless it had spotted the destroyer escort and submerged before bevacqua realized it was there sam found that unlikely he knew how good the petty officer was even if he didnt hang around with him change course to mr cooley he said switching to business i am changing course to siraye aye the exec replied sam tapped a waiting sailor on the shoulder tell the depthcharge crews to be ready at my order aye aye sir the sailor dashed away he didnt care whether sam was a mustang to a kid like him the old man was the old man regardless of anything and if the old man happened to be well on the way toward being an old manthat still didnt matter much ill be damned if he thinks were anywhere around sir bevacqua said and then whoopstake it back hes heard us hes picking up speed and heading for the surface lets get him sam said tell me when and ill pass it on to the guys who toss ash cans will do skipper bevacqua waited maybe fifteen seconds then said now launch depth charges sam shouted through the pa systemno need to keep quiet anymore during the great war ash cans had rolled off over the stern the state of the art was better now two projectors flung depth charges well ahead of the ship the charges arced through the air and splashed into the ocean all engines reverse cooley said sam nodded depth charges bursting in shallow water could blow the bow off the ship that had launched them carsten recalled the pathetic signal hed heard about from a destroyer escort that had had that misfortune befall her i have busted myself if it happened to him hed be busted too probably all the way to seaman second class even though the josephus daniels had backed engines the ash cans did their damnedest to lift her out of the water sam felt as if somebodyd whacked him on the soles of his feet with a board water rose and then splashed back into the sea more bursts roiled the atlantic somebody at the bow whooped shes coming up searchlights sam barked and the night lit up he knew the chance he was taking if cs planes spotted him before he settled the sub he was in a world of trouble have to settle it quick then he thought men spilled out of the damaged submersibles conning tower and ran for the cannon on the deck it was only a threeinch gun but carstens destroyer escort wasnt exactly a battlewagon if that gun hit it could hurt let em have it sam yelled the forward gun spoke in a voice like an angry gods the antiaircraft cannon at the bow started barking too they were more than good enough to tear up an unarmored target like a sub the enemy got off one shot which went wild then men on that deck started dropping as if a harvester were rumbling down it white flag three people shouted the same thing at the same time cease fire sam yelled through the intercom and then if they make a move toward that gun blow em all to hell he turned away from the mike and spoke to cooley approach and take survivors aye aye sir the exec said he had a different worry i hope to hell shes not one of our boats gurk sam said that hadnt even crossed his mind it wasnt impossible in these waters one more thing he knew too well they wouldnt just bust him for that theyd boot him out of the navy as the josephus daniels drew closer he breathed again the shape of the conning tower and the lines of the hull were different from those of us boats and the sailors tumbling into life rafts wore dark gray tunics and trousers they were confederates all right a last couple of men popped out of the hatch atop the conning tower the submersible startled rapidly settling down into the sea they opened the scuttling cocks sam realized he swore but halfheartedly in their place he would have done the same thing watching them will be fun cooley said we havent got a brig even if we did it wouldnt hold that many well keep them up on deck where the machine guns will bear sam answered i dont see how we can make our cruise with them along though ill wireless for instructions as soon as the prisoners were aboard he doused the searchlight the pharmacists mate did what he could for the wounded sam went down to the deck and called for the enemy skipper here i am sir a glumsounding man said lieutenant reed talcott at your service i dont thank you for wrecking us but i do for picking us up he tipped a greasy cap hed somehow kept on his head part of the game lieutenant sam said and gave his own name if it makes you feel any better ive been sunk too not one damn bit talcott said promptly sam laughed all right cant say as i blame you well put you somewhere out of the way and then well get on with the war not for the first time clarence potter thought that richmond and philadelphia were both too close to the csus border for comfort when war came between the two countriesand it came and came and camethe capitals were appallingly vulnerable they got more so as time went by too each side developed new and betteror was worse the right word ways to punish the other for all practical purposes the damnyankees had abandoned washington as an administrative center it just made too handy a target at the moment though washington wasnt the first thing on potters mind he stood behind a sawhorse in capitol square one of at least a dozen that had red rope strung from them to form a perimeter signs hung from the rope warning unexploded bomb if that wasnt enough to get the message across the signs also displayed the skull and crossbones even so a woman started to duck under the ropes to take a shortcut to the capitol get the hell out of there lady a sergeant shouted at her you want to get your stupid ass blown off well she sniffed such language the sergeant sighed and turned to potter it aint like she hasnt got enough ass so she couldnt use some of it blown off he said the intelligence officer chuckled indeed the woman hadnt missed any meals the noncom a member of the bomb disposal unit went on jesus god sir you wouldnt reckon people could be so stinking stupid though would you oh i dont know potter said that kind of thing rarely surprises me a lot of people are damn fools and theres not much you can do about it except maybe try to keep them from killing themselves ugly bitch wouldnt have been that much of a loss the sergeant sighed again still and all i expect youre right i just wish the yankees were damn fools potter pointed toward the hole in the ground where the sergeants colleagues were working if they made better ordnance that would have gone off he said though he knew confederate munitions factories turned out their fair share of duds too but the sergeant shook his head it aint necessarily so sir some of these fuckersuh excuse me ive heard the word before potter said dryly ive even used the word before oh the sergeant eyed the wreathed stars on either side of his collar i guess maybe anyways though like i was saying some of em have time fuses so they go boom when people arent expecting em youll have heard about that wont you i sure have potter said so you have to get them out of there before they go off id be lying if i said i envied you sometimes we get em out sometimes we have to defuse em where theyre at the bdu sergeant said and thats what i meant when i said i wished the damnyankees were fools some of their time fusesre just time fuses then we race the clock like some of em though some of em are boobytrapped so theyll go off when we start messing with the time fuse theyll put those on ordinary bombs too so theyll explode if you tinker sons of bitches want to kill us off see so then more of their time bombsll work thats unpleasant potter said how do you handle those carefully the sergeant answered potter laughed not that the younger man was kidding here was a glimpse of a catandmouse game he hadnt imagined before of course the yankees wanted to blow up the people who got rid of unexploded bombs it made perfect military sensebut it was hard on the men of the bdu he asked do we do the same thing to them beats me sir the noncom said but if we dont were missing a hell of a chance all right thats fair enoughno reason to expect you to know potter said he could find out for himselfor maybe he couldnt depending on how tight security was discovering the answer to that might be interesting all by itself hey cochrane somebody bawled from the direction of the hole in the ground give me a hand setting up the clockstopper were going to need it on this son of a bitch the clockstopper potter said intrigued sir i cant talk about that the sergeantpresumably cochranesaid securityyou know how it is and now if youll excuse me he sketched a salute and hurried away no bomb burst shattered the calm of richmond in the next half hour so potter supposed the clockstopper and whatever other arcane tools the bomb disposal unit brought to bear on the bomb did what they were supposed to do the war spawned every kind of specialist not all of whom operated with as many eyes upon them as did the men of the bdu after potter went back to the war department he remarked on what hed seen to nathan bedford forrest iii he couldnt very well breach security with the head of the general staff if forrest didnt have the right to know everything there was to know nobody in the csa did given the way things were in the confederacy these days quite possibly no one but jake featherston did potter preferred not to dwell on that as things turned out he didnt have to dwell on it because general forrest knew enough to satisfy his curiosity nodding forrest said the bdu men are some of the best we have every one of them is a volunteer too potter couldnt look out on richmond from forrests office which had plywood in place of window glass before long window glass here in the capital might grow as extinct as the passenger pigeon of course the same was no doubt just as true in philadelphia after pausing to light a cigarette the intelligence officer said i hadnt thought about it but im not surprised you wouldnt want somebody who didnt want to be there messing with those bombs thats what everybody thinks forrest agreed let me steal one of those from you potter gave him a smoke he tapped it on his desk a couple of times to settle the tobacco then stuck it in his mouth potter lit a match for him and held it out thanks forrest said he took a drag blew out a plume of smoke and looked up at the ceiling a lot of men volunteer for the duty good potter said id worry if they didnt yes yes forrest sounded impatient when you put it that way so would i but do you know how long the average service career of a bdu man is no sir potter admitted i dont have the faintest idea two and a half monthsi saw the number just the other day so its fresh in my mind forrest said we need a lot of volunteers by the way we dont talk about that number to bdu personnel not under any circumstances i believe it potter also believed that bdu men could probably figure it out for themselves or at least come close they all had to be mourning friends and comrades two and a half months that was worse than he would have guessed nos morituri te salutamus he murmured nathan bedford forrest iii nodded the only good thing you can say about the business is that if something goes wrong its all over before the poor bastards know it the bombs go off faster than the nervous system can react that does matter potter said he hadnt been at the front in the last war but hed been close enough to have seen horrors aplenty dreadfully wounded men as far as he was concerned were worse horrors than the dead no matter how gruesome a corpse was it was beyond suffering for the living pain went on and on the telephone rang forrest here forrest said potter left he didnt wait for forrest to wave him out because he lacked clearance to hear whatever the chief of the general staff was talking about disappearing without being asked in such circumstances was part of the etiquette of the securityconscious potters own aboveground office to which hed defiantly returned also had plywood in place of glass glass these days was not only a luxury but a dangerous luxury in a bomb burst shards were so many flying knives they could chop a man into hamburger in the blink of an eye potter knew that he missed being able to see out even so one thingsince he couldnt look out the window he couldnt use looking out the window as an excuse for daydreaming he had to buckle down and tackle the work on his desk and so reluctantly he did on top of the pile was an urgent request from the mormons of deseret for whatever the confederacy could send them getting supplies to them was harder than it had been when the rebellion first broke out the us noose was tightening potter had known it would in a way encouraging and helping the mormon uprising seemed dreadfully unfair those people had not a chance in the world of winning but they were eager to try eager to the point of madness it was enough to make a man with a conscience feel guilty of course a man with that kind of conscience had no business getting into intelligence in the first place potter knew as much he also knew his damnyankee counterparts were doing everything they could to arm the negro terrorists in the csa if turnabout wasnt fair play what was the only thing he really felt bad about was that there were so many more negroes in the confederate states than mormons in the united states blacks caused more trouble for his side than the religious maniacs did for the enemy he wondered whether some confederate operative had suggested auto bombs to the mormons or theyd come up with them on their own either way they made a viciously effective weapon for the weak against the strong again negroes in the csa had proved thatand continued to prove it whenever they got the chance we need to keep this uprising alive as long as we can he wrote where else can we tie down so many us soldiers at so little cost to ourselves even though the question was rhetorical as he wrote it he knew it did have a possible answer if canada flared into rebellion the yankees would need endless divisions to hold it down but despite assiduous efforts the confederates hadnt made a lot of friends up there to canadians they might as well have been yankees themselves that infuriated clarence potterand every other confederate whod ever run into the problembut fury didnt do much good if any outsiders could make the canadians rise up the confederates werent the ones the british were potter paused thoughtfully winston churchill was supposed to favor quixotic schemes like thatand keeping the usa busy was as much in britains interest as it was in the csas a memorandum from potter would never reach the british prime minister a memorandum from jake featherston on the other hand potter nodded to himself churchill might not agree that was the chance you took but he wouldnt be able to ignore the request from an allied head of state and featherston would look at a memorandum from potter the intelligence officer paused for a moment to gather his thoughts then began to write jake featherston often felt busier than a onelegged man in an asskicking contest he sometimes thought he wouldnt have wanted to become president if hed known ahead of time how much work the job was that wasnt truedown deep in his heart he knew as muchbut it gave him something to complain about take paperwork hed never known what an obscene word that could be till he came to the gray house no matter how much he gave to other people he still had plenty and then some paperwork was the price he paid for being boss every once in a while he ran into something he really needed to see when he came to a memorandum from clarence potter he knew he had to read it for one thing potter would give him a hard time if he didnt and for another even though he trusted the intelligence officer about as far as he could throw him potter had a lefthanded way of looking at the world that was often valuable by his own lights potter was a patriot where his lights and jakes corresponded they got on fine as featherston read through this scheme he found himself nodding yeah he said when he was done about time we got some help from our socalled allies he knew as well as anybody that britain was heavily bogged down in western germany trying to hold on to the gains she and france had made when the war was shiny and new he recognized the feeling he had it himself the problem with grabbing a tiger by the tail was that letting go could hurt even worse than hanging on he picked up a pen and started to write if churchill wanted to play along this wouldnt cost the limeys muchand if it went off well it could bring the united states untold grief that wouldnt break jakes heart oh nofar from it his big worry was that churchill was too obsessed with the kaiser to care what happened on this side of the atlantic but the usa was the country that had taken canada and newfoundland away from england after the great war winston was almost as good at remembering offenses done him as jake was himself lulu he called from his office what is it mr president his secretary asked i want major hamilton right away major ira hamilton hurried into the presidents underground office inside of five minutes reporting as ordered sir he said he was tall thin and bespectacled he looked much more like a math teacher than a major good good jake thrust the paper at him i need you to put this into our fanciest code and send it to london just as fast as you can there was a reason hamilton looked like a math teacher up till the war started hed been a professor of mathematics at washington university ill do it sir he said it doesnt look too longit should go out this afternoon thatll be just fine major thank you kindly featherston was far more polite with people who were useful to him than with the rest of the world hamilton gave him a ragged salute and hurried away someone would keep a discreet eye on the unmilitary major to make sure he did what he was supposed to do and nothing else and someone would watch the man who watched hamilton and somebody would things had to work that way if you didnt keep an eye on people theyd make you wish you had jake even kept an eye on don partridge hed chosen his vice president because partridge was the mildest safest most inoffensive and most useless man he could findand he kept an eye on him anyway you couldnt be too careful some of the papers featherston plowed through were damage reports from the western part of the confederacy the damnyankees were trying to knock out the dams hed built on the tennessee and the cumberland rivers that infuriated him it alarmed him too the confederate states needed the electricity those dams produced it kept factories going and it changed millions of peoples lives he was as proud of those dams and what they did as of almost anything else his administration had accomplished almost was the key word there ferd koenig came in a couple of hours later good to see you by god jake said have a seat he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a bottle of fine tennessee sipping whiskey have a snort dont mind if i do koenig took the bottle from him raised it swallowed and passed it back virgins milk the corn that went in there died happy you better believe it jake swigged too velvet fire ran down his throat he set the bottle on the desk after one knock he wanted the taste he didnt want to get smashed so hows relocation coming tolerable better than tolerable matter of fact koenig answered one neighborhood at a time one town at a time we clean em out off they go they reckon theyre going to camps and they are what they dont reckon on is they dont come out again towns are all very well towns are better than all very well matter of fact jake said but theres still the core of the cotton countryfrom south carolina through georgia and alabama and mississippi into louisiana we thinned that out some when we brought in harvestersgot a bunch of niggers off the farms and into towns where we could deal with em easier got a bunch of em with rifles in their hands too ferdinand koenig said dryly they didnt have work anymore so they reckoned they might as well go out and start shooting white folks he wasnt wrong but featherston said we had trouble with em before that too which was also true he went on that whole goddamn black belts been up in arms ever since the great war damn whigs never were able to put it down all the way and weve had our own fun and games with it plenty of places down there where its never been safe for a white man to go around by himself in broad daylight let alone after the sun goes down thats only part of the problem koenig said in towns you can put barbed wire around the nigger district and after that you can go in and clean it out one chunk at a time however you want to the niggers in the countryside you cant cordon em off so easy they just slip away its like trying to scoop up water with a sieve gotta keep working on it jake said the attorney generals jowls wobbled as he nodded oh hell i know that he said but the real trouble is it takes a lot of manpower and we havent got a lot of people to spare not the way things are going i know i know featherston reached for the whiskey bottle again more heat trickled down his throat hed been so certain he could knock the usa out of the war in a hurry hed been so certainand hed been so wrong soldiers at the front were more important than anything else even people to help round up the niggers after yet another swig he added those trucks that pinkard came up with cant handle all the volume we need for this operation either theyre the best weve got koenig said and we dont have guards eating their guns all the goddamn time anymore either the way we did before we started using them i know that too dammit jake said impatiently we need something better thoughand no i dont know what it is any more than you do but something weve got to get rid of those niggers in great big old lots you can figure out damn near anything if you throw enough money and enough smart people at it ferd koenig observed is this worth throwing em at it or do we need the people and the money more somewhere else this is what we spent all that time wandering in the wilderness for jake said as if he were moses leading the csa to the promised land that was exactly how he felt too if we dont do this were letting the country down well all right koenig nodded again i feel the same way but i needed to make sure you did we can do thatyou know we can but itll likely mean pulling those people and that money away from the war effort this is the war effort jake featherston declared what else would you call it this is what counts even as he spoke he heard the rumble of us artillery fire not nearly far enough to the north he nodded anyway we clean out the coons well do something for this country thatll last till the end of time all right then well tend to it koenig sighed i wish we had as many people as the yankees do they can afford to keep more balls in the air at the same time than we can i dont care about their balls in the air those arent the ones i aim to kick jake said heh ferd koenig said well i hope we can do it thats all he was listening to the gunfire from the north too he didnt brush it aside the way jake did it worried him and he made no secret about that not even to featherston showing what he thought took nerve lesser men had ended up in camps for lesser offenses but regardless of whether koenig agreed with jakes policies his personal loyalty was unshakable jake could count the people he fully trusted on his fingerssometimes on a bad day on his thumbsbut ferd always had been was and always would be one of them we will featherston retained his conviction in his own destiny the show will be starting soon and well squash em flat youll see expect i will koenig didnt say one way or the other he didnt even leave it hanging in the air he believed in jakes destiny too hed gone on believing in it through the black years in the middle twenties when so many others wrote jake and the freedom party off he asked you need me for anything else dont think so jake answered but we do need some kind of way to get rid of more niggers faster you put some bright boys on that and see what they can come up with right ferdinand koenig heaved himself out of his chair and headed for the door jake had no idea what he would come up with or even if he would come up with anything but had no doubt he would look and look hard if you looked hard enough you generally found something muttering jake went back to looking through his paperwork he wished he thought he would find anything else important or even something interesting in there fat chance he muttered fat fucking chance he made sure he kept his voice down lulu didnt like to hear him swear that didnt always stop him but it did a good part of the time and then he turned up a report from an outfit called the huntsville rocket society he wondered how the hell anything that bizarre had made it onto his desk then he saw why the brigadier general in charge of air defense of alabama and mississippi endorsed it writing however startling these claims sound i believe they can be made real soon enough to prove useful in the present conflict that made jake read it more carefully than he would have otherwise son of a bitch he murmured halfway through son of a bitch wouldnt that be something if they could viii as the weather heated up the pow camp near andersonville georgia did an increasingly good impression of hell with the heat came humidity with the humidity came thunderstorms that awed jonathan moss the red dirt in the camp turned to something not a great deal thicker than tomato soup after one of those downpours and the mosquitoes came moss had known mosquitoes up in canada too these seemed a larger and more virulent breed he slapped and swore and itched he was anything but the only one nick cantarella said this one i smashed last night you could hang machine guns under its wings and go to war in it who says they dont moss answered that would account for the size of some of the bites ive got the other officer laughed youre a funny guy major funny like a crutch moss said and then colonel summers ought to do something about it we could all come down with yellow fever do what cantarella asked in reasonable tones moses parted the red sea but all he did was plague the egyptians with bugs god was the one who had to call em off patiently moss answered moses couldnt ask for bug repellent and flit come to think of it pharaoh couldnt either but summers damn well can oh cantarella looked foolish well yeah moss didnt ask him how escape efforts were going he assumed they were still going he also assumed that much rain did tunnels no good he looked out the window out beyond the barbed wire even if the prisoners did get out of the camp could they cross several states and get back to the usa they spoke with an accent very different from the locals they would be pursuedhe pictured bloodhounds straight out of uncle toms cabin and the people they metthe white ones anyhowwould be freedom party fanatics put that all together and staying in the camp started to seem the better bargain but life here was no picnic either and prisoners of war had a duty to escape moss knew hed run if and when he found a chance as for what would happen after that hed worry about such things when he had to not before in due course citronella candles appeared in the prisoners barracks they filled the air with a spicy lemony scent as they burned the odor was alleged to discourage mosquitoes maybe moss got bitten a little less often after that on the other hand maybe he didnt he wasnt convinced one way or the other guards went through the camp with spray pumps the mist that came out of them smelled something like mothballs and something like gasoline moss had no idea what it did to mosquitoes it made him want to wear a gas mask since he didnt have one he just had to put up with it again he wasnt sure how much difference the spraying made the bugs didnt disappear however much he wished they would of course nobody was spraying outside the camp even if mosquitoes died by the thousands inside the barbed wire plenty of replacements flew on in to sample the flavor delights of prisoner of war on the hoof colonel summers once prodded kept right on complaining both to the confederate authorities and to his fellow prisoners what they really need to do is spray a thin film of oil over every pond and puddle they can find he said that would kill the mosquito larvae and then we really might get some relief well why dont they moss said it wouldnt just benefit us their own health would get better too he thought like the attorney he was weighing advantages and disadvantages summers only shrugged they say they havent got the manpower for it in a way thats good news moss said if theyre stretched too thin to take care of important things behind the lines pretty soon theyll be stretched too thin to take care of things at the front like a lawyerand like a prisonerhe bent reality so it looked better than it really was that hasnt happened yet colonel summers brought him back to earth with a dose of the current news are you sure sir moss asked anything you see in the papers the guards give us is just so much freedom party garbage im sure and summers sounded very sure indeed moss knew there were a couple of clandestine wireless sets in the camp he knew no more than that which was a good thing for all concerned he looked around the barracks two or three of the men were new fish new officers for whom nobody here could vouch they probably came from the united states they talked as if they did but good confederate spies would sound like yankees the less summers said while they were around the better machinegun fire woke moss in the middle of the night not quite a week later his first reaction was fury theyd pulled off an escape attempt and they hadnt included him his second reaction was despair if the guards were shooting the attempt couldnt have amounted to much was this the best his countrymen could do he got very little sleep the rest of the night at roll call the next morning the confederate guards swaggered and strutted like pouter pigeons damn niggers came sniffin round the camp last night one of them said we drove em off thoughyou better believe it however proud of themselves they were their posturing only filled moss with relief nothing inside here had gone wrong if the guards wanted to jump up and down because theyd beaten back a few sorry guerrillas they were welcome to as far as he was concerned later that day he found an excuse to amble around the grounds with nick cantarella as casually as he could he asked do we have any way of getting in touch with those colored men on the other side of the barbed wire cantarella took a couple of steps without saying anything what he did say at last was i ought to tell you i dont know what youre talking about why moss asked they could do us a lot of good if we ever happened to get on the other side of the wire ourselves maybe cantarella paused to light a cigarette it was one of the lousy us brands that came in red cross packages from the north prisoners could sometimes get the much better confederate tobacco from the guards quiet little deals like that happened every now and again after the first drag cantarella made a face tastes like straw and horseshit a moment later he added want one sure moss took one then leaned close to get a light the tobacco was bad but bad tobacco beat the hell out of no tobacco he blew out smoke and then asked how come just maybe the other officer looked around before answering satisfied nobody else was in earshot he said for one thing if the confederates catch us with them were dead no ifs ands or buts dead that was probably true moss shook his headno that was bound to be true the confederate states played by the usual international rules when they fought the united states they played by no rules at all when they fought their own negroes by all the signs the negroes returned the favorif that was the word moss said but if weve got a better chance of not getting caught at all maybe nick cantarella said again even more dubiously than before but why should they help us get back to the usa as if to a child moss answered because were fighting featherston too terrific the younger man said doesnt that make them more likely to give us rifles and enlist us you want to be a guerrilla yourself i dont or not very much its not what i was trained for but i wouldnt have a chinamans chance of convincing the smokes of that hed been an artilleryman before he got caught some of the people here would be good at it moss said infantry officers might make the black guerrillas considerably more effective they really did have training in what the negroes were trying to do moss himself was in cantarellas boat all his military expertise such as it was centered on airplanes he didnt think the guerrillas would be taking to the air anytime soon a flight of a dozen biplanes buzzing along at not much above treetop height made him wonder if he was wrong those werent military aircraft except in the sense that any aircraft could be military when you had them and the other fellows didnt as if to prove the point and to show whose side they were on they dropped bombs on the woods out beyond the prison camp the explosions set moss teeth on edge think theyll hit anything in there he asked cantarella oh theyll hit something the other officer answered with an expressive shrug whether itll be anything worth hitting thats liable to be a different question looking like they were just tossing those bombs out of the cockpit moss said thats how this whole business got started back when the great war was new if you say so cantarella wasnt old enough to remember the start of the great war he sure as hell hadnt been flying then as moss had a few days later moss put the question hed asked cantarella to colonel summers the senior officer looked at him as if hed suddenly started spouting cherokee trust a bunch of raggedyass niggers you must be kidding major but for his accent he sounded like a confederate himself with such patience as he could muster moss asked do you know anybody who hates jake featherston moreor who has better reason to summers ignored that besides major weve got no way to get in touch with the spooks he sounded like a man anxious to close off a subject he found distasteful he might have been a maiden lady forced into talking about the facts of life moss didnt laugh in his face which proved military discipline still held he did say sir we have all kinds of deals cooking that stretch farther than the camp spread a few dollars around and you can do damn near anything not this summers spoke as if from on high not this by god no confederate guard is going to go out and get hold of the niggers for us thatd be like asking them to cut their own throats he had a pointof sorts there are bound to be ways if we look for them moss persisted we havent even tried once were outside the barbed wire major you may put your faith in niggers or christian science or any other damnfool thing your heart desires colonel summers said until then i make the decisions and i have made this one is that clear enough for you or shall i be more explicit you are very clear sir moss turned the title of respect into one of reproach summers heard the reproach and went red will that be all major he asked in a voice like ice i suppose so moss answered bitterly after all were not going anywhere are we oh for christs sake jefferson pinkard slammed down the telephone and scowled at it as if it were a rattlesnake son of a bitch he added for good measure he slammed a fist down on his desk his coffee mug and the gooseneck lamp there jumped he had to grab the lamp to keep it from toppling over hed hated calls from richmond ever since he started running camps he had good reason for hating them too richmond had a habit of wanting miracles and of wanting them yesterday jeff had already given them onea more efficient more secure way of disposing of excess negroes than theyd ever had before now that wasnt good enough for them anymore he had to come up with something better yet he hoped the other people who were running camps had got the same call let one of them have a brainstorm for a change fat chance he muttered some of those people could blow their brains out if they sneezed goddammit he knew the question was ridiculous and unfair that didnt stop him from worrying at it like a dog worrying at a bone that was plumb out of meat how could you get rid of more spooks faster than with this fleet of special trucks oh you could use more trucks but that wasnt the answer richmond wanted to hear richmond wanted something different something spiffy something where you could wave a hand and all of a sudden a thousand negroes werent there anymore and richmond needed something like that too pinkard couldnt very well deny it all he had to do was look across the railroad tracks at the new womens half of the camp towns were getting their colored districts emptied out one after another the blacks came into places like camp determination they came in and they didnt come out againnot alive anyway how many niggers were there in the confederate states how many could the camps dispose of every day how long would the csa need to start really cutting into their numbers gotta be done jeff said heavily as if someone had denied it its a tough job but somebodys got to do it every now and then the sheer amount of work he had to do tempted him toward selfpity he pushed back his chair and got to his feet he could look out at the camp from the windowno substitute for prowling through it but sometimes a fast way to spot trouble before it got out of hand barbed wire and machinegun towers separated the administrative block from the seething misery in the main compound at the moment a long line of blacks was snaking forward the skinny men often eager to board the trucks that would they thought take them to another camp in fact their journey would be strictly oneway that they didnt know it was one of the beauties of the scheme for their ignorance kept them docile pinkard shook his head how could you come up with anything better than this oh sure it used a lot of trucks but so what it did the job didnt it some people were just never satisfied that was all he stuck his head into the chief guards office vern green was second in command here and needed to know where jeff was when he wasnt at the camp im going into town for a little while pinkard told him anything goes wrong send somebody after me will do boss green knew jeff wouldnt be anywhere but three or four places in snyder one of them far more likely than any of the other finding him wouldnt be hard green couldnt help adding things are smooth though yeah i know theyre smooth now anyways pinkard said but just in case i mean sure sure vernon green nodded he smiled he was no less ambitious than mercer scott had been back in louisiana like scott green undoubtedly reported back to someone in richmond about how jeff did his job but he wasnt so obnoxious about it scott had had a drill sergeants manner and a face like a boot green smiled a lot of the time whether there was anything to smile about or not he caught his flies with honey not vinegar he caught a lot of them however he did it and that was what a secondincommand was for as camp commandant pinkard had a motorcar laid on he could have had a driver too but he didnt want one he could drive himself just fine guards saluted as he left the camp he would have to go through all the boring formalities getting back in he shrugged he would have had the guards heads if they were anything but careful about letting people into camp determination snyder texas was a nice little town of perhaps three thousand people before the camp went up business there had centered on cattle and on ginning the cotton grown in the surrounding countryside and making cottonseed cake that the cattle ate the influx of guards had everybody in the fourstreet central business district smiling by local standards they made good money and they werent shy about spending it and new houses were going up because a lot of the guards were married men and didnt want to live right by the camp whoeverd named the roads in snyder had no imagination at all the ones that ran eastwest were numbered streets the ones that ran northsouth were avenues identified by letter he pulled up in front of a house on thirtyfirst street near avenue q in the southern part of town two boys were wrestling on the threadbare lawn in front of the house they broke off when he got out of the motorcar papa jeff they yelled its papa jeff they ran up to him and tried out a couple of tackles that would have drawn flags on any football field in the csa or usa fortunately they were still too little to flatten him he ruffled their hair he liked chick blades sons he liked chick blades widow even more easy there he told the kids trying to pry them loose from his legs without damaging them it wasnt easy they clung like limpets is your mama home he asked them that did the trick better than any wrestling hold she sure is they said together and dashed toward the house yelling ma ma papa jeffs here if the racket wasnt enough to wake the dead it would have made them turn over in their graves a couple of times edith blades came out on the front porch she was a nicelooking blond woman in her early thirties each time jeff saw her she seemed a little less ravaged by her husbands suicide time did heal wounds jeff had got over the disastrous end of his first marriage to the point where he was game to try it again and so was edith though she wouldnt tie the knot till after the first anniversary of chick blades death they were getting there hello jeff good to see you she said as he walked up to the porch how are things things are he paused well they could be better come in and tell me about it she said and then boys go on and play papa jeff will be with you in a little bit they made disappointed noises but they didnt argue too much they were good boys wellbehaved boys shed done a fine job with them before chick died and afterwards jeff admired that he also admired the way she listened to him hed never known that with another womancertainly not with his first wife animal heat had held him and emily togetherand then broken them apart set yourself down edith said when she and jeff went back into the living room in a second he kissed her she let him do that in fact she responded eagerly whenever he tried for more than a kiss though she told him they had to wait that didnt make him angry he thought the more of her for being able to say no emily hadnt with him or with his best friend but he didnt want to remember emily how you doin here he asked you got everything you need sure do edith answered and im not sorry to be out of alexandria out of that house and theres the lords truth i do believe it jeff wouldnt have wanted to live in a house where somebodyd committed suicide actually chick had done it in his auto but still what do you think of texas theres so much of it and its so big and flat edith answered seemed like we were on the train forever and that was just getting most of the way across one state people act nice enough she held up a hand but tell me whats gone wrong at the camp jeff did the only thing he didnt tell her was that chicks suicide with auto exhaust had given him the idea for the trucks that used their fumes to kill off negroes he would never say a word about that not even if he was on fire there was such a thing as talking too damn much when he finished edith was suitably indignant for him theyve got their nerve she said after everything youve done cleaning up the colored problem for them then they expect more they should get down on their knees and thank god theyve got a good man like you jeff ha those people in richmond dont notice anybody but their own selves jeff said only belatedly after venting his spleen did he notice the size of the compliment shed paid him thank you darlin you say sweet things youre my sweetheart edith said her voice dead serious if i dont stick up for you whos going to instead of answering with words he kissed her again she pressed herself against him but when ever optimistic he let his hand fall on her thigh as if by accident she knocked it away he didnt get madhe laughed youre somethin so are you edith was laughing too even if she was he remained sure shed keep right on holding him at bay till their wedding night it wasnt as if she were a virginor she could have doubled up on marybut she was a respectable woman and she acted like one for a moment jeff thought the deep thrumming he heard was the pounding of the blood in his veins then he realized it was outside himself no sooner had he realized that than ediths kids ran in yelling ma papa jeff theres a million airplanes up in the sky come look quick what the jeff was off the couch and heading for the door as fast as he could go edith right behind him they stared up and up and up passing high above them scribing rulerstraight contrails across the sky were more big airplanes than jeff had ever seen before they flew east in what was obviously a strong defensive formation in staggered echelons where one bomber could easily fire on enemy fighters attacking another and enemy fighters here could mean only one thing confederate fighters damnyankees jefferson pinkard made the calculation almost without conscious thought i bet theyre headin for forth worth and dallas how could they edith said theyve got their nerve sending em out in the daytime pinkard had a nasty feeling the bombers would get through the war west of the mississippi had been quiet he doubted the confederate authorities were ready for an attack on this scale the damnyankees had pulled a fast one here will they drop bombs on us papa jeff frank blades asked anxiously nah now jeff spoke with great assurance he set a big meaty hand on the boys shoulders aint nothin here the yankees would ever want to touch dont you worry bout a thing not as far as that goes one thing chester martin had to give to lieutenant thayer monroe the kid could read a map we want to call down more fire on these emplacements in back of fredericksburg eh sergeant he said i make their positions out to be in square green that sound right to you there was something else martin had to give him he did ask the older mans opinion and sometimes even listened to it martin looked out from the ruins of fredericksburg toward the heights to the south and southwest they werent mountains they were hardly even hills but they were plenty to let the confederate field guns and mortars dug in on them make life hell on earth for the us soldiers in the virginia town yes sir i think green is right he said the platoon commander called for the signalman with the field telephone then shouted into it us artillery was still on the far side of the river chester had the nasty suspicion that the confederates had let the us army get foot soldiers over the rappahannock so they could bleed them white all attempts to break out from the town had failed none seemed likely to succeed at least not to him goddammit lieutenant monroe hung up in disgust i cant get through bastards must have cut the wires again wouldnt be surprised chester agreed after a moment he added i wonder how much truth there is in the talk you hear you mean about confederates running around in us uniforms and raising cain the lieutenant asked chester nodded after some thought thayer monroe said i dont know for sure but i wouldnt be surprised its the sort of bastardly trick featherstons people would pull was it it struck martin as the sort of trick anybody with half an ounce of brains would pull especially in a war where both sides spoke what was for all practical purposes the same language he said i hope were doing the same thing to them thats all lieutenant monroe looked astonished it goes dead against the geneva convention sergeant if youre caught in the enemys uniform you get a blindfold and a cigarette thats too far to go for a good smoke chester dutifully chuckled though he had confederate cigarettes in his pocket plundering enemy corpsesand here in fredericksburg plundering shopskept frontline infantrymen supplied with better tobacco than they could get from their own country frontline service had few advantages but that was one of them freighttrain noises filled the air monroe might not have been able to get through to us artillery but someone had high explosives thundered down on the heights behind fredericksburg how much good they would do through the din the lieutenant said at least we dont have any orders to get out of our holes and attack as soon as the barrage lets up thank you jesus chester martin said most sincerely his platoon commander nodded monroe could learn the company and the regiment of which it was a part were in the line because so many men had tried to take the high ground in back of fredericksburg tried and bloodily failed the confederate gunners on those heights could murder every us soldier in the world if the army chose to come at them there machine guns and artillery swept the rising ground not even barrels had a chance of forcing their way forward martin drew in a breath and made a face most of the time you could forget about the stench of death on the battlefieldoh not forget about it maybe but shove it down to the back of your mind hed thought about it though and that brought it up in his mind again his guts did a slow lurch too many unburied bodies lay out there bloating in the sun when the company went back into reserve he would bring that stench with himin his clothes in his hair on his skin it took a long time to go away and hed smelled it in plenty of nightmares between the wars bad as it was here it had been worse in the trenches on the roanoke front where the line went back and forth over the same few miles of ground for a couple of years and where every square yard of ground was manured with a corpse or two keeping his head downhe didnt know whether the confederates had any snipers close enough to draw a bead on him and didnt care to find out the hard wayhe lit one of those smooth confederate cigarettes and held the pack out to lieutenant monroe thanks sergeant monroe said he leaned close for a light the smoke in chesters mouth and in his nose masked the smell of death for that one of the stablesscrapings cigarettes the usa turned out would have done as well if you were going to go this way though why not go first class i pity those poor bastards who dont smoke chester said out of the blue whys that the lieutenant not unreasonably couldnt follow his train of thought on account of they cant ever get out from under the goddamn smell oh thayer monroe considered then nodded hadnt looked at it like that but youre right he started to add something else probably on the same theme but all of a sudden he ducked down deep in the foxhole instead incoming aw shit martin got right down there with him the confederates were doing something sneakysomething gutsy too they couldnt huddle in reinforcedconcrete gun emplacements to serve their mortars they had to come out into the firing pits to use them but the nasty little bombs flew at fredericksburg almost silently with all the big stuff roaring by overhead nobody was going to notice the mortars till they started bursting which would be too late for some luckless soldiers and sometimes even being right on the money didnt do you a damn bit of good one of the reasons soldiers hated mortars was that the bombs went up at a steep angle and came down at an even steeper one plunging fire the boys with the high foreheads called it a foxhole didnt protect you from a round that came right down in there with you chester heard the boom next thing he knew he was grabbing at his leg and bawling for a corpsman absurdly the first thing that went through his mind was ritas gonna kill me when he could think of anything past his own pain he got a look at lieutenant monroeand wished he hadnt the platoon commander was the only reason chester was still breathing hed been between chester and the mortar round and hed taken almost all of it there wasnt a hell of a lot of him left and what there was wasnt pretty that you sarge one of the stretcher bearers called yeah chester forced out the word through clenched teeth the corpsman jumped down into the hole he swore softly when he saw what had happened to monroe then turned to chester how much of that blood is yours and how much is the other poor bastards beats me chester looked down at himself he was pretty well drenched in the lieutenants mortal remains he didnt want to let go of the leg though or more of what soaked him would be his he was much too sure of that can you stick me and bandage me or put on a tourniquet or whatever the hell youre gonna do this hurts like a son of a bitch right the corpsman jabbed chester with a morphine syrette then said lemme see what you caught blood flowed faster when chester took his hand away from his calf but it didnt spurt frowning the corpsman went on i think we can get by without a tourniquet he bandaged the wound watched how fast the gauze turned red and nodded to himself hey elmer gimme a hand here will ya lets get the sarge outa this hole sure the other corpsman hopped down in there too fuck he said when he got a look at the platoon commanders ruined corpse who was that anyways lieutenant monroe chester answered a certain dreamy wonder in his voice the painkiller hit hard and fast he got it quick anyhow elmer said about as much of a eulogy as anyone ever gave thayer monroe despite the morphine martin howled when the grunting corpsmen got him up on flat ground mortar rounds were still landing not far away a few fragments whistled by chester didnt want to get hit again but he didnt want to stay at the front either with another grunt the corpsmen carried the stretcher on which he lay back toward the rappahannock a white powerboat with big red crosses took him and the medics over the river the confederates werent supposed to shoot at such vessels any more than they were supposed to shoot at ambulances accidents did happen though when he got back to the field hospital the first thing a doctor did was give him a shot tetanus the man said by then martin wouldnt have cared if it was french dressing he was feeling very woozy indeed the doctor cut away his trouser leg and the bandage and looked at the wound he nodded thoughtfully not too bad sergeant if it heals clean youll be back on duty in a few weeks terrific chester said more or less at random he got some more shots these to numb the leg while the doctor sewed him up eyeing him the man asked did you have a purple heart in the last war yeah oakleaf cluster hot damn martin answered heh the doctor sounded more tired than amused he wrote notes on a form then tied it to chesters wrist orders for your disposition he explained yeah chester said again hed always known the army ran as much on paperwork as on bullets and canned rations he got stuffed into an ambulance and sent north up roads cratered by shellfire despite morphine and local anesthetic the jolts made him groan and curse his partner in misery a pfc with a bandaged shoulder was still very groggy from whatever hed been under and didnt seem to feel a thing martin envied him the military hospital was up near the potomac like the powerboat like the ambulance it was painted a dazzling white and had red crosses on the walls and roof chester would rather have been farther away but confederate bombers reached all the way up to new york city and boston just as us warplanes had recently flown from new mexico to unload hell on forth worth and dallas a briskly efficient nurse in starched whites got him into a bed well have to clean you up she remarked thatd be nice he said vaguely all he knew was that he wasnt going anywhere for a while and not going anywhere suited him fine abner dowling could have done without a summons to report to warrenton virginia that daniel macarthur wanted to see him did not fill his heart with joy instead the news filled him with apprehension he feared it meant macarthur had come up with another scheme for discomfiting the confederates the only thing wrong with macarthurs schemes that abner dowling could see was that they didnt work macarthur kept coming up with them though he had an endlessly fertile endlessly inventive mind if only hed had a better sense of what was practical well in that case he would have been someone else dwelling on it seemed pointless which didnt always stop dowling the general commanding made his headquarters in a house different from the one hed occupied the last time dowling came to warrenton then hed chosen the fanciest place in town for his own perhaps knowing his habits the confederates had knocked that house flatnot while he was in it dowling tried not to think about whose war effort they would have helped more if theyd got macarthur as well as the building not that macarthurs current residence was anything to sneeze at having lost the most impressive placeand no doubt thereby endeared its owner to the usa for ever and everthe american general had chosen the next grandest for his own another classical revival home from before the war of secession sandbagged machinegun nests and a thicket of barbed wire around the place detracted from the air of quiet elegance the colonnaded entranceway tried to project sentries gave dowling a careful onceover before letting him inside the perimeter some of them carried confederatemade submachine guns in place of boltaction springfields you really like those better dowling asked a corporal who toted one of the ugly little weapons yes sir for what im doing here the noncom told him wouldnt care to take it up to the front not enough range not enough stopping power but for putting a lot of lead in the air right up close you cant beat it all right that struck dowling as a wellreasoned answer he did inquire what does general macarthur say about your using a confederate weapon sir he says he wished we made one as good that also struck dowling as a cogent comment he wondered how macarthur had come up with it but that was neither here nor there he walked on toward the house greek refinement surrounded by modern barbarity but then considering some of the things athens and sparta did to each other during the peloponnesian war the greeks had surrounded refinement with their own barbarity one of macarthurs staff officers a captain as lean and probably as swift as a greyhound met dowling at the door please come with me general the bright young man said after saluting general macarthur is eagerly awaiting your arrival eagerly dowling wondered what could make macarthur eager to see him after the way theyd quarreled was the commanding general going to cashier him dowling resolved to fight like hell if macarthur tried he hadnt done anything wrong and he thought hed done more things right than his superior here we arein the map room the captain murmured daniel macarthur had had a map room in the other house he used for a headquarters too if hed had the sense to read the maps instead of just having them good afternoon general macarthur said a cigaretteconfederate tobacco by the smellburned in the long holder he affected he also affected an almost monastically plain uniform one whose only ornaments were the stars on his shoulder straps custer by contrast had made his clothes more ornate and gaudy than tightly interpreted regulations would have allowed both approaches had the same purpose to call special attention to the man wearing the uniform reporting as ordered sir dowling said and waited to see what happened next you were the one who discovered the confederates were thinning their lines in front of us here in virginia by the way macarthur said it he didnt think dowlings discovery would go down in history with columbus his tone declared that dowling might have been found picking his nose and wiping his finger on a trouser leg ignoring that dowling replied yes sir i was the one im sorry you discovered we couldnt take advantage of that at fredericksburg hed told the exact and literal truth there he was sorry the us attacks hadnt succeeded if they had macarthur would have become a hero that wouldnt have filled dowling with delight custer was already a hero when dowling got to know him when the pompous windbag became a bigger hero that didnt delight dowling either it hadnt broken his heart though custers success had meant the usas success macarthurs would mean the same thing dowling prided himself on his patriotism id admire a skunk who helped my country he eyed macarthur in a speculative way macarthur was looking back also in a speculative way he was no doubt trying to tease an insult out of dowlings remark but dowling hadnt said anything like only a blind jackass would have tried to break the confederates line at fredericksburg he might have thought something like that but macarthur couldnt read mindsand a good thing too ash almost as long as the first joint of a mans thumb fell from macarthurs cigarette the general commanding ground it into the expensivelooking rug that was bound to make whoever owned the place love him even more than he did already he lowered his voice to a portentous whisper i think i know where theyve gone do you sir dowling was ready to get news or gossip from anybody even macarthur where to the west yes the general commanding sounded portentous all right half a dozen old testament prophets could have taken lessons from him once dowling had the news it didnt strike him as improbable what are they going to do there he asked i doubt theyll dance around the maypole and strew flowers over the landscape macarthur replied very funny sir dowling lied dutifully why not hed had practice but i did wonder whether they were going to push toward toledo and detroit or go east toward cleveland and akron andwhats the name of the place youngstown thats it he felt proud of visualizing the map ah daniel macarthur nodded he took another cigarette from his pack stuck it in the holder and lit it with his prominent nose and his jowls wattling an otherwise thin face he reminded dowling of a chainsmoking vulture that i must tell you i do not know if the budding alexanders at the war department do they have not seen fit to impart that information to me dowling snorted he was little more fond of the functionaries at the war department than macarthur was he realized hed acquired his attitude from george custer that realization didnt thrill him but also didnt change his mind he said in case they do attack in the west whats the best thing we can do here he could see hed made macarthur unhappy again he needed a moment to figure out why macarthur didnt want to be reduced to a sideshow he wanted to be the main event but even macarthur could see he wouldnt be the main event if major fighting erupted in the west once more reluctantly he said keep the enemy as busy as we can i suppose if you see a better choice point it out to me im afraid i dont dowling said what was the world coming to when one of daniel macarthurs proposals made sound military sense very well i may call on your corps to try to break through the confederate defenses and threaten richmond macarthur said now i failed at one end of my line so ill try the other that was what it amounted to dowling gave a mental shrug macarthur had the right to ask that of himand the busier the confederates were in virginia the smaller their chance to send even more men west with a little luck they might even have to bring some back dowling said what needed saying of course im at your service sir whatever you require of me ill do nothing made daniel macarthur happier than unhesitating obedience he looked quite humanly pleased as he answered thank you general that was very handsomely said for once dowling made his farewells without getting the impression of breaking off an artillery duel as he headed for his greengray motorcar another onea bright blue civilian oldspulled up alongside it a woman not far from his own age got out her hair was the pinkish white peculiar to aging redheads she moved with a brisk spryness that belied her years hello colonel dowling no excuse mehello general dowling i didnt expect to see you here she said got a cigarette a broad smile spread over dowlings face hello yourself miss clemens i sure do here you are he pulled the pack from his pocket and handed it to her thanks ophelia clemens lit one and sucked in smoke then she stuck out her hand when dowling took it she gave his a firm pump and let it go the formalities satisfied she nodded toward macarthurs headquarters and asked so hows the great stone face one of the reasons dowling had always liked her as a reporter and as a person was that she said what was on her mind he of course did not enjoy the privilege of being outside the chain of command he answered general macarthur seems well oh yeah she said then how come hes dumb enough to keep feeding troops into a meat grinder like fredericksburg im afraid im not the one to answer that since he is my superior and since my corps is stationed at the other end of our line having said what any loyal subordinate ought to say dowling couldnt resist adding if you need to know his views youll have to ask him yourself thats what im here for ophelia clemens said and dowling wanted to hug himself with glee unlike a lot of correspondents she had no patience with bloated egos or double talk she had cut through custers pompous bluster like a regiment of barrels going through sioux indians he didnt think shed have any trouble doing the same with macarthur then she surprised him by asking and how have you been oh tolerable yes tolerables about right dowling batted his eyelashes at her i didnt know you cared she was taking a drag and choked on it she went alarmingly red dowling had to pound her on the back when she could talk again she wheezed god damn you generalyou caught me by surprise sorry miss clemens dowling more or less meant it a likely story she said sounding more like her herself youre just trying to get rid of me so you dont have to answer questions about how things got screwed up this time i thought you already had all the answers he teased she shook her head not yet but i aim to get em with determined stride she advanced on daniel macarthur the townsend slid over the improbably blue waters of the tropical pacific as smoothly as if japanese airplanes had never bombed her as george enos jr swabbed her deck he looked over the side every now and again to see if he could spot the feathery wake of a periscope when he did it once too often to suit a petty officer that worthy barked enos youre goldbricking you think your eyeballs are gonna spot something our hydrophones miss probably not george knew better than to make a challenge too blatant but you never can tell can you i can tell when youre goofing off the petty officer said after the one growl though he went off to harass somebody else georges answer held enough truth to let him wiggle off the hook he swabbed conscientiously for a while in case the petty officer came sneaking back and caught him doing too close to nothing he wasnt terrified of the man the way some ordinary seamen were for one thing he was in his thirties himself the other man didnt put him in mind of an angry father for another hed been yelled at by experts on the sweet sue what was one more fellow with a big voice getting along was easier but one more bawlingout wouldnt be the end of the world fighters buzzed overhead these days american ships didnt sail out of range of landbased aircraft from the sandwich islands somebody in honolulu or perhaps somebody back in philadelphia had finally had a rush of brains to the head george wished that would have happened sooner the townsend would have been better off for it or maybe it wasnt such a rush of brains about fifteen minutes later the destroyers klaxons hooted for general quarters george threw the mop into the bucket and ran for his antiaircraft gun he didnt know whether the skipper had spotted an enemy submarine or aircraft or just had a case of the galloping jimjams that wasnt his worry being ready to do his little bit to keep the ship safe was he got to the twinmm mount just ahead of fremont dalby if you were ahead of your gun chief you were doing all right you know whats going on dalby panted nope all i know is i run like hell when i hear the siren george answered dalby chuckled long as you do know that what you dont know doesnt matter anywhere near as much the rest of the sailors who served the gun took their places within another minute or so the townsends intercom crackled to life now hear this we have detected aircraft approaching from the northwest yranging gear says we have about fifteen minutes assistance from more landbased airplanes is promised that is all a pause do your duty and all will be well george laughed a sour laugh all will be well yeahunless we get blown to kingdom come anyway id like to see those army assholes get more fighters out here in fifteen minutes too dalby added matter of fact i would like to see it but im not gonna bet the damn farm two other destroyers cruised with the townsend a reconnaissance in force north of kauai the american powers that be wanted to tell the japs the sandwich islands werent going to be their ham and cheese on rye that was what the american authorities wanted to say yeah but they were liable to be offering the patrol up as an hors doeuvre fritz gustafson kept things short and to the point give me lots of ammo cant do much without it there was a loaders notion of practicality as usual the time between the call to general quarters and the appearance of enemy fighters seemed an eternity and an eyeblink at the same time one of the mm mounts on another destroyer opened up tracers tigerstriped the sky shells burst here there everywhere the only trouble was george couldnt spot any airplanes but the us fighters spring fever dalby said scornfully better too soon than too late gustafson said that was thoroughly practical too and then everybody spotted the japs the american fighters zoomed toward them all three destroyers put up a curtain of antiaircraft fire japanese fighters rushed ahead to hold the enemy away from the torpedocarriers and dive bombers they shepherded almost at the same time two fighters plunged into the pacific one carried the rising sun the other the eagle in front of crossed swords george pointed torpedo bomber coming at us he didnt think hed ever seen anything so ugly in all his life in fact the airplane carrying the torpedo under its bellyoffset slightly to the leftwas smoothly streamlined the torpedo itself was a straight tube with a bluntly curved nose and with fins at the stern a splendid piece of industrial design but it was designed to sink his ship and to kill him if that didnt make it ugly in his sight nothing could streams of tracers converged on the japanese aircraft george wasnt the only one whod spotted it the pilot had to fly straight and low to launch his fish that left him a perfect and perfectly vulnerable target while he did it he was a brave man he did what hed been trained to do his airplane exploded into fire but the torpedo was in the water by then hailmaryfullofgracethelordiswiththee george prayed in a rapid gabble the prayer he chose took him by surprise hed turned catholic because connie made it plain she wasnt about to marry him if he didnt he hadnt thought he took it seriously not till now somebodyd said there were no atheists in foxholes the deck of a ship under torpedo attack evidently counted the townsend was a greyhound of the sea capable of well over thirty knots why then did she feel as if she were nailed in place the heeling surging turn she made might have been filmed in slow motion it might have been but it wasnt it took her out of harms way for the torpedo raced past her stern thank you jesus fritz gustafson used words as if he had to pay for them he packed a lot of meaning into those three meatballs on its wings and fuselage a jap fighter shot up the destroyer bullets clanged and snarled and whined in wild ricochets wounded men screeched every antiaircraft gun on the ship tried to knock the pilot into the pacific he darted away just above the wavetops untouched or at least still flying fremont dalby gave credit where it was due hes a motherfucking son of a bitch but hes a motherfucking son of a bitch with balls i hope he gets home i dont george was not inclined to be chivalrous then suddenly the sky was full of airplanesairplanes blazoned with the american eagle and swords they threw themselves at the japs the army was on the ball after all ignoring the enemy fighters where they could the fighters bored in on the torpedocarriers and dive bombersthose were the ones that could sink ships the americans outnumbered the japanese aircraft before long the japanese decided theyd had enough and flew off in the direction from which theyd come no dive bombers had attacked the townsend george was pretty sure of it even near misses kicked up great columns of water and threw splinters of bomb casing every which way he couldnt have ignored anything like that in his singleminded ammunitionpassing could he one of the other destroyers hadnt been so lucky black greasy smoke poured from her a bomb had burst near her bow she wasnt dead in the water but she couldnt do much more than crawl even as he watched her starboard list got worse sailors bobbed in the water not far from her the bomb blast had blown them off her deck somecorpsesfloated face down others struggled to stay above the surface still others in life jackets didnt have that worry as the townsend swung toward her stricken comrade the execs voice blared from the intercom all hands lower lines and nets and life rings for rescue sailors rushed to obey the other destroyer slumped lower in the water they werent going to be able to save her men started coming up on her deck from below some of them helped wounded buddies they were going to abandon ship that could be us george said he didnt realize hed spoken aloud till dalby nodded that damn near was us last year the gun chief said we pick up these sorry bastards and then figure out what to do next pausing to take on survivors carried risks of its own if a japanese submersible prowled these waters the townsend would be a sitting duck for it george thought of his father but the senior george enos thought the war was over when his destroyer went down george jr knew better again he kept an eye peeled for periscopes this time no one reproved him he was a long way from the only sailor doing the same thing pull hard you lazy fuckers put your backs into it haul that line a petty officer screamed by his orders he might have been serving aboard a nineteenthcentury ship of the line but the destroyers men werent swinging from one tack to the other they were bringing a sailor up on deck he clung to the rope for dear life his feet thudded against the side of the ship god bless you he gasped when he came aboard he got down on hands and knees and puked his guts out nobody could possibly have blamed him for that he was covered from head to foot in heavy fuel oil so that he looked as if hed just escaped from a minstrel show but if you swallowed much of that stuff it would kill you as surely as a bullet would heaving up your guts was one of the best things you could do aint this a fuckup one of the rescued men said as he stood there dripping aint this just a grand fuckup we wanted to see if there was japs there we found out all right didnt we just didnt we just the mournful words echoed inside georges head he turned to fremont dalby and said i wonder if well be able to hang on to the sandwich islands we wouldnt have any trouble if the japs were the only thing on our plate dalby said we could lick em easy enough but this is the ass end of the goddamn war whatever they can spare from fighting the csa and the big mess in the atlantic and holding canada downwhatever they can spare we get that its not enough george said dalby shrugged they havent thrown us out yet theyre not fighting anybody else either but the sandwich islands are even harder for them to get at than they are for us i guess so george knew he sounded dubious he felt dubious hed seen too much to feel any other way and if he hadnt one look at the draggled survivors from the other destroyer would have been plenty to show him hipolito rodriguez packed his worldly goods into a duffel bag he didnt know how many times hed done that when he was in the army during the last warenough so that he hadnt lost the knack anyhow shouldering the duffel wasnt as easy as it had been then though a lot more years had landed on him since and almost getting electrocuted hadnt helped all the same he managed some of the other guards from the confederate veterans brigades were in no better shape than he was they managed too if you couldnt manage you shouldnt have been here at all well done men said tom porter the troop leaderessentially the top sergeant god knows we do need to fumigate these barracksweve got more bugs in em than you can shake a stick at im not telling you one goddamn thing you dont already know got that right a guard drawled he mimed scratchingor maybe he wasnt miming rodriguez had found out about delousing stations during the great war too theyd changed a little since thena little but not nearly enough its all them niggers fault another guard said theys filthy and we git their vermin he was bound to be right about that the rank smell of camp determination was always in a guards nostrils put lots of unwashed men and women together with texas heat and humidity and it was no wonder you raised a bumper crop of every kind of pest under the sun the exterminators were a cheerful crew whod come west from abilene buggone their trucks said on the side of each was painted a man walking up to an overgrown cockroach he had a mallet behind his back the roach wore an apprehensive expression yall got dogs or cats or canaries or snakes or goldfish or whatever the hell still in the building one of the men asked fumbling in the breast pocket of his coveralls for a cheap cigar better get em out if you do on account of this stuffll kill em deadern shit a couple of the guards did have pets but theyd taken them out when the exterminator lit that cheroot one of rodriguezs comrades asked him you gonna kill the bugs with the smoke from that goddamn thing laughing the fellow answered howd you guess now our secrets out he and his crew covered the barracks with an enormous tent of rubberized cloth they could make it as big as they wanted squares of the stuff zipped together rodriguez admired thatit struck him as good design one of the squares had a round hole in it that accepted the tube from the machine that pumped the poison into the tent again good design the exterminators didnt leave anything to chance any more than the people whod designed camp determination had done a small gasoline engine powered the machine which was hooked up to a gas cylinder with a large skull and crossbones painted on it rodriguez had seen poisongas cylinders during the last war he asked the fellow with the nasty cigar you use chlorine or phosgene i remember how chlorine kill all the rats in the trenches more come later though the trenches had been heaven on earth for rats and mice nah this here is a different mix the exterminator told him its stronger than any of the stuff they used back then bueno rodriguez said this means maybe the bugs dont come back for a while once you kill them maybe the man answered by the way he hesitated before he said it rodriguez decided he meant no sure enough he continued we get paid to kill all the little bastards thatre in there now what happens after that if you leave out ant syrup and spray flit around and keep the place clean so you dont draw roaches youll do pretty good and you can always call us out again bueno rodriguez repeated more sourly this time like undertakers exterminators werent likely to go out of business anytime soon the engine came to noisy life whatever was in the gas cylinder started going into the tented barracks hall rodriguez got a tiny whiff of something that smelled sort of like mothballs but a hell of a lot stronger that whiff was plenty to convince him he didnt want to breathe any more of it he moved away from the barracks in a hurry and noticed the exterminators had already put some distance between themselves and their machinery how soon can we go back in after yall leave a guard asked one of the buggone people you folks did leave the windows and doors open so the place can air out the exterminator asked in return the guard nodded the exterminator said well in that case you oughta be safe goin in there tonightsay after ten several guards swore rodriguez gave a mental shrug some things you just couldnt help what was the point of getting all excited about those wish we could fumigate the damn niggers like they was bugs a guard said unfortunately for him he said it where tom porter could hear him the underofficer reamed him out for it goddammit newcomb watch your fool mouth this here is a transit camp it aint nothin else but a transit camp you let the idea get out that it is somethin else and you turn the devil loose do you want that do you answer me when i talk to you goddammit no troop leader newcomb said hastily then shut up you hear me just shut up porter said and put his hands on his hips like an angry parent scolding a fiveyearold youve all heard this shit before to hell with me if i know whats so hard about keeping your damnfool mouths shut but yall leak like a pail with a hole in it we got to keep the niggers in camp tame or we buy ourselves all kinds of shit they go wild on us we got to watch our backs every second like they did in the camps in mississippi and louisiana yall want that do yall now he was yelling at every guard in earshot no troop leader they chorused rodriguez loud among them all right then the troop leader said at least partly mollified try and remember youre makin your own lives easier if you do when rodriguez patrolled the campeither the mens or the womens halfhe tried to watch his back every minute anyway he didnt know anybody who came from the confederate veterans brigade who didnt anybody whod lived through the last war had seen for himself that not having eyes in the back of your head was a good way to end up dead in a hurry some of the younger fellows the men whod been party stalwarts or guards but hadnt actually known combat were the ones who strolled through the compounds without a visible care in the world sooner or later one of them would get knocked over the head that might teach the others some sense rodriguez hoped it would anyhow his shift was on the womens side today he would have gone up with the window shade if hed accepted all the favors offered him the women figured their lives could be easier if they had a guard on their side and they knew what they had to give to get one if he wanted favors like that he could have them when they got thrown in his face half a dozen times a day he mostly didnt want them these nigger bitches is all whores opined his partner an alabaman named alvin sprinks it could be rodriguez said he didnt think it was at least under most circumstances but he didnt feel like arguing life was too short a couple of guards with submachine guns at his back jefferson pinkard prowled through the womens camp rodriguez had seen how his wartime buddy made his own rounds in camp determination going where he wanted to go when he wanted to go there that was just an extension of the rule of watching your back all the time to a man of pinkards rank the whole camp was his back you think we get a lot of pussy thrown at us man what about him sprinks sounded jealous rodriguez only shrugged if they tried to give you more than you wanted or could use who cared how much more than that they tried to give you pinkard spotted him waved and made a sudden left turn to head his way the guards tramped along behind him like a couple of welltrained hounds how you doin hip the camp commandant called not bad sir thank you rodriguez was always careful to show respect for his friends rank nobodyd called him hip since the great war ended it was the sort of nickname only an englishspeaker would use from pinkard it didnt bother him it reminded him of the days when theyd been miserable side by side your barracks got fumigated this morningaint that right pinkard asked yes senor jeff in spite of himself rodriguez was impressed by pinkards grasp of detail nothing went on in camp determination that he didnt know about often before it happened bet youll be glad to get rid of the bugs jeff said oh yes sir rodriguez nodded but it is like anything else si he had the brains not to talk directly about the way the camp worked not where mallates could overhear one batch goes away but before long there is another yeah well then well call out those buggone folks one more time and do it all over again well pinkard broke off he looked around the womens half of camp determination then he looked back at hipolito rodriguez son of a bitch he said softly son of a bitch what is it rodriguez asked dont rightly know yet jeff answered might be nothin but it might be somethin big too you never can tell till you go and find out if it is i promise you ill get you what you deserve for it dont want you to be like chick blades who never did find out what he came up with rodriguez scratched his head what you mean senor jeff never mind dont worry about it it happened a long time ago back in louisiana pinkard shook his head as if at something he didnt want to remember but couldnt forget he gathered himself you got to go on with your rounds and so do i see you later freedom off he went his guards in his wake what the devil was that all about alvin sprinks asked i dont know rodriguez said truthfully the commandant he has an idea i think reckon so despite agreeing sprinks sounded doubtful the next idea he had would be his first he could read and writerodriguez didnt think there were any guards who couldntbut he didnt like to when we gonna git outa this place a grayhaired colored woman asked as the guards started through the camp again soon auntie soon rodriguez answered alvin sprinks nodded solemnly rodriguez thought he would laugh or give the game away in some different fashion but he didnt maybe the troop leader had put the fear of god in him at least for a while he might not have his own ideas but he could get them from someone else ix waiting for the balloon to go up was the hardest thing a soldier did back in tom colleton had waited eagerly even gaily confident the war would be won and the damnyankees smashed before the cotton harvest came in everything would be glorious three years later he was one of the lucky ones who came home again glory quite forgotten the new war had smashed the usa had split the country in two that he was up here by sandusky ohio proved as much like jake featherston like everyone else in the csa hed assumed that splitting the united states meant winning the war there was a lesson there on what assumptions were worth but he didnt care to dwell on it this time for sure he muttered sir asked an improbably young lieutenant commanding one of the companies in his regiment he should have had a more experienced officer in that slot but the replacement depot hadnt coughed one up reinforcements were coming into ohio which was good even with them though not every hole got filled tom wished the damnyankees had the same problem he envied them their manpower pool confederate soldiers mostly had better weapons he thought and was far from alone in thinking confederate soldiers were better trained every one of them was worth more in combat than his us counterpart but jesus god there were a hell of a lot of yankees he needed to answer the youngster this time for sure he repeated when we hit the us forces this time weve got to knock them out of the war weve got to and we damn well will oh yes sir said the shavetailtom thought his name was jackson it was a safe bet anyway about one in every three confederate soldiers seemed to be named jackson of course we will he hadnt been at the front very long he could still think aboutcould still talk aboutinevitable victory the way confederate wireless broadcasts did tom knew better he thought the confederates still had a good chance of doing what they wanted but a good chance wasnt a sure thing anyone whod ever lost a hand with a flush knew all about that well see pretty soon he said lieutenantjackson said how can we lose colleton put a hand on his shoulder i said the same damn thing when i came to the front at the start of the last war i would have been a little older than you are now i suppose and then i spent all the time that came afterwards finding out how we could lose i just hope like hell that doesnt happen to you it wont jackson sounded supremely confident we got stabbed in the back last time niggers wont have the chance to do that now the partys going to take care of em but good he really believed that to a certain extent tom did too but only to a certain extent he said we would have had a better chance if they hadnt risen upsure but theres something youve got to remember or youll go home in a box and never find out how the latest serial ends the damnyankees can fight some too yes sir jacksons tones were those of a wellbroughtup young man too polite to correct an elder whos said something obviously foolish but theyre just doing it on account of their government makes em where did you hear that tom asked sending him a curious stare in school everybody knows it is this what theyre teaching my children too tom wondered god help us if it is gently he asked havent you ever noticed that not everything they teach you in school is true and that a lot of things everybody knows arent true at all no sir cant say that i have jackson answered after serious earnest and very visible consideration he meant that too for the first time tom found himself frightened for the younger generation in the csa if this was what they learned lieutenant theres something you have to understand because its the lords truth the yankees dont like us any better than we like them they dont need the government to make them fight theyd do it anyhow on account of we jumped them next time we interrogate some prisoners you listen in youll see ill do that jackson said but theyll just spout the nonsense their higherups told them theyrewhats the word theyre indoctrinated thats it he looked pleased with himself for remembering and youre not tom wondered he couldnt ask though jackson might see other peoples indoctrination his own was to him like the air under its wings to a butterfly he didnt think about it he didnt notice it he just floated on it and let it support him not far behind them artillery rumbled things were starting to pick up the confederate gunners fired barrages to east and west to keep the us soldiers posted in front of them from guessing which way they would move when the time came tom wished the men in greengray didnt know the time was coming wish for a million dollars while youre at it he thought the yankees werent blind men the confederate buildup had been as subtle as the soldiers with wreathed stars on their collars could make it but you couldnt hide everything no matter how hard you tried the confederates were doing their best as tom walked up toward the front he passed barrelsboth the older model and the newcrouching under camouflage netting with leaves and sod applied to make them as nearly invisible as possible theyd moved up under cover of darkness the orders against moving by daylight were explicit to the point of bloodthirstiness more cs artillery fire had masked the sound of their advance the damnyankees had used that trick in the last war imitation was the sincerest form of flattery with luck it would be the best revenge too get low you damn fool before somebody shoots you the raucous advice came from a foxhole by the side of the path only the two stars on each side of toms collar that marked his rank showed he was an officer hed deliberately dulled them so the yankees snipers wouldnt single him out evidently his own men couldnt single him out either and getting low was good advice almost any time tom hit the dirt and crawled toward the foxhole us artillery started coming in before he got there the crawl turned into an undignified scramble jesus the private already in it sounded disgusted this fucker aint big enough for two then he noticed toms rank badges uh sir he wasnt wrong even if he was rude tom took his entrenching tool off his belt and started digging like a mole after forty cups of coffee just have to make it bigger he said he added the dirt from his excavation to the breastwork in front of the hole huh the soldier said in surprise didnt know officers knew how to handle one o them things if i didnt i would have got killed when i was your age tom answered glad to pause and pant ever hear of the roanoke front sure as hell did uncle lucas came back without most of his arm on account of he was there the soldier paused taking longer than he should have to make the connection you was there too thats right im sorry about your uncle i never got more than a few scratches myselfi was lucky better believe you was the private might have said more but the scream of an incoming shell warned it would come down somewhere close he and tom both ducked the explosion was close enough to make the ground shake fragments maliciously whined and screeched overhead a few clods of dirt pattered down into the hole but nothing worse on the roanoke front that one shell would have been the harbinger of many more and only extraordinary luck and a hole better than this one would have kept a man from getting maimed or killed things were quieter here the damnyankees had shifted a lot of their weight to virginia what was left was good enough to hold the confederates in place and harass them but not to work the wholesale slaughter that had been so common in the great war the united states didnt seem to have figured out that the confederate states were shifting men out of virginia and sliding them back over here nothing made tom happier than their continued ignorance the more the yankees fussed and fumed in the east the less attention theyd pay to anything out here if they stayed ignorant till morning after next they did the real confederate barrage started an hour before sunrise it was thunderous enough to wake tom after all the gunfire hed slept through at the front in two warsand in fighting the negroes after the first onethat was no mean feat freighttrain noises traveled the rails of the sky from west to east yankee counterbattery fire started almost at once the us soldiers werent fools hed said as much to lieutenant jackson absently he wondered whether jackson still lived he thought so but he hadnt had any reports from that company for most of a day they knew trouble when they walked into it one after another though their guns fell silent battered into submission by a heavier weight of metal the confederate barrage let up precisely at sunrise its purpose was to stun not to kill everything on the us side of the line three years of bloody experience had taught the csa and the usa that they couldnt kill all their enemies or even enough of them with big guns alone and a really heavy artillery preparation one that went on for days ruined the ground over which attackers would advance and slowed them down less gunnery amounted to more confederate barrels rumbled and rattled and clanked forward tom scrambled up out of his hole he had an officers brass whistle and blew a long shrill blast on it come on you lazy sons of bitches he yelled weve caught em by surprise and now well make em pay watch your buddies and follow me an officer who told his men to follow him could almost always get them to obey an officer who told troops to advance but sat tight himself had a lot more trouble the only thing wrong with officers of the first sort was that they got shot a lot more often than the others if you thought about things like that tom resolutely didnt if everybody thought about things like that instead of being afraid to act like a coward in front of his buddies or his men war would become impossible the machinegun fire in front of him said this war remained altogether too possible not all the damnyankees were stunnedfar from it asskickers screamed down out of the sky to bomb strongpoints the cs artillery hadnt silenced for the moment the dive bombersand the confederateshad it all their own way dazed us soldiers threw up their hands and hoped the advancing men in butternut would let them surrender instead of just shooting them and moving on just like last year tom thought and wondered if that was good or bad when brigadier general irving morrells train pulled into the broad street station in philadelphia he couldnt have been in a worse mood if hed tried for a week the endless delays on the trip north from virginia did nothing to improve his temper between bomb damage and rail sabotage the trip took three times as long as it should have all he missed was getting the train strafed from the air but he could have flown up in the armys fastest fighter and still arrived ready to bite nails in half colonel john abell met him at the station that didnt make him any happier even if the colorless general staff officer was the one whod let him know hed finally earned stars on his shoulder straps goddammit colonel im not a pingpong ball you know morrell exploded he almost said god damn you colonel he suspected abell was responsible for getting him pulled out of virginia and he intended to raise cain about it for the moment abell was imperturbable consider it a compliment sir he answered his voicean unmemorable baritonenever rising we always try to send you where the country needs you most that took some of the wind out of morrells sails but only some im not a fire brigade all by myself he pointed out where are my fire engines where are my firemen wheres my hook and ladder at the last possible instant he left off the participle come with me sir abell said still mildly well give you our estimate of the situation in ohio and then well send you west to make bricks without straw morrell broke in the general staff officer looked pained how he looked wasnt a patch on how morrell felt ive already tried that in ohio thank you very much are you going to see if history can repeat itself and are you setting me up to take the fall if it does it cant be your fault after all by you he didnt mean abells alone but all the officers in philadelphia who thought of war as theory and maps and not as cordite and burning barrels and mangled men they were good at what they did because they were they thought they knew everything there was to know about the business of organized slaughter morrell had a different and lower opinion were both on the same side sir abell said weve flushed out several traitorssome of them planted long long agoand more no doubt remain in place but no one has ever questioned your loyalty or patriotism thats white of you by god morrell said making things as difficult as possible is another story abell snapped his iron control rusting a little at last will you come with me to the war department please we cant hash things out here on the platform ill come morrell replied and he did he and abell had little to say to each other on the short ride through central philadelphia the de facto capital looked more battered every time morrell saw it the war department had taken several hits since the last time he was there abell remarked much of what we do these days is underground we dig like moles youve had your heads in the ground for a long time morrell observed and bright patches of red burned on abells sallow cheeks morrell went on tell me about the new confederate barrels how long will we have to wait before weve got anything like that the general staff officer got redder amazingly lifelike morrell thought production of an improved model is expected to begin within the next few weeks abell said stiffly that was better than morrell expected hed feared the usa would have to design anything new from scratch even so he asked how late will the improved model be if the confederates take pittsburgh away from us how much of our steel production would that cost we are hoping sir that that will not happen abell answered we are hoping you will help keep that from happening thats why were sending you to ohio why youre sending me back to ohio morrell corrected and had the somber satisfaction of seeing john abell flinch to rub it in he murmured youngstown akron cleveland they havent taken cleveland this past year now abell sounded truly furious what makes you think they can take it now they werent trying before morrell said they wanted to split us and they did now they want to cripple us if youre telling me this is hopeless general someone else will be appointed your resignation will be accepted you will be permitted to return home to your wife and daughter not just permittedencouraged will be appointed will be accepted will be permitted abell didnt say who would do any of those things he probably didnt even think about it in his world things just happened without any particular agency that made him a good bureaucrat whether it made him a good soldier was a different question morrell wanted to go home to agnes and mildredbut not that way sorry no if you want to get rid of me youll have to throw me out im telling you it would have been a lot easier if wed started getting ready when the confederates did hindsight but abells voice lacked conviction morrell had been saying the same thing when it was foresight abell gathered himself were almost to the map room youll see what were up against there except for lacking windows the map room could have been three stories above ground instead of two stories below it a haze of tobacco smoke hung in the air it also smelled of coffee that had been perking for too long and bodies that had gone unwashed for too long that last odor pervaded the front too so morrell nodded as at an old friend when he recognized it here the stench of death at least was mercifully absent officers were poring over largescale maps of virginia and ohio john abell led morrell to one that covered the eastern part of the latter state morrell let out a tuneless note of dismay when he saw where the pins with the red heads were theyve come that far this fast im afraid it looks that way john abell answered jesus morrell said theyre already inside cleveland i thought you told me they couldnt take it they must have revised this since i went to meet you at the station abell said unhappily are the confederates moving that fast morrell asked they cant be abell spoke with less conviction than he might have liked its just signal lag im sure it had better be morrell said well what do you expect me to do about it have we got armor here he pointed if we do we can thrust toward the lake and try to cut through their advancing columndo to their supply lines what theyve done to us i dont believe we have enough equipment in place there to give us much hope of success abell replied why am i not surprised morrell didnt bother to keep his voice down several officers studying other maps looked up at him he scowled back at them too furious to care they looked away fury wasnt an emotion they were used to seeing here too bad morrell thought savagely he turned back to john abell well if we cant do that our next best move is pretty obvious is it the general staff officer raised an almost colorless eyebrow it hasnt seemed that way here morrell almost asked why he wasnt surprised again then remembering the old saw about flies and honey and vinegar he didnt he pointed again instead this time along the lakeshore from cleveland over to erie pennsylvania well have to fight like hell here well have to fight like hell in all the builtup placesbarrels arent really made for street fighting in the middle of towns they can do it abell said sure they can morrell agreed dogs can walk on their hind legs too but its not what theyre for if you know what i mean send barrels through a few goodsized towns and you wont see very many come out the other end suppose they bypass them abell might have been back at west point trying to solve a tactical problem thats what they did last year they didnt go into columbus with armor they got it in a pocket and attacked with infantry and artillery thats why we defend the towns along the lake like mad bastards morrell said they cant surround them the way they surrounded columbus they have to take them instead and thats more expensive if they dont we can resupply and reinforce by water maybe break out and get into their rear theyll know thatthey can read maps unlike some people i could name john abell drummed his fingers on the side of his thighfrom him the equivalent of another mans jumping up and down and waving his arms and yelling his head off this would involve cooperation with the navy he said at last by the way he said it he might have been talking about eating with his fingers the army always had the feeling that the navy didnt quite pull its weight here though morrell shrugged he had that feeling himself thered been no great naval coups in this war nothing like the capture of the sandwich islands indeed the navy seemed to be losing those islands a few at a time even so he said this is something they can do and hoped he told the truth rather than replying abell pulled a notebook from a breast pocket and scribbled in it you may be right he said when he put the notebook back its a ah more indirect approach to defending the interior regions than wed had in mind what happens if youre wrong ill probably be too dead to worry about it morrell answered abell blinkedno he didnt think about things like leading from the front morrell went on but whoever takes over for me will have a couple of things going for him either the confederates wont have taken all the lakefront or theyll have fought their way through it if they havent he can hit them in the flank if they have with luck theyll be bled white and theyll have a tougher time getting to pittsburghif thats where theyre going that is the current assessment abell said primly bully but again morrell swallowed the oldfashioned slang before it came out he and the desk warriors of philadelphia might not agree on means but they did on ends if he were jake featherston and he wanted to try to knock the usa out of the war he would have gone after pittsburgh too pontiac was the other possibility engine production though was more widely dispersed than steel and without steel you couldnt make engines for very long either well do what we can colonel he said we have to do more than that john abell exclaimed morrell started to laugh then checked himself yet again abell hadnt been joking morrell looked at the map again abell had no reason to joke either dr leonard odoull had thought that pulling out of fredericksburg would cut us casualties and so it would no doubt in the long run in the short run in the short run the confederates on the heights gleefully bombarded the withdrawing men in greengray theyd knocked out the pontoon bridges over the rappahannock more than once knocked them out and then poured shellfire into the men stuck near them waiting to cross i hate artillery odoull remarked as he worked to repair a mangled leg hed thought at first that he would have to take it off now he hoped this corporal would be able to keep it and thought he would too if he didnt get a wound infection that spread to the bone across the table from him granville mcdougald nodded the wounds are a lot nastier than anything a bullet can do arent they theyre more likely to be anyhow odoull had seen horrors from both a lot of the very worst horrors hed never seen at all they were reserved for frontline soldiers and stretcher bearers and graves registration personnel no one could hope to repair some wounds god almighty would have had trouble repairing some men hit by artillery fire for the resurrection get that bleeder there doc mcdougald said and odoull did the bald medic went on i thought you were crazy when you said you were going to try and patch this leg idve just reached for the bone saw myself but you may get a good result out of it my hats off to you he doffed an imaginary chapeau i hope soand thanks odoull yawned behind his surgical mask granville mcdougald chuckled recognizing the expression odoull added jesus but im tired i believe it this just never ends does it doesnt seem to odoull said now theyll probably ship us back to ohio eh that would give us a few days of vacation oh boy mcdougald said in a hollow voice were getting plenty of practice going back and forth anyway they were still joking about it when the corpsman brought in another wounded man they both fell silent at the same time all odoull said was get him under fast granny mcdougald nodded and put the ether cone over the soldiers face even that wasnt easy hed lost part of his nose hed also lost a chunk of his upper jaw and a bigger chunk of his lower jaw he made horrible gobbling noises nothing like words can you fix him doc one of the corpsmen asked the fellow gulped afterwards and odoull had a devil of a time blaming him this was another artillery horror and viler than most before answering odoull told macdougald get a bloodpressure cuff on him and watch his airway toodont want him drowning on us right the medic handled his end of the business with quick but unhurried competence bp is over he reported a few seconds later hes got a strong pulse the poor bastard he would odoull said morosely he nodded to the stretcher bearer then i dont think hes going to up and die on us but im not sure were doing him any favor keeping him alive yeah the corpsman looked away with the best will in the world with the best plastic surgery in the worldwhich odds were the wounded soldier wouldnt be lucky enough to getpeople would be looking away from the man on the table for the rest of his life did he have a girlfriend a wife would he still once she saw him did he have a little boy what would junior make of daddy with half a face gotta try mcdougald said and odoull nodded some men were tough enough to come through something like this not only sane but triumphant some had people around them who loved them no matter what they looked like most unfortunately didnt knowing that made odoull more hesitant than he wished he were he did what he could to clean the wound trim away smashed tissue and bone and make repairs where and as he could then he shot the man full of morphine and told mcdougald put him under as deep as hell go granny he wont want to be awake once he finally is lets put off the evil minute as long as we can no arguments here back at a field hospital theyll get him all bandaged up so he wont have to look atthatright away if they know what theyre doing theyll break it to him gently yeah odoull said tightly and let it go at that field hospitals were almost as frantic as aid stations would the people farther back of the line have the time to think of gently breaking the news of this mans mutilation even if they did think of it would they have the time to do it or would they treat him as one more body that took up a valuable cot till they could send him somewhere else odoull didnt know but he knew how hed bet granville mcdougald straightened and stretched im gonna have me a cigarette he announced and headed out of the tent sounds good to me leonard odoull didnt want to look at or think about that operating table for a while the virginia countryside wasnt much of an improvement not battered and bludgeoned by war as it was but mutilated meadows were easier to bear than mutilated men mcdougald held out a pack of confederate cigarettes odoull gladly took one the veteran noncom gave him a light he drew in smoke here he almost wished it were the harsh stuff that came from us tobacco wanting to choke would have done more to distract him than this richtasting smoothness off to the south artillery rumbled nothing was coming down close by he thanked the god he was having ever more trouble believing in bad one he said now that you mention ityes dont see ones like that ever day and a good thing too mcdougald exhaled a thin gray stream of smoke you fixed him up as well as anybody could have doc i know and hell still look like something they wouldnt put in a horror movie because it would really scare people odoull took a flask off his belt and swigged from it then offered it to mcdougald he didnt usually drink when he might be operating again in another couple of minutes this time he made an exception you didnt see ones like that every day you can do things now you couldnt begin to in the last war mcdougald said after a swig of his own thanks doc that hits the spot where was i yeahyou really can get him to where he looks like a disaster and not a catastrophe odoull finished for him come on granny theres not enough left to fix ive seen a lot of wounds but that poor fucker made me want to lose my lunch he tried to imagine writing nicole a letter about what hed just done that was cruelly funny he wouldntcouldnthave written it even if the censors would have passed it he always wrote her in french but they would have found somebody who could read it but you couldnt subject anyone you loved to even the shadow of what you went through when you were in combat or where you could see what combat did to men his letters to his wife and son were bright cheerful lies when somebody at the aid station said something funny he would pass that along especially if it stayed funny in french otherwise he just said he was well and safe and not working too hard lie after lie after lie he didnt know anyone who tried to tell the truth not about this kind of thing mcdougald ground out the cigarette under his heel and lit another one days like this i wonder why i stayed in the army he said i wonder why i came back odoull agreed oh no doc oh no you did more for that guy than i ever could have youre good im not badi know im not badbut youre good thanks granny im not good enough not for that nobodys good enough for that odoull muttered something under his breath even he wasnt sure if it was curse or prayer he went on is there any point to all this for us sure granville mcdougald answered if not for us a lot of guys would be a lot worse off than they are what we do is worth doing for the whole thing im not the one to ask about that sir if you want to cross the lines and talk to jake featherston if i ever ran into jake featherston id smash his head in with a rock and screw the hippocratic oath odoull said mcdougald laughed for all the world as if hed been kidding he hadnt not even a little bit in plaintive tones he added featherston went through the last war every goddamn bit of it wasnt that enough for him when you lose a war is never enough mcdougald answered that probably held an unfortunate amount of truth you happen to recall what remembrance day was like before the great war odoull grunted because he did the united states twice beaten and humiliated by the confederates and britain and france had had a lot to remember the regimentation the constant stinting to build up the army and navy the tubthumping speeches the parades with the flag flown upside down as a symbol of distress he sighed so we finally won so what did it get us he waved this what would we have got if we lost mcdougald asked something better something worse christ we might have grown our own featherston tabernac odoull said startled into the quebecois french hed used for so long thats a really scary thought granny the medic only shrugged when things go good everybody laughs at people like that and says they belong in the loony bin but when times get hard they come out of the woodwork and people start paying attention you go well how could they make things any worse lets see what they can do yeah and then they go and do it odoull said featherston wasnt the only one of that breed running around loose these days either action francaise and king charles had mobilized france even sooner than the freedom party grabbed the reins in the csa and in england churchill and mosley were yet another verse of the same sorry song its a bastard mcdougald said except for bashing in featherstons brains to hell with me if i know what to do about it and it might even be too late for that to do any good by now this mess has a life of its own some life the aid station was close enough to the front to share in the smell of the battlefield odoull knew what death smelled like he lived with that odornot always heavy but always there when war was alive that smell always got loose doc hey doc stretcher bearers hauled another wounded man toward the tent with the big red crosses on the sides leonard odoull and granville mcdougald looked at each other maybe they could save this one maybe he wouldnt be horribly mangled maybe theyd find out in a minute shaking their heads they ducked back into the tent appointments appointments appointments jake featherston had started to hate them they chewed up his time and spat it out when he was talking with people he couldnt do the things that really needed doing he even resented ferdinand koenig and if ferd wasnt a friend he didnt have any today a smile lightened the attorney generals heavy features that pinkard fellows given us a new line on things he said we may be able to dispose of more niggers faster than we ever dreamed we could oh yeah sure as hell that piqued jakes interest tell me about it koenig did the more jake listened the more intrigued he got will this shit work he asked do we make it in bulk now or would we have to run up a new factory to get as much as we need thats the beauty of it koenig answered they already use the stuff to fumigate houses and such theres a company in little rockcyclone chemicals the name of the place isthat makes it by the ton they arent the only one either theyre just the biggest well i will be a son of a bitch pinkards chock full of good ideas isnt he jake said promote him a grade and tell him to see what he can do to try this out as fast as he can weve got a big job ahead of us and were going to need all the help we can get ill do it the attorney general wrote in a notebook he pulled from a breast pocket half apologetically he said ive got so much going on i lose things if i dont write em down forget my own head if it wasnt nailed on tight jake laughed i know what you mean boy dont i just but stay on that one ferd taking care of the niggers is just as important as licking the yankees anything else i ought to know about reports i get from here and there grumbling about the war is up a little well deal with it jake muttered to himself things were dragging on longer than hed told the country they would that made propaganda harder than it should have been new offensives going well he said looking on the bright side ill talk with saul too see if we cant figure out a way to perk up morale anything besides that dont think so big and ponderous koenig rose to his feet ill get on the telephone to pinkard right away yeah you do that featherston got up too and walked to the door with him as koenig left jake asked whos next on the list lulu a professor fitzbelmont mr president his secretary answered working underground fazed her not at all jake suspected working underwater wouldnt have fazed her either fitzbelmont the name was vaguely familiar and then with a good politicians neartotal recall for people jake remembered exactly who professor henderson v fitzbelmont was he groaned oh for gods sake the uranium nut how did he get another appointment do you want me to tell him its been canceled sir lulu asked no no jake said resignedly if hes out there cooling his heels in the waiting room hell raise a stink if you send him home now fetch him in ill get rid of him as quick as i can professor fitzbelmont was as rumpled and tweedy as he had been the year before good to see you mr president he said likewise jake lied whats on your mind today professor kindly cut to the chaseive got a lot to do you will remember sir that i told you that uraniumuranium that ishas the potential to make an explosive thousands of times as strong as dynamite i do recollect yeah but i also recollect itd cost an arm and a leg and you werent sure how long itd take or whether you could do it at all has anything changed since then better be something professor or i wont be real happy with you i havent got time to waste henderson v fitzbelmont licked his lips and nervously fiddled with his goldframed spectacles in terms of what we know about uranium itself not much has changed jake started to growl angrily but fitzbelmont plowed ahead anyway but i do know or i can make a good guess that the united states are probably looking at this same question how do you know that featherston rapped out professor fitzbelmont had found a way to make him pay attention all right for one thing their journals have suddenly stopped mentioning uranium at all for another there are large engineering works in the northwestern usa that appear consistent with an effort along these lines and how do you know that i was asked by cs intelligence to identify buildings in photos the professor replied no doubt because of my previous visit to you those officers knew of my interest in that field and if i were to build a plant for producing enriched uranium it would look something like what the united states are building in washington all right featherston surprised himself by how mildly he spoke every once in a while somebody who looked and sounded like a nut turned out not to be one after all this felt like one of those times if the damnyankees are interested in this uranium stuff too there must be something to it thats what youre telling me isnt it i dont know sir not for sure i dont know whether we can isolate u how long doing it would take or how much it would cost there also seems to be a possibility that u can be transmuted can be what jake wished the prof would stop talking like a prof changed fitzbelmont said patiently maybe it can be changed into another element that will also explode theory seems to suggest the possibility i know less about this than i do about u there is much more u so the second possibility would be advantageous to us but i am certain of one thing oh and whats that jake asked as the physics professor surely wanted him to do usually he manipulated not today not right now henderson v fitzbelmont moved in for the kill an intellectual tiger on the prowl if the enemy succeeds in acquiring this weapon and we do not i fail to see how our cause can avoid disaster jake thought about it twenty thousand times as strong as tnt one bomb and no more city the usa with eight or ten of those bombs and the csa with none a fleet of yankee bombers had done horrible things to fort worth and dallas catching the texas towns by surprise that wouldnt happen again the officer whod been asleep at the switch now made his reports in hell those bombers had made him pay for his mistake but if the usa didnt need a fleet of bombers if one airplane would do the job nobody could stop every single goddamn airplane figure out what you need professor jake said heavily money machinery peoplewhatever it is youll get it i want the list as fast as you can shoot it to me no more than two weeks you hear uh yes sir fitzbelmont sounded more than a little dazed he lost a point in jakes book on account of that if hed really believed in this he would have pulled that list out of his briefcase now maybe he hadnt believed he could persuade the president of the csa featherston hoped that was it he accompanied fitzbelmont out of his subterranean sanctum as he had ferd koenig a little while before after the physics professor left jake turned to lulu and said get on the horn to general potter tell him i want to see him here ten minutes ago yes mr president she didnt bat an eye she never did can i tell him what this is in reference to nope ill take care of that when he gets here yes mr president lulu knew what was always the right answer featherston endured a delegation of freedom party officials from alabama and mississippi going on about how they needed more men and more guns to help keep their smoldering negro rebellions from bursting into flames since jake couldnt possibly give them more men he promised them more guns and hoped he wasnt crossing his fingers on the promise they seemed satisfied as they went away whether he could keep them satisfied ill do my goddamnedest thats all clarence potter came in next somebody in the waiting room down the hall was bound to be madder than hell too bad the president thought without preamble he barked what do you know about henderson v fitzbelmont and uranium sweet jesus christ he thought till fitzbelmont came here last year id never even heard of the shit i wish i still hadnt ah potter said has he convinced you he sure as hell has jake answered how about you im no scientist potter warned jake made an impatient noise potter made an apologetic gesture yes sir hes convinced me too sooner or later somebodys going to be able to make a hell of a bang with that stuff if its sooner and if its the damnyankees weve got us some big worries thats how it looks to me too featherston said unhappily he pointed at potter how the hell did you find out about that place in washington thats as far from here as it can be its in the us budgeta lot of money and no details at all about what the yankees are spending it on the intelligence officer replied spotting the combination sent up a red flag good jake said nice to know somebody in your outfit wouldnt blow his brains out if he farted by god now the next question is how did you get the pictures of that place for fitzbelmont to look at i didnt think our spy airplanes could fly that far and i reckon the usad shoot em down most of the time even if they could yes mr president i agree with youthats what would have happened if wed taken off from texas or sonora potter said and we would have given away our interest in the area too so we didnt do that our man in western washington rented a crop duster at a local airstrip nobody paid any attention to him and he got his photos jake featherston guffawed good thats goddamn good but we wont be able to do it again anytime soon though i wouldnt be surprised potter said nodding we found out what we need to know so we dont have to worry about putting the damnyankees backs up by trying it again jake said and clarence potter nodded once more the president aimed his finger like a rifle weve got to keep the usa from finding out that we know what theyre up to and from finding out were up to the very same thing ourselves whatever your superduper topsecret security business is use everything youve got and then some on whatever has anything to do with uranium ive already given those orders sir potter said minimum possible in writing and code phrases all through instead of the name of the metal no telephone discussion at allnever can tell who might be listening you did that just right when you had your secretary call me thanks jake said uranium who wouldve thunk it he would have bet money henderson v fitzbelmont was a nut he would have bet bigand he would have lost his shirt scipio felt like a ghost rattling around in a nearly empty part of the terry his family wasnt the only one in the area to have survived the cleanout but there werent many a few others had got advance warning but only a fewthe ones that had good connections with white folks one way or another nobody knew where the people whod been evacuated had goneor rather had been taken theyd just vanished no cards no letters no photographs came back to augusta maybe the deportees who could write didnt have the chance maybe the cs authorities werent letting them or maybe they were simply dead for the handful who remained life got harder the authorities shut off electricity and gas in the depopulated areas the water still ran maybe that was only an absentminded mistake or maybe the people who ran augusta kept it on so they could put out fires if they had to scipio had nobody he could ask he did ask jerry dover where the deportees went the white man looked him in the eye and said i have no idea could you find out suh scipio asked it do weigh on my mind the manager of the huntsmans lodge shook his head no im not about to ask some answers are dangerous hell some questions are dangerous do i have to draw you a picture no suh scipio answered unhappily dont reckon you do all right then dover hesitated before adding sometimes finding out is worse than wondering you know what i mean had the white man not told him to bring his family when he came to work that one night they would have found out scipio didnt think the answer would have made them happy they might yet learn from the inside out and so might he he didnt want to dover lit a cigarette then held the pack out to scipio who couldnt remember the last time hed seen a white man do even such a simple favor for a black i thanks you kindly scipio said he had matches of his own he didnt need to lean close to dover to get a light from his cigarette his boss might have taken that as an undue familiarity everythings gonna be dover stopped and shook his head shit i dont know whether everythings gonna be all right you got to do the best you can thats all yeah scipio smoked with short savage puffs dont mean no offense suh but you got an easier time sayin dat than i does doin it maybe but maybe i dont too dover said scipio felt a rush of scorn the likes of which hed never known what kind of trouble could the restaurant manager have that came within miles of a negros but then dover went on looks like they may pull me into the army after all more and more people are putting on the uniform these days oh scipio didnt find anything to say to that horrible things happened to negroes in the csa yes but horrible things could happen to anybody in the army too the one difference scipio could see was that dovers family wasnt in danger if he went into the service then a fresh worry surfaced you puts on de uniform suh who take over here well i dont exactly know dover didnt sound comfortable with the answer whoever he be he give a damn about colored folks well i dont exactly know that either do jesus scipio stubbed out the butt in the pressedglass ashtray on the managers desk the deceased cigarette had plenty of company he one o dat kind o buckra we is all dead soon i do know that dover said other thing i know is i cant do thing one about it if they call me up he shrugged i can talk to my own bosses till im blue in the face but they dont have to listento me scipio sometimes had trouble remembering that jerry dover had bosses but he didnt own the huntsmans lodge he just ran the place he was good at what he did if he hadnt been he wouldnt have kept his job for as long as he had as long as he stayed in augusta he had no place to move up from the huntsmans lodge he would have to go to atlanta or maybe even to new orleans to do better now he said go on go to work get your ass in gear not having anything else he could do scipio obeyed despite his worries he got through the shift when he went back to the terry he had no trouble passing through the barriers around the colored part of town cops and stalwarts knew who he was getting back to work the next day he found his boss in a terrible tempernot because hed been called up but because two dishwashers werent there when they were supposed to be that was a normal sort of restaurant crisis and dover handled it in the normal way he hired the first two warm bodies off the street that he could neither of them spoke much english they were mexicansnot confederate citizens from chihuahua or sonora but men out of the empire of mexico up in the csa looking for work now theyd found some and they went at it harder than anyone scipio had seen in a long time they wanted to keep it at first thinking of the restaurant and nothing more scipio was pleased to see their eagerness he didnt blame jerry dover for telling the black men theyd replaced not to bother coming back to work the look on the negroes faces was something to see but the color of those faces didnt win the men much extra sympathy from scipio if you didnt if you couldnt show up you were asking for whatever happened to you showing up on time all the damn time counted for more than just about anything else in the restaurant business that was at first then coming up to the huntsmans lodge a couple of days later scipio walked past a barbershop all the barbers in there had been negroes he couldnt imagine a white confederate demeaning himself by cutting another mans hair but now the barber at the fourth chair though he wore a white shirt and black bow tie like the other threea uniform not far removed from a bartendersdid not look like them he had straight black hair redbrown skin and prominent cheekbones he was in short as mexican as the two new dishwashers ice ran through scipio not when he noticed the new barber but when he realized what the fellow meant which didnt happen for another half a block do jesus he said and stopped so abruptly the white man behind him almost walked up his back watch what youre doing uncle the ofay said irritably i is powerful sorry suh scipio replied the white man walked around him scipio stayed right where he was trying to tell himself he was wrong and having no luck at all he wasnt sorry he was afraid and the longer he stood there the more frightened he got for twenty years and more jake featherston had been screaming his head off about getting rid of the negroes in the confederate states scipio had had trouble taking the freedom party seriously not because he didnt think it hated blacksoh no not because of that but because he didnt see how the csa could get along without them who would cut hair who would wash dishes who would do the field labor that still needed doing despite the swarm of new tractors and harvesters and combines that had poured out of confederate factories whites not likely being a white in the confederacy meant being above such labor and above the people who did it but whites felt themselves superior to mexicans not to the same degree as they did toward negroes but enough and the work blacks did in the csa couldnt have looked too bad to people who had no work of their own which meant if workers from the empire of mexico came north to do the jobs negroes had been doing in the csa the freedom party and jake featherston might be able to have their cake and eat it too scipio wasnt at his best at work that day he was far enough from his best to make jerry dover snap what the hells the matter with you xerxes jus thinkin bout jose an manuel mistuh dover he answered they arent your worry theyre mine if they keep on like theyve started theyre no worry at all and you can take that to the bank you just keep your mind on what youre supposed to be doing thats all everything will be fine if you do yes suh scipio said but yes suh wasnt what he meant jose and manueland that barber in the fourth chairwere the thin end of the wedge if jake featherston banged the other end what would happen nothing good the restaurant manager eyed him you wondering if we can find some damn greaser to do your job tell you one thing the worse you do it the better the chances are that came unpleasantly close to what scipio was thinking say what you would about dover he was nobodys fool aint jus me i is worried about scipio muttered whats that supposed to mean dover asked more mexicans they is mo trouble fo niggers scipio answered oh dover thought about it for a little while then shrugged i cant do anything about that you know the only thing i care about is keeping this place going and ill handle that till they stick a uniform on me and drag me out of here hed done everything a decent man couldmore than most decent men would have scipio had to remind himself of that yes suh the black man said dully hang in there dover said thats all you can do right this minute thats all anybody can do right this minute yes suh scipio said again even more dully than before but then in spite of himself his fear and rage overflowed he let them all out in one sarcastic word freedom jerry dovers eyes got very wide he looked around to see if anyone else could have heard the rallying cry that here was anything but evidently satisfied no one else had he wagged a finger at scipio for all the world like a mother scolding a little boy who had just shouted a dirty word without even knowing what it meant youve got to watch your mouth there xerxes yes suh i knows dat scipio was genuinely contrite he knew what kind of danger hed put himself in dover went on as if he hadnt spoken youve got a nice family i saw them you want to leave them without their pa no suh again scipio meant it still clucking the restaurant manager let it go and let him alone hed told the truth all right here though how much did the truth matter his family like any black family was all too likely to be torn to bits regardless of what he wanted chester martin couldnt have been more bored if the confederates had shot him as a matter of fact they had shot him or rather ripped up his leg with a shell fragment everybody kept assuring him he would get better he believed it he did feel better than he had right after he was wounded thanks to sulfa powder and pills and shots the wound didnt get badly infected a little redness a little soreness on top of the normal pain from getting torn open and that was it everybody kept telling him hed get back to duty pretty soon too he also believed that people kept saying it as if it were good news for the life of him he couldnt understand why hey chester the confederatesll get another chance to maim you or kill you before too long aint that great maybe he was prejudiced but it didnt seem great to him meanwhile he lay on a cot with the iron frame painted army greengray once a day he got exercise and physical therapy the rest of the time he just lay there the army gave him better rations in the hospital than it had while he was in the field that struck him as fundamentally unfair but then so did a lot of other things about the army he also got his pay here money in his pocket let him sit in on a poker game whenever he felt like it the only trouble was he didnt feel like it very often sometimes he sat in even when he didnt much feel like it it was something to do a way to make time go by because he didnt much care whether he won or lost he had a terrific poker face nobody can tell what youre thinking one of the other guys in the game grumbled me i gave up thinking for lent chester said everybody sitting around the table laughed and he had been joking up to a point hed just come back from his exercise one day when a ward orderly stuck his head into the room and said youve got a visitor martin yeah now tell me another one chester said im not bad enough off to need the padre for last rites or anything and who else is gonna want to have anything to do with me the orderly didnt answer he just ducked back out of sight rita walked into the room you idiot she told him and burst into tears chester gaped at his wife what are you doing here he squeaked she pulled a tiny linen handkerchief out of her purse and dabbed at her eyes when i found out you got wounded i asked the war department where you were she answered they told me and so i got on a traingot on a bunch of trains reallyand here i am carls with sue and otis till i get back all right chester said dazedly his sister and brotherinlaw would do fine with his son jesus sweetie its good to see you rita gave him a look laced with vitriol if you like seeing me why did you go put that stupid uniform on again you could have stayed in la and seen me every day he sighed it seemed like a good idea when i did it how many follies got perpetrated because they seemed a good idea at the time was there any way to count them chester didnt think so by the way rita drummed her fingers against the painted iron of the bedstead she didnt either they told me you werent hurt bad enough for them to discharge you from the army she said that means the confederates will have to shoot you at least one more time before i get you back doesnt it i hadnt thought of it like that chester said which was true no maybe you should have rita could be devastating when she felt like it how many pieces of you will be missing when you finally do come home for all either one of us knows i wont get another scratch the rest of the way chester said she didnt laugh in his face she didnt say anything at all her silence made his remark sound even more foolish than it would have anyway he grimaced he knew that as well as she did at last she unbent enough to ask how are you im getting better he answered as soon as the leg is strong enough theyll send me back swell rita said i thought i was going to die when i got the wire that said youd been hurt chance i took chester said its not that bad that was true he would recover as he had when he got hit in the arm during the great war hed seen plenty of men crippled for life plenty of others torn to pieces or blown to bits ritas first husband hadnt come out of the great war alive so she knew about that too what will it be like the next time she demanded pointedly i love you i couldnt stand getting another the war department deeply regrets to inform you telegram id die no i would chester swallowed the words long before they passed his lips rita wouldnt find them funny he did but only in the blackly humorous way that didnt make sense to anyone who hadnt been through the things frontline soldiers had rita came over bent down and laid her head on his shoulder she really started to bawl then i dont want to lose you chester hey babe awkwardly he put his arms around her hey he repeated im not going anywhere he did laugh then because that was literally true almost to chesters relief the orderly came in then and said youve got to go maam doctors dont want him tired out the look she gave the man should have put him in a hospital bed she kissed chester his eyes crossed nobodyd done that since he reenlisted then reluctantly she let the orderly lead her away when shed left the ward the guy in the next bed said must be nice getting a visit from your wife he wasnt even half chesters age by pure coincidence the two of them had almost the same wound yeah it was chester said more or less truthfully she sure caught me by surprise though that was also true too bad you dont have a private room the kidhis name was garyleered at him yeah well chester didnt know why he was embarrassed the same thought had crossed his mind he went on if i wasnt just a noncom if i was an officer like the snotnose whose hand i was holding maybe i would have one lifes a bitch sometimes would we be here if it wasnt gary was a buck private to him a top sergeant was as exalted a personage as any officer at least this side of a general youve got a point chester said of course instead of ending up in a military hospital they could have ended up dead or they could have been maimed not just wounded or we might not have got hurt at all chester thought resentfully but he knew too well how unlikely that was if you stayed in the meat grinder long enough odds were youd brush up against the blades gary was looking at him youre not a lifer are you me hell no chester said do i look crazy never can tell gary wouldnt get in dutch for sassing a sergeant here the rules were relaxed for wounded men its like your wife saidif youre so smart how come you signed up for round two when youd already been through round one we licked those confederate bastards once but then we let em up and look what we got chester answered millions of maniacs screaming freedom and out to take anything they can grab if we dont beat em again theyll damn well beat us and then we have to start all over yeah but why you gary persisted you paid your dues the last time you didnt have to take a chance on getting your ass shot off twice youre too young to know what remembrance day was like before the last war chester said slowly it really was a day of remembrance and a day of mourning things shut down tight except for the parades and the speeches nobody who saw it could ever forget the flag going by upside down the confederates and the limeys and the frogs beat us twice we had to get tough we had to build up if we were going to pay them backand we did i dont ever want to see the country go through anything like that again that talks about the country that doesnt talk about you gary said me im here on account of i got conscripted but they werent going to conscript you you old fart he didnt say it but he might as well have so how come you volunteered to let em take another shot at you youre not custeryou arent going to win the war all by yourself that would have been insulting if it hadnt been true yeah i know chester said with a sigh but if everybody sat on his hands wed lose thats the long and short of it so i put the uniform back on and look what it got you gary said i think i did some good before i got hurt chester said i commanded a company for a while the last time around so wait a second gary broke in you were an officer then chester snorted hell no just an ordinary threestriper but when everybody above me got killed or wounded i filled the slot for a while did all right if i say so myself after a while they found a lieutenant to run it if i could do that then i didnt have any trouble helping a shavetail run a platoon this time ill probably do the same thing somewhere else when they turn me loose here youre like a football coach gary said sort of i guess i never even thought about coaching football though i used to play itnot for money but on a steelmill team we werent bad we sure had some big guysyou better believe that chesters eye went to the clock on the wall it was a few minutes before eleven hey greek youve got two good legs turn on the wireless why dont you news coming up sure the guy called greek had one arm in a cast but nothing was wrong with the other the knob clicked the set started to hum everybody waited for the tubes to warm up what came out of the wireless when the sound started reminded chester of a polka played by a set of drunken madmen when it mercifully ended the announcer said that was the engels brothers new recording featherstons follies everyone snorted the engels brothers were madmen the announcer went on and now the news heavy fighting is reported in and around cleveland a different announcer said the fierce us defense is costing the confederates dearly chester knew what that meantthe united states were getting hammered the newsman continued occupation authorities have also declared that the situation in canada is under control despite enemy propaganda he went on to another story in a hurry chester didnt think that sounded good either x too many things were happening all at once for flora blackfords comfort none of them seemed to be good things either the us offensive in virginia on which so many hopes had been pinned was heading nowhere the new confederate assault in ohio by contrast was going much better than she wished it were the mormons still tied down far too many soldiers in utah and the canadian uprising from everything she could gather was a lot more serious than the authorities were willing to admit in the papers or on the wireless all in all the joint committee on the conduct of the war had plenty to do she would rather it didnt and there were other distractions her secretary stuck her head into the inner office and said miss clemens is here to speak with you congresswoman thank you flora meant anything but some things couldnt be helped though send her in in marched the reporter ophelia clemens had to be fifteen years older than flora but still looked like someone who took no guff from anybody there at least the two women had something in common hello congresswoman mind if i smoke she said and had a cigarette going before flora could say yes or no that done she held out the pack care for a coffin nail yourself no thanks i never got the habit flora said and then thats a confederate brand though isnt it you betcha if youre gonna go go first class ophelia clemens said flora didnt know how to answer that so she didnt try the reporter came straight to the point how many soldiers are we going to have to send up to canada to help the frenchies keep the lid on i dont have a number for that flora said cautiously you might do better asking at the war department yeah and i might not ophelia clemens said with a scornful toss of the head those people were born lying and you know it as well as i do since flora did she didnt bother contradicting the correspondent im afraid i still dont have the answer even if its just one itll be more than we can afford scritch scritch clemens pencil raced across a notebook page thats the truthand its a good quote how come the confederates can advance whenever they want to but we keep dropping the ball if i knew that id belong on the general staff not here flora said ophelia clemens laughed though she hadnt been joking she continued the joint committee is doing its best to find out do you think keeping our generals on a redhot grill will make them perform better the reporter asked i hope we dont do that flora said i hope you do ophelia clemens said theyd better be more afraid of us than they are of the enemy she waited to see if flora would rise to the barb when flora didnt she tried another question is our publicity making the confederates treat their negroes any differentany better i should say that flora was ready to comment on not one bit she said angrily theyre as disgraceful as ever and as proud of it as ever too the pencil flew over the page too bad the correspondent said ive heard the same thing from other people but its still too damn bad nice to know someone thinks so flora held up a hand this is off the record she waited ophelia clemens nodded flora went on too many people on this side of the border just dont care or else they say the damn niggers have it coming to them yes ive seen that too clemens said all depends on whose ox is being gored if the freedom party were going after irishmen or jews theyd be squealing like a pig stuck in a fence she threw back her head and let out a sudden startling noise she knew what a stuck pig sounded like all right and then raising an eyebrow she added no offense flora had wondered if the older woman remembered she was jewish that answered that she said what she had to say none taken good some people can get stuffy about the strangest things where was i that last seemed aimed more at herself than at flora flipping pages in the notebook ophelia clemens found what she was looking for oh yeah that she looked up at flora have you noticed theres something funny in the budget theres always something funny in the budget flora answered were in a war that just makes it funnier than usual ophelia clemens sent her an impatient look this has to do with funny business in she checked her notes again in washington thats where washington state i mean the government is spending money hand over fist out there and ill be damned if i can figure out why oh that with those two words flora realized shed admitted to knowing what that was she hadnt wanted to but didnt see that she had much choice sighing she said miss clemens i dont know all the details about that but i have been persuaded that keeping it secret is in the best interests of the united states the less said about it especially in the newspapers the better youve been persuaded the correspondent raised a gingery eyebrow i thought you were hard to persuade about such things i am i hope i am anyway flora said this is one of those times though have you spoken with mr roosevelt about this business no should i would he tell me anything ophelia clemens wasnt writing now flora took that for an encouraging sign i dont know whether he would or not im inclined to doubt it she said but i think he might have more to say than i would about why you shouldnt publish well ill try him clemens got to her feet ill try him right now as a matter of fact she sent flora a wry grin but youll be on the telephone before i can get over there wont you yes flora didnt waste time with denials he needs to know i told youi do think this is that important all right fair enough i suppose nice chatting with youturned out more interesting than i figured it would with no more farewell than that ophelia clemens swept out of the office no sooner had the door closed behind her than flora was on the telephone to the war department before long she had the assistant secretary of war on the line hello flora to what do i owe the pleasure of this call franklin roosevelt inquired jaunty as usual ophelia clemens is on her way to see you flora answered without preamble somehow or other shes got wind of whats going on in washington oh dear that doesnt sound so good roosevelt said i wonder how it happened i dont know i doubt shed tell you flora said but i thought you ought to know thank you shes a chip off the old block all right roosevelt said flora made a questioning noise roosevelt explained her father was a reporter out in san francisco for a million years he had a nasty sense of humorfunny but nastyand he spent most of it on the democrats if i remember straight he died not long before the great war started stan clemens his name was or maybe sam stan i think you could ask ophelia when she gets there flora said shes on her way now and shes not the kind of person who wastes a lot of time franklin roosevelt laughed well im sure youre right about that i wonder what sort of cockandbull story ill have to tell her she knows at least some of the truth flora warned remembering how little of the truth she really knew herself if what she hears from you doesnt match what she already knows that will be worse than if you didnt tell her anything at all think of the headlines boondoggle to end all boondoggles roosevelt seemed to be quoting one he also seemed to be enjoying himself while he did it he went on where did that word come from anyway it sounds like it ought to be something a confederate would say it does doesnt it flora said i dont know where its from not for sure ive certainly heard it i dont think you can live in philadelphia without hearing it thats because so many boondoggles live here roosevelt said cheerfully no doubt flora didnt sound cheerful or anything close to it is this project out in washington another one if it works no one will ever say a word about what we spent on it the assistant secretary of war answered and if it doesnt nobody will ever stop investigating us i cant do anything about it either way except hope it works and do everything i can to help the people who know more about it than i do that sounded less encouraging than flora wished it did but was perhaps more honest than the usual glowing promises she said i think you ought to tell ophelia clemens as much as youve told mehowever much that isand swear her to secrecy if shell swear to instead of swearing at roosevelt sounded dubious she may not like the administration she may not even like the government no matter whos in charge flora said but ill tell you one thing franklin i promise she likes it better than she likes jake featherston mm youve probably got something there roosevelt admitted noyouve definitely got something there i think im going to have to call the president before i talk to her but thats what ill put to him before i go though ive got a question for you go ahead what is it flora said midterm elections coming up this november has the joint committee talked about how were going to handle the house districts the confederates are occupying thank god neither senator from ohio is up for reelection this year senator taftwho was from ohiohas said the same thing flora answered roosevelt laughed ill bet he has right now the plan is to let the congressmen in occupied districts hold their seats flora added that seems only fair and it doesnt hurt that theyre pretty evenly split between socialists and democrats theres even a republican republicans franklin roosevelt laughed again this time on a sour note the lukewarm the politicians who cant make up their minds one way or the other no wonder the american people spewed that party out of their mouths the language was from the new testament but flora understood it she was a jew but she was also an american and the usa for better or worseno for better and worsewas a christian country if you lived here you had to accommodate yourself to that reality of course the confederacy was also a christian country and what did that say about christianity nothing good she was sure clarence potter did not care for professor henderson v fitzbelmont the dislike was plainly mutual potter thought fitzbelmont was a pompous stuffed shirt not being a mind reader he didnt know just what the physics professor thought of him probably that he was a military oaf who couldnt add two and two without counting on his fingers that stung since potter reckoned himself a cultured man hed known a lot of military oafs in his time to be thought one himself rankled his surroundings conspired against him instead of bringing professor fitzbelmont back to richmond he like mohammed had gone to the mountainin his case to the edge of the blue ridge mountains washington university was in lexington virginia not far from the virginia military institutewhat the damnyankees called the confederate west point war hadnt come home here it was something people read about in the newspapers and heard about on the wireless every once in a while airplanes would drone by overhead but the locals were still talking about a us air raid on vmi the year before after that calling card the yankees hadnt come back for clarence potter whod watched men work on unexploded bombs and whod spent enough time underground to get little beady eyes like a mole this was the next best thing to paradise the streets werent full of rubble and broken glass artillery didnt rumble in the distance the air didnt stink of smokeand of death the university sat at the top of a sloping meadow at the northwest edge of lexington professor fitzbelmonts office in one of the red brick buildings with white porticoes at the heart of the campus had a fine view of the forested mountains to the west the professors tweeds seemed far more appropriate here than potters butternut uniform with such patience as potter could muster he said i have to understand this business as well as i can professor to be able to give my people in the united states the best possible idea of what to look for indeed professor fitzbelmont looked like a maiden aunt called upon to discuss the facts of life with the madam of the local bawdyhouse he looked just like that in fact he might not approve of clarence potter the soldier but he definitely didnt approve of clarence potter the spy potter nodded to himself hed seen that before professor there isnt a country in the world that can get along without an intelligence service we spy on the damnyankees yes and you can bet your bottom dollar they spy on us too if theyre ahead of us in this uranium business we need to do everything we can to catch up dont we indeed fitzbelmont repeated even more distaste in his voice than hed shown the time before sir you were the one who brought this to the presidents attention you must have done that because youre a patriotic citizen potter said i dont want those people to beat my country again henderson fitzbelmont packed more scorn into that than most confederates did into damnyankees he went on if that makes me a patriot so be it but if you expect me to jump up on my hind legs and shout freedom every other sentence i fear you will be disappointed in me he was either braver or more naive than potter had thoughtmaybe both the intelligence officer said i dont do that either fitzbelmonts eyebrow was eloquently skeptical potter continued by god sir i dont my politics have always been whig and i did everything i could to keep jake featherston from getting elected that was not only true it was a spectacular understatement he could talk about it too because it was common knowledge talking about going up to richmond in with a pistol in his pocket was a different story he finished im also a confederate patriot though for better or worsefor better and worsethis is my country professor fitzbelmont studied him perhaps seeing the man instead of the uniform this time maybe he said at last maybe isnt the right answer professor clarence potter said gently you can talk to me now or you can have some less pleasant conversations with some much less pleasant people later on your call either way fitzbelmont didnt try to misunderstand him the physics professor did try to get huffy this is not the right way to get my cooperation general and if i dont work with you wholeheartedly how will you go forward potters smile all sharp teeth might have been borrowed from a gator he named four physics profs at universities scattered across the csa henderson v fitzbelmont looked appalled still smiling carnivorously potter said give me credit for doing my homework please if you were the only fellow in the country who could do this work we couldnt compete with the yankees anyhow because they have so much more manpower than we doand that includes trained manpower along with every other kind you may be important professoryou are importantbut youre not indispensable and youd better get used to it plainly fitzbelmont wanted to be indispensable how many years had he been the next thing to invisible a lot no doubtwho paid attention to a bespectacled physics professor well important would damn well have to do with a sigh fitzbelmont said tell me what you already know there are two kinds of uranium u will go boom u wont but maybe if you do things to it it will turn into something else that will go boom i dont quite follow that part it seems like magic but anyway most of the uranium is and its going to be harder than hell to separate the out of it potter paused how am i doing youll never make a physicist professor fitzbelmont said i dont want to be a physicist thats your job potter said i want to know enough to be able to do my job tell me what my people need to look for to tell whether the damnyankees are separating from or if theyre doing this other stuff with to make it go boom hed asked fitzbelmont the same thing when he first walked into the professors office if fitzbelmont had started talking then he could have saved both of them some time potter approved of saving time wherever he could some people though had to work up to things by easy stages potter had done more homework than hed shown the physics professor he believed in keeping a couple of hole cards hidden all the same once fitzbelmont did start talking he had a hard time keeping up gaseous diffusion thermal diffusion centrifuges those were complicated enough but what fitzbelmont called an atomic engine was worse wait a minute potter protested you really change the u into another element thats right fitzbelmont nodded when i went to yale back before the last war my chemistry professor told us transmutation was impossible potter said so thats why you talk the way you do henderson fitzbelmont murmured he shrugged narrow shoulders and went on your chemistry professor was right in a way you cant transmute elements chemically chemistry only has to do with the electrons around the nucleus change the nucleus though and you change the atom and nuclear processes are much more energetic than chemical ones do you have any idea how long it will take us or the yankees to get the for a bomb or to get one of your atomic engines going potter asked can we do it in this war can they turning theory into engineering is never simple fitzbelmont said the researchers in the usa must think they can do it fast or they wouldnt be putting so much effort into it and who knows where the germans are they were the ones who discovered uranium fission in the first place after all are england and france working on this stuff too potter asked id be amazed if they werent they have some talented peoplemore than we do probably the parenthetical phrase while true plainly made professor fitzbelmont unhappy it made clarence potter unhappy too it was true in more areas than nuclear physics the confederacys biggest problem had always been doing all the things it needed to do with the number of white men it had to do them doing all of them had proved beyond its ability in the great war potter had to hope it wouldnt this time around that one of the things the csas whites had to do was hold down the countrys blacks made things no easier the freedom partys determination to settle that mess once and for all helped justify its rule in potters eyes if whites didnt have to worry about niggers they could get on with the serious business of building the country they should have had from the beginning incorporating blacks into the pool of trained manpower would also have reduced the drain on whites and on the csa generally but it never once crossed clarence potters mindor those of any other whites in the confederate states theyd experimented with colored soldiers in the great war and some of those men whod learned what fighting was about remained in arms against the csa even now no one in authority would make that mistake again potter pulled his thoughts back to the business at hand you dont know for a fact what the british and french are up to im afraid not fitzbelmont shook his head whatever it is theyll be keeping it secret too i suppose so potter hesitated then asked are they likely to be ahead of us if we get hold of them about it will they be able to give us information that would help us move faster its possible certainly i dont know how probable it is have to find out potter wrote himself a note he wondered whether the british and french would help the confederacy theyd always looked on the csa as a poor relation a tool to keep the united states weak but never more than a local power but if the confederate states had this superbomb they wouldnt be a local power anymore one more question professor do you think the germans are helping the united states henderson v fitzbelmont looked at him over the tops of those goldframed spectacles you are the intelligence officer general surely you would know better than i so there potter thought the truth was he had no idea he didnt think anyone in the csa did you couldnt find an answer if you didnt know you should be asking the question glancing at his watch fitzbelmont said is there anything else i have to go to class in a few minutes some of the people im teaching will probably be working with me when we start real work on thisif we do oh i dont think you need to worry about that professor potter said if the damnyankees are going full speed ahead on this we will be too we cant afford not to can we he imagined superbombs blowing richmond and atlanta and new orleans off the map then he imagined them coming down on philadelphia and new york city and boston instead he liked that much better cleveland was a mess tom colleton had been sure it would be a mess before his regiment got into the city builtup terrain was bad for barrelstoo many places to ambush them machinegun nests cut into the firepower edge his men had over their us opponents this was great war fighting block to block and house to house it wasnt the way the confederates had wanted to fight this war sometimes though you had no choice leaving cleveland and its harbor untaken would have asked for worse trouble than slugging it out in the wreckage a us landing and a thrust south from the city would have played merry hell with supply lines meanwhile though a lot of good men were dying the only good news was that the damnyankees didnt have as many men in the city as they might have theyd weakened their defenses to put as much as they could into virginia and not all the men whod gone were back that let the confederates keep pushing forward despite casualties a lot of the big steel mills and refineries on the flats by the lake structures that could have turned into formidable fortresses had already fallen the confederate advance had touched the cuyahoga in a couple of places but the men in butternut didnt yet own bridgeheads on the east bank of the river above the city confederate hound dogs and us wright fighters wrestled in the sky when the hound dogs had the edge mule dive bombers screamed down to pound us ground positions when the wrights gained the upper hand they shot down the asskickers before the bombers could deliver the goods right now the confederates were on top in the air war maybe cs bombers had hit airstrips farther east so us fighters had trouble getting off the ground whatever the reason asskickers smashed us positions that even barrels couldnt take out antiaircraft fire was heavy but antiaircraft fire was only a nuisance fighters were a mule pilots great fear all the bridges over the cuyahoga were down tom colleton wondered if any bridges in the usa and the csa didnt have demolition charges ready to go up at a moments notice he wouldnt have bet on it sir a runner came back from the line a couple of hundred yards ahead sir looks like the damnyankees are pulling back that machine gun that was givin us hellit aint there no more no toms suspicions roused before his eagerness that was natural in anyone whod seen more than a little war all right he said at last send a patrol forward only a patrol you hear me theyre liable to be setting up to bushwhack us if we get too happy yes sir send a patrol forward the soldier started forward himself he ran hunched over dodging from cover to cover any runner who lasted more than twenty minutes learned that gait odds were it just put off the inevitable few runners were likely to last out the war tom waited he ordered the regimental reserve up closer to the front if the us soldiers truly had retreated he wanted to be in position to take advantage of it if they hadnt well the patrol would find out if they hadnt the runner came back again sir theyre really gone he reported were moving up till we bump into em again good thats good tom said his company commanders were up to snuff they could see what needed doing without his telling them he would have been angry if theyd waited for orders before advancing he turned to his wireless man get back to divisionlet em know were up in square blue blue yes sir the wireless man answered when the next artillery duel started tom didnt want his own sides shells coming down on his mens heads some would anywaysome always did but there wouldnt be so many if the gunners knew where his soldiers were corpsmen wearing white smocks with the red cross on chest and back and helmets with the emblem painted in a white circle carried the wounded back to aid stations youll be fine tom said more than once and always hoped he wasnt lying one of the injured men wore greengray not butternut the corpsmen had no doubt risked their lives to bring in the yankee nobody was supposed to shoot at them but accidentsand artillery which didnt discriminatehappened to be fair us medics did the same for wounded confederates the geneva convention was worth something anyhow geneva convention or not the smell of death filled tom colletons nostrils so did the other stenches of war cordite and shit and blood and fear just getting a whiff of that sharp sour tang made him want to be afraid too it struck at an animal level far below conscious thought confederate artillery might have spared his men but gunners in greengray didnt some of the shells gurgled as they flew through the air some of the bursts sounded odd colleton swore he knew what that meant hed known since gas he shouted and yanked his mask out of the pouch on his belt he pulled it on and made sure it fit snugly gas he yelled again this time the mask muffled the word others though were also taking up the cry somebody was beating on an empty shell casing with a wrench the clatter penetrated the din of combat better than most other noises it was a hot sticky summer day in cleveland it was in fact as hot and sticky as it ever got down in st matthews south carolina the damnyankees had nastier winters than the confederacy ever got but their summers were no milder as far as he could see that meant they got the worst of both worlds even without the mask he didnt feel as if he were getting enough air with it he might as well have been trying to breathe underwater one of the gases the yankees used could kill if a drop of it got on your skin people were issued rubberized suits to protect them from the menace tom had never ordered his men to wear those suits he didnt know anybody who had especially in this weather moving around in them steamed you in your own juices soldiers preferred risking the gas to dying of heat exhaustion which more than a few of them had done he swore the mask muffled the curses too trust the high foreheads to come up with protection that made danger seem welcome by comparison if that wasnt a metaphor for the futility of war in general but this war in particular had better not be futile not for the csa tell division we need counterbattery fire and we need it ten minutes ago he shouted to the wireless operator for a wonder the confederate guns woke up in short order some of what they threw at the yankees was gas too even when the shells flew by far overhead you could hear the stuff sloshing inside them tom laughed if anything was worse than being an infantryman under gas attack it was trying to jerk shells with a gas mask on serves you right you bastards he thought savagely see how you like it the us bombardment slackened but didnt stop then a flight of mules swooped down on the yankee gun positions one of the asskickers crashed in flames maybe it got hit maybe the pilot didnt pull out of his dive soon enough what difference did it make one way or the other but the dive bombers did a better job of silencing the artillery than counterbattery fire had some confederate barrels clattered and crunched up to the front fighting inside one of them was no picnic in weather like this either especially when they needed to stay buttoned up tight against gas but their guns blasted the us soldiers out of the positions to which theyd withdrawn come on tom shouted running forward we can get to the river maybe we can even get over the river before long he caught up with the barrels and then ran past them soldiers turned to stare at him in their pigsnouted portholed masks they looked like the martians in that yankee film that had scared the pants off everybody a few years before the war but he knew the magic words that would get them moving follow me that spell never failed men might balk at going forward alone but they would go after an officer toms heart thudded in his chest he hoped he didnt fall over dead leading from the front middleaged officers took that chance when they tried to lead young men to his relief the barrels also rumbled forward armor and infantry working together were hard to stop the damnyankees didnt stop them tom whooped the river he yelled there was the muddy cuyahoga winding its way north and west toward lake erie the tail of a crashed fighter stuck up from the water near the far bank on that far bank us troops didnt seem to know they had trouble tom ordered his men not to shoot across the river he sent an urgent request back to division for engineers with rubber boats if they could cross in a hurry set up a bridgehead on the far bank maybe theyd get slaughtered troops that tried to do too much too fast sometimes did but maybe theyd shake the yankees loose from the river line too for a wonder the engineers showed up in less than an hour soldiers piled into the boats as fast as the engineers could inflate them the confederates paddled like men possessed but their foes didnt stay bemused long enough heavy machinegun fire from the east bank of the river turned them back with heavy losses cs barrels waddled forward and shelled the machinegun nests lets try it again tom shouted this time he scrambled into one of the black rubber boats himself hed get over the cuyahoga or hed probably die in it he grabbed a paddle and thrust it into the muddy water the machine guns stayed quiet the barrels had done their job then rifle fire from the far bank was galling but no worse than galling confederate machine guns some on the barrels and others served by infantrymen made the damnyankee riflemen keep their heads down a bullet cracked past tom when you heard that crack the round came too damn close he automatically ducked not that it would have done him any good nobody thought anything less of him for ducking only a handful of nerveless people lacked that reflex here came the far bank lets go tom yelled and paddled harder than ever as soon as the rubber boat grounded on the mud he leaped out and ran for the closest wreckage he threw a grenade into what looked like the mouth of a cave in case any us soldiers lurked there then dove behind a burnedout truck carcass stay down he called to his men if they want you make em pay for you more confederates got over the cuyahoga us soldiers rushed up to try to wipe out the bridgehead before it got established a mortar bomb whispered down much closer to tom than he would have liked fragments of hot jagged steel snarled through the air not far away somebody shriekedsome of those fragments had snarled through flesh instead asskickers that stooped on the attacking men in greengray might have been angels in camouflage paint tom colleton yelled exultantly at the chance to get killed farther east in ohio than other confederates had before him sergeant michael pound approved of the way lieutenant bryce poffenbergers combat education was coming lieutenant poffenberger hadnt gone and killed himself yet even more to the point the barrel commander hadnt yet gone and killed sergeant pound pound strongly approved of that what he didnt approve of were the new confederate barrels no that wasnt quite true he highly approved of themas machines what he didnt approve of was that the longsnouted monsters had confederates inside them and not us barrelmen we could have had barrels like that he told lieutenant poffenberger as they camped somewhere between akron and canton we could have had them more than ten years ago but we didnt want to spend the money incautiously poffenberger said and i suppose you were there at the creation yes sir pound saidif the puppy forgot he had to have his nose rubbed in it i was at the barrel works at fort leavenworth when general morrellof course he wasnt a general then just a coloneldesigned the prototype for the model were using now if wed had that then we would have upgraded long since im sure of it poffenberger stared at him firelight shone from the junior officers wide eyes not for the first time he asked the question a lot of people had asked before him why the devil arent you an officer sergeant what he meant by it was why the devil arent you out of my hair i like what im doing sir pound replied in his best innocent tones things arelooser this way hrmp poffenberger said a noise that might have meant anything at all if youll excuse me sir pound waited to be sure the lieutenant wouldnt hold him then walked over to the barrel the driver a blond from dakota named tor svenson was fiddling with the engine wrench in one hand flashlight in the other any good barrel crew did a lot of its own maintenance the big heavy machines operated ator often pastthe limits of engine transmission and suspension and they broke down a lot even when coddled and cosseted whats up svenson the driver had been so engaged in what he was doing he needed a moment to realize somebody was talking to him when he looked up a smear of grease darkened one viking cheekbone oh its you sarge he said relief in his voice relief that it wasnt second lieutenant bryce poffenberger pound wouldnt have been surprised svenson went on you notice how the beast doesnt quite pick up fast enough when i goose it uhhuh pound nodded figure its the carb yah but i cant find anything wrong with the son of a bitch let me have a look with a grunt pound heaved himself up onto the machine so he could look down on the engine as a matter of fact he did look down on it it wasnt powerful enough to let the barrel do everything he wished it could he had a variety of wrenches and other tools in his coverall pockets some of them helped him adjust his beloved gun the others clanked there because any barrelman whod been at his trade for a while turned into a pretty fair mechanic svenson had already partly disassembled the carburetor pound continued the attack with his own wrenches and soon a needlenosed pliers and a jewelers screwdriver svenson watched with interest occasionally offering a suggestion he wasnt a bad mechanic himself but recognized pound was a better one what do you think the driver asked in due course looks to me like the metering rods not quite in synch with the throttle valve so you get that delay when you want high power pound answered i like a power jet betterless to go wrong but weve got what weve got clean everything out there real well and it should be all right he crossed his fingers yah ill do it sarge some of the flat vowels of scandinavia lingered in svensons speech thanks im not sure i wouldve picked that up myself i expect you would have pound didnt know whether the driver would have or not but svenson worked hard he was also a man whom a pat on the back helped more than a boot in the backside he grinned a dirtyfaced grin at pound as he started setting the delicate mechanism to rights when they moved out the next morning the engine was noticeably smoother pound reminded himself to say something nice to svenson when they stopped somewhere there wasnt a lot of really open ground as they moved northwest towards akron ohio was densely settled suburbs spread from towns like tentacles that meant a barrel commander had to have eyes in the back of his head to keep from walking into trouble lieutenant poffenberger did his best he rode head and shoulders out of the cupola so he could look around in all directions staying buttoned up and using the periscopes was safer for the commander but much more dangerous for the barrel as a whole the open cupola also let a little fresh air into the machine that was good it felt hot enough in there to cook meat at least the engine had a compartment of its own which it hadnt in great war barrels pound wiped sweat off his forehead with a coverall sleeve and thought longingly of blizzards foot soldiers trotted alongside the barrels if they started yelling about gasor if they started putting on masks for they might not be heard no matter how they yelledthe machine would have to button up that would be even less pleasant than it was already for all of lieutenant poffenbergers good intentions he never saw the cs barrel that wrecked the one he commanded the shot came from the side wham clang it was like getting kicked by a mule the size of a brontosaurus the barrel stopped at once the steel bulkhead between the engine compartment and the crew would hold fire at bayfor a little while holy jesus poffenberger yipped his voice high and shrill sir weve got to get out of here right now michael pound said urgently yes poffenberger said had he said no pound would have clipped him and then got out anyway poffenberger started up through the cupola a burst of machinegun fire from that same confederate barrelor so pound thoughtmade his body jerk and twitch the lieutenant let out a thin startled bleat and slumped back down into the turret he blocked pounds escape and the loaders swearing pound heaved his body up again so he himself could get at the escape hatch on the far side of the turret his hands left blood on the steel as he undogged the hatch come on he shouted to the man who sat below him and to his left what about the lieutenant asked the loaderhis name was jerry fields hes gone get moving goddammit next one hits right here pound hauled himself out of the turret with his muscular arms he crouched on the stricken barrels chassis then dropped to the ground the loader was right behind him they used the barrel as cover against enemy fire from the flank flame and black smoke boiled up from the engine compartment that would help hide them from confederates trying to do them in a hatch opened at the front of the barrel tor svenson and the bow gunner tumbled out one after the other pound shouted and waved to them that enemy machine gun blew off the top of the bow gunners head svensons dash turned into a limp and then a crawl as pound crouched to bandage the drivers leg another armorpiercing round slammed into the barrel just as hed known it would ammunition started cooking off inside the cheerful poppoppop of machinegun cartridgeslike a string of firecrackers on the fourth of julymingling with the deeper roars of the shells for the main armament the explosions blew what was left of lieutenant poffenbergers body off the turret more flames and smoke burst from the cupolaincluding a perfect smoke ring as if satan were puffing on a stogie how is it svenson pound asked hurts like a bastard the driver answered with the eerie matteroffactness of a justwounded man pound nodded the bullet had taken a nasty bite out of svensons calf pound gave him a shot of morphine then yelled for a corpsman feel naked outside the machine the loader said no kidding pound replied with feeling he felt worse than nakedhe felt like a snail yanked out of its shell the infantrymen around him knew how to be softskinned slugs but he had no idea the on his belt a reasonable selfdefense weapon for a barrel crewman suddenly seemed a kids water pistol the war went on without him nobody cared that his barrel had been smashed or that lieutenant poffenberger was nothing but torn burnt bleeding meat and the bow gunnerd had his brains blown out other us barrels kept grinding towards akron for all he knew some of them were hunting the cs machine that had put him out of action foot soldiers loped past none of them stopped for the deshelled snails as proper slugs they had worries of their own a couple of corpsmen did come up all rightwell take charge of him one of them said looks like you done pretty good thanks pound said he turned to jerry fields come on lets get moving where to the loader asked reasonably wherever we can find somebody wholl put us back in another barrel or at least give us something to do pound answered we cant stay here thats for damn sure he couldnt have been righter about that the confederates on the us flank ripped into the advancing men in greengray a shell from a cs barrel slammed into the turret of a us machine letting him see what hed been afraid of a couple of minutes earlier the highvelocity round almost tore the turret right off the barrel the men inside never had a chance they had to be hamburger even before their ammo started cooking off jesus fields said beside him that couldve been us really that never occurred to me pound said the loader for whom sarcasm was a foreign language gave him a peculiar look in the face of concentrated automaticweapons fire us foot soldiers went down as if to a reaper a reaper is righta grim one pound thought all he knew about infantry combat was to stay low that didnt seem to be enough he pulled out the in case any confederate soldiers got close enough to make it dangerous it didnt seem to be enough either the attack unraveled it quickly grew obvious the us soldiers werent going to make it to portage lake let alone into akron instead of going northwest they started going southeast as fast as they could the question became whether they would be able to hang on to canton and the answer looked more and more like no pound hated retreats he wanted to do things to the enemy not have those nasty bastards on the other side do things to him but one of the things he didnt want them to do was kill him he fired several rounds from the he had no idea whether he hit anybody with luck he made some confederates keep their heads down without luck no luck was with him for he got back to cantonstill in us handsalive and unhurt and as for what the powers that be came up with nexthed worry about that later although the newspapers the confederates let into the andersonville prison camp boasted of cs victories and us disasters major jonathan moss didnt throw them away that was not to say he believed them confederates in cleveland ridiculous confederates in canton preposterous confederates in youngstown absurd and the news from more distant lands struck him as even less likely the japs threatening to take away the sandwich islands the russians driving toward warsaw he shook his head whoever came up with those headlines had a warped sense of humor only on the western front in europe where the papers admitted that germany still had soldiers fighting did even the tiniest hint of reality emerge like the rest of the us officers in the camp though moss did hold on to the newspapers he got since the confederates didnt issue toilet paper and red cross packages held only a little the product of jake featherstons propaganda mills made the best available substitute he wasnt the only one dubious about what sort of leaves confederate headline writers loaded into their pipes an indignantlooking captain named ralph lahrheim came up to him one breathlessly hot and muggy afternoon and waved a copy of a rag called the augusta constitutionalist in his face what do you think of this major lahrheim demanded in irate tones what do you think that one i dont much like it moss answered gravely its scratchier than most of the atlanta papers no no nothat isnt what i meant lahrheim said i was talking about the story oh the story havent seen this one yet moss said the younger manthere werent a lot of older men in the camphanded him the newspaper he read the story lahrheim pointed out then made a reluctant clucking noise well captain a lot of canucks dont much like the usa yeah i know what but could they throw us out of winnipeg could they cut the eastwest railroads im sure they could cut some of them moss answered all i dont know about that i dont know how strong the rebels are in winnipeg i suppose they could drive us out for a while were busy a lot of other places captain lahrheim said as if to declare that the canadians couldnt hope to cause the usa trouble if that werent so that was true it was also rather aggressively irrelevant it was in fact irrelevant enough that moss couldnt resist mocking it really i hadnt noticed lahrheim turned red youre making fun of me he had a rubbery face that conveyed indignation even better than his voice not of you captain not personally moss said the andersonville camp was crowded you had to be able to get along with people if you possibly could again though lawyers instinct or perhaps plain cussedness made him add you did say something silly after a moment captain lahrheim managed a laugh of sorts well maybe i did he allowed but he remained indignant even if he aimed his ire in a different direction did you see how the damn frenchies performed did you they just cut and run sounds like i did notice that yes moss was disappointed if less surprised than the other officer men from the republic of quebec were tolerable occupation troops their mere presence had made englishspeaking canadians think twice about rising against the forces that had beaten them in the great war once the canucks had thought twice and rose anyway the men from quebec proved less then enthusiastic about putting them down there werent enough frenchies to go around and they werent really trained for serious combat anyway we have to do everything ourselves lahrheim grumbled a constant complaint in the usa maybe there werent enough americans to go around either jonathan moss hoped there were but how could you tell ahead of time moss looked north he didnt know how much lahrheim knew about the tunnel ever so quietly working its way out past the stockade since he didnt know he pretended the tunnel didnt exist but escape still filled his thoughts if a good many men could break out if they could cross georgia and south carolina and north carolina and virginia or maybe go up through tennessee and kentucky if all that could happen the united states would gain a few reinforcements all of which would matterhow much on the big scale of things probably not much if the fate of the united states depended on a handful of escaping pows the country was in worse shape than anyone could imagine but by escaping the prisoners would help the usa and hurt the csa which seemed worth doing they would also embarrass the confederates the longer moss stayed in andersonville the more appealing that looked ralph lahrheim also looked north or rather northwest storm coming he remarked since moss couldnt argue with him he nodded big thunderheads were building and rolling toward the prison camp wouldnt want to fly through those he said which was the lords truth the clouds towered higher than a fighters ceiling and were full of turbulence that could damn near tear the wings off an airplane i dont much fancy being under them when they get here either captain lahrheim retreated toward the prisoner barracks he wasnt a particularly clever man which didnt mean he was wrong here moss didnt fancy staying out in the open once the storm broke either the rain would be bad enough if you were unlucky lightning would be worse the first raindrops started kicking up puffs of dust from the red dirt just as moss ducked into his barracks the inevitable nonstop card game paused for a moment as people made sure he was someone to be trusted then the players got back to the serious business at hand ill see that and ill raise you five clams more rain fell drumming on the roof that roof would start leaking any minute men who werent playing cards set buckets and pots where theyd do the most good lightning flashed gods artillery followed close on its heels well this is fun somebody said the crack got a laugh but a laugh distinctly nervous around the edges having grown up in chicago and spent a lot of time in ontario moss had seen his share of several different flavors of bad weather what georgia got though was different from anything he was used to it was more energetic was the first word that came to mind and it fit pretty well rain came down as if noah were somewhere just over the next rise moss didnt know about forty days and forty nights but the next forty minutes marked as ferocious a cloudburst as hed ever imagined lightning crackled again and again a couple of times close enough to make all his hair stand on end the thunder that followed sounded like a dress rehearsal for the end of the world liable to be tornadoes on the edge of a storm like this a pow observed were safe then were not on the edge were in the goddamn middle another prisoner said besides whod notice anything as small as a tornado in the middle of this a wouldbe wit added he got a laugh but all he did was prove he didnt know the first thing about tornadoes as several pows from the midwest loudly explained to him moss agreed even if he didnt fuss and fume about it wherever tornadoes went they made themselves noticed colonel summers looked less and less happy with each minute the downpour went on moss had a pretty good notion why too he sidled up to the senior officer and murmured how well is the tunnel shored up well find out wont we was all monty summers said moss nodded if something went wrong there was damnall he or any other prisoner could do about it right this minute before too long he stopped worrying about the tunnel he started worrying about whether they would have to be rescued by rowboat instead that seemed a much more immediate problem he also wondered whether the confederates had any rowboats handy had they anticipated storms this big looking out the windows helped very little except when lightning tore across the sky it was almost nightdark and what the lightning illuminated was mostly a bumper crop of raindrops but after something less than an hour the storm eased the thunderheads glided off to the east with ponderous dignity the subtropical sun of georgia summer came out again the ground started to steamnot just the puddles and ponds the rain had left behind but the ground itself colonel summers strode to the northfacing window the starch came out of his shoulders he might have aged ten years in ten seconds theres a hole in the ground not far from the deadline inside the fence he said his tone that of a man in the room with a deathbed and so he might have been for that hole meant the passing of many mens hopes no one had ever accused the confederate guards of brilliance if theyd had any brains at all they would have been at the front doing something more useful for their country than this but they didnt have to be sir isaac newton to figure out that holes in the ground especially long straight ones like this didnt happen by themselves one of the guards whod squelched through the mud to the subsidence sighted along it as if down the barrel of a rifle what he saw when he did was the barracks where moss stood waiting for the other shoe to drop he didnt have to wait long the confederates advanced on the building one of them fell on his can in the slick red mud normally the us captives would have laughed and jeered at his clumsiness no one made a peep now the guards were unlikely to find much funny about an escape attempt especially one they hadnt noticed till the storm betrayed it yall come out right now one of them shouted yall come out or else the prisoners did come out moss for one didnt think the guards were kidding about that or else crashing sounds from inside the barracks declared that the confederates were taking the place apart looking for where the tunnel started along with everybody else in greengray moss stood glumly in the mud waiting for them to find it and they did hed known they would they were stupid but not stupid enough to miss it their leader came out with his face even hotter than the weather you sons of bitches he screamed how dare you try and escape from this here prison how dare you we have the right moss spoke up the lawyer in him touched by that peculiar brainless fury the geneva convention says so that rocked the confederate guard officer back on his heels but he rallied barking it also says i got the right to punish the bastards who try an break out fess up yall who worked on that there tunnel rest of youll have an easier time if we can punish the real criminals every single us prisoner raised his hand at the same time most of them hadnt had anything to do with the tunnel some the new fish hadnt even known it was there they raised their hands anyway without hesitation moss was proud of them what the guard officer felt was something else again all right all right he said heavily and snorted like a boar hog yall reckon youre so goddamn smart well youll all catch it together then and see how you like that he stormed away moss hoped he would take a pratfall in the mud but no such luck the rain was on the confederate side every which way today dr leonard odoull was about to get on a train that would take him back from virginia to ohio or perhaps given the way things were going only to western pennsylvania when a clerk bounced out of a command car with a canvas sack slung over his shoulder hang on doc he called i got mail for youse guys youse guys was as far outside the bounds of ordinary english as the confederate yall a lot of languages had separate forms for secondperson singular and plural english didnt but kept trying to invent them the thought flashed through odoulls mind and flew away in a split second replaced by simple joy give it here he told the clerk i thought it would be weeks catching up with us red crosses adorned the tops of the cars and the sides of the locomotive locomotive and cars alike were painted white with luck that would keep the confederates from dropping bombs on the train or machinegunning it from the air there had been a few horrible incidents but only a few there had also been a few south of the masondixon line odoull wondered if jake featherstons propaganda machine had manufactured those but wouldnt have been surprised if they proved real war was full of things like that he stopped worrying about the war when he saw his wifes handwriting on a letter with a stamp from the republic of quebec sorting through the pile he found several of those and one from his brotherinlaw georges galtier seeing that one made him smile in a different way among his wifes relatives georges was the zany the cuckoo the odd man outsometimes very odd indeed gotta go doc good luck to you without waiting for a reply the army mail clerk hopped back into the command car and drove away odoull carried the stack of envelopes and magazines and newspapers and small packages up into the train mail call he shouted and for the next couple of minutes he was the most popular guy around once the mail was all doled out that popularity naturally faded only granville mcdougald hung around he looked glum to show why he held up an envelope it had a big handstamp on it return to sender addressee deceased im sorry granny odoull said who is it fellow ive known since the great war he lost a hand then so they wouldnt let him stay in the army not even as a medic dammit don was a good guyone of the best now ive got to see if i can come up with his sisters address find out what happened to him the letter had gone to trenton new jersey confederate bombers certainly reached that far but other things could happen to a middleaged man too as a middleaged man himself odoull knew that much too well im sorry hes gone he repeated whatever it was i hope it was quick yeah amen mcdougald said theyd both seen too many men who lingered in agony and would not let go of life even if some of them wanted to a fast enddead before he knew what hit himwas far from the smallest mercy the world had to offer and the world didnt offer it often enough here odoull reached into his bag and pulled out a bottle of brandy have a knock of this medicinal you know sure thanks doc youre a medical genius mcdougald took the bottle and raised it in salute heres to you don he took one long swig then handed it back odoull put it away and closed the bag as an officer odoull had a pullman berth he took his letters there to read them in curtainedoff privacy he opened the one from georges first it was the usual nonsense from his brotherinlaw the usual nonsense with the usual ironic sting arent you glad i am not an englishspeaking canadian georges wrotein english not the french that was his usual language and that he used for almost all of the letter he went on in english for one more sentence if i were you might have to shoot me after that he returned to his own tongue and the usual doings in and around riviereduloup odoull wondered whether georges had had someone else compose that english for him he would have studied the language in school before the great war when quebec was still part of canada but when would he have needed it since of course being georges he might have remembered it just so he could make a sarcastic nuisance of himself thirty years later the uprising in anglophone canada worried odoull too and not because he might be called on to pick up a rifle himself he went through his wifes letters one by one starting with the earliest he got more gossip from riviereduloup and a different view of a small scandal involving a greengrocer and the butchers wife georges had treated the whole thing as a joke to nicole the butcher was a brute and his wife looking for happiness wherever she could find it odoull himself knew all the people involved but not well he wouldnt have cared to judge where if anywhere the rights and wrongs lay nicole didnt talk about the canadian uprising till her next to last letter then she wrote there is a bill in the house of deputies to extend military service i am lighting candles and praying it does not pass so am i sweetheart odoull muttered and then moi aussi hed seen news about that bill too the united states were doing everything they could to get the republic of quebec to contribute more men to quelling the revolt north of the fortyninth parallel that way the united states wouldnt have to pull so many of their own men off the fighting front against the confederates or even out of rebellionwracked utah but if the republic of quebec did contribute more soldiers one of them was much too likely to be a young man named lucien odoull one of the great advantages of living in quebec was that the country was technically neutral even if it inclined toward the usa leonard odoull hadnt had to worry about his boys becoming a soldier he hadnt had tobut now he did nicole naturally kept a close eye on the bills progress her latest letter reported that it had come out of committee i do not know anyone who favors this bill not a single soul she wrote bitterly it moves forward anyway it moves forward because the politicians are afraid of what the united states will do to us if it fails she was bound to be right about that without the united states there wouldnt have been a republic of quebec the republics economy had very strong ties to the usa as strong as the americans could make them if quebec made the united states unhappy the usa could make the republic unhappier odoull swore under his breath he understood both sides but because of lucien hoped the republics politicians would show some backbone all politics is personal he thought after getting everything off her chest his wife went back to family chatter and the ninedays wonders of riviereduloup it was as if she didnt want to look at what shed written about the bill either only one more sentence at the end of the letter betrayed her worry i wish you were home i wish i was home too dammit odoull muttered but he damn well wasnt and whose fault was that no ones but his own the united states were his country and hed volunteered to help them in a way that best matched his skills and talents and so here he was in a whitepainted train rumbling along toward more trouble happy day he wondered how the united states could find more trouble than they already had with japan bearing down on the sandwich islands with the confederates raising hell in ohio and heading for pennsylvania with the mormons still kicking up their heels in utah and the canucks north of the border that looked as if all the troubles in the world or at least on the continent had come home to roost back before the great war people had talked about how encircled the united states were with the csa canada britain and france all keeping a wary eye on the giant theyd tied down the country had burst its bounds in the war and dominated north america for a generation now everybody else was trying to get the ropes back on again if canada broke away from us occupation if british influence returned to the northern part of the continent how long could the republic of quebec stay independent that had to be on the minds of the politicians in quebec city it was on leonard odoulls mind too but so was his son and his son counted for infinitely more engine puffing iron wheels screeching against the track and throwing up suncolored sparks the train stopped odoull opened the curtains in front of the window and looked out they were as far as he could tell in the middle of nowhere something had gone wrong up ahead but he couldnt make out what the conductor was a medical service corporal odoull hoped he made a better corpsman than conductor because he wasnt very good at his secondary role but he did have an answer when the doctor asked him what had happened farther west sabotage he seemed to take a certain somber pleasure in the word osti odoull burst out which made the noncom give him a curious look odoull looked back in plain warning the other man decided walking down the corridor would be a good idea odoull shook his head it wasnt that he didnt believe the corporal no the trouble was just the opposite as long as confederate operatives sounded reasonably yankeelike they could hide in plain sight till they went off to work mischief in the middle of the night no doubt us operatives were doing the same thing on the other side of the border and helping cs negroes in their sputtering civil war against jake featherstons government odoull hoped they were anyhow but that didnt do him or this train any good at all three hours later after a repair crew filled in a crater and laid new track across it the train got rolling again by then the sun was going down in the west and odoull was going up in smoke if he was going to be useful he wanted to be useful he couldnt do a damn thing stuck here on a train track unlike most trains this one rolled through the night all lit up trains full of soldiers and weapons and raw materials sneaked along trusting to darkness to hide them from confederate aircraft this one showed its true colors and the enemy left it alone there were whispers that the confederates sometimes used the red cross to disguise troop movements odoull hoped that wasnt so it would make cs raiders want to disregard the symbol when the usa used it and it would make the united states distrust even legitimate confederate uses things were hard enough as they were did they have tocould theyget even worse xi back when cincinnatus driver lived in confederate covington before the great war he hadnt liked going to the zoo animals in cages had reminded him too strongly of the black mans plight then when he moved up to des moines after the war hed been able to take his kids to the zoo there and enjoy it himself hed felt freer thereand to be fair des moines had a much fancier zoo than covingtons now things had come full circle here he was back in covington here he was back in the csa and here he was caged when the barbedwire perimeter around the colored quarter went up a few blacks figured it was just for show to let colored people know who was boss without really intending to imprison them cincinnatus could have told them they were fools the freedom party lied about plenty of things but not about what it thought of negroes some of the optimists tried to slip between the strands or attacked them with wire cutters right there where the guards could see them cincinnatus had known for years what automaticweapons fire sounded like hearing it again saddened him without greatly surprising him the guards callousness afterwards did surprise him they left the bodies theyd shot where they fell so the sight and after a day or two the stench would intimidate the negroes inside the perimeter he didnt talk to lucullus about the odious and odorous events for one thing visiting lucullus probably put him on some kind of list the powers that be in covington already had too many reasons to put him on a list and for another lucullus remained in a state of shock at being closed off from the outside world cincinnatus had never dreamt the barbecue cook could stay downcast for so long but that seemed to be what was going on with lucullus disabled cincinnatus took his troubles to the brass monkey instead he didnt talk about them in the saloon but that didnt mean they didnt go away a lot of things dissolved in beer and there was whiskey for what beer wouldnt melt covingtons colored quarter had always had a lot of saloons people there had always had a lot of trouble that needed dissolving saloons were the one kind of business in the colored part of town that was doing better now than before the wire went up even more sorrows than usual needed drowning and the confederate authorities no doubt learned all sorts of things from saloon talk some of what they learned might even have been true cincinnatus perched on a stool under one of the two lazily spinning ceiling fans he slid a dime across the bar let me have a jax he said comin up the bartender took one out of the cooler popped the cap with a church key and handed cincinnatus the beer resting his can against one knee cincinnatus closed both palms around the cold wet bottle feels good he said and held it for a little while before lifting it to his lips and taking a long pull ah that feels even better i believe it sweat beaded the barkeeps forehead the way condensation beaded the bottle in his boiled shirt and black bow tie he had to be hotter and more uncomfortable than cincinnatus was motion up near the ceiling caught cincinnatus eye he glanced up it was a strip of flypaper black with the bodies of flies it had caught twisting in the breeze from a nearby fan that strip had been there since cincinnatus started coming into the brass monkey and probably for a long time before that the dead flies couldnt be anything but driedup husks plenty of live ones buzzed in the muggy air two stools down from cincinnatus a very black man in dirty overalls waved to the bartender gimme nother double he slurred by his voice and his potent whiskey breath hed had several doubles already the bartender took his money and gave him what he asked for the drunk stared down into the glass as if the amber fluid inside held the meaning of life maybe for him it did he gulped it down when the glass was empty the drunk set it on the bar and looked around whatever he saw cincinnatus didnt think it was in the brass monkey during the last war soldiers had called the glazed look in his eyes the thousandyard stare too much combat and too much whiskey could both make a man look that way what is we gonna do the drunk asked plaintively was he talking to cincinnatus to the bartender to himself or to god no one answered after half a minute of silence the negro brought out the question again with even more anguish this time what is we gonna do the barkeep ignored him polishing the battered bar top with a none too clean rag god ignored the drunk toobut then god had been ignoring negroes in the csa far longer than the confederacy had been an independent country if the man was talking to himself would he have asked the same question twice that left cincinnatus he thought about ignoring the drunk like the bartender but he didnt have a polishing rag handy swallowing a sigh he asked what are we gonna do about what oh lordy resignation and annoyance mixed in the bartenders voice now you done got him started the drunk lost in his own fog of alcohol and pain might not have heard the barkeep but cincinnatus words somehow penetrated what is we gonna do about what he echoed what is we gonna do about us dats what he might have been pickled in sour mash that didnt mean the question didnt matter no it didnt mean anything of the sort cincinnatus wished it did what can we do about us he asked in return damfino the drunk said yeah damfino but we gots to do somethin on account of they wants to kill us all kill us all you hear me his voice rose to a frightened angry shout cincinnatus heard him all right so did about half the colored quarter of covington kentucky even the bartender couldnt ignore him anymore hush there easy easy the man said putting away the rag he might have been trying to gentle a spooked horse aint nothin you kin do about it hesiod hesiod muttered and mumbled to himself gots to be somethin somebody kin do he said gots to be ifn they aint we is all dead before the barbed wire went up cincinnatus would have taken that for no more than a drunks maunderings he still took it for a drunks maunderingswhat else was it but not just for that not any more if freedom party goons wanted to reach into the quarter theyd cordoned off take out some negroes and do away with them they would whod stop them whod even know for certain what theyd done hesiod slapped four bits on the bar gimme nother double he said and then as if still ordering the drink gots to kill them ofays kill em you hear me here you is the bartender set the drink in front of him now you get outside o this when you aint drinkin shut your damn mouth you gonna open it so wide you falls in there was another home truth even if the brass monkey was a long way from home somebody in the divemaybe even the barkeep himselfwas bound to be spying for the white man spying for the government some blacks thought they could make deals with the devil grab safety for themselves at the expense of their fellows their friends their families cincinnatus didnt believe it not for a minute like any wild beast sooner or later the freedom party would bite the hand that fed it anyone who thought it would do anything else was bound to be a sucker no jake featherston had never bothered lying about what he aimed to do with and to negroes because that was exactly what so many whites in the csa wanted to hear them ofays come in here we gots to shoot em shoot em hear me hesiod said the only trouble with that was the white men would shoot back and they were the ones with the heavy weapons lucullus wood had seen as much and lucullus knew more than anybody else about the guns the negroes in covington had lucullus no doubt had brought a lot of those guns into the colored part of town expecting a drunk to know what lucullus knew was bound to be blind optimism cincinnatus did say anybody shoot at the ofays everybody gonna be real sorry he didnt want hesiod grabbing a and trying to blow out the brains of the first white cop he saw everybody real sorry already hesiod said breathing more bourbon into cincinnatus face how you reckon things git worse before cincinnatus could say anything to that the bartender spoke up things kin always git worse he did not sound like a man who intended to let himself be contradicted and he did not impress hesiod what they gonna do line us up an shoot us matter of fact yes this time cincinnatus spoke before the barkeep could theyd do that they wouldnt lose a minute o sleep neither but theys already doin it already hesiod said triumphantly they ship your ass to one o them camps you dont come out no more they shoots you there else they kills you some other kind o way might as well shoot back at them ofay motherfuckers they come after us we gots nothin to lose a considerable silence followed both cincinnatus and the bartender wanted to tell hesiod he was wrong both of them wanted to but neither one could he was too likely not to be wrong at all cincinnatus finished his jax set the bottle on the bar and walked out of the brass monkey the tip of his cane tapped against the sawduststrewn floor and then against the battered sidewalk outside he still carried the cane everywhere he went but it wasnt a vital third limb for him the way it had been when he was first getting around after the car hit him he wasnt as spry as his father but he got around tolerably well these days seneca driver was listening to the wireless when cincinnatus came back to the house where hed grown up the confederates and the yankees were jamming each others stations extra hard these days and most of what came out of the wireless sets speakers were hisses and unearthly whines what you doin home so quick son seneca had been born a slave and still spoke with the broad accent of a black man whod never had a chance to get an education reckoned youd stay down at de saloon longer no cincinnatus shook his head cant get away from bad news anywhere after so many years in iowa his own speech sounded halfyankee especially by comparison to what he heard around himself here he laughed bitterly and a whole fat lot of good not sounding ignorant was likely to do him these is hard times seneca said we gots to be like turtles an pull our heads into our shell an not come out till things is better most of the time that would have been good advice cincinnatus was sure it had worked for his father many times before but what were you supposed to do when those troubling you wanted to smash the turtles shell to get at the meat inside what then cincinnatus had no answers and feared no one else did either somewhere up ahead a machine gun started chattering armstrong grimes threw himself flat bullets cracked past overhead any time you could hear bullets cracking they came too damn close armstrong shared a stretch of brick wall near the southern outskirts of salt lake city with yossel reisen dont these mormon maniacs ever give up he demandedmore of god probably than of the congresswomans nephew god had nothing to say yossel did doesnt look like it long as theyve got guns and people to shoot em theyre going to keep fighting people armstrong made it into a swear word yossel was too right some of the mormons who carried rifles pistols and grenades were women some of the mormons who crewed mortars and machine guns were women too from everything armstrong had seen they fought just as hard and just as well as their male counterparts he didnt know if that old saw about the female of the species being more deadly than the male was true but in utah she sure wasnt any less deadly mormon women usually fought to the death whenever they could they had their reasons most of them good us soldiers who captured women in arms were inclined to take a very basic revenge that went against regulations officers lectured about how naughty it was it went on happening anyway armstrong didnt see how to stop it if he caught some gal who was trying to kill him it was more interesting than thinking about shooting a guy the size of a defensive tackle that was for sure down in the confederate states some of the black guerrillas were of the female persuasion the bastards in butternut who caught them served them the same way us propaganda said that only went to show what a bunch of cruel and miserable bastards the confederates were armstrong didnt doubt the confederates were cruel and miserable bastards theyd come too close to killing him too many times for him to doubt it but raping captives wasnt one of the reasons he didnt not anymore he understood the enemy in ways he hadnt before that sparked a new thought he turned to yossel reisen and said you ever get the idea were more like the assholes on the other side of the line whore trying to kill us than we are like the fancypants fuckers back in philly who give us orders he realized he could have picked somebody better than the jew to ask yossels aunt was one of those fancypants folks if hed wanted to he almost certainly could have got out of being conscripted that he hadnt either spoke well for him or said he was a little bit nuts depending but he nodded now oh hell yes i wonder how many guys in the war department have ever had lice maybe a few in the last war when they were lieutenants or something not many i bet armstrong said people like that they wouldve found cushy jobs back then too wouldnt be surprised reisen took a pack of cigarettes out of a tunic pocket stuck one in his mouth and offered the pack to armstrong once they were both smoking he went on did i ever tell you my uncle david only has one leg there werent a whole lot of families in the usa that didnt have a wounded or mutilated male relative armstrong said maybe you did i think so but im not sure aunt flora could have kept him out of the army if hed wanted her to same with me yossel said his voice matteroffact but youve got to do what youve got to do otherwise how can you stand yourself after a moment he added did i ever tell you uncle davids a firebreathing democrat yeah i think you did armstrong answered because reisen seemed to expect him to he asked how does your aunt like it she doesnt yossel said as matteroffactly as before they still get along with each other well enough but they argue whenever they talk about politics before armstrong could say anything a horrible screech filled the air screaming meemies he yelled and folded himself as small as he could down there in the foxhole that was now suddenly horribly on the wrong side of the fence yossel reisen did the same the spigot mortar burst with a roar like the end of the world a lot of the rounds from the mormons weird makeshift artillery were duds the ones that werent packed a hell of a wallop the ground shook under armstrong for a horrid moment he thought the foxhole would collapse and bury him alive what if it did the headline would be former first ladys nephew killed in combat armstrong would make a onesentence addon to the storyanother soldier also diedif that when he could hear anything but the thunder of the explosion he heard people screaming there in the bottom of the hole his eyes met yossel reisens he knew exactly what yossel was thinking because he was thinking the same thing himself oh hell or words to that effect he wanted to come out of the safety of the foxhole about as much as he wanted to dance naked in front of the mormon temple in salt lake city wagging his pecker at the gilded statue of the angel moroni that might get him shot faster than this on the other hand it might not but you had to pick up your buddies that had been drilled into him since day one of his abbreviated basic training hed seen the sense of it in the field too which wasnt true of a lot of the crap theyd fed him in basic if you didnt help your buddies when they needed it most they wouldnt help you if you didand you were liable to come on dammit he and yossel said the same thing at the same time as if they were an old married couple theyd both been around this particular block often enough that was for damn sure up they went keeping their bellies rattlesnakelow on the ground rex stowe was out there too the sergeant made no bones about disliking several of the new men in his section he came to help them anyway they were part of his joband again he expected them to do the same for him that damned mormon machine gunner opened up again after the spigotmortar round went off he knew thered be woundedand that thered be guys trying to do what they could for them spray enough bullets around and youd get some more wounded maybe even some dead armstrong and sergeant stowe reached the closest injured man at about the same time they looked at him and then looked at each other armstrong was pretty sure his face wore the same horrified expression as stowes that a man could make so much noise when so little of him was left war was full of nasty surprises and it had just pulled another one on armstrong grimes cavendish hey cavendish stowe said when he got a momentary lull in the screaming he asked you want us to bring you in or you want to get it over with right now your call had that been armstrong he would have wanted it over and done with he had no idea how stowe knew the wounded man was cavendish there sure wasnt enough left of his face to tell by that and one guys shrieks sounded a lot like anothers but cavendish seemed perfectly coherent when he said for the love of mike take me in then hardly missing a beat he went back to screaming again stowe looked at armstrong and shrugged he might live he didnt sound as if he believed it armstrong sure didnt he looked at what was left of cavendish no he wouldnt have wanted to go on if he looked like that but if the other soldier did gotta try i guess they bandaged and tourniqueted cavendishs wounds stopping the worst of the bleeding stowe closed the one in the mans belly with a couple of safety pins they werent much but they were better than nothing both armstrong and stowe gave him a shot of morphine maybe hell shut up armstrong said yeah and if we gave him too much of the shit maybe hell shut up for good stowe said thats easier than going out the way he was armstrong grunted and nodded his hands were all bloody so were stowes the sergeant asked you want to take him back or shall i no corpsmen were in sight they did the best they could but they couldnt be everywhere armstrong considered taking cavendish back would get him out of the front line for a bit but the mormons might shoot him while he did it he shrugged ill take care of it if you want me to go on then stowe could make the same calculation as armstrong ill get him on your backyoull want to stay low fuckina i will armstrong said fervently hed stayed as near horizontal as he could while working on cavendish so had rex stowe theyd both spent a lot of timetoo much time as far as armstrong was concernedup at the front theyd learned what tricks there were to know about staying alive and not getting hurt the only trouble was sometimes all the tricks in the world didnt do you a damn bit of good with what was left of cavendish on top of him armstrong crawled away from the mormon machine gun at least the dreadfully wounded man wasnt wriggling so much maybe the morphine the two noncoms had given him was taking hold even half a mile back of the line they acted a lot more regulation a soldier in a clean new uniform stared at armstrong and said what are you doing bringing a body back here leave him for graves registration fuck you jack armstrong said without heat for one thing he aint dead for another thing hes worth two of graves registration and four of you point me at the nearest aid station before i kick your worthless ass armstrong wasnt small but the other man was bigger fury wouldnt have worried him armstrongs complete indifference to consequences did maybe he thought armstrong would just as soon kill him as look at himand maybe he was right he said theres a tent behind that pile of bricks it shields em from smallarms fire thanks armstrong headed that way carrying cavendish now the wounded man was a lot lighter than he had been before he got hurt a corpsman came out before armstrong got halfway there hey he called come give me a hand with this guy the corpsman trotted toward him when he got close enough to take a good look at cavendish he stopped short his boots kicking up dust jesus he said tell me about it armstrong said you shouldve seen him before my sergeant and me patched him up but he said he wanted to live if he could he shrugged what are you gonna do when a guy says that jesus the corpsman looked green and hed seen some of the worst things war could do well i guess weve got to try ill help you get him to the tent thank you cavendishs voice was dreamy and far away armstrong had thought hed long since passed out the corpsman looked as if hed just heard a ghost the surgeon in the tent did a double take when he saw cavendish armstrong got out of there before the doc went to work watching would have made him sick that was crazy but it was true he went back up to the front line there at least death and mutilation came at random you didnt know about them ahead of time that made them if not tolerable at least possible to bear jefferson pinkard wondered why the hell the vice president of the cyclone chemical company wasnt in the army cullen beauregardcall me cbslattery couldnt have been more than thirty he was obviously healthy and just as obviously sharp oh yes sir he said anything alive thisll shift you dont need to worry about that at all you make it for bugs though thats right slattery nodded but itll kill rats and mice jeff said cb slattery nodded again jeff went on and cats and dogs another nod and people yes sir it will absolutely kill people thats why youve got to be careful when you use it slattery said matter of fact the chemicals the same one some yankee states use to kill criminals really is that a fact jeff said one more nod from slattery he was one of the noddingest people jeff had ever met if you wanted to you could use it to kill a whole bunch of people then absolutely you absolutely could the chemicalcompany official didnt ask why pinkard might want to use his product made to get rid of roaches and other pests to dispose of large numbers of people instead what he did say was if you use large quantities youd be entitled to a bulk discount thats nice thats white of you matter of fact jeff said cb slattery laughed uproariously he didnt ask what color the people who might die were pretty plainly he already knew somewhere in camp determination a work gang of negroes chanted rhythmically as they carried or dug or did whatever the guards told them to do slattery smiled at that too the way he might have smiled at a bear playing with a medicine ball in a zoo the shape of his smile decided jeff this wasnt a man who would balk at what needed discussing here lets get down to brass tacks then jeff said can your firm design us a facility i guess youd call it that would let us reduce the camp population without leaving the niggers still here any the wiser about what was going on inside hed talked about killing people when it was in the abstract when it got down to something he might actually do his own words turned abstract reducing population didnt seem to mean so much my firm no sir sorry but thats not what we do we make insecticide slattery answered pinkard muttered under his breath he hadnt expected a flat refusal but when the bright young man continued he discovered he hadnt got one either but i can put you in touch with some design outfits that will help you along those lines just as a guess id say youd want to call it a delousing station or a bathhouse or something like that sound reasonable sounds sensible i was thinking along those lines myself to tell you the truth said pinkard who hadnt been he picked up a pencil and wrote delousing baths on a sheet of foolscap maybe slattery saw through him maybe not he went on now these outfits youre talking aboutthey in arkansas like you if i have my druthers i want to work with somebody local you know what i mean i sure do and i respect that slattery said quickly respecting it didnt mean agreeing with it but did mean hed go along if he wanted the cyclone chemical company to get the business when jefferson pinkard wanted his druthers these days he damn well got them he remembered wishing for them in the last war wishing and not getting a lot of things about growing older were damned unpleasant his last visit to the dentist leaped to mind but if you were halfway decent at what you did you got your druthers a lot more often than you had when you were younger as if to underscore that cb slattery continued naturally we work with people from little rock a lot of the time but i do believe a couple of these outfits have branches in texasdallas or houston im not quite sure which well you can wire me the details when you get home jeff said and it was slatterys turn to write himself a note ill do some checking on my own too if slattery thought he could set up some sweetheart deal maybe rig kickbacks for cyclone chemical he could damn well think again he wasnt fool enough to let on that hed had anything like that in mind you go right ahead sir i think youll find out the firms i recommend are competitive in quality and in price he paused to pull out a pack of cigarettes offer one to jeff and then stick one in his own mouth once they both had lights he remarked something else occurs to me whats that you might want to site this ah facility away from the main camp and take prisoners to it youd be less likely to spook the spooks that way if you know what i mean slattery had a disarming grin he also had a point jeff scribbled some more on that sheet of foolscap could be he said it applied the same principle as telling negroes they were going to another camp when they got into the trucks from which they would never get out we could move em right on through just like a factory the word that first crossed his mind that caused the pause was slaughterhouse he didnt want to say that any more than he wanted to talk about killing negroes rather than reducing population it made him think too openly about what this camp was for you sure could cb slattery fairly radiated enthusiasm itd be a privilege for my firm to be affiliated with such a patriotic enterprise freedom freedom jeff echoed automatically youll be hearing from us i expect some of those designers may too so get me that word quick as you can like i say though ill check out some other outfits in these parts along with em you know your business best no slattery wasnt about to argue no matter who built the places where the negroes went in and didnt come out the chemical that made sure they didnt come out would come from his company he said freedom one more time and hurried out of pinkards office by the way he moved his next appointment was just as urgent and just as important as this one it wasnt likely to be but treating it that way made him a good businessman jeff got up and watched him leave the administrative center then went back to his desk he picked up the telephone and called richmond he wanted ferdinand koenig knowing what was going on every step of the way the attorney general heard him outhe did try to keep things shortand then said this all sounds pretty good only one thing bothers me a little whats that jeff asked whatever bothered jake featherstons righthand man was guaranteed to be dead on arrival this whole business of building the uh fumigatorwhatever the hell you want to call itaway from the camp that means were using trucks again i thought one of the big points of building the fumigator in the first place was getting away from the goddamn trucks well yes sir jeff said reluctantly only problem i see with building it here is the niggers wont take long to figure out this is the end of the line if we do well have more trouble from em in that case camps been pretty quiet so far and id like to keep it that way i understand that but weve got to think about efficiency too koenig said if we can give your trucks back to the armyminus your exhaust hookup of coursehe laughed which meant pinkard had to do the samethatll help the war effort a lot we need all the transport we can get right now what with the big push into pennsylvania and youve got a good solid perimeter around the camp right youve got guards who know what theyre doing right well yes sir jeff repeated he couldnt very well say the camp didnt have a solid perimeter or that the guards didnt know what the hell they were doing if he said that he wouldnt stay camp commandant for another five minutes and he wouldnt deserve to either all right then the attorney general said any trouble comes up i reckon youll be able to handle it a few bursts from the guards submachine guns should settle most troubles pretty damn quick if they dont well the machine guns in the towers outside the barbed wire sure as hell will yes sir pinkard said one more time everything ferd koenig said was true if the negroes caused trouble the guards ought to be able to smash it good koenig sounded pleased you keep at it pinkard im sure everything will work out fine freedom freedom jeff said but he was talking to a dead line he hung up swearing under his breath everything koenig said was true yeah but what he said was only part of the story jeff remembered how things had been back at camp dependable in louisiana when his guards were reducing population by taking niggers out to the swamps and shooting them not only had that put a strain on the white men it had also made them stay on edge every minute of the day and night the negroes in the camp had known too well they had nothing to lose if they tried to nail a guard theyd get killed sure but if they didnt theyd get killed anyhow so why not try to take somebody with you when you went camp determination wasnt like that now the blacks here believed this wasnt the last stop they were wrong but the belief itself mattered it mattered a lot because they still believed they had a future they were much more docile than they would have been otherwise building the fumigator here would ruin all that theyd figure out what was what how could they help it everybody knew negroes werent as smart as white people but they wouldnt have to be geniuses to figure this out and guards would have to stay on their toes every second from then on but now jeff had his orders he wished hed never called richmond he should have just gone ahead and built the fumigator where he wanted it and then told ferd koenig what hed done the attorney general would have gone along with it the way things worked out jeff was stuck he swore again louder this time sat down to look at a map of camp determination and then swore some more pretty plainly hed have to build two fumigators one for men the other for women and pickaninnies otherwise the sexes would meet on the way to getting eliminated and that would cause all kinds of troubleto say nothing of making inmates attitudes even worse than they would be anyhow after another look at the mapand some more venting of his spleenhe decided how things would have to work the fumigators could go at or even next to the present outer boundaries of the camp that way he could use the current perimeter to separate them from the areas where the negroes lived maybe he could send people through on the pretext that they had to be deloused before going to a new camp that would explain why they didnt come back how long could he keep them from learning that only bodies left camp determination not forever he feared but he could buy at least some time that way the longer he didnt have to worry about uppity niggers the better he liked it and he would be following orders irving morrell got his first look at one of the new confederate barrels just outside of salem ohio the town east of canton called itself ohios city of friends it had been founded by quakers and many still lived there what was happening around salem now had nothing to do with those peaceable people or their ideals a us firing over open sights had knocked out the barrel in question the young lieutenant who gravely explained that to morrell didnt see anything funny about it he didnt associate it with jake featherstons ranting tract of the same name morrell wondered whether to explain why he was laughing in the end he didnt any joke you had to explain wasnt funny neither was the new barrel it stank of gasoline and cordite and burnt paint and rubber and burnt flesh morrells nostrils tried to pinch in on themselves to hold out as much of that horrible smell as they could his stomach lurched as soon as he recognized it hed smelled it too often before no barrel in the world could withstand a direct hit from a at pointblank range getting hits with an artillery piece even at pointblank range was a much bigger problem though the best antibarrel weapon was still another barrel when morrell walked around the charred corpse of this one he got the feeling that the machines he commanded were like boys trying to stop men the long gun with the big bore the sloped armor the low profile this was what the usa should have had at the start of the war he turned to the lieutenant can the inchandahalf guns on our barrels hurt these monsters at all they can penetrate the side armor sir the youngster answered that frontal plateim afraid not our barrels armorpiercing rounds mostly just bounce off happy day morrell muttered and then weve got to upgun thats all there is to it yes sir the lieutenant said but the turret ring on our present model wont let us mount a threeincher like these bastards have two and a fraction thats itand even then we need a new turret to hold the larger weapon weve got to do it morrell said more to himself than to his guide building a whole new machine from the ground upwell we should have started a long time ago since we didnt weve just got to squeeze the most out of what we have for a while longer can we the lieutenant askeda question morrell wished he didnt have to contemplate after a moments thought he answered of course we can sonbecause weve got to now wheres the map that shows our armored dispositions its back in town sir the young lieutenant said morrell wished it were farther forward one of a lot of things he wished that he wasnt going to get back to salem they went refugees from farther west clogged the road some of them tried to take shelter in salem even as the people who lived there cleared out once upon a time before bombs and artillery started landing on it salem had been a pleasant little city it had held ten or twelve thousand people and had boasted a flour mill a dairy outfit a couple of china factories and some metalworks it also boasted a monument to one edwin coppock an abolitionist whod raided harpers ferry with john brown and whod been hanged with him if the confederates took salem they would blow that to hell and gone when morrell actually got a look at the armored dispositions in northeastern ohio his own disposition soured and his temper almost blew to hell and gone my god he burst out theyve got them scattered all over the damned landscape they support the infantry sir the shavetail said no no no no no morrell didnt pound his head against the wall in the pleasant little clapboard house now doing duty for his headquarters why he didnt he couldnt have said as far as he was concerned that restraint should have been worth a medal weve been at war for more than a year now hasnt anybody learned anything about anything sir the lieutenant an earnest young man realized he was out of his element morrell didnt try to explain it would have taken too long but the officer he was replacing hadnt learned a thing from two wars worth of barrel tactics the one thing you needed to do to get the most out of your armor was to mass it to use it as the spearhead to your attack putting some of it here some of it there and some more of it in a noaccount town twenty miles away was askingbeggingto get defeated in detail and the confederateswho while they were manifest sons of bitches were also capable sons of bitches when it came to handling armorwere only too happy to oblige the study morrell went into was more nearly black than brown how the hell can i get my forces concentrated so i can do something with them he muttered how can our infantry respond to the confederates if they dont have barrels to stiffen them sir the lieutenant asked the look morrell gave him should have left him charred worse than the burntout cs barrel i dont want to respond to featherstons fuckers he ground out the young lieutenants eyes widened perhaps at the obscenity but more likely at the heresy morrell proceeded to spell it out i want to make featherstons fuckers respond to me i cant do that can i unless i can pull together enough barrels to get their attention it seemed obvious to him why didnt it seem obvious to anybody else in a greengray uniform but sir if the infantry isnt supported the enemy will just slice through it the way he has before the lieutenant sounded like a man trying to reason with a dangerous lunatic hes welcome to try morrell said which made the shavetails eyes get big all over again if i have a decent force of barrels of my own though ill land on his flank and cut his supply line neat as you please lets see how much slicing he does without gasoline or ammo he waited the lieutenant contemplated do you really think you could do that sir he was too polite and too far under military discipline to call morrell a liar in so many words but he didnt believe him either would they have sent me here if they didnt think i could morrell asked or dont you think the war department knows what its doing sir if the war department knew what it was doing would we be in a quarter of the mess were in the lieutenant replied morrell stared at him as if hed never seen him before in a very real way he hadnt he stuck out his right hand when the lieutenant hesitated morrell grabbed his hand and pumped it up and down congratulations he said thats the first halfway smart thing ive heard out of you uh sir hed bewildered the lieutenant always distrust what the people too far from the front line to hear smallarms fire tell you morrell said always most of what they think they know is going to be out of date or wrong some other way it will have gone through too many mouths before it finally gets to them and a lot of them wont ever have got close enough to the front to hear smallarms fire half the time they wont understand what other people are trying to tell them even if it turns out to be the gospel truth sometimes it doesaccidents will happen the young officer eyed him what about you sir there thats the second smart thing youve said morrell grinned all i can tell you is ive got an oakleaf cluster for my damn purple heart do i pass inspection uh yes sir the lieutenant blushed like a schoolgirl a glance at the short row of fruit salad on his chest showed hed never been wounded he probably thought that made him less of a man morrell had had stupid notions like that till he got shot in the leg nothing like a wound infection to take the romance out of war he got down to business all right then how secure are the telephone lines out of this place well we do the best we can sir but i cant guarantee the bastards in butternut arent tapping them the lieutenant said same with the telegraph it would be morrell muttered a war between two countries that spoke the same language was harder than other kinds just about every which way you had to assume the enemy was listening to everything you did and that he knew what you were up to as soon as you did youd give him too much credit some of the time but you didnt dare give him too little you had to assume he was listening you had to assume he knew what you were up to do you know lieutenant i hope he is hes almost bound to be isnt he sir the blank look was back on the kids baby face morrell clapped him on the shoulder never mind point me at a typewriter we do have messengers we can rely on right if the lieutenant told him no he was up the wellknown creek without even a canoe much less a paddle but the young officer nodded oh yes sir theyre very reliable and they make sure to destroy what theyre carrying if they run into trouble thats what i wanted to hear morrell said now wheres that typewriter for the next couple of hours he pounded away at it he was no secretary he typed with his two forefingers he wasnt fast but he got the job done a look at the messengers reassured him more than the lieutenants praise did they were a raffish lot men who could be counted on to get where they were going and if they liberated booze or smokes or a steak along the way well so much the better he gave them oral orders then he handed them the dispatches hed written off they went in command cars on horseback on bicycles on shanks mare before long oneword responses started coming in by telephone and telegraph received morrell heard again and again and again he marked the map again and again and again when he was satisfied he got on the telephone he called officer after officer delivered his orders and hung up maybe this would work and maybe it wouldnt it seemed worth a try though one thing us reconnaissance was good most people who lived in ohio especially in this northern part of it wanted nothing to do with the confederates they slipped through enemy lines risking their necks to report on what jake featherstons men were up to when morrell heard the confederates were assembling armor in homeworth a few miles west of salem he smiled to himself their attack on salem went in two days later they came loaded for bear convinced they had a big force of barrels in front of them morrell showed a few and shelled the confederates heavily to slow them down that only made them push harder theyd just about reached salems outskirts when the real us barrel force which had concentrated some miles to the north roared down and struck them in the flank the confederates still might have made a fight of it they had at least as many machines as the usa did and theirs hit harder but they were rattled as anybody hit from a direction he didnt expect would have been they fell back in some disorder and left a lot of barrels burning in front of salem that was amazing sir now the young lieutenant looked at morrell with something not far from hero worship thats what were supposed to do dammit morrell said wondering howand ifhe could bring off the same sort of thing again abner dowling was the man whod spotted the confederates thinning their lines in virginia so they could send more men into ohio he hadnt had the chance to attack them after he caught them doing that oh no his reward was thinning his own lines so the usa could try to smash through the confederates position at fredericksburg which hadnt worked at all now he was thinning them still further to send reinforcements to the west he took a half pint of whiskey out of his desk drawer and stared at it like most half pints it was curved to fit the hand he wasnt a man who drank to excess he remembered general custer with whiskey as with women custer could resist everything except temptation and custer with a snootful was even more a bull in a china shop than he had been any other time no dowling wasnt like thatwhich didnt mean he was teetotal either every once in a while a nip was welcome sometimes you needed not to think about things for a little while and whiskey was the best thought preventer this side of a blackjack he undid the metal screw top raised the bottle to his lips and took a healthy slug his adjutant chose that moment to walk in the door captain angelo toricelli had been with him since his unhappy stay as commandant in salt lake cityanother one of the garden spots of the universe unlike some adjutants toricelli understood that he wasnt about to end up on skid row just because he drank now and again it was embarrassing all the same trying to cover that embarrassment dowling held out the bottle and asked want some for yourself no thank you sir captain toricelli answerednot primly but not in a way that suggested hed change his mind either we have a message from general macarthur inquiring how the pullback is going in this corps tell general macarthur to dowling broke off if he went on in that vein toricelli would think it was the whiskey talking that was nonsense dowling needed no booze to despise daniel macarthur still tell general macarthur to rest assured that we are complying with his orders and the war departments yes sir thank you sir thats well phrased toricellis dark eyes glinted he knew what dowling had been on the point of saying but dowling hadnt said it neither he nor the half pint could get the blame toricelli saluted and left the room dowling eyed the little bottle it was almost as if the narrow escape gave him the license for another drink he shook his head and put the bottle back in the desk drawer it would be there when he really needed it if he drank when he didnt really need it that was how trouble started off in the distance somebodys artillery opened up he thought those were us guns with fewer foot soldiers on the ground artillery had to take up some of the slack of course some of his artillery was getting pulled west to try to stop the confederates too after fifteen or twenty minutes the guns fell silent dowling hoped that meant theyd smashed whatever they were aiming at if not some wireless man would rush in with news of a new disaster and dowling would have to try to put the pieces back togetherand take the blame if humpty dumpty remained bits of eggshell his eyes went to the largescale map of virginia on the wall he didnt like the way his right flank was vulnerable he never had general patton the confederates answer to irving morrell had roared out of the mountains trying to roll him up patton hadnt managed it dowling took a certain amount of pride in the way hed defended against the csas armored wizard but they didnt pin medals on your chest for losing only a few square miles often that deserved a medal but it never got one if patton or some other confederate hotshot tried charging out of the mountains again could dowlings corps hold the enemy again he muttered unhappily if the confederates hit him as hard as they had the last time he probably couldnt but he brightened a little a moment later he might not have the wherewithal to defend that hed had before but he was pretty damn sure the boys in butternut couldnt mount the same kind of attack as they had then they seemed to be putting everything they had into the push through ohio and into pennsylvania he looked at the map again then slowly nodded to himself ever since the war started people had been saying that whoever could mount two big drives at once would likely win so far neither side had come close logic said the united states had the better chance they had more men and more resources they also had more problems the confederates had a smoldering negro uprising to worry about their response seemed to be massacre the united states had to flabble about the mormons and now the canadians the japanese in the pacific and the really mad naval struggle in the north atlantic with all the sideshows they couldnt concentrate on the main event captain toricelli came in again yes what is it dowling asked with a sinking feeling his adjutant could bear bad tidings at least as well as a wireless operator but toricelli only asked sir do you know a miss ophelia clemens the reporter i should say i do dowling answered i spoke with her outside general macarthurs headquarters not more than a few weeks ago as a matter of fact why because she just pulled up in front of this building sir toricelli said i doubt like the dickens shes here to talk to me send her in send her in dowling said how subversive do you think i can be i couldnt begin to guess by toricellis expression though he feared for the worst when ophelia clemens marched into dowlings office she looked him in the eye and said general id murder somebody for a drink not me i hope dowling opened his desk drawer and with the air of a vaudeville conjuror produced the half pint here you are maam at your service god bless you ophelia clemens said i hoped i could find a st bernard in all these alps after that rhetorical outburst she unscrewed the cap and swigged like a man she eyed the bottle in her hand with a certain amount of respect thats what they call panther piss isnt it something like that dowling allowed it sure isnt sipping whiskey she handed the half pint back to him when he put it away without drinking she said keep it around just for poisoning visitors do you by no means maam you misunderstand me im about half an hour ahead of you thats all and what besides bartender duty can i do for you on this none too lovely day well ive got my own cigarettes she replied and lit one to prove it i dont suppose you could spare me some truth dowling snorted you dont ask for much do you if you had it i think you might give it to me ophelia clemens told him thats more than i can say about most of the people in your line of work i know you flatter me he said keep it up i love it ill give you the reporters ultimate flattery then she said how would you like to be a reliable source dowling knew what that meant somebody who shot off his mouth without getting called to account for it at his age and station such a chance tempted him more than a twentytwoyearold virginmore than a twentytwoyearold professional come to that go ahead and ask he said and well see how reliable i am all right ophelia clemens took out a spiralbound notebook opened it to a blank page and poised a pencil above it how bad do things look in ohio and pennsylvania you just named pennsylvania right there that says we arent doing as well as we ought to be dowling shook his head no i take it back thats not fair i dont know what things are like on the ground over there i have my own troubles lord knows you can say things arent going as well as we wish they were her pencil scratched across the page do you think featherstons going after pittsburgh too early to be sure but thats how it looks right now dowling said uhhuh ophelia clemens wrote some more do you know they wouldnt give me a straight answer in the war department you never heard so many variations on no comment in all your born days franz liszt couldnt write variations like that heh dowling said doubtfully as the allusion flew over his head had he been up in the war department he would have played it cagey toohe knew that you could get in trouble for saying yes and being right for saying yes and being wrong and conversely with no as well no comment looked pretty good under those circumstances can the confederates take pittsburgh ophelia clemens asked when dowling got questions like that being a reliable source looked a lot less enjoyable i hope not he blurted scritch scritch scritch went the pencil point can we stay in the war if they do take pittsburgh no this wasnt any fun at all i hope so dowling answered losing it would hurt us we make an awful lot of steel there but its not like birminghamits not just about the only place where we make steel as far as that goes we can hold on and hold out even so will the country stand for it she asked cleveland was supposed to hold up the confederates for a long time it didnt not for nearly long enough its gone its lost if pittsburgh goes the same way wont we just say oh no we cant win this one and throw in the towel thats what jake featherston hopes well do anyhow dowling said weve got elections coming up this fall now im just a soldier im not supposed to know anything about politics and i mostly dont soldiers even soldiers acting as reliable sources had to say such things dowlingand no doubt ophelia clemens with himknew he was being disingenuous but he couldnt help it he went on one thing i havent seen is anybody from any party campaigning on a peace now platform scritch scritch scritch well neither have i the reporter said why do you suppose that is because everybody figures featherston would kick us while were down dowling answered at once dont you what else could it be hes made it pretty damn clear that he tells lies whenever he opens his mouth or do you think im wrong me she shook her head no sir not even a little bit you know the number of the beast all right ive been in this business for as long as youve been in the armylonger really because i watched my father before i was old enough or good enough to do it myself jake featherston scares the spit out of me ive never seen anybody like him not on this continent some of the people in action francaise maybe and that mosley fellow in england but nobody here comes close we should have smashed him when we had the chance just after he got power dowling said but featherston didnt look so dangerous then and the usa was stuck in the economic collapse and so yes dowling thought sourly and so hipolito rodriguez sat on his cot in the guards barracks at camp determination methodically cleaning his submachine gun hed learned in the dirt and mud and dust of the trenches that a clean weapon could make the difference between life and death the submachine gun had a more complicated apparatus than his old tredegar too another guard an alabaman named jonah gurney said anybodyd reckon you was married to that gun he carried his weapon when he walked through the camp and ignored it the rest of the time he was a younger man not a recruit from the confederate veterans brigades hed never seen combat and it showed married no rodriguez shook his head my wife screw me i like that this gun screw me i dont like nothin no more he pushed an oily rag through the barrel with a cleaning rod the rest of the men in the barracks laughed he got you jonah somebody said he got you good by the dull flush rising on gurneys blunt features he already knew that he liked ragging on other people oh surehe liked that fine it wasnt so much fun when somebody turned the tables on him if rodriguez had had a dime for everybody like that hed met he would have been one of the richest men in sonora certainly too rich to be a camp guard scowling gurney said youre asshole buddies with the big cheese in the camp aint you we were in the war together rodriguez answered with a shrug because hed practiced stripping and assembling the submachine gun so much he could let his hands do it while he kept an eye on the other guard i dunno about asshole buddies i dont think i like the sound of that too much he did like the sound with which a full magazine went into place a satisfying click jonah gurney didnt seem to notice no he said what you aim to do about it greaser one step up from niggersthat was how sonorans and chihuahuans seemed to a lot of whites in the csa another smaller click from rodriguezs gun the safety coming off casually calmly rodriguez said what do i aim to do i aim to blow your fucking head off pendejo all at once the barrel of the gun pointed straight at gurneys nose rodriguezs finger twitched on the trigger that wasnt what shook the alabaman the smile on his face was gurneys own face went pale as a plate of grits he tried a smile of his own the only word that suited it was ghastly hey he said with lips and tongue that suddenly seemed numb i didnt mean nothin by it honest to god i didnt kiss my ass rodriguez said succinctly put down the piece rodriguez that was troop leader porter the noncom in charge of rodriguezs squad there aint gonna be any killing here today thank you troop leader jonah gurney gabbled you see what that crazy mexican fucker was gonna do to me ought to take him out and shut up porters voice was flat and hard pack up your shit and get the hell out of here youre reassigned as of now maybe some other campll take you i dont know i dont care but youre not gonna stay at camp determination another minute and you can take that to the bank youre a troublemaking son of a bitch and weve got no need for people like you get out fuck off gurney stared at him as if he couldnt believe his ears youre gonna back a goddamn dago against a white man im going to back a guard who pulls his weight against a slacker who does as little as he can to get by porter said i wouldnt have been real sorry to see you dead gurney if it wasnt for the paperwork id have to fill out to make sure rodriguez didnt end up in hot water over your worthless carcass gurney plainly thought himself as much abandoned and thrown over the side for no good reason as the original jonah he gestured toward the rest of the guards in the barracks a wave full of angry disbelief come on yall he cried you gonna let him get away with that you gonna let him screw over a white man for the sake of a goddamn mexican disbelief stretched his voice high and shrill for close to a minute nobody said anything nobody seemed to want to look at gurney or at rodriguez or at troop leader porter for that matter nobody seemed to want to look at anybody else finally somebody behind gurney said hes got the stripes jonah reckon that gives him the right like hell it does jonah gurney shouted furiously were white men that gives us the right thats what this here countrys all about aint it thats what the freedom partys all about aint it again silence stretched this time porter broke it go on jonah he said his voice surprisingly gentle go on now and dont get yourself any deeper in dutch im gonna make like i didnt hear any of what you said just now a mans gotta blow off steam i know that but you dont want me to have to tell the commandant you were trying to make a mutiny now do you when rodriguez was in the army theyd read out the articles of war every so often making a mutiny was one of the things they could shoot you or hang you for even mentioning it put a chill in the hot muggy air rodriguez didnt know if camp guards came under the same military law as soldiers but he would have bet they did the ominous words seemed to get home to gurney too this aint right dammit he muttered my congressmans gonna hear about it so help me god he is but he might have shrunk standing there in plain sight he filled his gray canvas duffel bag slung it over his shoulder and trudged out of the barracks rodriguez nodded to porter thank you he said softly i didnt do it for you the noncom answered thank you anyway rodriguez said his gratitude only embarrassed the troop leader i didnt do it for you dammit he repeated i did it for all of us when were in there with the coons weve got to know we can trust each other to guard our backs anybody who doesnt care to help another man who wears the same uniform no matter what i dont want that son of a bitch here i cant trust him nobody can trust him he looked around the barracks we got anybody else who feels the way gurney did anybody who does clean out your footlocker and head out the door i wont put a bad word on your fitness reportswear to jesus i wontbut i want you doin somethin else anybody no one moved no one spoke all right then porter said rodriguez isnt the only man from sonora and chihuahua weve got at this campnot even close has anybody seen any sign that those people are falling down on the job anything at all again no one said a word the noncom nodded i havent either the government and the partyand the party mind youthought they could do it or they wouldnt have recruited them in the first place right yall gonna tell jake featherston he doesnt know what hes doin you let me know where you want your body sent first that pretty much took care of that white men were careful around rodriguez from then on out he wasnt sure whether they were afraid to say anything bad to him even if he had it coming or they were afraid hed shoot them if they did say anything either way felt awkward he wished they would just treat him the way they treated one another too much to hope for he feared he wasnt a mexican a greaser to the negroes in the camp maybe that was because they knew most sonorans and chihuahuans had no more use for them than most whites did more likely he judged it was because to them in his gray uniform he was a guard the uniform took precedence over the face when he went over to the womens side of the camp the prisoners always tried to soften him up if hed do something for them they made it plain they would do something for him and some of them left nothing to the imagination taking up all the offers and comeons and outandout propositions would have drained a man half his age dry in nothing flat some of the guards took up as many as they could in a way rodriguez understood that they had to think why not sooner or later whether she knew it or not a woman was going out in a truck why not enjoy her while she was here if she was enjoyable why not fix it so she went out later not sooner in the end what difference did it make rodriguez took up an offer himself every now and then but only every now and then most of the time he remembered he was a married man when three guards in quick succession got the clap that made him more cautious than ever magdalena wouldnt thank him for bringing home a drippy faucet troop leader porter was loudly disgusted when that happened jesus fucking christ he exclaimed and fuckings about right aint it we gonna have to set up a shortarm station around here i knew we had some dumb pricks on this duty but yall have gone over the line next man who comes down venereal hes gonna get a dishonorable discharge to go with his dishonorable discharge you hear me yes troop leader the guards chorused sooner or later somebody would if it was later the noncom might have forgotten about his threat if it was sooner rodriguez resisted temptation till he got shifted to the mens side that was a different business walking through the mens side inspecting barracks to make sure the prisoners werent working on tunnels or any other nefarious schemes was like walking through a cage full of wolves and cougars nothing was likely to happen to you if you were careful and if you stayed with your buddies if you went off by yourself one guard got his head smashed in his weapon disappeared everybody turned the mens half of the camp upside down and inside out rodriguez thought that submachine gun was gone for good or till a mallate emptied the clip into more guards but by what had to be not far from a miracle it got fished out of a latrine trench it was wrapped in greasy rags and slathered with lardnot as good as cosmoline but enough to keep it in working order no one ever found out who did in the guard all the prisoners had their rations cut in punishment but nobody squealed suh what they buildin out past the wire a man asked rodriguez not long after the gun was recovered by chance the black had picked a guard who knew the answer would get rodriguez a promotion as soon as the paperwork went through but he just scowled at the scrawny prisoner and said you find out when the time comes you dont got to be dat way suh the negros voice was a sheepish whine hed no doubt used to talk his way out of trouble before i didnt mean no disrespect i wasnt rude or crude or mean or nothin like that i just wants to know you find out when the time comes rodriguez repeated and glared at the prisoner the fellow knew when to back off in a hurry when the time came when he found out that wouldnt help him a bit xii all ahead onethird sam carsten called down to the engine room from the josephus daniels bridge all ahead onethird sir aye aye the answer came back at once the destroyer escort picked up a little speed sam read the chart by the dim glow of a flashlight with red cellophane taped over the bulb that didnt spoil his night vision and wouldnt be visible from any great distance getting out of philadelphia harbor and delaware bay was going to be even more fun than escaping chesapeake bay if the clouds overhead broke if they did moonlight would pour down on the us warship while she was still sneaking through the minefields that protected the harbor that to put it mildly wouldnt be good confederate subs lurked just outside hungry for anything they could catch i wish they would have given us a pilot who really knows these minefields pat cooley said me too sam told his exec i asked for one at the navy yard hell i screamed for one they wouldnt give him to me they said wed have to stop and lower a boat to let him come back and that that would make the mission even more dangerous they said they didnt have enough pilots like that for us to just go on and take him with us well i can sort of see their point cooley said reluctantly sort of in the light of that cellophanecovered flashlight he looked like a pink angry ghost if we were a battleship or a carrier though we would have got one now that you mention it yes carsten gave the younger officer a crooked smile didnt you figure out we were expendable the first time they gave us a shorebombardment mission sorry sir i guess im just naive cooley answered but ill tell you somethingim sure as hell convinced now thats uh swell sam had almost said it was bully to someone the executive officers age that would have smacked of the nineteenth century if not the middle ages since sam was only middleaged himselfand not always reconciled to thathe didnt want cooley to think of him as one with nineveh and tyre then he stopped flabbling about changing tastes in american slang and went back to worrying about getting blown out of the water if he screwed up come left to i say again come left to coming left to onefiveoh aye aye sir cooley changed course without question or comment he was still the best shiphandler on the josephus daniels in a nasty spot like this the best shiphandler belonged at the wheel he had to make his course corrections on the basis of what sam told him and had to hope sam was telling him the right thing if that wasnt enough to give you an ulcer before you hit thirty sam didnt know what would be even if i do everything right we still may go skyhigh sam thought unhappily not all confederate submersibles carried torpedoes some laid mines if theyd laid some that us sweepers hadnt found yet that could getinteresting or a moored mine might have come loose if it drifted into their path sam would have done everything right and a fat lot of good it would do him he gauged distances and times and speed and ordered other course corrections lieutenant cooley coolly made them how am i doing the exec asked after a while youre here to ask the question youre standing on a nice level deck were not burning were not sinking youre doing fine if you hit a mine ill have something to say to you till then dont worry about it cooley chuckled youve got a good way of looking at things sir do i i dont know sam said this whole business of being in command is new to me im making it up as i go alongand i probably shouldnt tell you a word of that well too goddamn bad its not like you and everybody else aboard dont already know it dont worry about it sir everybody knows youre the old man and everybody feels good about it cooley said thanks sam said on the josephus daniels he was the old man literally as well as figuratively the destroyer escort had a couple of grizzled chiefs with close to his mileage on them but only a couple he was old enough to be father for most of the crew if anything that might help his position of command if somebody looked and sounded like your dad you were used to taking orders from him of course if you were eighteen you were probably convinced your dad was a jerk so maybe command authority didnt follow from age after all like his early small worry that one got submerged in the intricacy and tension of what he was doing he stayed at it till the gray light of earliest morning grew brighter than the flashlights red beam then he stood up very straight and allowed himself to look away from the chart and stretch i think were through it pat he said good thats hard work the exec also stretched i think we handled it about as well as we could you did the hard part carsten said i just told you where to go he grinned im the only man on this ship who can youre the only one who can say it cooley replied everybody else just thinks it he turned to the bespectacled extremely junior jg in charge of the yrange gear isnt that right walters i dont know what youre talking about sir thad walters replied deadpanwhich in a perverse way proved cooleys point sam took another look at the lightening sky he didnt like what he saw not even a little bit any sign of those damn confederate maritime bombers he asked knowing he sounded anxious any skipper without air cover of his ownand even skippers with ithad the right to sound anxious in this day and age walters eyed the screen so did sam he didnt see anything untoward but would an expert war was getting to be a business of gadget against gadget not man against man well that had been true when battleships ruled the seas too but the gadgets were a lot subtler these days looks all right for now the young jg said keep an eye peeled sam told him he spoke into a voice tube anything on the hydrophone bevacqua no sir the petty officers voice came back everythings quiet thats what i like to hear another gadget sam thought theyd had hydrophones during the great war too back then though youd had to stop to listen if a sub was in the neighborhood stopping wasnt the best thing you could do in the last war also the hydrophone could give you a bearing on where a submersible prowled but not a range the boys with the thick glasses and the slide rules had fancied up the device in the interwar years these days hydrophones could filter out a ships own engine noise though they still worked better in silence they could also say just where in the water an enemy submarine hid the way vince bevacqua explained it newmodel hydrophones used sound waves as yranging gear used wireless waves they bounced them off a target and picked up the reflections technical details fascinated sam he knew he would never be able to repair let alone improve a yrange set or a hydrophone that didnt bother him the better he understood how the gadgets worked what they could and couldnt do the better hed be able to use them and the more he could count on what they told him keep listening was all he said now who me bevacqua answered sam laughed he knew how hard the petty officer concentrated with the earphones on his head pat cooley waved at the thick clouds overhead weve got a nice low ceiling this morning he remarked we probably dont have to worry about the maritime bombers too much only thing that has any real chance of running across us is a flying boat out snooping yeah those bastards fly low all the time sam agreed one of these days before too long theyll have yrange gear too and then everythingll be out to lunch makes you wonder what the navys coming to doesnt it he wasnt worried not as far as his own career went a kid like cooley would see a lot more change though the exec didnt seem unduly worried if were vulnerable to air power well just have to bring our own air power with us thats all if our airplanes shoot down their airplanes before they can get at us we win that was the real lesson of the pacific war sam had been in the pacific war cooley hadnt even been at annapolis yet that didnt mean he was wrong carriers have a hard time operating against landbased air though he said too many attackers can swamp you we found that out at charleston hed been there too when this war was new put enough carriers together and youll swamp the landbased air cooley might have been right about that neither the united states nor britain the two major carrier powers in the atlantic had been able to prove it yet japan was trying its hardest to do so over and around the sandwich islands since sam couldnt prove anything one way or the other he said bring us around to course pat changing course to aye aye sir cooley swung the josephus daniels to port till she was steady on her new easterly course steady on sir thank you now weve got a clear track to providenceexcept for subs and mines and raiders and those flying boats and other little details like that providence by the way the exec said it he might have been talking about the black hole of calcutta he sighed noisily well its better than staying stuck in philadelphia would be i suppose what are we going to do there deliver the daniels so she can take over as a training ship for the swabbies there seamen learning their trade went out on the lamson a destroyer of great war vintage they learned to fire weapons aboard her they formed the black gang that served her wheezy engines they worked in the galleys they cleaned heads they learned what it was like to sleep in a hammock with another sailors bad breath and backside only inches from their face were not quite spavined enough for that sam said cooley raised an eyebrow at an evidently unfamiliar word but he figured out what it had to mean sam felt his years showing again back when people talked about horses all the time you heard spavined every week if not every day but the exec had grown up in an automotive age if you talked about a spavined motorcar you were making a joke not describing anything real sam went on were going to escort a convoy down the coast to new york city and then back to philly should be exciting the exec mimed an enormous yawn sam laughed if youre on convoyescort duty you hope to jesus it isnt exciting everything that could make it exciting is bad i suppose so cooley grudged him a nod then winked one thing skipperall that zigzagging will do wonders for you at the wheel yeah i know sam answered seriously which spoiled cooleys joke but the same thought had already occurred to him and he wanted his shiphandling to get better he wanted everything he did to get better hed got such a late start at being an officer and still had so much catching up to do fremont blaine dalby stared at the ships coming into pearl harbor the cpo shook his head if those arent two of the ugliest sons of bitches i ever set eyes on then you two guys are he nodded to fritz gustafson and george enos jr george said i dunno chief they look pretty damn good to me yeah gustafson added a nod bullshit dalby said the boss of the twinmm crew was a man of strong opinions his being a republican proved that some of his opinions were crackpot too as far as george was concerned his being a republican also proved that he went on dont get me wrong im not saying we dont need em on account of we do but theyre still as ugly as the guy sitting next to you on the head george grunted at that like any new sailor hed had to get used to doing his business in a facility without stalls he hadnt thought about it for a while now and wondered if hed be stricken with constipation because he did he admitted to himselfif not to fremont dalbythat the senior rating had a point of sorts the trenton and the chapultepec didnt have the raked grace of a heavy cruiser but the escort carriers brought something vital to the sandwich islands hope they looked like what they werefreighters that had had their superstructures torn off and replaced with a flight deck a tiny starboard island didnt begin to make up for what had been amputated but they carried thirty airplanes apiece they had dive bombers and torpedocarriers and fighters to protect the strike aircraft and the ships themselves the two of them put together were worth about as much as one fleet carrier what i want to know is are there more of them out in the pacific george said thats what really counts if they can watch the gap where airplanes from the sandwich islands cant stay and the ones from the west coast cant either then we really might hang on to this place they didnt come by themselves you know dalby reminded him most of the freighters and tankers that came with em are unloading in honolulu not here but everybodyll have enough beans and gasoline for a while longer sure chief disagreeing with a cpo when you were only an able seaman took diplomacy picking his words with care george went on but its not waddayacallitnot economical thats what i want to sayto send these ugly ducklings back and forth to frisco or wherever for each new convoy hes right gustafson saidanother goodsized speech for him he was a petty officer himself though not an exalted chief he could speak somewhat more freely to dalby but only somewhat george was more than halfway convinced that cpos really ran the navy they let officers think they did but so many officers orders were based on what they heard from cpos a lieutenant jg who tried to buck one of the senior ratings didnt have a prayer even his own superiors wouldnt back him and it wouldnt have helped if they did well yeah fremont dalby said but these babies ought to be good for more than defense they ought to be able to play sixty minutes how many of em dyou figure wed need to take midway back from the buddhaheads gustafson eyed the chapultepec which was closer damn thing cant do moren eighteen knots if you chuck her off a cliff he opineda veritable oration he didnt bother to say what he already knew that japanese fleet carriers like most selfrespecting warships could make better than thirty dalby only shrugged doesnt matter all that much airplanes are a hell of a lot faster than ships any which way that held some truth but only some other things went into the mix jap carriers can walk away from subs these little guys wont be able to another shrug from the gun chief thats why the townsends in the navy if we cant keep submersibles off of carriers what the hell good are we george gave up he wasnt about to change dalbys mind that was as plain as the nose on the cpos facewhich was saying something because dalby had a formidable honker in the end changing dalbys mind didnt matter a dimes worth anyhow dalby wasnt the one whod decide what to do with the escort carriers he wasnt the one whod decide what to do with the townsend either though he often acted as if he were the skipper he said itll be goddamn nice operating with real air cover for a change not even the brassd be dumb enough to send us out naked anymore heres hoping fritz gustafson packed a world of skepticism into two words this time george thought dalby had the right of it there were plenty of landbased airplanes on oahu why send carriers all the way to the sandwich islands if not to use them with the rest of the navy when the townsend put to sea a few days later she did so without either the trenton or the chapultepec even though she did george didnt flabble about it she went out on an antisubmersible patrol to the east of oahu japanese carrierbased aircraft were most unlikely to find her there after george remarked on that dalby looked at himlooked through him really youd sooner be torpedoed got a better chance against a sub than we would against airplanes george said stubbornly then he wondered if that was true his father hadnt had any chance against a submarine but he got suckerpunched after the war was over wed be on our toes whenever george was on deck he kept an eye peeled for periscopes he also looked for the thin pale exhaust from a submersibles diesel engine what with the townsends hydrophone gear all that was probably wasted effort he didnt care not even a little bit he did it anyhow he noticed he was far from the only one who did he wasnt on deck when general quarters sounded he was rinsing off in the shower he threw on his skivvies and ran for his gun with the rest of his clothes including his shoes under his arm nobody laughed or not very much nobody whod been in the navy longer than a few weeks hadnt been caught the same way he dressed at his post his hair was still wet it dripped in his face and down his back he would have minded that much more in the north atlantic in december than he did here now hear this the execs voice crackled out of the loudspeakers weve found us a submarine and we are going to prosecute the son of a bitch an excited buzz ran through the sailors george looked enviously up toward the depthcharge launchers near the destroyers bow their crews were the ones whod have the fun of dropping things on the japs heads dont go to sleep now fremont dalby warned if those bastards surface were the ones wholl fill em full of holes he set a hand on one of the mms twin barrels the quickfiring gun made an admirable can opener the townsend swung to port down under the surface a submersible was no doubt maneuvering too it could have been catandmouse but the mouse here had almost as good a chance as the cat the townsends advantage was speed the subs stealth where was that boat they must have thought they knew for depth charges flew from the launchers and splashed into the pacific george waited bracing himself when the ashcans burst it was like a kick in the ass from an elephant the townsends bow lifted then slammed back down more charges arced through the air some would be set for a depth a little less than the hydrophone operator thought accurate some for a little more with luck the submersible wouldnt get away with luck oil oil somebody yelled his voice cracked the second time he said it could be a trick fritz gustafson said george nodded a canny sub skipper would deliberately release oil and air bubbles to try to fool his tormentors into thinking theyd smashed him then he could slink away or strike back as he got the chance not this time though coming up screamed somebody near the bow motherfuckers coming up like a breaching whale but far bigger the japanese submarine surfaced she might not have been able to stay down anymore but she still showed fight men tumbled out of her conning tower and ran for the deck guns the odds against them were longa destroyer vastly outgunned a submersiblebut they had a chance if they could hurt the townsend badly enough they might yet get away but the destroyers guns were already manned and ready george wasnt sure if his weapon was the very first to start blazing away but it was among the first tracers walked across the water toward the sub less than a mile away they were close enough to the target to let him see chunks of metal fly when shells slammed into the side of the boat and the conning tower one of the shells hit a japanese sailor amidships he exploded into red mist there were worse ways to go he must have died before he knew it the japs got off a few shots one of them hit near the townsends bow just aft of the ashcan launchers george heard shrieks through the din of gunfire but the sub was in over its head its guns were out in the open and unprotected and the american mms and machine guns picked off the crews in nothing flat when the destroyers main armament started taking bites out of the subs hull it quickly sank it kept firing as long as it could the crew had gutsno way around that a few men still bobbed in the water after the submersible went down the townsend steered toward them and threw lines and life rings into the water the japanese sailors stubbornly refused to take them a couple of sailors deliberately sank when lines came near others shook defiant fists at the ship that had sunk their sub they shouted what had to be insults in their own language theyre crazy george said if that was me id be up on this deck and down on my knees thanking god theyd rescued me instead of shooting me or leaving me for shark bait or just to drown japs arent like that dalby said bunch of crazy monkeys if you want to know what i think they figure being a pow is the worst thing in the world fritz gustafson said far as theyre concerned dyings better like i saidcrazy dalby said nasty too gustafson was for him in a talky mood dont let em catch you if youre a pow they figure youre in disgrace anything goes near enough how do you know that george asked the loader shrugged you hear stuff is all one of the last japanese sailors afloat spat seawater up at the townsend he made gestures that probably meant the same as giving her the finger the ship took the perfect revenge she sailed away the sailors whooped and cheered i think youre right chief george said they are crazy told you so fremont dalby said smugly i just wish they werent so goddamn tough thats all jefferson pinkard inspected his dress grays in the mirror he looked pretty goddamn sharp if he did say so himself the three wreathed silver stars on either side of his collar gleamed and sparkled the way hed polished them they couldnt very well do anything else his silver belt buckle shone too so did the black leather of his belt and boots when he got married the first time back before the great war hed done it in a rented tailcoat hed thought he was hot stuff then maybe hed even been right his belly hadnt bulged over his belt in those days anyhow he scowled as the memory came back emilyd been hot stuff in those days too too goddamn hot it turned out little whore he growled she hadnt wanted to wait till he got back from the trenches shed spread it around starting with his best friend he remembered walking in after he got a leave he hadnt told her about ahead of time walking in and angrily he turned away from the mirror then feeling foolish he had to turn back to get his hatalmost a stetson but with a higher crown and a wider brimcocked at just the right jaunty angle everything was going to be perfect dammit perfect and he wasnt going to think about emily even once a birmingham painted in official butternut waited for him take you into town sir the driver said if you dont we aint got a show jeff answered and the fellow behind the wheel laughed jeff added yeah you might as well ive come this far i dont reckon ill chicken out now he slid into the back seat better not the driver agreed thats where you get one of them waddayacallemsbreeches of promise suits thats it that wasnt exactly it but came close enough jeff wondered if any lawyers were filing breach of promise suits these days or if the army had grabbed them all most anyhow he guessed but a maiden spurned could probably still find a lawyer to be her knight in shining armorat a suitable hourly rate of course edith blades was no maiden on the other hand jeff didnt aim to spurn her long as im at the church everythingll be just fine he said a couple of buses sat in the church parking lot theyd brought guards in from camp determination patrols would be thin there this afternoon and evening jeff hoped they wouldnt be too thin he didnt think they would hed made the camp as hard to break out of as he could it ought to get along just fine for a few hours with a skeleton crew hip rodriguez waited in the doorway and waved when jeff got out of the birmingham edith had squawked a little when jeff asked a mexican to be his best man but hed won the argument wasnt for him sweetheart hed said its not real likely id be here to marry you edith hadnt found any answer for that pinkard hadnt figured she could you look good senor jeff rodriguez called so do you pinkard said which was true his old army buddy hadnt put on nearly so much weight as he had and looked impressive as the devil in his guards uniform whoever had designed those clothes knew how to intimidate gracias rodriguezs smile was on the sheepish side you know something this is the very first time i ever go inside a protestant church thinking about it jeff realized hed never set foot inside a catholic church he remembered some of the things hed heard about those places when he was growing up in birmingham turning them on their head he said dont worry hip i promise we dont keep the devil down in the storm cellar by the way his pal started to cross himself he must have been wondering something like that rodriguez broke off the gesture before completing it of course not senor jeff he said though his expression argued it was anything but of course jeff went on into the vestibule or whatever they called the antechamber just inside the entrance ediths sister who would be her maid of honor stood guard at the door to the ministers little office the bride waited in there and the groom was not going to set eyes on her till the ceremony started jeff liked judy smallwood just fine if he hadnt got to know edith first he might have liked her sister better since judy was going back to alexandria right after the wedding though that wasnt likely to prove a problem you look mighty nice he told her and she did her dress was of glowing blue taffeta with short puffed sleeves that set off her figure and her fair skin dark blond hair and blue eyes by the way those eyes traveled him she thought he cut a pretty fine figure himself in his fancy uniform she said kind of a shame you havent got anybody coming out from alabama for the day my ma and pa been dead for years jeff answered with a shrug dont have any brothers or sisters my cousins he shrugged again i dont recollect the last time i talked to one of them they heard from me now theyd just reckon i was aiming to pry a wedding present out of em well if its like that you shouldnt judy said its too bad though have i got time for a cigarette before we get going jeff wondered hed just pulled the pack out of his pocket when the minister emerged from the office jeff made the cigarettes disappear again a smoke would have calmed his nerves but he could do without anyhow the only real cure for prewedding jitters was about four stiff drinks and that would make people talk he touched the brim of his hat howdy parson mr pinkard the reverend luke sutton said bobbing his bald head in return he sent hip rodriguez a slightly fishy stare rodriguez showed no sign of sprouting horns on his forehead or letting a barbed tail slither out past his trouser cuffs so the minister looked away and started down the aisle mrs sutton struck up the wedding march on a beatup old upright piano against one wall some baptist churches didnt approve of music at all jeff was glad the suttons werent quite so strict as theyd rehearsed he listened to her play it through once then he headed down the aisle himself his best man followed uniforms filled the folding chairs on one side the other held ediths relatives ordinarylooking men and women in black suits and in dresses of a variety of colors and stylessome of them must have dated from just after the great war and they ran up to the present ediths sons by chick blades were the ring bearers small smothered chuckles rose as people got a look at the young boys jeff had to work to keep his own face straight edith had told him she would make sure frank and willie didnt have silly grins on their faces when they came down the aisle shed put the fear of god in them all right better than reverend sutton could have dreamt of doing they looked serious past the point of solemnityall the way to absurdity in fact ediths sister came next she was grinning but on her it looked good and edith herself followed a moment later her dress was identical in cut to judys but of a taffeta somewhere between cream and beige this wasnt her first marriage so white wouldnt have been right shed had to do some searching to find a veil that matched but shed managed she stood beside jeff they faced the minister he went through a wedding sermon hed probably delivered a hundred times before it wasnt fresh it wasnt exciting it wasnt even very interesting pinkard didnt care it was officialthat was all that mattered before too long sutton got down to business they exchanged rings taking them from the velvet pillows ediths sons carried do you jefferson davis pinkard take this woman as your lawful wedded wife to have and to hold to love and to cherish in sickness and in health for richer for poorer for better for worse till death do you part i do jeff said ediths vows were the same except there was a to obey in them somewhere jeff hardly noticed it and suspected edith would hardly notice it either her chin went up in pride as she also said i do then by the authority vested in me by the confederate baptist convention and by the sovereign state of texas i now pronounce you man and wife luke sutton declared you may kiss the bride jeff lifted ediths veil to do just that he made the kiss thorough without he hoped making a spectacle of himself edith stayed relaxed in his arms so he didnt think he overdid it the wedding march rang out again as the new couple and their attendants went up the aisle to the back of the church everybody else filed by to congratulate them well what do you think jeff asked hip rodriguez after the last guards and cousins of ediths slowly shuffled past very nice senor jeff rodriguez answered but he couldnt help adding i miss the priests fancy robes and the incense and the latin this way it hardly seems like you are in an iglesiaa church oh its a church all right jeff said he had seen priests in rich robes down in the empire of mexico he hadnt seen a service there though it didnt seem as if those prelates and somebody like reverend sutton were talking about the same god the church boasted a little social hall next to the sanctuary the reception was there the punch and cider were teetotal reverend sutton wouldnt have it any other way warned of this jeff had got the intelligence to the guards a lot of them carried flasks with which to improve the liquid refreshment they stayed reasonably discreet and the minister stayed reasonably polite one of the guards made models for a hobby working with a tiny brush hed changed the clothes of the groom atop the wedding cake from white tie and tails to dressgray uniform the figure was still too slim to make a good image of jeff pinkard but it looked a lot more like him than it had before edith stuffed gooey chocolate cake into his mouth and he did the same for her he wasnt sorry not to dance on church property hed never been much for cutting a rug at about ten oclock he and edith went out to the birmingham people cheered and yelled bawdy advice and pelted them with rice the driver took them back to jeffs quarters edith squeaked when he picked her up to carry her over the threshold then as he set her down he said whats this this was a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice by the bed a card in an envelope leaned against the bucket when jeff opened the envelope and took out the card his eyes almost bugged out of his head hope the two of you stay real happy together it read in a looping scrawl surely written by no secretary the signature was in that same rough hand jake featherston oh edith said reading it with him oh jeff yeah jeff said thats somethin all right he picked up the champagne bottle reckon the least we can do is drink some o this before he stopped edith turned pink anyhow he laughed wedding nights were for laughing werent they champagne went down smoother than spiked punch had edith got pinker yet not from embarrassment but from the sparkling wine jeff picked her up again he was a big man and she wasnt a very large woman this time he set her down on the bed she was no giggling maiden she knew what was what the same as jeff did that made it better as far as he was concerned when it was over he stroked her lazy in the afterglow hello there wife he said hello husband edith said and started to cry i love you jeff even though she said it even though he was sure she meant it he knew she was remembering chick too he didnt know what the hell he could do about it doing nothing seemed the smartest thing so he did that chester martins leg still didnt feel like carrying him around like it or not though the leg could do the job the army let wounded men heal but only as long as it absolutely had to then it threw them back into the meat grinder to see if they could get chopped up again as martin lit a cigarette in a replacement depot somewhere in western pennsylvania he wondered why the devil hed joined up again hed known he could get hurt get hurt hellhe could get killed hed done it anyhow after a while you forgot how bad it had been that was the only thing he could think of women said the same thing happened when they had babies if theyd truly remembered how bad labor was none of them would have had more than one he couldnt imagine a lonelier place than this depot he was still part of the army of course but he wasnt exactly in it he wasnt part of a unit a soldier by himself was hardly a soldier at all whatever outfit he joined now hed be the new guy for a whiletill enough other men got killed and maimed and enough other replacements took over for them to make him an oldtimer again the way things were going these days it wouldnt take long men ranging in rank from private up to major sat on benches and folding chairs some of them smoked some read newspapers or paperback adventures or mysteries some just stared into space chester recognized that stare because hed worn it the look of a man whod seen too much of hell you could help a buddy out when things got bad or he could help you nobody here had a buddy that was part of being in limbo a bad part you were stuck with yourself a fat technical sergeant who would never get any closer to the front than this called out three names following each with a serial number two privates and a corporal shouldered the packs theyd had between their feet they went up to the tech sergeant signed some papers and went out the door by which chester had come in they were fully part of the military machinery again off in the distance antiaircraft guns barked confederate dive bombers and strafing fighters were tearing up us positions in these parts softening them so cs barrels and foot soldiers could cut through them more easily the boys in butternut had the bit between their teeth again and they were running like hell chester ground out the cigarette under his heel and lit another one he didnt have the wind hed had the last time around but who did smoking gave him something to do it was as much fun as he was allowed to have here out popped that tech sergeant again half a dozen privates got up and trudged off to whatever awaited them chester went on chainsmoking second lieutenants got killed in droves first sergeants were a tougher smarteror at least more experiencedbreed till one went down hed sit here twiddling his thumbs martin chester a the tech sergeant yelled and his pay number after it the man also shouted several other names speak of the devil martin thought he rose slung on his packwhich didnt make his sore leg rejoiceand went over to the other noncom the men with him were all kidsa pfc and five or six newly minted privates the technical sergeant paid more attention to him than to the rest of them put together chester signed off on his paperwork then went outside hed wondered if his new outfit would have sent another senior sergeant to collect men from the reppledepple instead a shavetail second lieutenant awaited him that was good news and bad good because it showed his new co had enough sense to pick somebody who wasnt needed in the field bad because the youngster here was liable to know that and resent it by the sour expression on the lieutenants rather rabbity features he knew it too well hello sergeant im jack husak he said youre my new nursemaid arent you yes chester thought as he saluted and gave his own name but dealing with a superior with a chip on his shoulder was the last thing he wanted so he said im sure that wont be necessary sir so am i husak said ive been in charge of my platoon for a good six weeks now and ive got it running solidsolid all right im glad to hear it sir chester wondered what the youngsters notions of solid were he hadnt got shot in six weeks but what did that prove not much as chester knew too well second lieutenant husak didnt want to leave it alone commanding a platoon is an important responsibility he said which only proved he didnt understand his place in the world lieutenants in charge of platoons had the company co above them and a senior noncom below to fix things if they screwed up too badly doing all right meant you were training for a real role not doing all right probably meant getting wounded or killed and certainly meant youd never see another promotion husak went on whats the biggest command you ever had sergeant all right sonny boy you asked for it sir i led a company for a while in the last war over in northern virginia what husaks voice went high and shrill by the way he jerked he might have sat on a tack how could you do that usual way sir all the officers were killed or wounded martin answered stolidly this was sir and we were almost as beaten down and beat up as the confederates were eventually they got around to putting a lieutenant in the slot so i got bumped back down again but i had it for a month or so oh husak looked as if he wanted to call him a liar but he didnt have the nerve chesters matteroffact account was impossible to contradict especially for someone whod been making messes in his drawers in the young lieutenant also looked as if he hated chester and as if he was scared to death of him both at once he jerked a thumb towards a waiting truck hop in well see how you do in the war weve got now yes sir as chester did he called himself seventeen different kinds of idiot for this sour little punk hed walked away from his wife his son and a pretty damn good slot in the construction business what had those bastards at the recruiting station put in his coffee whatever it was they should have used it against the confederates instead it would have made them quit without a fight the other replacements got in after him husak did too he spent a lot less time on them than he had on chester the pfcchester thought his name was fitzpatrick though he looked more italian than irishsent him a sympathetic look but with the lieutenant in the truck with them that was all he could do move out husak called to the driver yes sir the man fired up the engine put the truck in gear and started west chester sighed softly back to the war dammit he thought instead the war came to him and within ten minutes the truck which had been rumbling along at a good clip slowed and then stopped the driver leaned on his horn lieutenant husak went up to the little window that separated the rear compartment from the drivers and shouted what the hell refugees the drivers answer was equally laconic jesus christ husak clapped a hand to his forehead a few seconds later martin who could only see where hed been not where he was going got a look out the back of the truck at the detritus of war by the time hed got to virginia all the civilians whod wanted to leave the combat zone were long gone here a woman stared at him out of eyes as empty and exhausted as those of an overworked draft animal sweat plastered her hair to her head her freckled skin was badly sunburned she had a knapsack on her back and a crude harness rigged from bed sheets on her chest that let her carry a howling toddler there a little girl of four or five clung to one hand a boy a year or two older to the other beside her stood a man in a battered straw hat pushing a wheelbarrow that held whatever hed been able to distill of his life he hadnt shaved for a week or so his checked shirt was filthy his dungarees were out at the knees and his shoes out at the toes he looked as weary and as beaten as the woman except as an obstacle they and the others like them ignored the truck they flowed around it flowed past itand kept the men in it from getting to where they could do anything about stopping the confederate advance that had set the refugees in motion in the first place a model t that edged around the truck heldchester counted carefullyfourteen people he wouldnt have bet you could cram that many in as a stunt this was no stunt it was literally life and death the ancient flivver ran even if it sagged on its springs lord what a fuckup the pfc said softly chester nodded and lit yet another cigarette that was about the size of it lieutenant husak meanwhile started throwing a fit weve got to clear these people he yelled how are we supposed to fight a war if civilians keep getting in the way civilians getting in the way werent an accidental consequence of confederate attacks featherstons men knew they would and took advantage of it husak turned to the soldiers with him you men fix bayonets and get these refugees off the road if an asskicker comes by were sitting ducks and so are they he wasnt wrong chester hadnt used his bayonet for anything but a knife and a can opener since the great war he put it on the business end of his springfield now it was still good for intimidating civilians get out of the road he shouted as he hopped down from the truck he did his best to sound like a traffic cop come on peoplemove it youre blocking military traffic youve got to get out of the way had the truck been full of soldiers he would have got results faster it wasnt so easy with only half a dozen men at his back the civilians didnt want to listen all they wanted was to get away from the confederates they returned to the highway as soon as chester and his comrades went by and then a confederate dive bomber did spot the column and the halted truck chester knew what that scream in the sky was as soon as he heard it hit the dirt he yelled and took his own advice scrambling away as fast as he could the pfc dove for cover too the rest of the soldiers and the civilians were still mostly upright when the mule machinegunned them dropped a bomb right in front of the truck and roared back toward the west screams shrieks raw terror people running every which way people down and bleedingsome writhing and howling others lying still pieces of people flung improbably far the truck going up like vesuvius whatever problems lieutenant husak had with his temper hed never fix them now and now there was even more chaos and delay on the road than there had been before chester looked around with the lieutenant dead he was the highestranking man here he wanted the responsibility about as much as he wanted a root canal want it or not it had just landed in his lap he got up and started doing what little he could to set things right despite its quaint name tom colleton found himself liking beaver pennsylvania the town sat in the middle of a mining and industrial belt near the border with ohio but was itself pleasant and treeshrouded hed commandeered the ivycovered quay house former home of a prominent socialist politician for his regimental headquarters the runner from division hq a few miles farther south caught up with him there after saluting the corporal said sir i have a special order for you it must have been special or his superiors would have sent it by wireless or field telephone enciphering it if they thought they had to tom nodded give it to me then he expected the messenger to pull out a piece of paper for him to read and then destroy instead it came orally the powers that be really didnt want anything that had to do with it falling into us hands sir you are ordered to allow a special unit to pass through your lines and to make sure the troops under your command do nothing to interfere with this special unit in any way that said just enough to leave lieutenantcolonel colleton scratching his head of course ill obey but id like to know a little more about what im obeying he said why would my men want to interfere with this special unit whatever it is how can i tell them not to if i dont know why itll cause trouble sir i was told youd likely ask that question and that i was allowed to answer it the corporal said seriously the answer is this special unit is made up of men who can talk like damnyankees they wear yankee uniforms and act like us soldiers son of a bitch colleton exclaimed whatever hed expected that wasnt it after a moment he wondered why not troops like that could raise merry hell behind enemy lines of course theyd have a short life and not a merry one if they got captured but that was their lookout not his he asked how will they get up here without having some overeager kid in butternut shoot their asses off he won a smile from the runner theyve come this far sir the corporal said theyll have escorts who look the way theyre supposed to and theyll move up at night when theyre less likely to be noticed all right makes sense tom wondered if the special unit had come up from the csa entirely by night lying quiet and hidden by day he couldnt think of any better way to keep his own side from trying to kill them he asked can you tell me anything about what theyll be doing no sir the messenger answered they didnt tell me so i couldnt tell the damnyankees in case i got caught fair enoughthat makes sense too tom said what time can i expect em my men will need some warning they should get here about eleven oclock the messenger said please dont brief your men too soon if they get captured or if they just start bragging to damnyankee pickets i understand what tom understood was that he was between a rock and a hard place his men did need warning or they would do their best to murder the ersatz yankees if he had to hold off till the last minute for fear of breaching security some of them might not get the word ill do what needs doing yes sir the corporal saluted if youll excuse me he headed back toward division hq presumably bearing word that the special unit could come ahead tom shook his head in wonder then he got on the field telephone with his company commanders trying to find out where us lines in front of him were most porous whats cooking sir one of his captains asked we going to sneak raiders through you might say so bobby lee tom answered youve got the quiet sector so you win the cigar alert your men that the infiltrators will have escorts and that they are to follow the orders they get from those escorts got it well enough to do what im told the captain answered plaintively something funnys going on though isnt it you dont know the half of it tom didnt want to go into detail on the telephone the damnyankees were better than he wished they were at tapping telephone lines he didnt know some us noncom with earphones was listening to every word he said but he didnt want to elaborate on what was going to happen not when his own superiors had gone out of their way to keep from sending anything on the air or over the wires with his own curiosity aroused he waited impatiently for nightfall somewhere off to the north artillery rumbled his own area stayed pretty quiet he supposed his superiors wanted it that way if the confederate soldiers dressed as yankees were going to cause the most trouble they ought to go in where the real enemy wasnt keyed up and ready to start shooting at anything that moved trucks rumbled into beaver a few minutes past eleven a confederate major in proper uniform alighted from the first one and came looking for tom after being directed to the quay house he said here we are sir youve been warned about us i sure have tom colleton answered good the major said please bring some men with you to form a screen around the ah special soldiers as they go forward we dont want to have any unfortunate accidents we dont want the ordinary soldiers shooting up the special men he meant tom nodded i understand major i agree one hundred percent nobody had got out of the trucks a couple of blocks away tom rounded up a couple of squads worth of clerks and technicians and other rearechelon troops and had them surround the silent vehicles whats up sir one of them asked reasonably enough dont be surprised and dont start shooting when you see who gets out of these trucks tom answered no matter what these men look like they arent real damnyankees theyre infiltrators theyre going to cause trouble behind the enemys lines if this goes well itll make the advance on pittsburgh a hell of a lot easier he turned to the major all right couldnt be better sir thanks the major raised his voice you can come out now boys toms men swore softly as the faux yankees emerged he couldnt blame them he muttered under his breath too they looked much too much like the real thing their uniforms and helmets were the ones hed been shooting at for more than a year they wore us shoes and carried us weapons and when they spoke they sounded like damnyankees too that really made the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck want to stand on end one of his men said sir you sure these bastards is on our side if i was a real yankee id shoot you for that you son of a bitch one of the men said he wore a sergeants uniform and sounded like a cocky noncom a cocky noncom from new york city he could have taken his act to the stage in fact he was taking it to the stageand a bad review would cost him his neck come on tom said ill take you up to the line one of my companies is facing a sector where the enemy doesnt really have much of a line in place against usthats what happens sometimes when you push hard good the major said can you start a little firefight somewhere else to distract the yankees some more the request made sense even if it would get some of his men wounded or killed ill take care of it he said and sent the order over the field telephone a machine gun and some riflemen opened up off to the right the enemy returned fire springfields sounded very different from automatic tredegars machine guns differed too the us weapons were closely related to their great war ancestors the cs model was lighter cooled by air rather than a clumsy water jacket and designed to put out absolutely as much lead as possible it sounded like nothing so much as a giant tearing up an enormous sheet of cloth the individual rounds going off blended into an almost continuous roar all right major tom told the officer in charge of the imitation yankees when they got to the perimeter ive done what i can do the rest is up to you and your boys good luck thank you kindly sir the major at least sounded like a proper confederate he turned to the men in his charge come on yall know the drill yeah sure thing no problem those laconic grunts sounded as if they came from the wrong side of the border one of the men muttered goddamn cowflop cigarettes from now on tom sympathized with that everybody knew how eager yankees were for confederate tobacco a few at a time the confederates in us uniform slipped off into the night tom waited tensely if gunfire erupted right in front of him something had gone wrong up there but everything stayed quiet could they have the passwords for this sector if the enemy had any brains he would change those every day tom knew his own side wasnt perfect at that he supposed the yankees also were unlikely to be everything stayed quiet however the infiltrators were doing it they were doing it the company commander said if that doesnt buy us a breakthrough nothing will even talking about breakthroughs made a great war veteran nervous well see what happens thats all bobby lee tom answered and i reckon wed better tighten up our own procedures what do you mean sir bobby lee asked what goes around comes around tom answered you dont suppose the damnyankees have men who sound like they come from the csa you dont suppose they can get their hands on our weapons and uniforms like hell they cant i think we came up with this one firsti hope to god we didbut were liable to be on the receiving end one day son of a bitch the young captain said my hats off to you sir he took himself literally doffing his helmet tom snorted never mind that just have our men ready to move fast if the order comes yes sir they will be sir bobby lee promised by the time tom got back to beaver the buses that brought in the phony us soldiers had gone but confederate barrelswith he devoutly hoped real confederates inside themwere rumbling into town the storm broke the next afternoon the barrels slammed into the shaky us position and it turned out to be even shakier than anybody would have expected enemy reinforcements showed up late showed up in the wrong places or didnt show up at all unlike a lot of people tom colleton had a pretty good notion of why that was so he wondered what it was costing the confederates in us greengray wed better make it worthwhile he thought and pushed his own men forward without mercy jonathan moss mooched back toward the barracks at the andersonville pow camp from the latrine trenches nick cantarella was coming the other way he gave moss a sour nod they still have guys looking up your ass when you take a crap he asked just about moss answered they both rolled their eyes ever since that downpour made part of the us escape tunnel fall in on itself the confederates had been as jumpy as mice at a cats wedding moss knew they had every reason to be knowing it didnt make him like it any better such fun cantarella said the confederates still didnt know whod built the tunnel that cantarella kept on walking around proved as much if the guards had had any idea what was what he would have been in solitary confinement or manacles or leg irons or ball and chain or whatever else they thought up to keep pows from absquatulating i wonder if anyone has anything else going on moss remarked you never can tell said the captain from new york one of these days the guards are liable to wake up and find out weve all flown the coop what do they do then jump off a cliff heres hoping yeah heres hoping moss knew his own voice sounded hollow he wanted out he wanted out so bad he could taste it he wasnt the only pow who did of course the guards knew as much too theyd known that even before the tunnel collapsed now with their noses rubbed in it they tried to keep an eye on everybody all the time wrinkling his own nose captain cantarella walked on toward the latrine trenches jonathan moss ambled back to the barracks other pows nodded to him as he went by he was one of the boys by now not a new fish who drew dubious glances wherever he went and whatever he did having the enemy suspicious of you was one thing it came with being a prisoner of war having your own side suspicious of you felt a lot worse day major first lieutenant hal swinburne said hello hal moss hid a smile at his own thoughts of a moment before hal swinburne hadnt been at andersonville very long but nobody suspected him of being a confederate plant for one thing three officers already incarcerated vouched for him for another he was a yankees yankee he came from maine and spoke with such a thick downeast accent half his fellow pows had trouble following him moss couldnt imagine a confederate plant talking like that hot today swinburne said mournfully hot yesterday hot tomorrow hot the day after too moss kicked at the red dirt dust rose from under his foot he pointed up into the sky where big black birds circled see those swinburne looked shielding his eyes with the palm of his hand he was about sixone on the skinny side with dark blond hair and a thin little mustache that almost disappeared if you looked at it from the wrong angle ravens he asked did you see ravens soaring over the maine woods moss wouldnt have been surprised he wasnt sure hed ever seen one but he was no birdwatcher he did know the birds he was watching now werent ravens vultures he said solemnly waiting for something to fall over dead from the sun so they can come down and have dinner vultures the way swinburne said it it sounded like vuhchaaz he nodded ayuh seen em on the field time or two nasty birds he stretched out the a in nasty and swallowed the r in birds after wiping his forehead with the back of his hand he went on how do folks live in weather like this all the time though people wondered the same thing about maine of course for opposite reasons moss said im from chicago i dont think theres any kind of weather in the world you dont see there thats not so bad swinburne said thats variety like but this here every day he shuddered id cook there was a variation on this theme when it wasnt hot and muggy and sunny it was hot and muggy and pouring rain moss didnt bother pointing that out he doubted the other pow would find it an improvement with another nod hal swinburne went on his way he didnt move any faster than he had to in this heat and humidity nobody moved any faster than he had to sweat coated moss skin thick and heavy as grease it welded his shirt and even his trousers to his body coming into the shade inside the barracks hall was a small relief but only a small one a little warm out there moss remarked that made even the men in the unending corner poker game look up really one of them said never would have guessed another added come on major a third poker player put in you knew hell was supposed to be hot right moss laughed a moment later he wondered why if this wasnt hell it had to be one of the nastier suburbs of purgatory he went over to colonel summers could i talk with you for a moment sir he asked the senior us officer in the camp nodded certainly he closed the beatup paperbound mystery hed been reading i already know who done it anyhow moss knew who done it in that one too the camp library didnt hold enough books anyone whod been here for a while and liked to read had probably gone through all of them at least once monty summers got to his feet whats on your mind major till they walked outside again moss kept it to small talk summers didnt seem surprised or put out when moss was sure neither guards nor fellow prisoners could overhear he asked are we still working on an escape officially i dont know what youre talking about colonel summers answered officially i had no idea there was a tunnel under these grounds till the rain showed it i was shockedshocked i tell youto learn that some men here were planning to break out the confederates couldnt prove any different either im glad they couldnt it would have been troublesome if they could he wouldnt admit a damn thing that was bound to be smart the less he said the less the confederates could make him sorry for the less moss heard the less the enemy could squeeze out of him all the same i do believe im going to go smack out of my mind if i stay cooped up here much longer oh i wouldnt summers said theyll put you in a straitjacket and those things are uncomfortable as the devil especially in this weather yes sir moss said resignedly he should have known he wouldnt get a straight answer as a matter of fact he had known it or had a pretty good idea that hed squawked anyhow was a telling measure of how fed up and cooped up he was feeling voice far drier than the dripping air they both breathed summers said believe me major you arent the only one incompletely satisfied with the accommodations around here no moss spirits revived or tried to is there anyone in particular i should talk to is anybody besides me especially unhappy about them if someone is im sure hell get in touch with you colonel summers said which again told moss nothing was anything else troubling you as i say youre not the only one who doesnt like it here remember that and you may keep from winning one of the guards a furlough bastards moss muttered the pows didnt know for a fact that their guards got time off for shooting a prisoner whod set foot on the smoothed ground just inside the barbed wireor sometimes for shooting a prisoner who looked as if he was about to do such a thing they didnt know it but they believed it the way a lot of them believed in the divinity of jesus christ of course theyre bastards summers said they get paid to be bastards you dont want to make things easy for them do you well no sir moss said good summers nodded in a businesslike way i should hope not he waved to lieutenant swinburne who was on his way back to the barracks what do you think of the guards lieutenant me sir pack of bastards swinburne answered at once the word was bahstuds in his mouth giving it only a vague resemblance to what moss had called the guards thanks i couldnt have put that better myself summers said the officer from maine touched his cap with a forefinger and went on his way colonel summers turned back to moss you see youre not the only one who loves these people i never said i was sir moss scowled ive got more right to complain than he does ive been here longer yes but they interrogate him more theyve already squeezed everything out of you that theyre going to get summers said hes new so they still have hopes if theres more than three confederate officers between here and richmond who dont know my name rank and pay number id be amazed and not a goddamn one of them knows anything but that moss spoke with a certain somber pride theyve grilled all of us major summers replied wearily rolling his eyes as if to say havent they just i know they get more out of some people than they do from others he held up a hasty hand im not talking about you and im not talking about swinburne either i know sir i understood that some men will talk more than others and they lean on some harder than others depending on what they think the poor sons of bitches know moss sighed i cant even cuss em for that or not real hard because i know damn well we do the same thing monty summers shrugged its war he said two words that covered a multitude of sins we all do the best we can yes sir moss agreed mournfully and look what thats got us his wave encompassed the camp god knows what would have happened if we tried to screw up heh colonel summers saida noise that sounded like a laugh but wasnt a hell of a lot of people who didnt do their best are dead right now oh yes sir moss agreed and some of them are back in philadelphia with stars on their shoulder straps theyre drinking good booze and eating steaks and screwing their secretaries for them the wars a nuisance or an opportunity depending on how you look at things summers eyed him for a long moment before saying that holds on both sides of the border you know i sure hope so sir moss said but what worries me is the confederates may have done a better job of sweeping away their deadwood than we have and thats liable to cost us its liable to cost us a lot xiii dr leonard odoull wondered how many places hed set up his aid station since returning to the war a lot of themthat was all he knew for sure after a while they started blurring together so did cases what made that worse was he never saw them again after they went back for more treatment he never found out whether they got better or worse they were just arms or legs or bellies or chests or headsnot that he or anybody else this side of god could do much for too many head wounds when he complained about that outside the aid tent one day granville mcdougald said well doc remember the fellow who had the round burrow under his scalp and come out the back calisse im not likely to forget him odoull said that one would stay in his memory forever i havent come that close to crapping myself since i was three years old but most of the bullets dont go around they go in mcdougald grimaced he crushed a cigarette under his foot theyd set up in some woods north of pittsburgh catbirds mewed and squawked in the trees they made an ungodly racket not all of it catlike you didnt see them all that often they were gray with black caps and rusty brown under their tailsgood camouflage colorsand stayed where leaves and bushes were thick a cardinal scratching for seeds on the ground on the other hand i used to love those birds odoull said sadly pointing towards it nowadays though the color just reminds me of blood you are cheery this morning arent you mcdougald studied the plump crested cardinal i still like em to each his own odoull looked up at the leaves and branches overhead in a different way i wish we were a little more out in the open a tree burst right above us would fill the aid tent with shrapnel if we were out in the open wed get shrapnel from ground bursts that the tree trunks will stop mcdougald answered which was also true only way not to worry about artillery is not to have a war and its a little late for that now just a bit yeah odoull said and aint it a shame his head came up like a pointers taking a scent so did mcdougalds but they didnt smell anything no they heard heavy footsteps the footsteps of stretcher bearers bringing back a casualty doc eddie yelled hey doc heres a new model for you back to work odoull murmured and granville mcdougald nodded the doctor raised his voice bring him to us eddie he went inside and washed his hands with soap and disinfectant taking special care to clean under and around his nails mcdougald did the same they slipped on surgical masks together sometimes odoull wondered how much good that did when wounds were often already filthy before they got back to him he supposed you had to try another groaning wounded man this one shot in the leg except as eddie had said he wasnt what odoull was used to seeing he was short and swarthy and blackhaired and wore a uniform of cut and colora khaki more nearly yellow than browndifferent from either us greengray or cs butternut when words broke through the animal noises of pain they came in spanish not english heard there were mexican troops in front of us mcdougald remarked so did i odoull nodded poor devil came a long way just to let some nasty strangers put a hole in him mcdougald shook his head he came to put holes in the nasty strangers himself suckers always do they never figure the guys on the other side are gonna shoot back the mexican soldiers moans eased eddie or one of the other corpsmen must have given him morphine he said something odoull couldnt figure out what it was spanish and french were related sure but not closely enough to let him understand one even if he knew the other he spoke in english youll be all right from what he could see of the wound he thought that was true the bullet looked to have blown off a chunk of flesh but not to have shattered any bones he turned to mcdougald put him under right you are doc mcdougald settled the ether cone over the wounded mans face he and eddie had to keep the soldier from yanking it off a lot of men thought they were being gassed when they inhaled the anesthetic after a few breaths the mexicans hands fell away and he went limp odoull cleaned out the wound and sewed it up had men from the soldiers own side brought him in it would have been a hometowner good for convalescent leave but nothing that would keep him from coming back to the front as things were hed sit out the rest of the war in a pow camp when the job was done odoull nodded to eddie you can take him back to the rear now if they have anybody who speaks spanish handy theyll probably want to grill him i suppose eddie said like worrying about the confederates wasnt bad enough now weve got the greasers jumping on us too no matter what he called mexicans he handled this one with the same rough compassion he would have shown any wounded soldier white brown black or even green he and the other stretcher bearers carried away the stillunconscious man interesting granville mcdougald said does this mean the confederates are starting to run low on their own men dont know said odoull who hadnt looked at it like that well neither do i mcdougald allowed i dont think like jake featherston or francisco jose thank god i hope im not a son of a bitch or a moron that startled a laugh out of odoull the medic went on but even if i dont know thats sure how it looks to me it makes sense odoull said we beat the csa last time by hammering on them till they couldnt hammer back anymore if were going to win this war well have to knock em flat again flatter mcdougald said last time we let em up again if we beat em this time wed better not do that again i dont know how long well have to sit on em but we need to do it however long it takes i suppose so odoull said mournfully but remember what kentucky and houston were supposed to be like before the plebiscite id better rememberi was in houston for a while half of what went on never made the papers in the usa let alone in quebec i bet granville mcdougald paused he looked very unhappy i dont want to think about how much trouble sitting on the whole confederacy would be those people purely hate us no two ways about it but if we dont occupy them and control them well have to fight em again in another twenty years and i sure as hell dont want to do that either so what youre telling me is were in trouble no matter what happens odoull said thanks a lot granny theres trouble and then theres trouble mcdougald said trouble is us occupying the confederate states trouble is the confederates occupying us if ive got a choice i know which one id take yeah me too odoull said heres hoping weve got a choice now why would you say something like that mcdougald inquired havent you got confidence in our brilliant leaders doesnt the fact that were fighting in pennsylvania mean victorys right around the corner thats what im afraid of odoull answered the only trouble is whose victory are you talking about mcdougald laughed for all the world as if they were sitting in a saloon telling jokes the fate of nations who could get excited about the fate of nations if the beer was cold and the joint had a halfway decent freelunch spread the medic said if we were a little farther back of the line and we talked like this wed catch hell for defeatism you know yeah theyd yell at us odoull agreed but thats all theyd do if we talked like this on the confederate side of the line theyd probably shoot us yall are damnyankee sympathizers mcdougalds southern drawl wouldnt get him into espionage yall can have blindfolds i aint gonna waste good confederate tobacco on you thoughthats for damn sure a kentucky colonel youre not odoull said but then he thought about the warning that had come in confederate soldiers in us uniform were supposed to be operating behind us lines they were supposed to have good us accents too odoull had no idea if that was true or how you went about telling a disguised confederate from an average screwup he also wondered what to do if one of those confederates in us clothing came into the aid station then he wondered how the devil hed know scipio got more frightened every day nothing had changed in the terry since the sweep that would have swept out his family and him nothing had changed no but trouble was in the air something new was stirring and he didnt know what it was he came right out and asked jerry dover the manager at the huntsmans lodge just shrugged and said i havent heard anything do jesus scipio said them freedom party stalwarts they looks like they gwine kill all o we an you aint heard nothin if i had id tell you dover said this time i think youre flabbling over nothing aint you got no mo errands fo me to run aint you got no errands fo me an my whole fambly to run scipio paused then switched dialects to the one he hardly ever used mr dover please understand mei am a desperate man sir he had to be desperate to use his white mans voice it rocked dover the way it would have rocked any white in the csa biting his lip the restaurant manager muttered if id known you were that goddamn sharp i never wouldve sent you to savannah scipio wanted to laugh or possibly to scream jerry dover had worked alongside him for more than twenty years if that didnt give dover the chance to figure out what kind of brains he had scipio knew what the trouble was of course all that time hed talked like a nigger and an ignorant nigger at that perception clouded reality like so many whites dover had assumed anybody who sounded like an illiterate field hand had to be as ignorant and probably as stupid as a field hand of course there were holes in that line of thought dover had known all along that he could read and write and cipher set that against sounding like a buck from the congaree swamps though and it suddenly became small potatoes what was in that envelope i took there scipio pressed his advantage he didnt get one very often and knew he had to make the most of it something for the united states something for the freedom party something for a lady friend of yours perhaps even to himself he sounded smarter when he talked like a white man if that wasnt a measure of what living in the confederate states his whole life had done to him he didnt know what would be jerry dover turned red whatever it was its none of your damn beeswax he snapped the less you know about it the better off we both are have you got that he made sense no matter how much scipio wished he didnt if they arrested scipio instead of just hauling him off to a camp he couldnt tell them what he didnt know of course he could tell them dovers name at which point theyd start tearing into the restaurant manager and how would he stand up to the third degree scipio almost looked forward to finding out if dovers ruin didnt so surely involve his own he would have somethin else you better keep in mind dover said wasnt for me youd be dead wasnt for me youd be in wherever niggers go when they clean out part of the terry instead youre still walkin around augusta and you dont seem any too goddamn grateful for it if walking around augusta involved anything even approaching freedomlowercase f mind youi would be grateful scipio said but this is only a slightly more spacious prison i dont ask for much mr dover i could accept living as i did before the war began it was imperfect but i know it was as much as i could reasonably expect from this country what i have now siri do believe a preacher would call it hell hed hoped his passionand his accentwould impress the white man maybe they even did but dover said all i got to tell you is you dont know what youre talking about you go on about a preacher you ought to get down on bended knee and thank god you dont know what youre talking about where scipio had rocked him before now he shook the black man he sounded as if he knew exactly what he was talking about mr dover if what you say is true then my family and i have even more urgent reasons to leave augusta immediately bullshit dover said scipio blinked as if hed never heard the word before bullshit dover repeated what the hell makes you think things are better anywhere else for crying out loud scipio bit down on that like a man breaking a tooth on a cherry pit in his piece of pie do jesus he exclaimed startled for a moment back into his usual way of talking hed always thought of augusta as an aberration a disaster if it wasnt jesus aint got nothin to do with it jerry dover said brutally dont be dumber than you can help all right if you reckon youre the only one in the world with troubles what does that make you besides a damn fool i mean do jesus scipio said again softly this time what am i gonna do he wasnt asking the question of the restaurant manager he wasnt asking god either he was asking himself and he had no more answers than either god or dover did dover thought he had one get your ass out there do your job and keep your head down had scipio been alone in the world that might even have sufficed as things were he shook his head i got a wife mistuh dover i got chilluns he couldnt talk like a white man now that would have hurt too much i wants dem chilluns to do bettern i ever done how kin dey do dat likely tell dey dont even git to grow up tears filled his eyes and his voice dover looked down at his desk i dont know what you want me to do about it hep me scipio burst out you gots to hep me git me outa here how where the restaurant manager demanded you reckon i got some magic carpet thatll fly you to mexico or the usa if you do give me some of whatever youre drinking on account of i want to get goofy too scipio looked wildly around him the walls of dovers office seemed to be closing in except it wasnt the office alone you know somethin mistuh dover he said this whole countrythis whole goddamn countryaint nothing but a prison camp fo black folks yeah well i cant do nothin about that neither jerry dover said all i can do is run this place here and if you arent out there waiting tables in five minutes i start having trouble doing that no suh scipio said and dover blinked whites in the csa seldom met outright refusal from negroes scipio went on reckon you do moren dat reckon you never woulda sent me to savannah you didnt do moren dat he still didnt know why the white man had sent him there he didnt care either that hed gone gave him a weapon you got to hep me you got to hep my chilluns i already have dover said quietly scipio grimaced that was true dover went on you want me to do more than i can do you want me to do more than anybody can do i cant make you turn white thats what you really want out of me isnt it he made scipio grimace again even when times were relatively good for blacks in the csa skin lighteners and hair straightenersa lot of them especially the lighteners only quack nostrumssold briskly the worse times got the better they sold too these days anyone who could possibly pass for white was doing it scipios own skin was far too dark even to let him think about it bathsheba was lighter but not light enough neither were antoinette and cassius they were all irredeemably marked as what they were damn you mistuh dover scipio said dully im sorry hell i am sorry i didnt want things to turn out like this jerry dover said im no goddamn freedom party goon you know that but i cant stick my neck out too far either not unless i want it chopped scipio tried to hate him try as he would he couldnt dover wasnt as big a man as he might have been but plenty were smaller too and not all of them were white dover didnt even use his advantage in color and class to order scipio out of his office he just waited scipio could tell no hope was to be had here he left by himself taking orders in the restaurant bringing them back to the kitchen and carrying food out again felt strangely surreal the prosperous white men and their sleek companions treated him as they always would have like a servant they talked as if he werent there had he been a us spy he could have learned some interesting things about railroad repairs and industrial bottlenecks he could have picked up some pointers on barrel deployment from an officer tryingthe wrong way in scipios viewto impress a really beautiful brunette he kept waiting to hear word about the terry about yet another cleanout hed been doing that ever since the night when the angel of death thanks to jerry dover passed over his family and him but the whites in the huntsmans lodge never talked about things like that maybe they didnt want to think about them while they were eating venison or duck in orange sauce and drinking fancy french wine or maybe they werent quite so oblivious to the colored staff as they let on it was probably some of each scipio wouldnt have wanted to think about sending people off to camps while he was enjoying a fine meal either and while whites in the csa often pretended to ignore negroes they knew they couldnt really afford to do it very often they would pay and pay high if they did he got through the evening he clocked out of the huntsmans lodge and walked through augustas dark silent streetsthe city remained under blackout even if no yankee bombers had ever appeared overheadtoward the terry it was like going back to jailwith the barbed wire all around just like that halt called one of the policemen and stalwarts at the gate advance and be recognized slow and easy or you never get another chance they were jumpy tonight scipio didnt like that it was too likely a harbinger of trouble aint nobody but me he said what would the ruffians have done if hed used his white mans voice with them shot him probably for not being what they expected as things were they laughed its the old spook in the boiled shirt one of them said the gate creaked as they opened it go on through they didnt even ask for his passbook whatever the shape of the trouble they were flabbling about it wasnt his the terrys streets were even quieter than those of the white part of augusta scipio imagined he heard ghosts moaning along them but it was only the breeze or was it with more than half the negroes scooped out of the place and carried off to a fate unknown but unlikely to be good ghosts were bound to be wandering the streets where so many real people no longer went his apartment was dark bathsheba had got a couple of kerosene lamps after the electricity was cut off but kerosene was hard to come by these days too they used it only when they had to he navigated with the confidence of a man who knew where everything was whether he could see it or not his wife had left his nightshirt out for him on a chair by the bed he sighed with relief at escaping the tuxedo sleep dissolved night terrors breakfast was bread and jam cassius and antoinette were already up when scipio rose his son said pa we got to fight the ofays we dont fight em reckon they go an kill us all we do fight de buckra reckon dey kills all o we anyways scipio answered leastways we gets to hit back cassius said yond cassius has a lean and hungry lookhe thinks too much such men are dangerous having watched the brutal collapse of the congaree socialist republic scipio knew black uprisings against whites in the csa had no hope he looked around was there hope anywhere else in the terry not that he could see all he said was be careful son be careful as you kin cassius face lit with a terrible joy the joy of a man who had nothing left to lose midnight was the traditional time for the knock on the door had the police come then cincinnatus driver would have greeted them with the boltaction tredegar hed hidden under a floorboard in the front room but they caught up with him in the middle of the afternoon and found him on the street armed only with a cane there were four of them three were older than cincinnatus the fourth who must have been a cadet or a pup or whatever they called it couldnt have been above sixteen but he carried a while the regular cops sported two submachine guns and a shotgun they didnt come into the colored part of covington without being ready for trouble they started to walk on past cincinnatus then one of the geezershe wore a bushy mustache that had been red once but was almost all white nowpaused and said youre cincinnatus driver aint you cincinnatus thought hard about denying it but if he did theyd ask him for his passbook and that would prove hed lied the truth seemed a better bet yes suh he said and waited to see what happened next hes on the list the cadet exclaimed his voice breaking he sure as hell is the cop with the mustache agreed cincinnatus didnt like the sound of that as usual in the csa what a negro liked or didnt like didnt matter the cop gestured with his submachine gun youre gonna come along with us what for cincinnatus yelped i aint done nothin he didnt think he had done anything they could prove hadnt they grabbed him once and let him go the whitemustached cop chuckled buddy if i had a dime for every asshole i nabbed who hadnt done anything i couldve quit workin a hell of a long time ago now you can come along quietlike or you can come along some other way but youre gonna come so whatll it be one cane against all that firepower made ridiculous odds and the policemen were pros the oldtimers didnt come close enough to let cincinnatus lash out even if hed been crazy enough to do it when the kid started to one of them pulled him back and explained how hed almost been a damn fool ill come quiet cincinnatus said smart fellow the mustachioed cop said he turned to the cadet hes smartern you are newt hows that make you feel by the look on newts face it made him want to cry a blue jay scolded cincinnatus and the policemen for having the nerve to walk under the oak tree where it perched a little kid playing in his front yard stared at them eyes enormous in his dark face so did a drunk draped over a front porch cincinnatus happened to know the drunk reported to lucullus wood he feared that wouldnt help him when the gate closed behind him and he passed out of the barbedwire perimeter around the colored quarter that small latch click had a dreadfully final sound a police car waited just beyond the gate the policeman with the mustache took cincinnatus cane away when he got into the back seat then got in beside him ill give it back when we get to the station he said in the tones of a man just doing his job dont want you trying anything silly though know how to get what you want i reckon cincinnatus said the cop laughed when they got to the station they didnt tell cincinnatus what he was charged with he feared that was a bad sign they stuck him in a cell by himself none of the other cells close by had anybody in it so he had no one to talk to he feared that was a bad sign too but they let him keep the cane maybe they knew how much trouble he had getting around without it police though werent in the habit of showing white prisoners consideration let alone blacks sitting on the edge of the cotthe only place he could sit except for the concrete floorhe scratched his head a guard who must have been called back from retirement brought him supper on a tray two cheese sandwiches on coarse brownish bread and a big cup of water cincinnatus shoved the empty tray and cup out into the hall and went back to the cot the guard nodded when he came back to pick up the tray you know the drill all right reckon you been in the joint before not for anything i did cincinnatus said likely tell thats what they all say bending made the guard swear under his breath goddamn rheumatism cincinnatus had never expected to sympathize with a screw but he had aches and pains too whatever his thoughts the guard never knew them the white man would have taken sympathy as weakness show weakness in a place like this and you were even worse off than you were already which wasnt good he waited for them to come and start squeezing him for whatever they thought he knew no matter what they did he couldnt tell them much about luther bliss he had no idea where the us secret policeman was staying or even if he was still in covington if they started asking him about lucullus though he could do lucullus a lot of harm he didnt want to but he knew the best will in the world wouldnt always stand up against enough pain they left him in there they fed him the food was a long way from good but he didnt go hungry they took out the honey bucket twice a day it was just jail it didnt feel as if they were softening him up for anything drastic they could easily have done much worse maybe they thought they were lulling him he didnt mind he would take whatever he could get boredom wasnt much but it beat the hell out of brutality if he yawned if he pacedwell so what he could have bled he could have spat out teeth hed heard of things they could do with a motorcar battery and some wires that made his stomach turn over compared to any of that boredom was a walk in the park on a sunny spring day it had to end and when it did it was even worse than hed feared police didnt come for him instead the man at the head of three guards who carried submachine guns was a jackbooted confederate major with a face like a clenched fist youre cincinnatus driver he barked yes suh cincinnatus admitted apprehensively damnfool notion letting niggers have last names the officer muttered cincinnatus kept his mouth shut it wouldnt do him any goodhe was all too sure of thatbut it wouldnt harm him either anything he said might have the major glowered at him the mans mouth got even tighter cincinnatus hadnt thought it could one of the guards had a key he opened the cell door come on the major said get out get moving cincinnatus obeyedwhat choice did he have where you takin me he asked they couldnt get too angry at him for wanting to know that didnt mean they would tell him shut up the major said youre coming along with me he looked as if he would sooner have scraped cincinnatus off the soles of those highly polished boots than had anything more personal to do with him cincinnatus wasnt all that eager to have anything to do with the major either the white man however had a choice as usual cincinnatus got none they marched him down the corridor to the front desk the confederate officer signed whatever paperwork he had to sign to take cincinnatus farther than that then he and two of the guards took cincinnatus out of the city jail altogether the third one the one with the key stayed behind they bundled him into a motorcar and took him up to the docks on the ohio another auto pulled up beside his to his surprise his father got out of that one seneca driver had his own contingent of guards whats goin on son he asked beats me cincinnatus answered shut up both of you the major said into the boat he pointed it was a smallish motorboat with at the moment a red cross flag draped across what had to be a machinegun mount up near the bow awkwardly cincinnatus obeyed then he helped his father into the boat though the older man was probably sprier than he was the engine roared to life the motorboat arrowed across the river to the cincinnati side more guards waited at a pier there one of them condescended to give cincinnatus a hand as he struggled out of the boat thank you suh he said softly shut up no talking the major had strong opinions and what seemed to be a onetrack mind he pointed to a waiting motorcar painted cs butternut get in soldiers stood near the motorcar the automatic rifles they carried made the submachine guns hed seen before seem childrens toys by comparison their expressions said they would just as soon shoot him as look at him he got into the auto one of them got in beside him dont fuck with me sambo the confederate said casually or youll never find out how the serial down at the bijou turns out i aint done nothin cincinnatus said i aint gonna do nothin neither the soldier only grunted he didnt believe a word of it another heavily armed man sat in the front seat next to the driver away went the motorcar cincinnatus looked out the window cincinnati had taken more battle damage than covington the people on the streets looked shabby and unhappy he never saw confederate soldiers in parties smaller than four that told him a lot about what the occupied thought of their occupiers can i look out the back window suh without you shootin me he asked the soldier after considering the man nodded hand me your stick first he said move slow and careful dont get cute or youll be sorrybut not for long cincinnatus obeyed in every particular he saw what hed hoped to see another motorcar full of soldiers right behind this one with any luck at all that one also held his father he swung around so he was sitting straight ahead again thank you kindly suh huh the confederate soldier said and then looks like were here here was the cincinnati city jail cincinnatus wondered if hed just traded one cell for another nobody told him to get out of the auto though in fact three more motorcars joined the ones he and his father were in the procession headed west and north through occupied ohio most of the countryside looked normal as if war had never touched it here and there usually around towns were patches of devastation you could see where us soldiers had stood and fought and where theyd been outflanked outmaneuvered and forced from their positions the little convoy passed through checkpoint after checkpoint at one of them a soldier put something on the wireless aerial to cincinnatus auto he couldnt see what it was he asked permission to look back at the motorcar behind him again the soldier with the automatic rifle looked disgusted but nodded he didnt get any less alert he also showed no sign of needing to take a leak though theyd been traveling for quite a while cincinnatus didnt know how much longer he could go on before asking for a stop he didnt know if hed get one though even if he asked a white flag flew from the other autos aerial he supposed his motorcar carried the same flag of truce but when he asked about it the soldier stared through him and said shut up he didnt argue with an armed man just before he had to ask for a stopand just after theyd rolled through a small town called oxfordthe convoy halted on its own where the hell are they the driver grumbled theyll be here said the other man in the front seat aint like we never done this before sure enough five minutes later another convoy of motorcars approached from the west those also had white flags on their wireless antennas they were painted greengray not butternut the soldier next to cincinnatus nudged him with the muzzle of his rifle get out he obeyed the soldier passed him his cane his father left the auto behind him three skinny white men who needed shaves emerged from the other motorcars along with us soldiers five whites got out of the greengray autos cincinnatus dour major went up to confer with a us officer who might have been his longlost twin they signed some papers for each other the cs major turned back you are exchanged he shouted to cincinnatus and the others youre the damnyankees worry now far as im concerned theyre welcome to you go ongit do jesus cincinnatus whispered as he limped forward into us custody that cop in covington hadnt lied to him after all do jesus he looked back to his father come on pa i think were goin home sergeant michael pound had a new barrel considering what had happened to the old one that was anything but a surprise but this wasnt a new barrel of the same old style us engineers had rapidly figured out they needed to do something about the fearsome new machine the confederates had introduced their answer was not everything it might have been but a damn sight better than no change at all the chassis hadnt changed much the engine was of similar design to the old one but put out an extra fifty horsepower that was all to the good because the new barrel was heavier and needed the extra muscle to shove it around almost all the weight gain came from the new turret it was bigger than the old one its armor was thicker and better sloped and it had been upgunned instead of a mm gunan inch and a half to a gunnerit now carried a mm piecea little less than two and a half inches that still didnt match the threeinch monster the new confederate barrels used but it was big enough to make any enemy barrel say uncle where you had to be damn good or damn lucky to hurt the new cs machine with the mm cannon and the mm gun was absolutely the biggest one that would fit on the turret ring of the old chassis a new improved body took a lot longer to turn out than a reworked turret the confederates must have been planning their mark while the mark was just starting production the usa hadnt done that and so instead of a proper mark the united states had to make do with mark more or less ugly beast pound said laying a hand on its armored flank he didnt see how anybody could argue with that the new turret went with the old chassis about the way a rhinos head went with a cows body everything on the confederates new barrels fit together with everything else they had a grim functional beauty the mark was just grim well sergeant featherstons fuckers will think its ugly too especially after it bites them a few times that was cecil bergman pounds new loader he was a skinny little guy which helped him do his jobeven though the new turret was bigger on the outside it had even less room within than the old one thats a fact the new gun will make them sit up and take notice about time too pound said maybe we have a chance of holding them out of pittsburgh now maybe he sounded anything but convinced he sounded that way because he was unconvinced the us army hadnt been able to stop the latest confederate push any more than it had been able to stop the confederate drive up through ohio the summer before if you couldnt stop the enemy how the devil were you supposed to win the war pound saw no way he could have elaborated on the many failings of the us war department but bergman hissed at him and jerked a thumb off to the left here comes the lieutenant he warned second lieutenant don griffiths was typical of the breed he was young he didnt know much and one of the things he didnt know was how much he didnt know he had blond hair and freckles and couldnt possibly have bought a drink without proving to the bartender that he was over twentyone sergeant pound and pfc bergman saluted him he returned the gesture men we have our orders he said he sounded full of enthusiasm it was too early in the morning for pound to feel enthusiasm or much of anything else except a deep longing for another cup of coffee but griffiths stood there waiting expectantly so pound did what he was supposed to do he asked what are they sir we are going to drive the enemy out of pennsylvania the lieutenant said grandly what all by ourselves pound said don griffiths wagged a finger in his face ive heard about you sergeantdont think i havent he said you havent got the right attitude probably not sir pound agreed politely i do object to being killed for no good reason dont get smart with me either griffiths voice didnt break the way the late lieutenant poffenbergers had but he still sounded like a kid ill bust you down to private faster than you can say jack robinson go ahead sir pound answered politely still ill never get rich on army pay no matter what my rank is and if im a private again ill get out from under you besides how likely is either one of us to live through the war why should i get excited about whether my sleeve has stripes on it lieutenant griffiths gaped at him the gold bar griffiths wore on each shoulder strap was the only thing he had going for him he couldnt imagine anybody who didnt care about rank in fact pound did very much but the best way to hang on to what he had and be able to mouth off the way he wanted to was to pretend indifference you are insubordinate griffiths spluttered not me sir bergman is my witness pound said have i been disrespectful have i been discourteous have i been disobedient he knew he hadnt he could be much more annoying when he stayed within the rules griffiths proved it by spinning on his heel and storming away pfc bergman chuckled nervously hes gonna get you in dutch sarge bergman predicted what can he do to me throw me in the stockade pound laughed at the idea i hope he does ill be warm and safe in a nice cell back of the line three square meals a day while hes stuck up here with unfriendly strangers trying to shoot his ass off the worst thing he could do to me is leave me right where i am bergman shook his head worst he could do is bust you and leave you where youre at pound grunted that unfortunately was true he didnt think lieutenant griffiths had the imagination to see it if hed had that kind of imagination he would have been a real officer not a lowly shavetail pound proved right the next time griffiths had anything to do with him the barrel commander pretended their last exchange hadnt happened pound played along he watched the way griffiths eyed him like a man watching a bear that might or might not be ready to charge their barrel moved out the next morning several platoons of the new machines rumbled north and west from the classically named town of tarentum tarentum lay northeast of pittsburgh the barrels wanted to knock in the head of the confederate column sweeping past the industrial center another enemy column was pushing up from the southwest if they met they would put pittsburgh in a pocket that had happened to columbus the summer before if the confederates brought it off here they could smash up the us defenders in the pocket at their leisure pittsburgh was the most important iron and steel town in the united states if it fell how could the country go on with the war if it fell would the country have the heart to go on with the war those were interesting questions michael pound hoped heand the usadidnt find out the answers to them this is pretty good barrel country sir he remarked to lieutenant griffiths after theyd been rolling along for a while it is griffiths sounded suspicious as if he feared pound was pulling his leg i thought you wanted wideopen spaces for barrels not all these trees and houses and other obstructions anyone who used a word like obstructions in a sentence was bound to have other things wrong with him too you do sir if youre on the attack pound said patiently but if you want to defend if the enemys coming at you having enough cover to shoot from ambush is nice oh the lieutenant weighed that yes i see what you mean im glad sir now pound soundedand wasdead serious because the point of the whole business is to kill the other guys and not get killed ourselves thats the long and short of it griffiths didnt disagree with him the young officer opened the cupola and stood up in the turret to see what he could see pound just got glimpses through the gunsightwhich was also improved from the one in the earlier turret the confederates hadnt got here yet so the landscape wasnt too badly battered that didnt mean he would have wanted to live here even if no one had ever heard of war coal mines tailings from coal mineshed heard the locals call the stuff red dogand factories dealing with coal and steel and aluminum dotted the landscape some of the factories belched white or gray or black or yellowish smoke into the sky even though the enemy was only a few miles away they were going to keep operating till the confederates overran them michael pound scowled when they shut down all the workers would try to get away at once hed seen that before theyd clog the roads us troops would have trouble going around them or through them and the confederates would have a high old time bombing them and shooting them from the air not five minutes after that thought crossed his mind the barrel slowed and then stopped lieutenant griffiths shouted from the cupola you people clear the road at once at once i tell you youre impeding the war effort pound wouldnt have moved for anybody who told him he was impeding anything this crowd didnt either and they paid for not moving no asskickers screamed down out of the sky to pummel them but they were in range of confederate artillery so were the advancing us barrels that didnt worry pound very muchexcept for the rare unlucky direct hit longrange bombardment wouldnt hurt them he did tug on griffiths trouser leg and call better get down sir fragments arent healthy oh right the lieutenant even remembered to close the cupola hatch after himself he was faintly green or more than faintly my god he gulped what shellfire does to civilians out in the open its a slaughterhouse out there yes sir pound said as gently as he could ive seen it before hed got glimpses through the gunsight here too and was glad hed had no more than glimpses shrapnel clattered off the sides and front of the barrel there were times when sitting in a thick armored box wasnt so bad even if it was too damn hot and nobody in there with you had bathed anytime lately griffiths spoke to the driver over the intercom if you can go forward without smashing people do it the barrel moved ahead in low gear pound didnt like to think about what it was running over so he resolutely didnt the lieutenant peered through the periscope a far cry from sticking your head out and looking around but nobody would have done that under this kind of shellfire well maybe irving morrell would have but officers like him didnt come along every day suddenly griffiths let out an indignant squawk what is it sir pound asked our men griffiths answered our soldiersretreating pound got a brief look at them too and liked none of what he saw wed better find an ambush position pretty quick then sir he said were going to have company griffiths didnt get it right away when he did he nodded a stone wall that hid the bottom half of the barrel wasnt perfect cover but it was a lot better than nothing have an ap round ready pound told bergman the loader tapped him on the leg to show hed heard theres one griffiths squeaked with excitement uh front i mean identified pound confirmed range six hundred yards he added armorpiercing bergman slammed the round into the breech with quick fussy precision pound lined up the sights on the target one of the newmodel cs barrels now to see what this new gun could do he nudged lieutenant griffiths ready sir fire griffiths said and the cannon spoke here in the turret the report wasnt too loud the empty casing leaped from the breech and clattered down onto the deck cordite fumes made pound cough but he whooped at the same time for fire spurted from the enemy barrel hit he shouted and griffiths with him the old gun wouldnt have pierced that armor at that range front griffiths said again more businesslike this time about ten oclock identified pound replied he scored another hit whatever the confederates wanted today they werent going to buy it cheap out of the line armstrong grimes knew only one thing besides relief resentment that hed have to go back when his regiments turn in reserve was up for the time being though nobody would be shooting at him he wouldnt be ducking screaming meemies he wouldnt wonder if the stranger in a greengray uniform was really a us soldier and worry that that unfamiliar face might belong to a mormon intent on cutting his throat or stabbing him in the back and then sneaking away he turned to sergeant rex stowe who tramped along beside him down what had been a highway and was now mostly shell holes aint this fun oh yeah now tell me another one stowe needed a shave his helmet was on crooked a cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth he looked like most of the other us soldiers trudging through the wreckage that had been provo anybody figure this fight would take so long when it started armstrong persisted weve been here forever and were still not in salt lake city he was no lovelier than his sergeant and had no doubt he smelled as bad too were doing it on the cheap yossel reisen complained we could end this mess in a hurry if wed put enough men and barrels and bombers into it write your congresswoman stowe saida joke that had grown old in the company but reisen answered ive done it aunt flora says the confederates and now canada are taking away what we need sergeant stowe didnt seem to know what to say to that neither did armstrong they both outranked yossel but when it came to clout armstrong had none and as far as he knew stowe didnt either yossel reisen on the other hand had all the clout in the worldand didnt want to use any of it if he had wanted to use it he would have been anywhere but here provo looked as if god had dropped a cigarette here and then ground it out with a hobnailed boot the city had fallen weeks ago but smoke still rose here and there the smell of death lingered too by the urgent insistence it took on every now and then some of the dead were a lot more recent than the fall of the town as armstrong and his buddies slogged south other soldiers came north they were cleaner and better barbered but their faded uniforms and hard watchful faces said this wasnt the first time they were heading up to the front whats new one of them called in armstrongs general direction you know about the fucking spigot mortar he replied sure do the soldier going the other way nodded kaboom they had that the last time i went up yeah but now theyve started loading the screaming meemies with mustard gas they can carry a lot of it too well shit the other soldier said bitterly if its not one goddamn thing its another if i have to put on that rubber gear the heatll kill me it was probably somewhere in the upper nineties that wasnt so dreadful as it would have been back in washington or philadelphia as people from out west never got tired of saying it was a dry heat that didnt mean it wasnt hot though and when you wore full antigas gear you cooked in your own juices who needed humidity then a little blond girl came out of the ruins to stare at armstrong she was about eight years old and would have been pretty if she werent scrawny and filthy and wearing what looked like a torn burlap bag for a dress the stony hatred on her face didnt help either jesus he wanted to make the sign of the cross to ward off that look and he wasnt even catholic shell shoot at us in the next goround and her kidll pick up a gun in the one after that we oughta just shoot all of these bastards and start over here stowe said treat em like the confederates treat their niggers then we could do this place right you think featherstons fuckers really are doing that shit armstrong said seems hard to believe youd better believe itits true yossel reisen said my aunt knows more about that stuff than she ever wanted to find out theyre filthy down there really filthy his aunt was likely to know if anybody did armstrong said still seems crazy to me why would anybody want to do that to somebody else just on account of what he looks like i mean ive got no use for niggers god knows but i dont want to kill em all he had no idea how many oversimplifications and unexamined ideas hed packed into that and was probably lucky he didnt people do it all the time yossel said youre not jewish thats for sure nope not me armstrong might have had more to say on the subject of jews too but not where his buddy could hear it you didnt do things like that life at the front was tough enough as is if you pissed off somebody who might save your ass one day soon you only made it worse a sign led to the trucks that would take them back to the r and r center at thistle before long theyd have to leave again but armstrong looked forward to getting clean getting deloused and eating real food and sleeping on a real mattress as happened too often in the army somebodyd screwed up there were far more soldiers than trucks to take them to thistle or anywhere else the men milled around waiting for something to happen a lot of army life was like that a captain climbed up on what was left of a brick wall and shouted that more trucks would be along in an hour or so the cheers he drew were distinctly sarcastic the catcalls on the other hand came from the heart the captain turned red and got down in a hurry armstrong didnt know what drew his eye to the woman who walked toward the crowd of soldiers maybe it was just that she was a woman most of the ones hed seen lately wore dungarees and carried rifles and wanted to kill him he returned the favor the best way he knew how this one had on a dress a baggy dress that reached almost to her ankles her face was pinched and pale maybe that was what kept armstrongs eye on hernot her good looks though she wasnt half bad but her absolute determination an alarm bell went off in his mind he nudged rex stowe sergeant somethings wrong with that broad he pointed yeah stowe didnt see it for a second then he did yeah he took a step toward her and started to take another one and the world exploded next thing armstrong knew he was on his back something that stung ran into his eyes he put up a hand and discovered it was blood he was bleeding from the leg too and from one arm he looked around yossel reisen somehow was still on his feet and didnt seem to be scratched sergeant stowe was down and moaning both hands pressed to a swelling scarlet stain on his belly she blew herself up the words seemed to come from a million miles away armstrong realized the bomb must have stunned his ears he hoped they werent ruined for good he scrambled to his feet closer to the womanwho wasnt there anymore of coursethe landscape was a surreal mess of bodies and body parts how many had she killed how many had she hurt armstrong watched a soldier pull a nail out of his arm he realized the woman hadnt just carried explosives shed had shrapnel too shed done what shed done on purpose and shed made sure she did as much damage as she could when she did it you all right yossels voice came from far far away too if im not ill worry about it later armstrong said weve got to do what we can for these poor mothers he bent beside rex stowe and gave him a shot of morphine he might have wasted it stowe was going gray he put a dressing on the noncoms wound but blood soaked through right away corpsman yossel reisen shouted but a dozen other soldiers were yelling the same thing and no medics seemed close by who would have thought trouble might strike here nobody would have nobody had and that was probably why it had happened here the men waiting for transport hadnt paid any attention to the mormon woman till too late yossel reisen slapped a bandage on armstrongs forehead thanks he said its all right yossel said absentlyhe had other things on his mind in disbelieving tones he went on she blew herself up she fucking blew herself up she fucking blew herself up on purpose she sure as shit did armstrong liked that no better than his buddy did how do you stop somebody who wants to make like a bomb i dont know i have no idea and i dont think anybody else does either yossel said who would have thought anybody could be that crazy mormons armstrong said the mormons had caused so much trouble for the usa and had notions so different from those of most americans that blaming things on them just because they were mormons came easy but even armstrong who was anything but reflective realized more than that went into it despite the heat he shivered a woman she waited till she could hurt the most soldiers and thenshe did they could pull shit like this anywhere yossel reisen said a new horror in his voice anywhere at all on a bus in a subway in a theater at a football gameanywhere theres a crowd if you hate enough and you want to hit back enough you just do fuck armstrong meant the word more as prayer than as curse he said the worst thing he could think of to follow it youre right men with red cross armbands did rush up then they got rex stowe on a stretcher and carried him away he was still breathing but armstrong didnt think hed live even if he did hed be out of the war for months probably for good bodies and pieces of bodies remained after all the wounded were taken away so did the butchershop stink of blood armstrong walked over to where the woman had been standing he found a torn and charred shoe that wasnt army issue but for that there was no sign shed ever existedexcept the carnage all around fuck he said again no less reverently than before a dozen us trucks painted army greengray rumbled up then the drivers stared in disbelief at the bloodsoaked scene what the hell happened here one of them said somebody threw a piece of broken brick at his truck it clanged off the hood you son of a bitch the soldier shouted if youd got here on time we wouldnt have been here when she did that another rock or brick banged off a different truck for a moment armstrong wondered if the soldiers whod survived the bomb would lynch the truck drivers they might have if a burly first sergeant hadnt said she was gonna do it anyways if it wasnt us it woulda been the next poor bunch of bastards what the fuck you gonna do he was so obviously rightand so largethat he threw cold water on the lynching bee an officer thought to set up a perimeter in case more mormons decided to blow themselves to kingdom come for their cause and then the unwounded and the walking wounded got on the trucks and headed down to thistle after all what the fuck are you gonna do armstrong thought like yossel he had no idea he hoped somebody did flora blackford had never warmed to the philadelphia cheese steak the only way they could have made it more treyf was to add ham and oysters she stuck with pastrami on rye robert taft probably wouldnt have minded if theyd added ham and oysters to his cheese steak those werent forbidden foods for him the old munich was near the damaged congressional building it had pretty good prices and air conditioning looking around flora didnt think she could assemble a quorum from the representatives and senators in the place but she didnt think she would miss by much either taft raised a schooner of beer heres to youmost of the time he said and sipped from it flora had a gin and tonic almost as good a cooler as the refrigerated air same to you she said we see eye to eye about the war anyhow seems that way taft made a very unhappy face maybe the president knew what he was doing when he tried to come to terms with the mormons maybe flora sounded unhappy too did taft know that woman had almost blown up her nephew instead of asking she went on would you be comfortable making peace with people who do things like that it depends taft said judiciously if peace meant they werent going to do them i might if every nut with a grievance is going to strap on some dynamite and start seeing how many honest people he can take with him weve really got a problem he drained the schooner the way things look now weve really got a problem flora remembered that she was about to answer the explosion outside beat her to the punch women screamed so did a couple of men flora didnt quite what came out insteada soft oh dear godwas close to a sob of despair taft jumped to his feet the cheese steak forgotten wed better see if we can do anything to help he said and hurried out of the old munich flora paused long enough to pay the check then ran after him a bus halfway down the block sprawled sideways across the road the crumpled shape was burning fiercely window glass glittered in the streets and on the sidewalk like outofseason snow some people were still trapped on the bus their shrieks dinned in floras ears one of them threw himself out a window he was on fire passersby tried to beat on the flames with their hats and with their hands he blew himself up shouted a man with blood rilling down his face the motherfucker blew himself up he had a a thing and he pushed it and he blew himself up he paused then spoke again in an amazingly calm voice somebody get me a doctor he folded up and passed out plenty of others were wounded flora couldnt tell whether some had been on the bus or were just luckless passersby others the burned had obviously been passengers along with the man with the thingsome sort of switch flora supposed she tore her handkerchief in half and made two bandages with it after that she used the tissues in her handbag on smaller cuts robert taft sacrificed his handkerchief and his tie then he took off his shirt and his undershirt and used a pocket knife to cut them into strips of cloth other people need them worse than i do he said and he wasnt the only barechested man around either good for you flora told him let me have some of those too please ambulances roared up sirens wailing philadelphia was good at responding to disasters and so it should have beenit had had enough practice somebody put a bomb on the bus asked a whitecoated man from an ambulance somebody was a bomb on the bus a woman answered the mans answer was eloquent heartfelt and altogether unprintable well taft said looks like we have the answer to my question and its not the one i wish we had he was splashed with blood past his elbows his trousers were bloodstained too but flora didnt think any of the gore was his she glanced down at herself the cotton print dress she had on would never be the same blood also dappled her arms what are we supposed to do she asked a question aimed more at the world at large than at senator taft how do we fight people wholl kill themselves to hurt us if we have to we taft broke off as if really hearing what hed been about to say he shook his head good lord i started to sound like jake featherston yes flora wanted to cry or to scream here for once the usa faced a knottier problem than the csa negroes looked like negroes mormons mormons looked and talked just like anybody else anybody here could be a mormon and could have another bomb waiting how would you know till it went off good lord taft said again were going to have to start searching people before we let them gather football games films trains buses department storesfor all i know well have to check anybody who goes into the old munich i was thinking how many members of congress were in there flora said shakily if that bomber had walked inside instead of blowing up the bus philadelphia was its usual hot muggy summer self that kind of weather wouldnt last much longer but it was still heresweat ran down floras face she shivered anyhow auto bombs are bad enough taft said people bombs like flora he seemed to run out of words he spread his bloody hands what could be worse what were they working on out in western washington something they thought might win the war whatever it was that all but guaranteed it would be a horror worse than any theyd known up till now worse than poison gas worse than the camps where the confederates were systematically doing away with their negroes she had trouble imagining such a thing that didnt mean the people out in washington state had any trouble though while horror swelled inside her rage seemed to fill taft this is no fit way to fight the senator from ohio ground out if they want to meet us like men thats one thing if they want to see how many innocent civilians they can blow up they used it against soldiers first flora said remembering yossels narrow escape again and we drop bombs on civilians all over the csa its just that who would have expected people to be weapons instead of using weapons well the genies out of the bottle now taft said grimly nobody in the world is safe from here on out nobody do you hear me there isnt a king or a president or a prime minister somebody doesnt hate a man comes up to you in a reception line maybe you didnt appoint him postmaster maybe he just hears voices in his head you reach out to shake his hand next thing you know youre both dead and a dozen people around you too how do you stop something like that flora only shrugged helplessly for thousands of years war had been based on the notion that you wanted to hurt the other side without getting hurt yourself now the rules had shifted under everybodys feet how could you stop someone who embraced death instead of fleeing it fresh dread filled her when she thought about how useful a weapon like this might be surely the united states could find men willing to die for their country if you sent them after jake featherston and you got him werent you doing more to win the war than you would by smashing a division or two of ordinary soldiers but the confederates would have targets of their own i might even be one flora thought and ice walked up her back again like it or not it was true nobody in the usa had spoken out more ferociously than she had about what the confederate states and the freedom party were doing to their negroes how many more of these bombs will we see in the next week in the next month in the next year taft asked weve never known anything like this before never that canadian who kept blowing up american soldiers after the last war the one who tried to blow up general custerhe finally blew himself up but he didnt want to if hed been like these mormons he could have gone to a rally and done even worse he suddenly laughed which made flora stare what could possibly be funny about this she demanded id like to see featherstons face when he hears about it robert taft answered he knows how many people mm dont love him shall we say hes the one wholl really have reason to be shaking in his boots sic semper tyrannis by godthus always to tyrants if your latins rusty it was flora hadnt even thought about those classes in close to forty years at the time she hadnt thought they were good for anything it wasnt as if she were likely to train for the catholic priesthood looking back though theyd probably improved her english and looking back that had probably been the point it sure hadnt occurred to her then what taft said made a certain amount of sense what he said often did people who had or should have had bad consciences would worry more about menor womenwith bombs than others would and yet the mormons are using them against us she said bleakly yes but the mormons are a pack of crazy fanatics taft said but that wouldnt do and he realized it wouldnt i see what youre saying i wish i didnt to them we look like the tyrants thats what i was thinking flora agreed a lot of its like beautyits in the eye of the beholder god help us taft said omayn flora said or amen if youd rather that doesnt matter to me one way or the other taft said flora believed him whatever else he was he was no antisemite he sadly shook his head what are we going to do i cant begin to tell you and i wish i could flora answered we might have a better chance now if wed done something different a lifetime ago but its a little late to worry about that now yesjust a little taft said we have this pack of people who hate us right there in the middle of the country and the most we can hope for as far as i can see is that they do us as little harm as we can manage taft absently wiped his high forehead with the heel of his hand and left a red streak on his skin this has gone on for too long flora said if we dont settle it once and for all during the war we have to try afterwards that sounded good but what did it mean she listened to her own words with the same sick horror taft had known before her what could settling it once and for all during the war mean but killing all the mormons if the united states did that they wouldnt have to worry about it afterwardsexcept when the country looked at itself in a mirror flora shuddered all the carnage around her hadnt nauseated her the way that thought did dear god in heaven she whispered theres a little bit of jake featherston in me too a little bit of that bastards in every one of us taft said the point of the exercise is not to let him out well senator weve found one more thing we agree on flora held out her bloodstained hand taft clasped it in his xiv the telephone on clarence potters desk rang he picked it up potter here he said crisply hello potter there jake featherston rasped in his ear i need you to be potter here fast as you can so get your ass on over right now on my way sir potter hung up he grabbed his hat closed and locked the office door behind him and went upstairs to get a motorcar from the war department to the gray house on shockoe hill shouldnt have taken more than five minutes in fact it took more like fifteen the us air raid the night before had cratered several streets on the most direct routes sorry sir the driver kept saying as he had to double back potter suspected the president would make him sorry too but he didnt take it out on the luckless young soldier behind the wheel when he arrived he hopped out of the birmingham showed his id to the guards at the entrance to the battered confederate presidential residence and was escorted below ground to the enormous bomb shelter in which jake featherston operated these days new york city had skyscrapers potter wondered how long it would be before men built twenty thirty even fifty stories underground to keep from getting blown up when bombers came overhead he laughed that wouldnt work in new orleans where the cemeteries were on top of the ground because of the high water table such details and anomalies aside the picture seemed scarily probable saul goldman sat in the waiting room potter nodded to the director of communications am i after you in line he asked i dont think so general goldman answered i think we go in together do we potter kept his voice as neutral as he could goldman was good at making propaganda but the intelligence officer didnt want to be part of any propaganda no matter how good hed had that argument with the president before he hadnt completely lost it which only went to show how good his case was featherstons secretary stuck her head into the room come with me gentlemen goldman caught potters eye and nodded sure enough they were an entry like and a at the racetrack when potter came into the presidents sanctum featherston fixed him with a fishy stare and barked took you long enough what did you dowalk sorry sir bomb damage potter had been braced for worse and featherston let him off the hook after that which also surprised him we need to get down to brass tacks the president said youve both heard about these people bombs up in the usamormons strapping on explosives and blowing themselves to hell and gone as soon as they can take a raft of damnyankees with em yes mr president saul goldman said potter nodded goldman went on weve been working on ways to play them upto show the yankees are so low and evil people will kill themselves before they live under them that sounded like a good line to take to potter but jake featherston shook his head i was afraid you were gonna do somethin like that he said heavily thats how come i called you in hereto tell you not to no way nohow not a word about em out of us and jam the yankees hard as you can when they talk about em you got that i hear you sir but i dont understand goldman looked and sounded pained clarence potter didnt blame him had he been in the communications directors shoes he would have been pained too but featherston repeated not a word goddammit and ill tell you why he went on i dont want the damn niggers to hear anything about people bombs you hear me not one fucking word coons are enough trouble as is you dont reckon some of those bastardsd blow themselves to the moon if they could take a raft of decent white folks with em i sure do but saul goldman began even starting the protest took nerve not many people had the nerve to squawk to featherstons face here though potter agreed with the president im sorry mr goldman but i think hes right he said wed better keep the lid on that one for as long as we can because the niggers will make us sorry if we dont damn straight featherston said the director of communications still looked unhappy since youve made up your mind sir thats the way well do it he plainly thought the president was wrong to have made up his mind that way jake featherston just as plainly didnt care make sure you do and pick up the jamming on the damnyankees too we will be sorrywell be sorry as hellif we cant keep this quiet ill do my best mr president if youll excuse me the little jew left the presidents office very abruptly as soon as the door clicked shut behind goldman jake featherston let out a long sigh i dont like making saul do like i tell him instead of like he wants to hes goodhes damn good you need to give a man like that his head this time though i just dont reckon ive got much choice potter nodded i think youre right mr president i said so yeah you did featherston eyed him youre not one to do something like that just to make me wag my tail either remembering the weight of the pistol in his pocket as he rode the train up to richmond in potter nodded again no sir whatever else i am im no yesman son of a bitch i never wouldve known if you hadnt told me maybe jake featherston was remembering that pistol too he drummed his fingers on top of his desk got a question for you mr straight answer go ahead potter said those fucking mormon people bombsdid any of your men give em the idea or did they come up with it all by themselves mr president our people did not have thing one to do with that potter said positively nobody in the csano white man in the csa anyhowis that crazy the mormons came up with it on their own all right i believe you but if i ever find out youre lying to me about this one ill have your head featherston said people bombs hurt the damnyankees yeah but they can hurt us a lot worse and you know as well as i do that saul wont be able to clamp down on the news forever one way or another this kind of shit always comes out i knew that sir i wasnt sure you did potter answered people who werent in the intelligence business often had an exaggerated notion of how easy keeping a secret was jake featherston laughed at him i never went to a fancy us college general but i reckon i may know a thing or two anyways thats not what i meant mr president clarence potter said stiffly featherston laughed some more yeah likely tell but amusement didnt live long on his face it never did not that potter had seen the president of the csa always had to be angry at something or worried about something and today he had something to be angry and worried about damn niggers are gonna start blowin themselves up sure as hell they are damfino how much we can do about it either massive reprisals potter suggested kill ten coons for every white a people bomb blows up or twenty or a hundred that wont stop em featherston predicted morosely therell always be some bastards who think who gives a damn what happens after im dead and the ones who go after us without counting the cost are the ones weve got to be afraid of he knew what he was talking about the freedom party had always gone after its foes without counting the cost whether those foes were whigs and radical liberals negroes or the united states potter said yes sir youre rightwell still have trouble even if we do that but i think well have less well make some niggers think twice before they turn into people bombs and well make the niggers who dont want to blow themselves up think twice before they help or cover up for the ones who do theyd better anyhow if they know theyre going to get shot after a people bomb goes off it could be featherston picked up a pencil and wrote himself a note its a better scheme than anybody else has come up with ill say that whatever else you are general you arent soft on niggers i should hope not sir potter said thats how we first met remember i was trying to head off the red uprising before it got started i was after that officers body servant pompey his name was jake featherston said at once potter wouldnt have remembered the negros name if theyd set him on fire featherston had a truly marvelous memory for detailand never forgot an enemy or a slight he went on he was a mincing prissy little bastard thought his shit didnt stink just what youd expect from a stinking blueblood like jeb stuart iii to have for a servant he looked as if he wanted to spit on the carpet or possibly start chewing it and he wasnt wrong during the great war and even afterward the confederate states had had too many sons and grandsons and greatgrandsons of founding fathers in positions of authority for no better reason than that their ancestors had done big things it wasnt like that anymore nathan bedford forrest iii notwithstanding forrest was there because of what he could do not because of what greatgrandpa the cavalry general had done the freedom party had swept away most of the juniors and iiis and ivs and that potter was willing to admit needed doing featherston let the pencil fall all right general thats about it looks like main reason i wanted you here was to find out if those damn people bombs were your notion but you gave me a good idea and i reckon well try it out when the time comesand it will goddammit i thank you for that potter got to his feet youre welcome mr president were on the same side in this fight in this one yeah how about some of the others but featherston waved that aside never mind get out of here a man in a state department uniform went in as potter went out potter wondered what that was all about he knew he could learn with a little poking and prodding he also knew hed catch merry hell if anybody found out he was doing it you didnt try to find out what was none of your business that was one of the rules in this game too there were often good reasons why it was none of your business after the air conditioning under the gray house ordinary richmond late summer seemed twice as hot and muggy as usual a haze of dust and smoke hung over the confederate capital a souvenir of yankee bombing raids the same sort of haze was said to hang over philadelphia will anything be left of either side when this war is over potter wondered more and more it reminded him of a duel of submachine guns at two paces both countries could strike better than they could defend he didnt know what to do about that he didnt think anyone else did either maybe taking pittsburgh away from the damnyankees really would knock them out of the fight it had a chance of doing that anyway potter couldnt think of anything else that did a truck dumped gravel and asphalt on the street in front of the gray house a heavy mechanized roller started smashing it down into a more or less level surface and it would stay level till the next time us bombers visited richmond or the time after that or perhaps the time after that the machine was more interesting to clarence potter than the job it was doing not long before a swarm of negroes with hand tools would have done work like that no more machinery was much more common than it had been and there werent so many negroes around potter nodded to himself both halves of that suited him fine hipolito rodriguez awkwardly sewed a sergeantsno a troop leadersstripes onto the left sleeve of his gray tunic the letter that came with his promotion notice said it was for contributions valuable to the safety and security of the confederate states of america that left the guards at camp determination who hadnt been promoted both puzzled and jealous it also gave the noncoms whose ranks hed suddenly joined something new to think about tom porter whod been rodriguezs squad leader till he got the promotion added two and two and got four this has to do with those new buildings going up alongside the mens and womens half doesnt it he said i think maybe it does si rodriguez answered he was still getting used to the luxury of the noncoms quarters he had a room of his own now with a closet and a sink no more cot in the middle of a barracks with a lot of other noisy smelly guards no more shoving everything he owned into a footlocker either he had more room to be a person as a troop leader he wasnt just one more cog on a gear in a vast machine i know you helped give the commandant the idea for those new buildings porter said if they work out as well as everybody hopes i reckon youve earned your stripes porters acceptance helped ease the transition from ordinary guard to troop leader it meant the other noncoms made it plain they would back rodriguez if he ran into trouble with that going for him he didnt or never more than he could handle by himself and those buildings rapidly neared completion nobody ever called them anything but that if you talked about one of them it was that building the guards knew what they were for theyd been briefed they had to be by the nature of things but also by the nature of things they didnt call them by their right names if you didnt name something you didnt have to dwell on what it really was and really did not thinking about those things helped you sleep at night a few of the guards men whod come to camp determination as it went up would sometimes talk about shooting negroes in the swamps of louisiana they were mostly matteroffact but they would also talk about comrades who couldnt stand the strain soandso ate his gun they would say that was how rodriguez learned jeff pinkards new wife was a dead guards widow hed known she was married before two boys made that obvious the details poor son a bitch just couldnt take it a guard said sympathetically he shoot himself too rodriguez asked with a certain horrid fascination nope the veteran guard shook his head chick mustve got sick of guns he ran a hose from his auto exhaust into the passenger compartment and fired up the motor sure as hell wish wedve had those trucks back then you dont have to worry so much about what youre doing when you load one of them the trucks they came after this fellow kill himself rodriguez said thats right the guard who was talking didnt see anything out of the ordinary about that maybe there was nothing out of the ordinary to see to rodriguez the timing seemed interesting anyhow senor jeff was good at getting ideas from things that happened around him rodriguez almost remarked on that then he thought better of it he couldnt prove a thing after alland he couldnt unsay something once hed said it better to keep his mouth shut and keeping his mouth shut proved a good idea as it usually did a few days later an officer tapped him for special duty saying the commandant tells me you wont screw this up no matter what is that a fact he sent rodriguez a fishy stare i hope so sir rodriguez answered he recognized that stare hed seen it before on white confederates they looked at him saw a mexican and figured he wasnt good for much he asked what do i got to do well were going to test out one of those buildings the officer answered were going to pick about a hundred niggers and run em through it oh yes sir i do that dont you worry rodriguez said his confidence seemed to relieve the officer all right the man said he drummed the fingers of his left hand against the side of his leg his right sleeve was pinned up short as his right arm ended just below the shoulderhe too came out of the confederate veterans brigade he went on this has to go good mind you we got bigwigs from richmond comin out to watch the show rodriguez shrugged maybe it go good maybe it go wrong i dunno all i know is it dont go wrong on account of me the other man considered that he finally nodded fair enough make sure all the ordinary guards youre in charge of feel the same way si senor i do that rodriguez promised because they were trying things out for the first timeand because bigwigs from richmond were watchingthey used far more guards than they normally would have to deal with a hundred black men they got the negroes formed up in a tenbyten square the inmates carried whatever small chattels they intended to take away to the new camp where they thought they were going that was part of the plan as long as they thought they were going somewhere else they would stay docile they wouldnt cause trouble unless they figured they were going on a oneway trip the onearmed officer worked hard to keep them unsuspecting you men we want yall to be clean and tidy when we ship you out of camp determination were going to get you that way before you leave youre gonna take baths youre gonna be deloused no horseplay or we will make your black asses sorry yall got that yes suh the negroes chorused black heads bobbed up and down the negroes didnt think anything was wrong they were dirty most if not all were lousy they probably wanted to get clean and they could see why the men who ran the camp would want them to be that way before they left oh yeseverything made perfect sense to them but it made a different kind of sense to the guards and their superiors come on then the onearmed officer said keep in formation now or youll catch it the negroes had no trouble obeying they often marched here and there through the camp in formation guards opened the barbedwire gate separating the main camp from that building in the negroes went two guards waited in an antechamber one of them said strip naked and stow your stuff here everybody remember who put what where you get in a fight over what belongs to who youll be sorry you got that again the negroes nodded so did hipolito rodriguez watching as the black men shed their rags and set down their sorry bundles this was a very nice touch it convinced the prisoners theyd come back the large contingent of guards was hardly necessary a handful of men could have done the job but rodriguez understood why jefferson pinkard had assigned so many men to the prisoners the more ready for trouble you were the less likely you were to find it and with visiting firemen watching you couldnt afford it a sign on the wall above an onwardpointing arrow said delousing ahead the negroes who could read went that way without hesitation most of the others followed move along move along the guards said and chivvied the rest of the men into the room at the end of the corridor it could hold a lot more than a hundred peoplebut this was after all only a test even here the deception continued a doorway was set into the far wall a sign above it said to the baths at the officers nod rodriguez shut the door through which the negroes had gone in that door didnt match the rest of the scene it was thick and made of steel and had rubber gasketing all around the edge to make an airtight seal rodriguez spun the wheel in the center of the doors back making sure it fit snugly against the frame and locking it in place above the wheel a small window with rounded corners let him look into the chamber hed just sealed off more rubber gasketing inside and out made sure what was inside that chamber would stay there other windows were set into the chambers walls they too were protected with rubber inside and out guards took their places at some of them higherranking camp officials and the delegation from richmond already stood by the rest they wanted to see how this building worked out near the center of the chamber stood half a dozen steel columns painted the same gray as the walls the bottom two or three feet of them were not solid metal but a grillwork too fine to poke a finger through the naked negroes in there milled about some of them went up to one column or another a man rapped on a column with his knuckles rodriguez heard the dull clang he knew exactly when guards up above the ceiling poured the cyclone into the columns all the negroes sprang away from them as if theyd become redhot men started falling almost at once not all of them fell right away though some ran for the doorway marked to the baths they pounded on it butwhat a surprise it didnt open and some ran back to the door through which theyd come desperate dying fists battered against the steel an agonized face looked out at rodriguez with only glass and the gasketing between them startled he took a step away from the door the negro shouted something rodriguez couldnt make out what he said his words were drowned in the chorus of yells and screams that dinned inside the chamber as the insecticide took hold the black mans face slid down and away from the window the frantic pounding on the door eased one by one the shouts and screams faded and stopped rodriguez looked in again a few of the huddled bodies in the chamber still moved feebly but only a few after fifteen or twenty minutes they all lay still a bell rang several heavy ceiling fans came on he could feel their vibration through his feet they sucked the poisoned air out of the chamber after about ten more minutes another bell chimed now the door marked to the baths openedfrom the outside guards went in and carried corpses out to the waiting trucks rodriguez nodded to himself this would work those hundred black men hadnt come close to filling the chamber of course this was only a practice run now that they knew things really went about the way theyd expected they could load in a lot more mallates load them in take them out load in the next batch you could use ordinary trucks to haul away the bodies now too and you could pack them much tighter with dead men than you could with live ones yes the scheme would definitely do what it was supposed to attention the onearmed officer called automatically rodriguez stood stiff and straight here came jefferson pinkard with one of the men from richmond a burly fellow with a tough square jowly face rodriguez recognized him right way it was the attorney general don fernando koenig the biggest man in the freedom party except for jake featherston himself no wonder everything had to go just right today pinkard and the attorney general stopped sir this heres my buddy hip rodriguez the camp commandant said he helped give me the notion for this whole setup well good for him and good for you too pinkard this is all firstrate work and ill say so to the president koenig stuck out his hand in rodriguezs direction freedom dazedly rodriguez shook it freedom senor then koenig clapped him on the backman to man not superior to inferior were going to have freedom from these damn niggers arent we and youve helped youve helped a lot yes sir rodriguez said thank you sir koenig and pinkard went on their way the rest of the guards stared at rodriguez in awe jake featherston had been in pennsylvania before during the great war the army of northern virginia had pushed up almost to within shelling distance of philadelphia that almost counted for everything if the de facto capital of the usa had fallen along with washington would the enemy have been able to go on with the fight no way to know now but a lot of people in the csa doubted it as things were jake had survived the grinding retreat through pennsylvania and maryland and back into virginia hed survived defeat and hoped for victory now he was within shelling distance of pittsburgh in the western part of pennsylvania confederate s boomed in their gun pits sending shells south toward the yankee defenders and the factories and steel mills they fought to hold he wanted to take off his uniform shirt and serve one of those s himself hed done that before too over in virginia his bodyguards were more nervous now than they had been then sir if we can shell the damnyankees from here they can reach us here too one of them said what do we do then reckon we jump in a hole just like the gunners jake pointed to the foxholes a few feet away from each yes but the bodyguard began no no buts featherston said firmly chances are im safer here than i am back in richmond and thats the gods truth the guard looked at him as if hed lost his mind the man was young brave and good at what he did he also had all the imagination of a cherrystone clam most of the time the lack didnt affect the way he did his job even a dimes worth every once in a while sir you dont know what youre talking about his voice couldnt have been any stiffer if hed starched and ironed it hell i dont jake said difference is here i know where the enemys at i know what he can do and i know what i can do about it he pointed to the foxholes again in richmond any goddamn son of a bitch could be kitted out with explosives if hes got the balls to blow himself up along with me how you gonna stop him all his bodyguards looked very unhappy featherston didnt blame them he was very unhappy about people bombs himself a man willingno eagerto die so he could also kill made a very nasty foe war and bodyguarding both assumed the enemy wanted to live just as much as you did if he didnt give a damn if he didnt give a damn then what would stop a rational soldier or assassin wouldnt matter a hill of beans to him that seemed more obvious to the president of the csa than it did to his guards they didnt want to admit even to themselves that the rules had changed this one said mr president theres no evidence anyone in the csa has thought of doing anything like that jake featherston laughed in his face evidence first evidencell be when somebody damn well does blow himself up its coming sure as shit its coming i wish like hell we could stop it but i dont see how we cant jam all the us wireless stationstoo many of em and they cant hardly talk about anything else fucking mormons he shook his head in disgust good thing there arent hardly any of them in our country the bodyguard said proving hed missed the point if he were smarter if he were able to think straighter he probably wouldnt want to be a bodyguard you couldnt get all hot and bothered because people werent the way you wanted them to be oh you could but a whole fat lot of good it would do you taking them as they were worked better will this fellow see it if i spell it out in small simple words jake wondered the decision got made for him he knew what that rumbling rushing sound in the air was incoming he shouted and was proud his yell came only a split second after the first artillerymans he sprang for the foxholes and was down in one before the first shells landed the men who fought the s were just as fast or even faster some of his bodyguards though remained above ground and upright when shells burst not far away they didnt know any betterthey werent combat troops here ignorance was expensive get in a hole goddammit he yelled some of the artillerymen were shouting the same thing and the bodyguards who hadnt been hit did dive for cover only a few seconds slower than they should have but a barrage was a time when seconds mattered till things let up jake couldnt do anything if he came out of his foxhole he was asking to get torn up himself he wasnt afraid hed proved that beyond any possible doubt in the last war but he knew too well the csa needed him that kept him where he was till the us bombardment moved elsewhere that bombardment wasnt anything that warned of an attack it was just harassing fire to make the confederates keep their heads down and to wound a few men during the great war jake had fired plenty of shells with the same thing in mind if he wasnt the first one out of a foxhole when the shelling eased he couldnt have been later than the third fuck he said softly you forgot what artillery could do to a man till you saw it with your own eyes one of his guards lay there gutted and beheadedexcept the reality which included smell was a hundred times worse and only a tenth as neat as the words suggested another bodyguard lay hunched over on his side clutching his ankle with both hands he had no foot he was doing his best to keep from bleeding to death jake bent beside him hang on beau he said far more gently than he usually spoke ill make you a tourniquet his bootsthe same sort hed worn in the field in the last warhad strong rawhide laces he pulled one out fast as he could easy there i got to move your hands so i can tie this son of a bitch thank you sir beau sounded preternaturally calm some wounded men didnt really feel it for a little while he seemed to be one of the lucky ones though he hissed when the president of the csa tightened the tourniquet around his ragged stump jake used a stick to twist it so the stream of blood slowed to the tiniest trickle hed tended to battlefield wounds before his hands still remembered how as long as he didnt think about it too much morphine he yelled somebody give this poor bastard a shot and where the hell are the medics the men with red cross smocks were already there taking charge of other injured guards one of them knelt by beau the medic injected the bodyguard then blinked to find himself face to face with jake featherston you did good uh sir he said he ought to make it if everything heals up all right hear that beau jake said he says youre gonna be fine the medic hadnt quite said that but jake didnt care he wanted to make the bodyguard as happy as he could fine beau said vaguely maybe that was shock or maybe it was the morphine hitting him the medics got him onto a stretcher and carried him away jake wondered what kind of job he could do that didnt require moving around the president shrugged beau would be a while getting better if he did the head of the bodyguard contingent came up with fire in his eye hed got his trousers muddy jake judged that accounted for at least part of his bad temper when the man spoke he did his best to stay restrained sir can we please move to a safer location you see what almost happened to you here jake shook his head not to me by god i know what to do when shells start coming down im sorry as hell some of your men didnt and if a shell had landed in your hole mr president the bodyguard asked it didnt dammit jake said the guard chief just looked at him jake swore under his breath the man was right and he knew it admitting somebody else was right and he himself wrong was the hardest thing in the world for him he didnt do it now not in so many words he just scowled at the bodyguard i reckon ive seen what i came to see thank you sir the man saluted he called to the other guards who hadnt been hurt we can get him away now they all showed as much relief as a drummer who finds out his latest lady friend isnt in a family way after all and they hustled jake back from the gun pit with olympic speed he thought it was funny the guards thought it was anything but one of them scolded him sir did you want to get yourself killed if hed asked whether jake wanted to get the guards killed the president would have gone up in smoke but that wasnt what hed wanted to know and so jake featherston only sighed no i wanted to watch the damnyankees catch it well youve done that and now youve seen we can catch it too the bodyguard said will you kindly leave well enough alone sure featherston said and all the bodyguards brightened then he added till the next time it needs doing their shoulders slumped we really shouldnt be anywhere close to the line the guards leader said damnyankee airplanes are liable to drop bombs on our heads even less we can do about that than we can about artillery dammit jake laughed raucously jesus h christ dont the damnyankees come over richmond about every other night and drop everything but the fucking kitchen sink on our heads bastardsd drop that too if they reckoned itd blow up some of the bodyguards smiled their chief remained severe sir youve got a proper shelter there not a ahole in the ground he slapped at the knees of his trousers not much mud came away he fumed he didnt like to get dirty hell of a lot of good a proper shelter did al smith jake said that made all the guards unhappy again they didnt like remembering all the things that could go wrong jake didnt like remembering those things either but he would do it if he could score points off men who liked it even less the guard chief changed the subject at least a little sir couldnt you just stay somewhere safe and follow the war with reports and things no way in hell jake replied at once no placed stay safe for long soon as the yankees found out where i was at theyd send bombers after me i dont care if i went to habanatheyd still send em but thats beside the point point is you cant trust reports all the goddamn time sometimes youve got to yeah you cant keep up with everything by your lonesome but if you dont get your ass out there and see for yourself every so often peoplell start lying to you you wont know any better either cause you havent been out to look and then youre screwed got it yes sir the bodyguard said mournfully he knew what that meant it meant he and his men would have to keep worrying because jake would go on sticking his nose where the damnyankees could shoot it off airplanes droned by overhead jake looked for the closest hole in the ground so did most of the guards they werent combat troops no but a trip to the field taught lessons in a hurry the airplanes flew from west to east they had familiar silhouettes jake relaxedthey were on his side none of the bodyguards relaxed they werent supposed to not while they were on duty their leader said mr president can we please take you someplace where youre not in quite so much danger gonna fly me to the empire of brazil jake quipped a few guards gave him another round of dutiful smiles most stayed somber he supposed that was just as well like sheep dogs they had to be serious about protecting him trouble was he made a pisspoor sheep sometimes sam carsten thought the navy didnt know what to do with the josephus daniels other times he was sure of it after the destroyer escort had threaded its way out through the minefields in delaware bay once more he turned to pete cooley and said i swear to god theyre trying to sink us i really do i think well be all right sir the exec said we will as long as confederate airplanes dont spot us anyhow yeah sam said as long as his ship was ordered to strike at the csa us flying boats and other aircraft constantly patrolled the united states coastal waters if there was intelligence to say the confederates didnt do the same thing he hadnt seen it mission seems simple enough cooley said we start heading in as soon as night falls land the raiders pick em up and get the hell out of there he sounded elaborately unconcerned sam snorted one of these days pat somebody needs to explain the difference between simple and easy to you i know the difference cooley said with a grin an easy girl puts out right away a simple girls just dumb so youve got to snow her before she puts out all right dammit in spite of himself sam laughed the exec wouldnt take things seriously maybe that was as well too just so we dont get spotted and our navigation better be spoton too ill get us there sir cooley promised as with shiphandling sam was learning to use sextant and chronometer to know where the ship was and where it was going he thought it was the hardest thing hed ever tried to pick up the navy had tables that made it a lot easier than it was in the days of iron men and wooden ships but easier and easy didnt mean the same thing either sorrowfully sam said this is the first time in a million years i wish id paid more attention in school youre doing real well sir for a two words too late pat cooley broke off he tried again youre doing real well for a mustang he hadnt quite swallowed enough of that or maybe it had been for a dumb mustang taking sunsights and then trying to convert them to positions sure as hell made sam feel like a dumb mustang he painfully remembered the time when hed screwed up his longitude six ways from sunday and put the josephus daniels halfway between philadelphia and pittsburgh the only thing the exec said then was well the infantry could use the fire support sam thought that showed commendable restraint for now he swung the destroyer escort well out into the north atlantic before steaming south he figured that was his best chance to get where he was going undetected he didnt know that it was a good chance but good and best also werent always synonyms the ocean wasnt nearly so rough as it would be when winter clapped down but it wasnt smooth either sailors and marine raiders spent a lot of time at the rail sam might not have been much of a navigator he might not have been the shiphandler he wished he were he mighthe wouldburn if the sun looked at him sideways but by god he had a sailors stomach some of the youngsters in the officers mess and some of the marine officers who dined with them looked distinctly green sam tore into the roast beef with fine appetite be thankful the chows as good as it is he said when were on a long patrol or going around the horn its all canned stuff and beans after a while excuse me sir lieutenant thad walters said the yrange operator bolted from the mess with a hand clapped over his mouth carsten hoped the jg got to a head before he wasted the cooks best efforts lieutenant cooley brought the josephus daniels about miles off the north carolina coast just as the sun was sinking in flames in the direction of the confederacy were as ready as well ever be sir the exec said fair enough sam nodded all ahead full then course all ahead full course cooley echoed aye aye sir he called the order for full power down to the engine room the ship picked up speed till she was going flat out sam wished for the extra ten knots she could have put on if she were a real destroyer of course they never would have dropped a mustang on his first command into a real destroyer he knew damn well he was lucky to get anything fancier than a garbage scow lieutenant walters seemed to have got rid of what ailed him the yrange operator was still a little pale but kept close watch on his set if the ship could spot an enemy airplane before the enemy spotted her she would have a better chance of getting away the darker it got the happier sam grew he didnt think the confederates had aircraft with yranging gear he sure hoped they didnt keep an eye peeled for any sign of torpedo boats too he warned a fish were not expecting will screw us as bad as a bomb yes sir walters said and then aye aye sir were doing everything we know how to do sam thought nowis it enough the josephus daniels ran on through the night listening to her engines pound sam felt she was yelling here i am to the world if she was the world stayed deaf and blind every so often lieutenant walters looked over at him and shrugged or gave a thumbsup cpo bevacqua on the hydrophone kept hearing nothing too shortly before the commander of the marine detachment came onto the bridge about an hour away eh captain he said thats right major sam answered mike murphy outranked himexcept that nobody on a ship outranked her skipper murphy understood that fortunately he was a black irishman with eyes as blue as a siamese catsbluer than sams which took doing carsten went on your men are ready ready as theyll ever be murphy pointed into the darkness theyre by the boats and theyll be in em in nothing flat he snapped his fingers good enough sam said and hoped it would be not quite an hour later the shape of the western horizon changed it had been as smooth and flat there as in any other direction no more that deeper blackness was land the coast of the confederate states of america here we are sir pat cooley said if thats not ocracoke island dead ahead my career just hit a mine and sank so did mine sam thought the navy department might blame an exec whod been conning a ship for botched navigation the navy department would without the tiniest fragment of doubt blame that ships skipper and so it should the destroyer escort was his ship this was his responsibility nothing on gods green earth this side of death or disabling injury could take it off his shoulders send a petty officer forward with a lead and a sounding line sam said an order more often heard in the riverboat navy than on the atlantic but he didnt want the josephus daniels running aground and she drew a lot more water than any river monitor she needed some water under her keel cooley nodded and obeyed feet thudded on the deck sir weve spotted a light about half a mile south of here a sailor exclaimed looks like its what we want it wouldnt be the ocracoke lighthouse at the southwestern tip of the island that had gone dark at the beginning of the war if you didnt already know where you were in these waters the confederates didnt want you here major murphy quivered like a hunting hound id best join my men i think he said and left the bridge very pretty navigation pat sam said bring us in a little closer and well lower the boats and turn the marines loose aye aye sir cooley said and then to the engine room all ahead one third the josephus daniels crept southwest after a breathless little while sam said all stop the executive officer relayed the order the ship bobbed in the water sam sent a sailor to major murphy to let him know everything was ready murphy had no doubt figured that out for himself but the forms needed to be observed lines creaking in the davits the boats went down to the ocean for this raid theyd been fitted with motors one by one they chugged toward the shore that was only a low darker line in the night north carolina barrier islands were nothing but glorified sandbanks every time a hurricane tore through it rearranged the landscape pretty drastically sometimes after a hurricane tore through not much landscapeor landwas left in its path confederates at that station are going to think a hurricane hit em sam murmured he didnt know hed spoken aloud till pat cooley nodded and said hell yesuh sir grinning sam set a hand on his shoulder dont worry about it pat were on the same page gunfire crackled across the water sam tensed if something had gone wrong if the bastards in butternut somehow knew the marines were coming in that case the destroyer escorts guns would have to do some talking of their own the wireless operator looked up sir major murphy says everythings under control sure enough the gunfire died away sam had nothing to do but wait he drummed his fingers on the metalwork in front of him waiting was always a big part of military life right this minute it was also a hard part there we go pat cooley pointed fire rose from the station yeah there we go all right sam agreed other question is did the confederates get off an alarm call before we finished overrunning the place he shrugged well well find out not very much later sailors peering over the starboard rail called boats coming back sam almost said something like stand by to repel boarders he wondered when the skipper of a ship this size last issued an order like that but these boarders were on his sideor theyd damned well better be raising boats was harder than lowering them he had nets out against the sides of the ship for the marines and their prisonershe hoped theyd have prisonersto climb if the crew couldnt do it but they managed he went down to the deck and met major murphy there everything go well he asked well enough captain the marine officer answered we lost one man dead and we have several wounded we brought back the groans on deck would have told sam that if murphy hadnt the marine went on but we destroyed that station and weve brought back prisoners to question and samples of confederate yranging gear for the fellows with thick glasses and slide rules to look at what they do with the stuff is up to them but we got it we did our job sounds good sam said now my job is to make sure we deliver the goods is everybody back aboard ship i think so major murphy said an indignant confederate came up to them are you the captain of this vessel he demanded of sam i must protest thisthis act of piracy he sounded like an angry rabbit go ahead and protest all you please pal sam said genially and you can call me long john silver too major murphy and several nearby marines spluttered sam went to the rail to make sure no boats or marines were unaccounted for satisfied he hurried back up to the bridge are we ready to leave town sir pat cooley asked and then some sam said make our course all ahead full all ahead full cooley echoed and passed the order to the engine room course is he sounded slightly questioning to let sam change his mind without losing face if he wanted to but sam didnt want to yes pat he said i really do want to head southeast because thats the last direction the confederates will look for us once we get away we can swing wide and come back but i figure most of the searchll be to the north and i want to get away from landbased air the best way i know how so cooley nodded aye aye sir it is the josephus daniels steamed away from the north carolina coast at her sedate top speed brigadier general irving morrell did not like getting pushed around by the confederates theyd done it in ohio and now they were doing it in pennsylvania they had the machines they needed to go forward he didnt have as many machines as he needed to stop them it was as simple as that men well how much did men count in this new mechanized age the united states had more of them than the confederate states did the question was so what a nervouslooking pow stood in front of morrell in the other mans beatup boots morrell would have been nervous too he said name rank and pay number an interpreter turned the question into spanish a torrent of that language came back the interpreter said his name is jose maria castillo he is a senior privatewe would say a pfc his pay number is thanks morrell studied senior private castillo the prisoner from the empire of mexico was mediumsized skinny swarthy with mournful black eyes and a big bushy mustache like the ones a lot of confederate soldiers had worn during the great war his mustardyellow uniform would have given good camouflage in the deserts on mexicos northern border here in western pennsylvania it stood out much more morrell said ask him what unit hes in and what their orders were more spanish the pow didnt have to answer that did he know he didnt have to morrell wasnt about to tell him and he answered willingly enough he says hes with the veracruz division sir the interpreter reported he says thats the best one mexico has their orders are to take places the confederates havent been able to capture are they morrell carefully didnt smile at that he suspected any number of confederate officers would have had apoplexy if they heard the mexican prisoner if the veracruz division was the best one francisco jose had the emperor of mexico would have been well advised not to take on anything tougher than a belligerent chipmunk the men all had rifles but they were woefully short on machine guns artillery barrels and motorized transport the soldiers seemed brave enough but sending them up against a modern army wouldnt have been far from murderif that modern army hadnt been so busy in so many other places the prisoner spoke without being asked anything he sounded anxious he sounded frankly scared out of his wits morrell had a hard time blaming him surrender was a chancy enough business even when two sides used the same language as us and cs soldiers did wouldbe pows sometimes turned into casualties when their captors either wanted revenge for something that had happened to them or just lacked the time to deal with prisoners if a captive knew no english he likely thinks well eat him for supper morrell thought not without sympathy sure enough the interpreter said he wants to know what were going to do with him sir tell him nobodys going to hurt him morrell said the interpreter did jose castillo crossed himself and gabbled out what had to be thanks every once in a while war made morrell remember what a filthy business it was that a man should be grateful for not getting killed out of hand roughly morrell went on tell him hell be taken away from the fighting tell him hell be fed if he needs a doctor hell get one tell him we follow geneva convention rules if that means anything to him the prisoner seized his hand and kissed it that horrified him getting captured had in essence turned a man into a dog he gestured the interpreter led jose castillo away morrell wiped his hand on his trouser leg dont blame you sir one of his guards said god only knows what kind of germs that damn spics got germs were the last thing on morrells mind he just wanted to wipe away the touch of the desperate mans lips if he couldnt feel them anymore maybe he could forget them he needed to forget them if he was going to do his job hes out of the fighting now he said hes luckier than a lot of people i can think of well yeah sir since you put it that way the guard said hes luckiern me for instance he grinned to show morrell not to take him too seriously but morrell knew he was kidding on the square only a few hard cases really liked war most men endured it and tried to come through in one piece from everything morrell had heard jake featherston was part of the small minority whod enjoyed himself in the field morrell couldnt have sworn that was so but he wouldnt have been surprised who but a man who enjoyed war would have loosed another one on a countrytwo countriesthat didnt that guard shifted his feet trying to draw morrells attention morrell nodded to him the soldier asked sir is it true that the confederates are inside pittsburgh i think so wally morrell answered thats what it sounds like from the situation reports ive been getting anyhow son of a bitch wally said it isnt what we had in mind when this whole mess started morrell allowed what the usa had had in mind was a victory parade through the ruined streets of richmond preferably with jake featherstons head on a platter carried along at the front richmond was close to the border which didnt mean the united states had got there they hadnt in the war of secession or the great war either so what are we gonna do wally askeda thoroughly reasonable question how come we dont just pitch into em because if we do wed probably lose right now morrell said unhappily we dont have enough men or materiel yet were getting there though i hope as a matter of fact things could have been worse the confederates had been planning to surround pittsburgh instead of swarming into it but us counterattacks hadnt let them do that now they had to clear the americans from a big city house by house and factory by factory that wouldnt come easy or cheap again morrell hoped it wouldnt anyhow hed been screaming at every superior in pennsylvania to let him concentrate before he counterattacked hed been screaming at philadelphia to get him enough barrels so hed have a legitimate chance of getting somewhere when he finally did he was sure hed made himself vastly unpopular he couldnt have cared less what could they do to him dismiss him from the army if they did he would thank them take off the uniform and go back to agnes and mildred outside of fort leavenworth whatever happened to the country after that happened whatever it was it wouldnt be his fault before long he discovered they could do something worse than dismissing him they could ignore him they could and they did his requests for more barrels and more artillery fell on deaf ears since they wouldnt dismiss him he sent a telegram of resignation to the war department and waited to see what came of that he didnt want them to accept it he thought he could hit the confederates harder than anyone they could put in his slot but if they thought otherwise he wasnt going to beg them to let him stay maybe they would give his replacement the tools they were denying him if someone else got the weapons he wasnt getting that made him less indispensable than he thought himself now no answering telegram came back instead less than twentyfour hours later colonel john abell showed up on his doorstep no brigadier general abell he had stars on his shoulder straps now congratulations morrell told the general staff officer more or less sincerely thank you abell answered for some reason im considered an expert on the care and feeding of one irving morrell and sohere i am here you are morrell agreed in friendly tones nice weather were having isnt it as a matter of fact it looks like rain abell saidand it did he gave morrell a severe look it was like being haunted by the ghost of an overstrict schoolteacher see here generalhow dare you threaten to resign when the country is in crisis after all these years weve been banging heads you still dont know how i work morrell wasnt friendly anymore how can you care for me and feed me if you dont know where i live or what i eat i wasnt threatening anything or anybody ive just had enough of being asked to do the impossible if you put someone else here maybe youll support him the way you should you are the recognized expert on barrel tacticsrecognized by the confederates as well as your own side abell spoke the words as if they tasted bad to him they probably did he said them anyhow he did have a certain chilly integrity confederate recognition i could do without morrell said as if in sympathy his shoulder twinged the enemy wanted him deadhim personally that was why he tolerated wally and the other bodyguards he didnt want he knew too well the confederates might try again anger rising in his voice he went on and if the war department thinks im so goddamn wonderful and brilliant and all that why do i have to send a letter of resignation to get it to remember im alive that is not the case i assure you john abell said stiffly yeah and then you wake up morrell jeered now tell me another one one ill believe we are trying to meet your needs general if abell was angry he didnt show it he was very good at not showing what he thought please remember though this is not the only area where we are having difficulties difficulties my ass the confederates are in pittsburgh theyre going to tear hell out of it whether they keep it or not thats not a difficultythats a fucking calamity tell me im wrong i dare you i doubledare you morrell felt like an eightyearold trying to pick a fight if we destroy the confederate army causing the devastation in pittsburgh that devastation may become worthwhile abell said morrell clapped a hand to his forehead if he was going to be melodramatic hed do it in spades christ on his cross abell what do you think im trying to do he howled why wont philadelphia let me you will agree the cost of failure is high abell said you make sure i fail if you dont support me morrell said is that what youve got in mind no of course not if we didnt want you here we would have put someone else in this place abell said we had someone else in this place before you recovered from your wound if youll remember oh yes you sure did morrell rolled his eyes and my illustrious predecessor scattered barrels all over the landscape too he aimed to support the infantry with them perfect war department tactics from john abell turned red in the last war the war department had thought of barrels as nothing more than infantrysupport weapons george custer and morrell had had to go behind philadelphias back to mass them the war department would have stripped custer of his barrels if it found out what he was up totill he proved his way worked much better than its thats not fair abell said once his blush subsided we did put you here to set things right and you cant say we didnt all right fine morrell took a deep breath if thats what you want ill try to give it to you let me have the tools i need to do my job stand back and get out of my way and let me do it too and if you dont now abells voice was silky with menace morrell laughed at him thats obvious isnt it if i make a hash of it youve got a scapegoat things went wrong because general morrell fucked up that nogood bungling son of a bitch tell every paper in the country its my fault i wont say boo if i have what i need here and i cant do what needs doing i deserve it youll get whats coming to you the general staff officer said and if you dont deliver once you get it youll really get whats coming to you im glad you think it seems fair because it will happen whether you think so or not deal morrell stuck out his hand john abell looked surprised but he shook it the other sailor tossed five bucks into the pot call he said tenhigh straight george enos jr laid down his cards oh for christs sake the other sailor couldnt have sounded more disgusted if he tried for a week george understood when he threw down his own hand he held an eighthigh straight got him by a cunt hair george fremont dalby said as george scooped up the cash it was a nice chunk of change theyd gone back and forth several times before the call losing would have hurt it wouldnt have left george broke or anythinghe had better sense than to gamble that hardbut it would have hurt dalby scooped up the cards and started to shuffle my deal i think yeah george wiped sweat from his forehead with his sleeve the compartment where they played was hot and airless a bare bulb in an iron cage overhead gave the only light the door said stores on the outside but the chamber was empty the sailors sat on the graypainted deck and redistributed the wealth fremont dalby passed george the cards here cut george took some cards from the middle of the deck and stuck them on the bottom dalby laughed whorehouse cut eh all right you bastard i had my royal flush all stacked and ready to deal and now you went and fucked me some pal you are sorry george said in tones suggesting he was anything but as the cpo dealt george asked ever see a real royal flush in an honest game nope and ive been playing poker for a hell of a long time dalby answered i saw a jackhigh straight flush once that was a humdinger of a hand too on account of it beat four queens but i knew the people and they werent dealing off the bottom of the deck or anything nobody else in the game admitted to seeing a royal flush either george looked at his cards none of them appeared to have been introduced to any of the others this wasnt a jackhigh straight flush it was jackhigh garbage he almost threw it away but hed won the last hand so he stayed in and asked for four cards that left him with a pair of jacks when dalby called for jacks or better to open he put in a dollar the hand got raised twice before it came back to him he tossed it in with no regret except for the vanished dollar fremont dalby ended up taking it with three kings george had just started to shuffle when the klaxons called men to battle stations everyone paused just long enough to scoop up the money in front of him to be continued somebody said as the poker game broke up and so no doubt it would be it seemed as unending as any movie serial his feet clanged on the deck as he ran for the nearest stairway dalby was older and rounder but stayed with him all the way they got to their antiaircraft gun at the same time along with the townsend three other destroyers surrounded the trenton the escort carriers fighters buzzed high overhead kauai lay somewhere to the southeast they were out tweaking the japs again much as francis drake had singed the beard of the king of spain like king philip the japs were liable to singe back is this real or a drill enos dalby said i got five bucks says its a drill the odds favored him they had many more drills than real alerts still in these waters youre on george said they shook to seal the bet now hear this now hear this the intercom blared aircraft from the trenton are attacking a japanese carrier the japs are sure to try to return the favor if they can be ready it is expected that the trenton will be their main target but we want to remind them that we love them too theres a fin you owe me george said happily thatll buy one of the boys some shoes my ass fremont dalby said his voice sour itll buy you a couple of shots and a blowjob from a chinese whore on hotel street when we get back to pearl since he was probably right george didnt argue with him he just said well thats a damn sight better than nothing too the gun crew laughed even the cpos lips twitched they waited before too long the executive officer said yranging gear reports inbound aircraft they arent ours were going to have company in about fifteen minutes roll out the welcome mat for our guests boys five minutes later he came back on the loudspeakers trentons aircraft report that that jap carrier is on fire and dead in the water score one for the good guys cheers rang out up and down the townsends main deck and probably everywhere else on the ship too the crew had faced savage air attacks more than once getting their own back felt wonderful those jap pilots are liable to know they cant go home again dalby warned that means theyll give it everything theyve got when they hit us knock em down as quick as you can so they dont crash into the ship or something knocking down airplanes was hard enough without any extra pressure to do it fast george just shrugged unless somebody got hurt all he had to do was make sure the gun had enough ammo to keep shooting what happened after that was dalbys responsibility not his the yrange antenna swung round and round george and everybody else up on deck peered northwest the direction from which trouble had so often come before the townsend picked up speed she would want to do as much dodging as she could george glanced over toward the trenton the carrier couldnt pick up a lot of speed her engines wouldnt let her there they are somebody yelled george swore softly those were jap airplanes all right their silhouettes might have been more familiar to him than those of us aircraft the half dozen fighters in combat air patrol over the little us fleet streaked toward the enemy japanese escort fighters were bound to outnumber them their pilots would want to take out as many enemy strike aircraft as they could before the enemy shot them down a pilots life wasnt always glamorous george wouldnt have traded places with anybody up there an airplane tumbled out of the sky leaving a comets trail of fire and smoke all the way down to the pacific thats a jap someone shouted george hoped he knew what he was talking about this wasnt like the last few times the townsend had ventured out in the direction of midway the main attack wasnt aimed at the destroyer the japs wanted the trenton a carrier was really dangerous to them as aircraft from the converted freighter had just proved destroyers destroyers were nuisances annoyances worth noticing now only because they tried to keep enemy aircraft away from the trenton that made the mm crews jobs easier they were less rattled less hurried than they had been when enemy dive bombers singled the townsend out for attention george fed his gun shells fritz gustafson loaded them into the breeches at fremont dalbys command two other sailors shifted the antiaircraft gun in altitude and azimuth empty shell casings clattered down onto the deck by the gun crews feet every so often george or gustafson would kick them out of the way so nobody tripped over them the townsends fiveinch guns blasted away at the japs their shells could reach a lot farther and packed much more punch but they couldnt fire nearly so fast their roar on top of the thunder from all the smaller weapons hammered the ears george wondered whether hed be able to hear at all by the time the war ended and the big guns blast shook and jarred loose damn near everything on the deck the last time theyd cut loose a sailor george knew ended up spitting a filling out into the palm of his hand hed been lucky too even if he didnt think so when the pharmacists mate played dentist on him stray too close to a fiveinchers muzzle when it went off and blast could kill even if it didnt leave a mark on your body george didnt aspire to be a corpse unmarked or otherwise hit the whole gun crew shouted at the same time when a japanese dive bomber theyd been shooting at suddenly wavered in the air and started trailing smoke we got the son of a bitch george added exultantly that pilot must have known he had nowhere to go with his own carrier in flames he wouldnt have had anywhere to go even if his engine were running perfectly taking a hit must have rubbed his nose in it he dove for the trenton instead of releasing his bomb and trying to pull up he seemed intent on using his airplane as an extra weapon a hail of antiaircraft fire from the escort carrier said its gunners realized the same thing they scored more hits on the dive bomber but didnt deflect it from its course the ship swung to starboardslowly so slowly a carrier built from the keel up as a warship would have had a much better chance of getting away but that turn small as it was saved the trenton maybe the enemy pilot was dead in the cockpit or maybe the heavy fire severed the cables to his rudder and ailerons so he couldnt swerve no matter how much he wanted to he splashed into the pacific a hundred yards to port of the carrier his bomb went off then sending up a great plume of white water a near miss like that would damage the trenton with fragments and might make her leak from sprung seams but it wouldnt turn her into a torch and send her to the bottom fucker had balls fritz gustafson said with grudging respect as grudgingly george nodded trying to get in a last lick at your foe when you knew you were a goner took nerve not so many japanese airplanes were left in the sky now us fighters and ferocious aa had knocked down a lot of them then george watched something that chilled him to the bone a jap fighter pilot heeled his undamaged airplane into a dive and swooped on the trenton like a hunting falcon he didnt try to save himselfall he wanted to do was damage that carrier the only way he had left that he would die if he succeeded couldnt have mattered to him he wasnt going home anyway the trenton shot him down his fighter broke up and fell in flaming pieces into the sea but hed given the other japs an ideaor maybe hed told them over the wireless what he aimed to do one after another they all dove on the american ships below them dead men themselves they didnt want to die alone georges gun put as many rounds as it could into a fighter the japanese didnt make their aircraft as sturdy as americans didnot that a us fighter would have survived a pasting like that but the jap wasnt trying to survive only to take americans with him he didnt quite make it his burning airplane crashed into the ocean off the townsends starboard bow one fighter did crash on the trentons flight deckand then skidded off into the sea trailing flames it scraped eight or ten sailors off the ship with it fires lingered on the flight deck after the jap was gone damagecontrol parties beat them down with highpressure seawater by the time the escort carriers strike aircraft got back she was ready to land them by god we did it george said in the waters off the sandwich islands americans hadnt said anything like that for a while but theyd earned the right today george said it again with feeling xv brigadier general abner dowlings guards now enforced a wider perimeter around the house he was using than they had before he wondered if they joked that he had a wide perimeter too he wouldnt have been surprised the perimeter around the place though was no laughing matter it came by direct order from the war department people bombs dowling said as he showed his adjutant the order not just auto bombs anymore but people bombs too what on gods green earth are we coming to thats all i want to know captain angelo toricelli studied the order the mormons have done this in the usa he said negroes have done it in the csa it doesnt say white confederates have started doing it anywhere if they havent its only a matter of time till they do dowling said gloomily if you think the freedom party doesnt have people whod martyr themselves for st featherston youre out of your tree plenty of fanatics whod thank him for the chance to blow up a damnyankee or three go ahead tell me im wrong i dare you i wish i could sir toricelli sounded mournful too he went on i dont think the world is ever going to be the same from now on if youre in a big city or if youre in politics or the military you wont be able to go down to the corner diner for a cup of coffee or a ham on rye without wondering whether the quiet fellow in the next booth is going to blow himself to hell and goneand you along with him youre in a cheerful mood today arent you but dowling feared the younger officer was rightdead right one thing consoles me anyhow whats that sir bound to be more people who want to blow up jake featherston than ones who want to see me dead bad enough to kill themselves to get me sir i believe they call that a dubious distinction and i believe youre right dowling laughed but on a note not far from despair what is the world coming to captain just before the war started i listened to a fellow named litvinoff going on and on about nerve agentshe wouldnt call them gases he was happy as a clam in chowder you know what i mean oh yes sir toricelli nodded ive met people like that its their toy and they dont care what it does as long as it does what its supposed to thats right thats exactly right dowling nodded too and now this is there anything we wont do to each other toricelli considered that i dont know sir im not sure im the right person to ask he said dont you think you ought to talk to one of the negroes in a freedom party camp instead but ask fast while there are still some left ouch abner dowling winced well you got me there maybe i ought to put it a different way arent there some things we shouldnt do to each other weve got the geneva convention toricelli said it doesnt talk about people bombs dowling said it doesnt talk about those camps either it doesnt talk about gas come to that nobody wanted to talk about gas when they were hammering it out because everybody figured he might need it again one of these days now toricelli eyed dowling with a certain bemusement youre just about as cheerful as i am arent you sir im as cheerful as i ought to be dowling answered he looked out the window an auto painted us greengray was coming up to his headquarters the guards stopped it before it got too close anybody could paint a motorcar who was inside mattered far more than what color it was but the driver seemed to satisfy the guards he got out of the chevrolet and hurried toward the building ill see what he wants sir captain toricelli said thanks dowling told him his adjutant returned a few minutes later with the man from the autoa sergeant hes from the war department sir toricelli said says hes got orders for you from philadelphia well then hed better give them to me eh dowling did his best not to show worry orders from philadelphia could blow up in his face almost as nastily as a people bomb he could be cashiered he could be summoned before the joint committee on the conduct of the war againand wasnt even once cruel and unusual punishment he could be ordered back to the war department to do something useless again the possibilities were endless the good possibilities seemed much more sharply limited here you are sir the sergeant said dowling opened the orders and put on his reading glasses if this noncom had orders to report on how he took bad news he was damned if hed give the man any satisfaction wounded soldiers bit back screams for the same reason he skimmed through the orders blinked and read them again more slowly well well he said when hed finished may i ask sir captain toricelli was sensitive to everything that might go wrong what hurt dowlings career could hurt his too ive been relieved of this command ive been transferred dowling said toricelli nodded like dowling he didnt want to show a stranger his wounds hurt transferred where sir he asked trying to find out how badly he was hit to clovis new mexico which is i gather near the texas border dowling answered he couldnt keep the amazement out of his voice as he went on theyve appointed me commander of the eleventh army there they want somebody to remind the confederates theres a war on in those parts and yes sir toricelli broke in eyes glowing he might have been a soldier whod discovered a bullet had punched a hole in his tunic without punching a hole in him and theyve given me a second star major toricelli major general abner dowling said he and toricelli shook hands congratulations sir the sergeant from the war department said to dowling the man turned to toricelli congratulations to you too sir thank you dowling said at the same time as toricelli was saying thank you very much dowling went back to his desk and pulled out the half pint he eyed how much was left in the bottle about enough for three good slugs he said as he undid the cap he raised the little bottle heres to clovis by god new mexico he drank and passed it to angelo toricelli to clovis toricelli also drank and passed it to the sergeant here you go pal kill it dont mind if i do the noncom said to clovis he tilted his head back his adams apple worked ah that hits the spot all right much obliged to you both he would still have a story to tell when he got back to the war department but it wouldnt be one of frustration and rage and despair sergeants didnt drink with generalsor even majorsevery day one swig of whiskey didnt turn him into a drunk he drove off toward philadelphia that left dowling and his adjutant in a pleasant sort of limbo what the deuce is going on in new mexico toricelli asked all i know is what i read in the newspapers and you dont read much about new mexico there dowling figured he was heading to clovis to fix that or try only thing i can really recall is that bombing raid on fort worth and dallas a few months ago probably a good idea to find out before we get there toricelli said probably dowling agreed he was sure that never would have occurred to george custer custer would have charged right in and started slugging with the enemy regardless of what was going on beforehand nine times out of ten he and everyone around him would soon have regretted it the tenth time the tenth time he would have ended up a national hero dowling didnt make nearly so many blunders as his former boss he feared he would never become a national hero though his sense of caution was too well developed im sure well stop in philadelphia on our way to clovis his adjutant said the war department can brief us there captainno majortoricelli had a welldeveloped sense of caution too not even the stars on his shoulder straps kept dowling from being searched before he got into the war department sorry sir said the noncom who did the job complain to the chief of staff if you want to rule is no exceptions dowling didnt intend to complain as far as he could see the rule made good sense how many people bombs have you had he asked inside here none the sergeant answered in philadelphia i think the count is five right now jesus dowling said the man who was patting him down nodded sadly he felt like saying jesus again when he got a look at the situation map for the texasnew mexico border the socalled eleventh army had a division and a halfan understrength corpsto cover hundreds of miles of frontier the bombers that had plastered dallas and fort worth had long since been withdrawn to more active fronts only one thing relieved his gloom the confederates he was facing were just as bad off as he was where he had a division and a half under his command his counterpart in butternut commanded a scratch division and somebody had been scratching at it pretty hard dowling thought he could drive the enemy a long way after studying the map he wondered why he ought to bother if he advanced fifty miles into texas even a hundred miles into texaswell so what what had he won except fifty or a hundred empty dusty miles all those wideopen spaces were the best shield the confederacy had advance fifty or a hundred miles into virginia and the csa staggered advance fifty or a hundred miles into kentucky and you cut the enemy off from the ohio river and took both farming and factory country texas wasnt like that there was a lot of it and nobody had done much with a lot of what there was are you sending me out there to do things myself or just to keep the confederates from doing things he asked a general staff officer that worthy also studied the map for now the first thing is to make sure the confederates dont do anything he replied if they take las cruces people will talk if they go crazy and take santa fe and albuquerque id say your head would roll theyd need a devil of a lot of reinforcements to do that dowling said and the colonel with the goldandblack armofservice colors didnt deny it dowling went on theyd have to be nuts too because even taking albuquerque wont do a damn thing about winning them the war looks that way to me too the colonel said all right thenwere on the same page anyhow dowling said now the next obvious question is who do i have to kill to get reinforcements of my own well sir till we settle the mess in pennsylvania you could murder everybody here and everybody in congress and you still wouldnt get any the general staff officer said gravely that struck dowling as a reasonable assessment too the colonel added i hope youll be able to hold on to the force youve got i dont promise but i hope so all right you seem honest anyhow ill do what i can dowling said when he headed to the broad street station for the roundabout journey west he discovered fall had ousted summer while he wasnt looking the temperature had dropped ten or twelve degrees while he was visiting the war department the breeze was fresh and came from the northwest gray clouds scudded along on it no red and gold leaves on trees no brown leaves blowing not yet but that breeze said they were on their way home cincinnatus driver had never imagined a more wonderful word while he lived in it the apartment in des moines had seemed ordinaryjust another place one where he could hang his hat after almost two years away after being stuck in a country that hated hisand hated him toothat apartment seemed the most wonderful place in the world the apartment and the neighborhood seemed even more amazing to his father do jesus seneca driver said its like i aint a nigger no more dont hardly know how to act when the ofay down at the corner store treat me like is a man cincinnatus smiled its like that here i tried to tell you but you didnt want to believe me of course one reason it was like that was that des moines didnt have very many negroes not enough for whites to flabble about the united states as a whole didnt have very many cincinnatus smile slipped the usa didnt want many negroes either that left most of them stuck in the csa and at the tender mercy of jake featherston and the freedom party no such gloom troubled his father bought me a pack of cigarettes an i give the clerk half a dollar an he give me my change an he say to me here you is sir sir aint nobody never call me sir in all my born days but he do it sir he might have been walking on air then something else occurred to him that clerk he call a chinaman sir too reckon so cincinnatus answered what color you are dont matterso muchhere achilles and amanda they both graduated from high school you reckon that happen in kentucky and you got yourself two grandbabies that are half chinese and another one on the way you reckon that happen in kentucky not likely his father snorted at the idea i seen chinamen in the moving pictures before but i dont reckon i ever seen one in the flesh in covington now i aint just seen emi got em in the family he thought himself a man of the world because of that theyve got you in the family too cincinnatus said achilles wife the former grace chang really seemed to like cincinnatus father and to be glad cincinnatus himself was home her parents had much less trouble curbing their enthusiasm they werent thrilled about being tied to achilles or cincinnatus or seneca the funny thing was they would have been just about as dismayed if the drivers were white what bothered them was that their daughter had married somebody who wasnt chinese they is welcome in my family long as they make that good beer seneca driver said cincinnatus nodded homebrew mattered in iowa a thoroughly dry state he first got to know joey chang because of the beer his upstairs neighbor brewed achilles and grace got to know each other in school the rest well the rest just happened cincinnatus wondered how the freedom party would look at that marriage who was miscegenating with whom he didnt have to worry about that here he didnt have to worry about all kinds of things here things that would have been matters of life and death in the confederate states he could look at a white woman without fearing he might get lynched he didnt much want tohed always been happy with elizabethbut he could he could testify in court on equal terms with whitesand with chinese for that matter and youre a us citizen pa he said suddenly once youve lived in iowa long enough to be a resident you can vote his father was less delighted than hed expected done did that once in kentucky seneca driver replied there was that plebiscite thing remember i done voted but they went ahead an gave her back to the csa anyways he plainly thought that since hed voted things should have gone the way he wanted them cincinnatus wished the world worked like that elizabeth came out of the kitchen and into the front room you two hungry she asked got some fried chicken in the icebox i can bring you she thought cincinnatus and his father were nothing but skin and bones since theyd eaten too much of their own cooking down in covington she might have been right i would like that thank you kindly seneca said cincinnatus nodded but he was less happy than his father sounded to seneca driver his sons family seemed rich compared to anything the older man had had in kentucky they were but cincinnatus knew money didnt grow on trees and neither did chickens elizabeth had done cooking and cleaning to make ends meet while he was stuck in covington achilles had helped out too all the same cincinnatus knew his hauling business was dead his wife had sold the ford truck hed been so proud of he didnt blame her for that if she couldnt pay the rent the landlord would have thrown her out onto the street but he didnt have enough money to buy another one he wasnt going to be his own boss anymore he would have to work for somebody else and he hadnt done that since the end of the great war he hated the idea but he didnt know what he could do about it were there jobs for a middleaged black man with a bad leg and a none too good shoulder there for once cincinnatus wasnt so worried with the war sucking ablebodied men out of the workforce there were jobs for all the people who wanted them hed seen how many factories and shops had now hiring signs out where folks could see them women were doing jobs that had been a mans preserve before the war he figured he could find something elizabeth came back with a drumstick for his father a thigh for him and two more glasses of beer you holler if you want anything else she said she swung her hips as she walked off in some ways cincinnatus was glad to discover he wasnt crippled at all his homecoming had been everything he hoped it would be along those lines sure is good his father said taking a big bite out of the chicken leg and washing it down with a sip of mr changs homebrew they always said folks in the usa had it good i see they was right all he had to do was enjoy it he didnt have to worry about where it came from for the past couple of years elizabeth had done that cincinnatus was sure shed done a lot of worrying too but shed managed now that cincinnatus was finally home the worrying fell on his shoulders again hed hoped the government would help him out no such luck to those people hed been in kentucky on his own affairs and never mind that the plebiscite and its aftermath were what had stuck him there amanda came into the apartment shed found work at a fabric plant and her paycheck was helping with the bills now too she smiled at cincinnatus and seneca hello dad hello grandpa she said and kissed them both on the cheek shed always got on better with cincinnatus than achilles had there was none of that young goat bumping up against old goat rivalry that sometimes soured things between cincinnatus and his son how are you sweetheart he asked her she made a face tired long shift seneca laughed welcome to the world dear heart you better git used to it on account o it gonna be like dat till god call you to heaven i suppose amanda sighed i wish i could have gone on to college id be able to get a really good job with a college degree lawd the mere idea startled cincinnatus father a child o my child in college that woulda been somethin all right even if you had started college hon reckon you wouldve gone to work anyways with things like they were cincinnatus said sometimes you just cant help doin what you got to do i suppose his daughter said again she went into the kitchen to say hello to elizabeth when she came back she had a glass of beer in her hand cincinnatus raised an eyebrow when she sipped from it when did you start drinking beer he asked i knew you were going to say that amanda stuck out her tongue at him i knew it i started about a year ago i needed a while to get used to it but i like it now cincinnatus smiled remembering how sour beer had tasted to him the first few times he tasted it all right sweetheart he said mildly i aint gonna flabble about it youre big enough you can drink beer if you want to but when i went away you didnt he didnt want to get upset about anything not here not now he was so glad to see his daughter he wouldnt worry about anything past that she looked relieved i was afraid youd get all upset say it wasnt ladylike or something not me he shook his head how could i do that when your mamas been drinkin beer a whole lot longern youve been alive you could have amanda said darkly some people think whats fine for older folks isnt so fine for younger ones so there cincinnatus thought yeah some people do that he admitted but i aint one of them he listened to the way his words sounded compared to those of the people around him after so many years in iowa hed seemed more than half a yankee whenever he opened his mouth in covington but amanda and achilles had taken on much more of the flat midwestern accent of des moines than he had next to them he sounded like a negro whod just escaped from the confederate states well i damn well am when i was jus a lil pickaninnythis here was back in slavery daysmy pa give me my first sip o beer his father said in an accent far thicker and less educated than his own he screwed up his face at the memory i axed him am i pizened an he tol me no an he was right but i done pizened myself with beer a time or two since yes suh a time or two oh yeah cincinnatus remembered times when hed poisoned himself too some of them not so long ago he wondered how the brass monkey and the dedicated drinkersand checkerplayerswho made it a home away from home were doing already the time when he was stuck in covington was starting to seem like a bad dream he remembered waking up in the hospital if only that were a bad dream the pain in his leg and shoulder and the headaches he still sometimes got reminded him it was all too real he still didnt remember the motorcar hitting him the doctors had told him he never would they seemed to be right from what they said lots of folks didnt remember what happened when they had a bad accident if his were any worse they would have planted him with a lily on his chest glad youre home dad amanda said dad there it was again down in covington she would surely have called him pa she had called him pa for years when had she changed to this yankee usage whenever it was he hadnt particularly noticedtill he went away and came back and got his nose rubbed in it im glad im home too cincinnatus said when you got right down to it he didnt much care what she called him as long as she could call him anything and he was there to hear it nothing else mattered he thought about the brass monkey again and about lucullus woods barbecue place and about his father and mothers house now empty and for all he knew standing open to the wind and the rain and he thought about the barbed wire and the guards around covingtons colored quarter autumn was coming to des moines but winter lived in his heart when he remembered that barbed wire allegheny monongahela beautiful names for rivers even ohio wasnt a bad name for a river when you put the three of them together though they added up to pittsburgh pittsburgh hadnt been beautiful for a long time the way things looked to tom colleton it would never be beautiful again the damnyankees were not going to give up this town without a fight they poured men into it to battle block by block house by house crossing a street could be and often was worth a mans life barrels came in and knocked houses flat and machinegunned the men who fled from the ruins then some damnyankee they hadnt machinegunned threw a featherston fizz through an open hatch and turned a barrel into an iron coffin for the men inside and then a counterattack went in and threw the confederates back six blocks somebody not far away started banging on a shell casing with a wrench or a hammer or whatever he had handy oh for christs sake tom said and grabbed for his gas mask the weather seemed to have broken it wasnt so hot and sticky as it had been but the gas mask was never any fun if us artillery was throwing in nerve gas hed have to put on the full rubber suit hed be sweating rivers in that even in a blizzard confederate shells crashed down on the factories and steel mills ahead the bursts sent up smoke that joined the horrid stuff belching from the tall stacks air in pittsburgh was already poisonous even without phosgene and mustard gas and the nerve agents they called the thick brown eyestinging mix smog jamming together smoke and fog what they got was more noxious than the madeup word suggested though tom wouldnt have wanted to work in one of those places with shells bursting all around but the factories kept operating till they burned or till the confederates overran them trucks and trains took steel and metalware of all kinds east barges took them up the allegheny too confederate artillery and dive bombers made the yankees pay a heavy price for what came out of the mills and factories some of it got through though and they must have thought that was worthwhile barrels painted butternut ground forward telling streets from blocks of houses wasnt so easy anymore confederateoccupied pittsburgh was nothing but a rubble field these days the whole town would look like that by the time toms countrymen finished driving out the damnyankees if they ever did a machine gun fired at the barrels from the cover of a ruined clothing store bullets clanged off the snorting machines armor tom didnt know why machine gunners banged away at barrels they couldnt hurt them bang away they did though he wasnt sorry the more bullets they aimed at the barrels the fewer theyd shoot at his foot soldiers whom they really could hurt traversing turrets had a ponderous grace three swung together till their big guns bore on that malevolently winking eye of fire the cannons spoke together too more of the battered shop fell in on itself but the machine gun opened up again like a small boy yelling nyah nyah you missed me when bigger kids chucked rocks at him the crew had nerve all they got for their courage was another volley and then another after that the gun stayed quiet had the barrels put it out of action or was it playing possum tom hoped his men wouldnt find out the hard way and then for a moment he forgot all about the machine gun something an infantry officer hardly ever did but a round from a us barrel he hadnt seen slammed into the side of one of the butternut behemoths the confederate barrel started to burn hatches popped open men dashed for cover the us barrel was smart it didnt machinegun them and reveal its position it just waited the other two cs barrels turned in the general direction from which that enemy round had come if the us barrel was one of the old models their sloped front armor would defeat its gun even at pointblank range but it wasnt it was one of the new ones with the big homely turret that housed a bigger nastier cannon and when that gun roared again another confederate barrel died this time several soldiers pointed toward the muzzle flash by the time the last cs barrel in the neighborhood brought its gun to bear though the damnyankee machine had pulled back tom colleton got glimpses of it as it retreated but only glimpses the butternut barrel didnt have a clear shot at it and held fire he sent men forward to keep the enemy from bringing barrels into that spot again he was only half surprised when the machine gun in the ruined store opened up again his men were quick to take cover too he didnt think the machine gun got any of them he hoped not anyway the confederate barrel sent several more rounds into the haberdashery the machine gun stayed quiet ever so cautious soldiers in butternut inched closer one of them tossed in a grenade and went in after it tom wished he had a man with a flamethrower handy the last fellow whod carried one had got incinerated along with his rig a few days earlier though no replacement for him had come forward yet not enough replacements of any kind were coming forward little by little the regiment was melting away tom didnt know what to do about that except hope it got pulled out of the line for rest and refit before too long however much he hoped he didnt expect that would happen soon the confederates needed pittsburgh theyd already put just about everybody available up at the front after a minute or so the soldier came out of the wreckage with his thumb up there was one damnyankee machine gun that wouldnt murder anybody else nowhow many hundreds how many thousands more waited in pittsburgh the answer was too depressing to think about so tom didnt one thing he hadnt seen in pittsburgh yellowish khaki mexican uniforms the mexicans hadnt done badly in ohio and pennsylvania but they werent the first team and everybody knew it they held the flanks once the confederates went through and cleared out the yankees they were plenty good enough for that and it let the confederates pile more of their own troops into the big fight a rifle shot rang out a bullet struck sparks from the bricks just behind the head of the soldier whod thrown the grenade he hit the dirt three other confederates pointed in three different directions which meant nobodyd seen where the shot came from the machine gun might be gone but the yankees hadnt given up the fight for this block it didnt seem as if they would till they were all dead down in the csa some peoplemostly those who hadnt been through the great warstill believed us soldiers were nothing but a pack of cowards tom laughed as he ducked down into a shell hole to shed his mask and smoke a cigarettehe didnt turn blue and keel over so it was safe enough and much better not to let the match or the coal give the damnyankee sniper a target he just wished confederate propaganda were true pittsburgh would have fallen long since a runner came skittering back to him calling his name here i am he shouted not raising his head whats up sir theres a yankee with a flag of truce right up at the front the runner replied wants to know if he can come back and dicker a truce for the wounded the last time a us officer proposed something like that hed scouted out the cs positions as he moved with his white flag the damnyankees kept the truce but they knew just where to strike after it ended tom threw down the halffinished smoke ill meet the son of a bitch at the line he growled he made his own flag of truce from a stick and a pillowcase then went up with the runner the truce already seemed to be informally under way firing had stopped confederates were swapping packs of cigarettes for us ration cans both sides deplored that neither could do anything about it commerce trumped orders the yankees had better canned goods and worse tobacco the confederates the opposite a us captain in a dirty uniform waited for tom i could have come to you the man remarked colleton smiled a crooked smile i bet you could he said and explained why he didnt want the yankee back of his lines i wouldnt do a thing like that the us officer said much too innocently and im sure you wouldnt either who me tom said with another smile like the first the us captain matched it theyd been through the mill all right tom got down to business is an hour long enough or do you want two split the difference the damnyankee suggested and tom nodded the captain looked at his watch all right lieutenantcolonel truce till then agreed tom stuck out his hand the us captain shook it they both turned back to their own men and shouted out the news corpsmen from both sides came forward ordinary soldiers did some more trading somebody had a football cs and us soldiers tossed it back and forth tom remembered the christmas truce when the great war almost unraveled he knew that wouldnt happen here both sides meant it now corpsmen poked around through rubble they called outside of smashed houses sometimes they got answers from smashed people trapped inside soldiers helped move wreckage so the medics could do their job when us corpsmen found wounded cs soldiers they gave them back to the confederates corpsmen in butternut returned the favor for the yankees tom and the officer in greengrayhis name was julian nesmithhadnt agreed to that but neither of them tried to stop it wont change how things end up one way or the other nesmith remarked i was thinking the same thing about smokes and grub a little while ago tom agreed hed handed captain nesmith a couple of packs of raleighs and was now the proud possessor of two cans of deviled ham a delicacy esteemed on both sides of the front his mouth watered if he could scrounge up some eggs even if he couldnt the ham would be a treat we might as well be comfortable as we can while we slaughter each other nesmith said were enemies tom said simply you wont make me believe the united states wants to do anything but to squash my country and i dont expect i can persuade you the confederate states arent full of villains it wouldnt matter if you did nesmith answered as long as youve got villains at the top all they have to do is shout loud enough to make everybody else go along that came close to hitting below the belt tom hadnt much cared to listen to jake featherston on the wireless at all hours of the day and night but jake featherston had got kentucky and houston back into the csa after the damnyankees stole them at gunpoint in the whigs hadnt come close to managing that featherston was doing something about the negroes in the confederate states too the whigs hadnt known what to do and so whos a villain and who isnt depends on how you look at things tom said sometimes julian nesmith replied they shook hands again when the truce ended corpsmen disappeared men got back under cover almost ceremoniously a us soldier fired a springfield to warn anybody who hadnt got the word in that same spirit a confederate soldier answered with one round from a tredegar then another confederate squeezed off a burst from his automatic rifle a us machine gun opened up tom sighed the little peace had been nice while it lasted salt lake city wasnt hell but you could see it from there armstrong grimes peered toward the rubble of the mormon templetwice built and now twice destroyed he peered very cautiously all the mormons still fighting were veterans some of them were veterans of two uprisings show any body part and theyd put a bullet through it faster than you could say jack robinson armstrong wondered who the hell jack robinson was he also wondered how life would change now that he was a sergeant instead of a corporal hed hesitated before sewing the new stripes onto his sleeve the mormons snipers liked to pick off officers and noncoms yossel reisen had two stripes now he wore them too their promotions both came through while the regiment was in reserve in thistle somebody must have thought they were on the ball when that woman blew herself up in provo all armstrong knew was that the two of them hadnt got badly hurt when the people bomb went off and afterward hed done what anybody else would have that must have been enough to impress one officer or another he turned to reisen who crouched behind a stone fence not far away you hear the skinny last night he said they figure sergeant stowes gonna make it yeah somebody told me yossel nodded i wouldve thought he was a goner for sure he looked like hell boy didnt he armstrong said hes lucky hunhunh now armstrong shook his head were lucky we didnt catch shrapnel we arent in the hospital with our guts all messed up if stowe was lucky hed still be here same as we are instead hes in a bed somewhere and they probably have to shoot morphine into him all the goddamn time belly wounds are supposed to hurt like anything his vehemence surprised him it must have surprised yossel reisen too armstrong didnt usually argue with him yossel was older and more experienced even if he didnt care about rank here though armstrong couldnt keep quiet and after a few seconds yossel nodded well youre right he said hes alive and thats good but he still isnt lucky there you go armstrong said thats how it looks to me too sarge hey sarge somebody yelled armstrong needed a moment to remember that meant him yeah what is it he said a beat slower than he should have mormon coming up with a flag of truce firing had died away armstrong hadnt noticed that either he felt as far down on sleep as he had before his regiment got r and r cautiously he stuck his head up again sure as hell here came a mormon in what the rebels used for a uniform chambray shirt dungarees and boots hold it right there buddy or youll never know how your favorite serial comes out on the wireless armstrong yelled the mormon waved the white flag i want to talk to an officer i mean no harm yeah now tell me another one armstrong said how do i know youre not a goddamn people bomb waiting to go off because i say i am not the rebel answered i am a major in the army of the state of deseret armstrong could hear the capital letters thud into place capital letters didnt impress him and im the queen of the may he said you want to come forward he waited for the mormon to nod then made a peremptory gesture strip show me youre not loaded with fucking tnt if looks could kill but they couldnt and tnt might fuming the mormon major shed his boots his jeans and his shirt he even took off his stetson that left him in a peculiarlooking undershirt and longish drawers it was getting toward longunderwear timenights were downright chillybut it hadnt got there yet the strange getup didnt particularly bother armstrong hed seen it on other mormons some sort of religious rule said they had to wear it that didnt mean he had to trust it lift up the shirt he called the drawers are snug enoughdont bother with those the mormon did showing a hard belly covered with hair a shade darker than the blond hair on his head armstrong waved to him now turn around after the rebel did armstrong reluctantly nodded all right looks like youre clean put your stuff back on and come ahead as the mormon major dressed he said i ought to complain to your officers go ahead buddy armstrong said you think theyll come down on me i think theyll pat me on the back they dont trust you people any further than i do and i dont trust you at all believe me we feel the same way about you the mormon said bending to tie his bootlaces if you would only leave us alone if you hadnt risen up id be back east somewhere with confederates trying to shoot me armstrong said and youd be here in utah happy as a goddamn clam they didnt even conscript you people we want to be free we want to be independent the mormon said as he picked up his white flag whats so wicked about that he came toward the us lines armstrong laughed a dirty laugh you want to have lots of wives are they all in the same bed when you screw em does one lick your balls while another one gets on top the mormons jaw set its a good thing i dont know your name sergeant he walked past armstrong as if he didnt exist armstrong called for a couple of privates to take him back toward the rear hes going to put you on a list even if he doesnt know your name yossel said youll be the sergeant in soandso sector and those bastards will be gunning for you big fucking deal armstrong laughed again easy enough to get shot around here even when the bastards arent gunning for you wont make a whole hell of a lot of difference one way or the other you better hope it wont yossel seemed willing to look on the gloomy side of life screw it nobodys even shooting right now armstrong lived for and in the moment the less you thought about all the horrible things that had happened the horrible things that would happen and the horrible things that might happen the better off you were after a bit captain lloyd deevers came over and got down in the hole with him armstrong liked deevers a lot better than lieutenant streczyk who ran the platoon deevers actually had a pretty good idea of what he was doing he nodded to armstrong now and said i dont think that mormon likes you now ask me if i care sir armstrong answered i dont like him either deevers chuckled all right im not going to flabble about itexcept if you want to transfer to some other outfit on the line i wont say no no thanks sir i already told reisen i can stop one as easy somewhere else as i can here armstrong said captain deevers grinned and slapped him on the back armstrong asked did that mormon say why he wanted the truce not to me deevers answered he wanted to talk to the high muckymucks i passed him back to division hq and well see what they do with him if i had to guess id say he wants to dicker a surrender that isnt really a surrender if you know what i mean but thats only a guess good fucking luck uh sir armstrong said lloyd deevers laughed he would have had a better chance before they started blowing themselves up yossel said if we let em off the hook now its like they screwed it out of us and if they want something else theyll think all they have to do is use a few more people bombs to make us give in thats how it looks to me too especially since weve almost got em licked armstrong said well boys i wont argue with either one of you cause i think youre dead right deevers said but it isnt up to me any more than its up to you well see what the fellows with the stars on their shoulders have to sayand maybe the fellows in the cutaway coats too theyll screw it up armstrong predicted they always do he waved a hand at the devastation all around the wreckage and the smell of corpses might not prove his point but they didnt come out and call him a liar either captain deevers just shrugged like i told you i cant do anything about it either i suppose what they decide to do here depends a lot on how things look in pennsylvania and up in canada that made sense armstrong might have been happier if it didnt soldiers in utah didnt hear much news from pennsylvania not hearing news was a bad sign all by itself when things went right nobody on the wireless would shut up about it that same ominous quiet came out of canada for all armstrong knew hordes of pissedoff canucks were swarming over the border toward minneapolis and seattle were off in the back of beyond yossel said nobody tells us anything wonder how much news about us gets out captain deevers said musingly you ought to ask your aunt armstrong told yossel he kept an eye on the company co as he spoke deevers didnt blink he was fairly new to the unit but he knew it had a vips nephew yossel said she doesnt tell me a whole lotnothing im not supposed to know shes got to worry about security like anybody else too bad armstrong said whats the point of being related to a big shot if you dont get anything out of it people always say that yossel reisen answered but if somebody important gives you a hand all the time how do you know what youre good for by yourself he had a point armstrong could see it his family though had no fancy connections he thought not having to worry about money or a good job or the right college would be awfully nice no doors had opened for him because he was soandsos nephew his family had plenty of soandsos in it but not that kind somebody called a question across the line to the mormons how long is this truce supposed to last till the major comes back a rebel answered then we give you thieving wretches more of what you deserve thieving wretches armstrong smiled in spite of himself the mormons seldom came right out and cussed some of the insults they used instead sounded pretty funny men on both sides walked around and stretched showing their faces without fear of taking a bullet if they did the mormons were scrupulous about honoring truces us soldiers smoked some of them probably had something better than water in their canteens the mormons werent supposed to use tobacco or alcohol and most of them didnt armstrong figured that meant screwing was the only way they could have a good time they sure did that theyd raised up a big new generation of rebels after getting one killed off in their uprising during the great war in midafternoon us soldiers passed the mormon officer back through the lines to his own side his face was a thunderstorm of fury he hardly even had an extra glare for armstrong as he went by the mormons fired a warning shot into the air a us soldier answered it a couple of minutes later a screaming meemie came down on armstrongs company and then another one all things considered maybe he would rather have stayed anonymous leonard odoull had worked in a hospital before hed met his wife working in one outside of riviereduloup during the last war if the authorities hadnt decided lucien galtier was an unreliable nuisance and confiscated his land for the building nicole never would have come to work there odoull knew he wouldnt have settled in the republic of quebec if he hadnt made family ties sometimes very strange things could twist a mans fate he was in a fancier hospital now the university of pittsburgh had had one of the best medical schools in the usa and a large hospital where staff members trained residents interns medical students and nurses now the hospital was full of wounded and gassed soldiers along with the people in trainingthose who hadnt put on the uniformthe staff were getting trained themselves by experts like leonard odoull and granville mcdougald speed mcdougald told a surgeon with an oldfashioned upturned kaiser bill mustache the faster we can get to em the better they do if were operating less than an hour after they get hit theyll probably make it every minute after that hurts their chances the whitemustached healer nodded ive also seen this in motorcar accidents he said its even more critical with gunshot and shrapnel wounds because the traumas usually worse mcdougald said the surgeon nodded again thoughtfully and walked down the corridor mcdougald looked over at leonard odoull and grinned look at me doc going on just like i know what im talking about dont sandbag granny odoull answered when it comes to wounds whos seen more than you nobody this side of the guy who cuts up steers in a chicago slaughterhouse mcdougald said but he always sees the same ones not like that in our line of work is it always something new odoull agreed people keep coming up with new ways to maim their fellow man i dont know why i dont despair of the human race somebody once said people were the missing link between apes and human beings mcdougald said wistfully damned if he didnt hit that one on the button didnt he just odoull listened to the artillery outside if the confederates get over the allegheny were going to be even busier than we are already so will they mcdougald said theyll be busier than a onearmed paper hanger with the hives they may take this place away from us but christ theyre paying through the nose leonard odoull nodded it looked that way to him too the dashing cs barrels werent dashing not in pittsburgh they had to fight their way forward house by house and a lot of them ended up as burntout hulks confederate infantry had trouble advancing without the barrels too local us counterattacks meant the hospital held a good many wounded confederates along with us soldiers that might have been for the bestthe more of their own men in this place the less inclined the confederates would be to hit it by accident wouldnt put it past em mcdougald said when odoull remarked on that they fought as clean as we did the last time around here now he made a sour face i think they cheat when they use the red cross and i think they think we cheat too makes them more likely to hit our aid stations and hospitals and ambulances featherstons fuckers sure as hell i hope that isnt true odoull let it go there the bad news seemed more likely to be true with each unfolding day there were even rumors featherston himself traveled in an ambulance to keep us fighters from shooting him up well doc if you want some consolation the bastards in butternut arent as bad as they could be granville mcdougald said it sounds like the action francaise boys really abuse the red cross yeah ive heard that too odoull said theres another war as big as this one going on over there bigger the medic said bigger all right odoull accepted the correction but its like noises in another room to us oh were working with the german high seas fleet where we can but mostly weve got our troubles and germany and austriahungary have theirs austriahungarys got more troubles than you can shake a stick at mcdougald observed all the uprisings in the balkans make whats going on in utah and canada look like pretty small potatoes he grinned crookedly at odoull might as well be ireland matter of fact heh odoull said sourlysomething that sounded like a laugh but really wasnt with us help ireland had thrown off the english yoke after the great war the first thing winston churchills government did when the new round of fighting flared was send in barrels and bombers and battleships the union jack flew again in belfast and dublin and corkand the island heaved with rebellion i wonder how long itll be before irish people bombs start going off in london mcdougald winced those damned mormons let the genie out of the bottle with that one he said how do you stop somebody whos already decided to die by the evidence available so far you couldnt stop somebody like that not often enough mcdougald added theyll feel it in vienna and budapest too serbs and romanians and bosnians and god only knew how many others from the balkan patchwork quilt of peoples and competing nationalisms bushwhacked the kingemperors soldiers where and as they could russia encouraged them and sent them arms and ammunition the way the british helped the canucks and the confederates armed the mormons of course the usa armed negroes in the csa odoull didnt even think about us support for the republic of quebec which would still have been a canadian province absent the great war germany played those games with finns and jews and chechens and azerbaijanis inside the tsars empire and both sides helped their own sets of guerrillas inside the ukraine which was in technical terms a mess an orderly trotted up to odoull and mcdougald weve got a man with a leg wound in or seven he said we should do something about that mcdougald said and odoull nodded they hurried toward the or working in an actual operating room was an unaccustomed luxury for odoull it beat the hell out of doing his job under canvas he had a real operating table surgical lights he could aim wherever he wanted and all the other amenities hed almost forgotten in the field and he had a nasty case waiting on the table for him a leg wound hardly did the injury justice get him under fast granny odoull said after one glance at the shattered appendage right mcdougald said and not much else till the soldier was mercifully unconscious then he asked youre not going to try and keep that on are you good god no odoull answered above the knee too poor bastard he picked up a bone saw and got to work like most amputations it was bloody but fast the wounded soldier was young and strong and healthy odoull thought he would do wellor as well as you could do after youd been maimed how many men on both sides of the border were short an arm or a leg too many that was for sure as he closed up the stump odoull asked ever see a real basket case granny no arms no legs mcdougald asked and odoull nodded the medic shook his head no not me you always hear about em but ive never seen one you get wounded like that most of the time they take your pieces back to graves registration not to an aid station how about you the same odoull answered you hear about em all the time hell people talk about basket cases when they mean somebody whos just all messed up but ive never seen the real mccoy either i suppose there really are some mcdougald said would we have the name if we didnt have the thing beats me odoull said we have names for truth and justice and liberty too how often do you really see the things those names point at touche doc granville mcdougald gave him another sour laugh and then weve got freedom too by the way he said the word he might have been a stalwart in white shirt and butternut trousers getting ready to go out there and break some heads god damn jake featherston up one side and down the other odoull said wearily as he went to the sink and washed the now onelegged soldiers blood from his hands how much blood did featherston have on his hands but he didnt care about washing it off he reveled in it mcdougald stood beside him and scrubbed down too ive been wishing that very same thing he said holding out his arms in front of him with the wrists up so water would flow down from his hands and carry germs away with it ive been wishing for it since before the war started matter of fact and god hasnt done thing one far as i can tell hes at a football gameprobably standing in line to get himself a couple of franks and a beer that was blasphemous which didnt mean it didnt hold a lot of truth i dont know how anybodys going to be able to believe in anything by the time this damn war is done odoull said i dont know how anybody believed anything after the last one mcdougald said but youre right this ones worse the poison gas is more poisonous were better at dropping bombs on the confederates cities and theyre better at dropping them on ours o brave new world that has such people int he quoted shakespeare with malice aforethought you forgot one odoull said mcdougald raised a questioning eyebrow the doctor explained we didnt slaughter people just because of who they were the last time around oh yeah tell it to the armenians and the turks were on our side mcdougald said odoull winced hed forgotten about the armenian massacres he was sure most people in the usa had mcdougald went on but youre rightwe didnt not on this continent and jake featherston probably noticed nothing much ever happened to the turks and he must have figured nothing much would happen to him if we went after his spooks and you know what else looks like hes right it does doesnt it odoull said unhappily i dont think a whole lot of people in the usa like smokes a whole hell of a lot mcdougald said id be lying if i said i liked em a whole hell of a lot myself dont know very many dont know any very wellarent that many here to know and that suits me fine what i do know well you can keep em far as im concerned but theres a lot of difference between saying that and wanting to see em dead im with you odoull said i dont think i saw a negro all the time i was up in riviereduloup and i didnt much miss em either lots and lots of em in the csa so the confederates cant pretend they arent there the way we can but making so they really arent therethats filthy yeah were on the same page again doc granville mcdougald said and you know what else odoull raised an interrogative eyebrow the medic went on it wont do those poor sons of bitches one damn bit of good leonard odoull sadly nodded because that was much too likely to be true coming back to the lower east side of new york city always felt strange to flora blackford it was only a couple of hours by fast train from philadelphia but it was a different world as she made a campaign visit just before the presidential elections she found it different in some new ways confederate bombers hadnt hit her hometown nearly so hard as theyd hit philadelphia those extra miles round tripmeant more fuel and fewer bombs aboard they also meant us fighters had all that extra time to try to shoot the confederates down and most of the bombs that had fallen in new york city had fallen on wall street and the publishing district and on and around the factories in the bronx and brooklyn the neighborhood where shed grown up wasoh not untouched by war but not badly damaged either she spoke in a theater where shed debated her democratic opponent during the great war this time the democrats were running a lawyer named sheldon vogelman he stood well to the right of robert taft and only a little to the left of attila the hun he was the sort of man who if he werent jewish probably would have been a raving antisemite instead he raved about plowing up the confederates cities and sowing them with salt so nothing ever grew there again he also wanted to plow up anybody in the usa who presumed to disagree with him my opponent flora said would ship salt from the great salt flats in utah especially for the purpose digging up the salt and bringing it east for his purposes would create jobs im afraid thats his entire definition of a fullemployment policy she got a laugh and a hand the democrats could nominate a rightwing lunatic in this district because they werent going to win no matter whom they nominated vogelman blew off steam for their party he was loud and obnoxious and for all practical purposes harmless we made mistakes flora said im not going to try to tell you anything else we should have been tougher on jake featherston as soon as he made it plain he was building up a new war machine but herbert hoover was president of the united states from to and he and the democrats didnt do anything about jake featherston then either thats right somebody in the audience shouted a few hecklers booed but there werent many sheldon vogelman was not only a reactionary nut he was an ineffective reactionary nut best kind flora thought the bestor worstexample of the other kind was featherston she and vogelman agreed on one thing the war had to be fought to a finish they had different reasons but they agreed she didnt know of any socialists democrats or even republicans running on a peaceatanyprice platform jake featherston had been effective at uniting the united states against him too when this war is overwhen we have won this war flora began and had to stop for a flood of fierce applause when we have won i say featherston and his fellow criminals will face the bar of justice for their aggression against the united statesmore ferocious cheersand for their coldblooded murder of tens of thousands of their own people she got cheers for that too but not so many even if she didnt call a spade a spade the painful truth was that not even her mostly jewish audience could get excited about the fate of negroes in the csa flora had been banging her head against that truth ever since she started speaking out about jake featherstons persecutions dont you see she said pogroms are wrong how many of your ancestorshow many of you ladies and gentlemencame to the united states because of the tsars pogroms come oni know its more than that all over the hall hands went up people raised them reluctantly and lowered them as soon as they could if theyd had their druthers they wouldnt have raised them at all they didnt want to think about why theyd come to america they especially didnt want to compare their past to the confederate negroes present flora wanted to make sure they remembered she wanted that even if it cost her votes against a candidate like sheldon vogelman losing a few didnt much matter if the democrats had run someone stronger she hoped she would have done the same thing if you turn your back on other people when theyre in trouble wholl look out for you when you are she asked dont you see if we dont look out for the negroes in the csa in an important way we dont look out for ourselves either we dont want those people here somebody shouted several people clapped their hands they werent all hecklers she knew where the hecklers were sitting listening to them hurt more because they werent the democrats are the party for people who only care about themselves flora said if your fellow man matters to you youll vote socialist next week i hope he does i hope you do thank you she got a good hand as she stepped away from the lectern she could have been caught pulling hundreddollar bills out of a contractors pocket with her teeth and she still would have won here this time around for lunch the next day she faced a more critical audience david hamburger had come out of the great war with one leg and with politics not far from vogelmans he and flora still got on well when they stayed away from political matters when they didntand they couldnt all the timesparks flew they met at kaplans a delicatessen that had been around at least as long as flora had david was waiting for her when she came in that was probably just as well she didnt have to watch the rolling gait required by an artificial leg that started above the knee hello there he said as she joined him so how does it feel to be slumming in your old stomping grounds kaplans isnt slumming flora said dont be silly not a place in philadelphia comes close to it the waiter was bald and had a gray mustache flora ordered corned beef on rye her brother chose pastrami they both ordered beer the waiter nodded and hurried away how have you been flora asked not too badmiddleclass or somewhere close david shrugged my sons too little to conscript in this war so thats good yes flora said tonelessly her own son was heading toward eighteen and joshua wouldnt hear of her doing anything to keep him out of the conscription pool having a nephew in harms way was bad enough having a son on the front lines would be ten thousand times worse the food and the beers came quickly flora took a long pull at hers david drank more slowly he pulled a dill pickle from the jar on the table and nibbled it with his sandwich and his beer after a bit he said looks like youll be away for another couple of years well i hope so flora said youve done a good job and vogelmans meshuggeh david said between the two that ought to do the job if it doesnt this district is even more verkakte than i give it credit forand i didnt think it could be hearing the yiddish made flora smile like her brothers and sisters shed grown up speaking it more often than english at home now though she never heard it never spoke it unless she came back to the district no one she knew in philadelphia used it her husband a gentile from dakota had learned a few phrases from her but that was all joshua knew a few phrases too he couldnt begin to speak it flora wasnt so sure she could speak it herself anymore she thought and then did bring out a yiddish sentence whats going to happen to this language in a couple of generations i dont know david answered also in yiddish he dropped back into english to go on and i wont lose much sleep over it either we brought yiddish from the old country now were americans they speak english here so fineill speak english i suppose so flora said joshua doesnt seem much interested in learning it anyhow but i cant help wondering whether my grandchildren or greatgrandchildren wont think they missed out on something special because they didnt get the chance to learn it well if they do theres always night school david said and flora nodded how many immigrants had learned all sorts of different things in night school hundreds of thousands surely some were accountants some were lawyers because of the courses theyd taken in hours snatched from sleep and rest still it wont be the same she said what you learn in school isnt like what you pick up around the house i cant do anything about it david pulled another pickle spear out of the jar and aimed it at her like a bayonet i cantbut you can you can pass the preservation of yiddish act and make it a crime for all the alter kackershe tacked the english plural onto the yiddish wordwho can still yatter away in the old language to use english instead and you can make it another crime for anybody jewish not to listen to them and talk back in yiddish flora laughed so hard she almost choked on her sandwich you she said severely are ridiculous thank you her brother answered which only made her laugh harder and while youre at it you can have them make the lower east side a national park buffalo have yellowstone why shouldnt people who speak yiddish have their own game preserve too and if we get too crowded you could issue hunting licenses to antisemites and theyd come in here and thin us out only difference between us and the buffalo is we might shoot back you flora stopped she had to reach into her purse for a handkerchief to wipe her streaming eyes she tried again you ought to sell that routine to the engels brothers if they wouldnt pay you for it im a chinaman you could do the same thing for chinamen here and in san francisco david said warming to his theme and think of the chances jake featherstons missing if he charged fees to get into the hunting preserves for shvartzers he could probably cut taxes in half that killed floras laughter it isnt hunting down there she said its slaughter nothing else but they might as well be mormons eh david insisted on being difficult its worse flora insisted were fighting the mormons but we arent murdering the ones in the land weve taken the confederates are emptying out one town after another taking the negroes off to camps and killing them once they get there its about as bad as it can be down there and its just pretty bad up here david said well nice to know weve still got room for improvement that wasnt funny eitheror if it was only in the blackest way when flora laughed this time it was only to keep from sobbing xvi some lovely rubble lay between sergeant michael pounds barrel and the advancing confederate armor once upon a time the rubble had been homes and shops and peoples hopes all things considered pound liked it better as rubble if you knocked a wall down in a neighborhood that hadnt been trampled the enemy would notice right away if you rearranged what was already wreckage though so what not many pittsburgh neighborhoods had gone untrampled the united states were making a stand here defying the confederates to drive them out jake featherston seemed willing even eager to try he keep feeding men and barrels and artillery and airplanes into the fight no matter who held pittsburgh by the time the battle here was done one thing was clear it wouldnt be worth holding pound tapped lieutenant don griffiths on the leg sir do you think we could crawl inside that ruinedgarage i guess it used to beover there weve got a nice field of fire where the window was and the shadows insidell keep the bastards in butternut from spotting us the barrel commander stuck his head out of the cupola for a good look he had nerve nobody could say he didnt and he seemed to own more in the way of sense than the late lieutenant poffenberger anyway when he ducked back down again he said good idea sergeant and spoke to the driver by intercom jouncing over shattered brickwork the barrel took its new position another reason pound liked the ruined garage was that hed seen us infantrymen huddled in the ruins not far away your own foot soldiers were the best insurance policy you had in a barrel they kept the other sides foot soldiers away no sneaky bastard could plant a magnetic mine on your side chuck a grenade through an open hatch or throw a featherston fizz at your engine compartment so the flaming gasoline dripped down through the louvers and set you on fire not if you had pals around he spotted motion up ahead through the gunsight not the dinosaurian shape of a confederate barrel rumbling into position but sir theyre moving infantry up yes i saw them too griffiths answered hold fire for now let our own infantry deal with them if they can weve got this good position i dont want to give it away for something as small as a few soldiers on foot yes sir pound surprised himself by smiling at the lieutenant what griffiths said made perfectly good sense pound wouldnt have thought the junior officer had it in him confederate asskickers screamed down out of the sky to bomb and machinegun us positions what seemed like every antiaircraft gun in the world opened up on them so many guns blazed away pound wondered if some of them hadnt kept quiet before to lure the confederate dive bombers into a trap three or four mules didnt pull up from their dives but went straight into the ground the explosions made the ground shake under his barrel he saw one funeral pyre through the hole that had held the garage window good riddance he muttered amen cecil bergman said the loader added see anything out there that needs killing sarge quiet right now pound answered good bergman saidnot a bloodthirsty attitude but a sensible one nobody in his right mind was eager for combat you had a job to do you did it and you tried not to think about it when you had to think about it you thought about targets and barrels you didnt think about men because those sons of bitches on the other side had a job to do too and theirs was turning you into a target if that also meant turning you into raw hamburger or burnt hamburger they would try not to think about it somebody coming over to us griffiths said and then hes in our uniform right pound said and pulled the on his belt out of its holster confederates in us uniform confederates who talked like us soldiers had caused a lot of grief in pennsylvania make sure hes got the right countersign before you let him get close i intend to sergeant griffiths sounded like a small boy reproving his mother the barrel commander popped out of the cupola foxx he said greenberg the soldier answered michael pound relaxedmostly that was the right countersign the confederates had their own football heroes they were unlikely to know the names of a couple of us running backs of course they might have captured a prisoner and torn the countersign out of him pound didnt relax all the way he was glad to see lieutenant griffiths didnt either thats close enough soldier i dont know you griffiths said pound grinned down there where nobody but cecil bergman could see him maybe the lieutenant wasnt such a little boy after all yes sir the man in greengray said just wanted to let you know featherstons fuckers have armor coming forward one of our artilleryspotting airplanes saw the barrels all rightthanks griffiths said the soldier sketched a salute and left griffiths ducked down into the turret what do you think sergeant pound had enormous respect for artillery spotters they flew low and slow and often got shot down but that had only so much to do with the lieutenants question well sir if hes legit well find out pretty soon pound said yes griffiths said but that kind of message cant hurt us so he must be the real thing right well no sir not quite pound answered patiently he could have had a harmless message just waiting in case we were on our toes if he did hes out there looking for somebody else to screw oh griffiths said in a hangdog voice i didnt think of that a moment later softly and to himself he added dammit dont worry about it sir pound said you did what you were supposed to do nobody could ask for anything more im supposed to see more than you do though the barrel commander sounded fretful if i dont then you ought to be the officer i dont want to be an officer sir pound said for what had to be the hundredth time in his career senior enlisted men were supposed to curb junior officers enthusiasms that was at least as important a part of their job as anything else most junior officers didnt know it pound didnt know how to say it without offending the lieutenant if he didnt say anything griffiths couldnt get his ass in a sling he kept quiet a few minutes later the confederates laid on an artillery barrage griffiths kept the hatch up on the cupola as long as he could when gas rounds started gurgling in though he clanged it shut button up he yelled over the intercom to the driver and bow gunner then he put on his gas mask resignedly pound did the same with autumn here wearing it wasnt so awful as it had been during the summer even so it cut down his vision and it was awkward to use with a gunsight lieutenant griffiths had an even harder time seeing out the cupola periscopes through his masks portholes shrapnel clanged off the barrels chassis a barrage like this wasnt dangerous to armor except in case of an unlucky direct hit pound traversed the turret so the big gunthe pretty big gun anywaybore on the approach route he would use if he were a confederate barrel commander griffiths set a hand on his shoulder to say he understood and approved not much later the barrel commander sang out front identified pound answeredhe saw the ugly beast too range you lined up on him so nicely sergeant griffiths said go ahead and do the honors yes sir pound said and then to bergman armorpiercing armorpiercing the loader echoed and slammed a round in the breech pound adjusted the main armaments elevation just a little the cs barrel came on sure nothing nasty was in the neighborhood pound wouldnt have been that confident the enemy machine was one of the new models maybe that made the commander feel invulnerable infantrymen in butternut loped alongside automatic rifles at the ready the us barrels gun spoke pounds mask kept out the cordite fumes the shell casing clanged on the fighting compartment floor hit lieutenant griffiths yelled thats a hit smoke and fire spurted from the stricken cs barrel the us bow gunner opened up on the confederate foot soldiers one of them spun his rifle flying out of his hands he crumpled right out there in the open other confederate soldiers went down too they were more likely diving for cover than hit nobody came out of the barrel flames and a cloud of smoke burst from the cupola hatch five men dead pound thought and then well they wanted to kill me i like it better this way he tapped lieutenant griffiths sir shouldnt we move out of here and find another firing position next enemy barrel that comes this way is going to know where were at most ambushes only work once good point the barrel commander said and then over the intercom to the driver back us out mancatelli shift us over behind that pile of bricks to the left he hadnt been ready to move quite soon enough but hed had a backup firing position in mind when he did it was a pretty good one too michael pound would have suggested it if griffiths hadnt seen it himself but he had no he wasnt such a helpless puppy after all after the barrel backed out of the garage mancatelli stayed in reverse long enough to move forward toward the secondary position that kept the front glacis plate and the front of the turret facing the direction from which the barrel was likeliest to take fire it avoided exposing the machines thinner side armor those who served in barrels knew their weaknesses bestexcept maybe for those who tried to destroy them peering out through the gunsight pound saw soldiers in butternut pointing to where the barrel had been that probably meant they were warning it was still there nobody pointed toward the wreckage behind which it now hunkered down if a machine weighing upwards of twenty tons could be sneaky this one had just done the trick and here came a pair of confederate barrels front griffiths sang out the one on the right sergeant identified pound acknowledged bergman were going to have to do this fast as hell because that other bastard will start shooting at us as soon as we nail his pal he assumed he would nail the first barrel he had all the arrogance a good gunner should as he traversed the turret he added so give me two rounds of armorpiercing fast as you can when i say now now the first round clanged home pound fired he got his hit on the enemy barrels turret the second round was in the breech well before hed brought the gun to bear on the second confederate barreland the new turret had a hydraulic traverse too a feature he adored his gun and the enemys belched fire at the same instant the cs barrel burst into flames the confederates round slammed into the rubble slammed through the rubble but slowed enough so that it clanged off the us barrels glacis plate instead of penetrating two hits two griffiths yelled he pounded pound on the back cecil bergman thumped him on the leg which was the only part of him the loader could reach they both told him what a wonderful fellow he was thank you sir he said to griffiths then he added id like to go on being wonderful a while longer too so could we please find another firing position griffiths laughed but the barrel moved that was all that really mattered night came earlier now as autumn deepened us bombers could spend more time above richmond and other confederate cities jake featherston hated that as much as he loved cs bombers being able to spend more time over cities in the united states except for that night and day meant little to him in the shelter under what was left of the gray house he slept in odd chunks a couple of hours here three there and stayed awake in equally odd chunks between the stretches of sleep everyone around him had to adapt to that if jake was awake at four in the morning and needed to talk to nathan bedford forrest iii forrest could damn well get his ass over to the gray house at four in the morning the same went for ferd koenig and clarence potter and saul goldman and lulu and the rest of his inner circle he seemed to thrive on his erratic sleep schedule no one else did lulu stuck her head into his underground office she was paler than she should have been she didnt get up into the sun and fresh air as often as she should these days jake suspected he was paler than he should have been too he didnt like being stuck down here but he didnt like getting blown up either general forrest is here to see you mr president she said well send him on in jake replied did he tell you what it was all about forrest had asked for this meeting jake hadnt summoned him the chief of the general staff had been coy about saying just what was on his mind too but featherstons secretary shook her head no sir all right never mind ill find out jake said nathan bedford forrest iii strode into the office and saluted mr president he said and then freedom and then may i shut the door go ahead featherston answered forrest had a pistol in his holster he was one of the handful of men allowed to bear arms in jakes presence jake didnt think forrest had come here to plug him if forrest had he wouldnt waste time with the door hed just go ahead and do it jake waved him to a chair and asked whats up mr president it seems to me weve done a pretty good job of making pittsburgh useless to the damnyankees forrest said weve smashed it up so the steel production theres gone straight to hell most of what the mills do make the usa cant get out of the city do we really need to hold the ground damn straight we do jake said without even a heartbeats hesitation we need to show those bastards we can beat em anywhere we please and besides the second we ease up that townll come back to life like a monster in a horror flick you know it as well as i do too forrest looked unhappy sir what i know is the damnyankees are chewing up men and barrels and airplanes we cant afford to lose theyve got more people than we do dammit and thats what theyre using between us we and the yankeesve knocked pittsburgh cockeyed they squat in the ruins and potshoot us well lick em jake declared thats why every infantrymans got an automatic weapon put enough lead in the air and the other guys fall over dead sir its not that simple nathan bedford forrest iii said fighting like that there are no good targets they make us come to them and then they make us pay for coming weve got crack regiments knocked down to the size of a couple of companies units just arent the same when you have to rebuild em after losses like that its the same way with barrels they pick a spot they wait and then they shoot first their new models arent as good as ours but getting the first shot off counts for a hell of a lot especially at short range were losing barrels as fast as we can build em and were losing veteran crews too that just isnt good terrain for armor to attack in whatever were losing theyre losing worse jake said forrest nodded which didnt mean he agreed yes sir they are he said but they can afford it better this is how we got in trouble in the last war he hadnt been old enough to fight in the last war jake had been in it from first day to last that a pup should have the nerve to tell him what had happened and what hadnt we are going to take pittsburgh featherston said in a voice like iron we are well take it and well hold it and if the damnyankees want it back theyll have to kiss our ass thats the way its gonna be general have you got it yes sir nathan bedford forrest iii got to his feet he stood at stiff attention he saluted with machinelike precision he did a smart aboutturn and marched out of the presidents office he didnt slam the door he closed it silently which was even more sarcastic i havent convinced that man jake muttered but forrest would follow orders when he got them that was what soldiers were for and pittsburgh would fall and when it did the united states would have to make peace they couldnt very well fight a war if they didnt have anything to fight with could they sometimes the fellows in the fancy uniforms started flabbling over nothing forrest hadnt been one to do that but he was doing it now jake had no doubts he hardly ever had doubts that was why hed got where he was why the freedom party had got where it was people with doubts stopped before they ought to if you just kept going youd get there and he was going to get pittsburgh lulu came in mr president mr goldman is here to see you he says its urgent well then id better find out what he wants eh jake wondered what had gone wrong something must have or saul wouldnt come to his office uninvited the director of communications gave him the news in three bald words another people bombing son of a bitch jake said where how bad jackson mississippi sir goldman answered a waiter at a restaurant there last night it was crowdedsome kind of ladies club function eleven known dead at least forty hurt plus the nigger of course featherston said yes sir plus him two other waiters were also injured goldman paused how do you want to treat this mr president i hate to say it but keeping quiet about what the mormons are doing in the usa hasnt worked jake knew why he hated to say it saying it meant saying jake featherston was wrong but goldman had said it and jake couldnt very well claim not talking about people bombs had kept them from scarring the csa he made a discontented noise down deep in his throat he wanted to say exactly that but he had to deal with the truth no matter how little he liked it he thought for a few seconds then nodded to himself all right heres how well play it you can splash this one all over the papers saul a ladies club you say make it an atrocity story to end all atrocity stories then nigger murders confederate white women thatll make peoples blood boil and you can let folks know all the coonsll pay for what that one bastard went and did goldman didnt always show everything he thought by the way he brightened now that was what hed wanted to hear and hed wanted very much to hear it yes sir mr president he said enthusiasm bubbling in his voice that sounds like just the right line to take ill handle everything dont you worry about it i dont jake said simply if i worried about the way you did your job saul somebody else would be doing it and you can take that to the bank uh yes sir goldman said jake didnt want him scared so he made himself smile that did the trick goldman got to his feet and said ill get right on it if youll excuse me go on go on featherston said indulgently the director of communications hurried away jake got on the telephone ferd you heard about the shit that happened in jackson yeah saul told me just now eleven dead plus the nigger jesus christ how fast can you get the party mobilized to help the cops and soldiers that quick good by this time thursday then i dont want one nigger left in jacksonnot one you hear me and when they get where theyre going i dont want em hanging around either you see to it thats all bye he hung uphe slammed down the telephone as a matter of fact he wasted a few seconds swearing at the mormons those damned fanatics had come up with a weapon other fanatics could use mississippi and alabama had been in revolt since he took office and they hadnt been what anybody would call calm even before that too damn many coons that was all there was to it well he aimed to thin em out and what he aimed at he got he wondered whom lulu would announce when she came in again instead of announcing anybody she asked when was the last time you ate something mr president why before jake could finish talking his stomach let out a rumble you could hear across the room been a while i guess he said sheepishly ill get the kitchens to send you something she wagged a finger at him youve got to take care of yourself you know right jake said i have been busy you know he was amazed at how defensive he sounded he could ream out the chief of the general staff and stop him in his tracks his own secretary that was a whole different story what made the difference lulu was right and nathan bedford forrest iii damn well wasnt so he told himself anyhow not ten minutes later lulu came back with a tray with two thick roastbeef sandwiches potato salad and a bottle of beer jake got outside the food in nothing flat he did feel better afterwards he wasnt about to admit it to her on the other hand he didnt have toshe would already know his restless energy burned off what he ate and left him with the same lanky frame hed had half a lifetime before he knew he wasnt as strong as he had been then though he wasnt fat but his muscles had gone soft and slack he didnt get the exercise he once had manhandling a field gun was a lot tougher physically than being president of the csa and running things from behind a desk i ought to put in time every day at something hard anyway he muttered to himself something dammit when you got past fifty you had to take care of yourself the way you took care of a motorcar youd break down if you didnt and replacement parts for your carcass were mighty hard to come by but he had no idea what to do to keep fit he couldnt imagine himself playing golf or riding a bicycle or anything like that plain old calisthenics like the ones from his army days were too boring to stand without a drill sergeant making you do them and where would he find the time anyway he didnt have time to do everything he needed to do now he muttered again this time blasphemously he knew what would happen he wouldnt find the time and then six months or a year from now hed be even angrier and more disgusted with himself because hed be that much further out of shape he didnt have any good answers though the only way he could find the time to exercise was to stop being president he wasnt about to do that some of his pilots took pep pills to stay awake when they needed to fly mission after mission after mission hed always stayed away from those coffee and his own drive kept him going but if coffee and his own drive flagged he shrugged it was something to think about anyway he didnt have to make up his mind once and for all right this minute if he ever decided he needed those pills he could get em richmond capitol square a cool gray fall day with the smell of burning leaves in the airalong with other less pleasant smells of burning and death clarence potter sat on a bench in the bombcratered square and looked at the enormous pyramids of sandbags surrounding the great statues of george washington and albert sidney johnston the egyptians wouldnt have been ashamed of pyramids like those so far theyd done their job despite all the damnyankee bombing raids both statues remained more or less intact the confederate capitol couldnt be sandbagged it looked more like a ruin from the days of greece and rome than a place where important things happened and important things didnt happen there anymore congress met somewhere else these daysexactly where was classified potter wasnt sure why what difference did it make even if the usa blew congress clean off the map what difference would it make jake featherston and the freedom party ran the csa these days congress was a rubber stamp and a sounding board and that was about it potter lit a cigarette adding more smoke to the air that had already made him cough twice he looked at his watch the man he was supposed to meet here was late and he shouldnt have been had something gone wrong but when he looked up nathan bedford forrest iii was picking his way across the battered ground forrest already had a cigarette going the coal furiously red he sat down next to potter and smoked in angry silence for a minute or so then he said i do thank you kindly for coming i should get out and about more often potter answered keeps me fresh whats on your mind instead of answering right away forrest lit another cigarette he smoked it halfway down blowing out an almost continuous stream of smoke at last he asked do you think jake featherstons got all his oars in the water whatever potter had expected that wasnt it he looked around again to make sure nobody was paying extra attention to a couple of officers sitting on a park bench seeing nothing and no one out of the ordinary he said well i havent always been in love with the manwhich was a bigger understatement than nathan bedford forrest iii might realizebut i never thought he was ready for the straitjacket either how come you do forrest hesitated again potter had no trouble figuring out whyif he went telling tales to the president the chief of the general staff was a dead man but forrest must have known that before he asked to meet with potter the intelligence officer gestured impatiently as if to say piss or get off the pot unhappily forrest said well things arent going as well as we wish they were in pittsburgh that makes me unhappy but it doesnt make jake featherston a candidate for the booby hatch potters voice was desertdry no of course not nathan bedford forrest iii looked down at the ground between his feet he bent and picked up something a little chunk of shrapnel from a bomb casing with a grimace he tossed it away but a few days ago i went and asked him if maybe we wouldnt do better just wrecking pittsburgh than throwing away more men and materiel than we can afford and potter asked theres always an and to a story like that oh there is forrest said and he damn near threw me out of his officedamn near threw me through the door matter of fact were going to take pittsburgh take it away from the damnyankees come hell or high water no matter how many soldiers or barrels or airplanes we lose he just wouldnt listen to me it was like he couldnt listen to me his mind was made up and nothing anybody could say would change it and so potter said the presidents never been what youd call good at listening to other people or changing his mind i dont suppose hed be president if he were because he would have quit trying a long time ago not liking jake featherston didnt mean you could ignore his furious driving almost demonic energy this wasnt like a stubborn man talking forrest saidstubbornly this was likelike a crazy man talking he looked relieved at finally getting that out by god potter it really was all right lets say it was potter knew he sounded as if he might be humoring a lunatic himself if it was what do you propose to do about it bear in mind that were in the middle of a small disagreement with our neighbors right now his wave encompassed the sandbagged statues the cratered square the ruins of the confederate capitol nathan bedford forrest iiis eyes followed his hand forrest grimaced again as if he hadnt noticed how things were till then maybe he hadntmaybe he hadnt let himself jesus christ if we followed a nut into this war you didnt reckon he was a nut as long as things went our way potter said brutally forrest flinched potter went on do you really think this is the time to start plotting a coup detat thats what it would have to be you know youd have to take him down hed never leave or change on his own i do understand that forrest said thats why i wanted to talk to you you were a redhot whig even after it wasnt safe to be a whig anymore he did know a fair bit about potters past then if anybody could see the need for putting our house in order i reckoned youd be the man for gods sake potter we cant afford to lose another war it would ruin us for good this ones a long way from lost we may get pittsburgh yet part of potter wanted to leap at any chance to cast down jake featherston that made him even more careful about what he said than he would have been otherwise he didnt think forrest was trying to entrap himthe other officer sounded too upset for thatbut he wasnt a hundred percent sure when three men plot one is a fool and two are government spies what about two men im already a spy potter thought he laughed inside though he held his face straight but he was a spy for the confederate states he wasnt a spy for jake featherston and the freedom party and he was damned if hed turn into one and if he did ever turn into such a debased creature he doubtless would be damned so we may forrest spoke cautiously too but how likely do you think that is what with the way things look now i dont know potter said the exact and literal truth he thought about henderson fitzbelmont over at washington university he thought about and and the trouble fitzbelmont and his fellow physicists were having in separating the one from the other he had no idea whether forrest knew about fitzbelmonts project he couldnt ask either for fear the chief of the general staff didnt if the physicists could build their bomb the csa would win the war drop one of those on pittsburgh and it wouldnt cause problems anymore drop one on philadelphia one on new york city one on boston one on pontiac that would knock the united states flat and kick them in the teeth while they were down then potter thought about the us project in washington state he thought about bombs blowing richmond and atlanta and louisville and birmingham and new orleans and dallas off the map it was a race a race into the unknown whoever first played prometheus and stole fire from the gods would drop that fire on his enemies heads he tried to imagine fighting a war where both sides had bombs like that his mind recoiled like a horse shying at a snake that wouldnt be submachine guns at two paces it would be flamethrowers at two paces and what sort of weapons would you use in the war after that one to his surprise the answer formed almost as soon as the question did you would fight that next war with rocks were on the tigers back right now and weve got hold of his ears he said not knowing and not much caring whether he was talking about featherston or about the war if you tell me thats not where we want to be i wont argue with you but if you say wed do better letting go and jumping off i have to say i think youre out of your mindsir do you want don partridge trying to run things he supposed hed been talking about jake after all nathan bedford forrest iii hissed like a wounded snake himself damn you potter you dont fight fair i didnt know that was part of the requirement potter said i thought the only thing you had to do was win thats it forrest agreed and thats what i wanted to ask you do you think we can win the war with jake featherston in charge of things do you think we can win without him potter asked in return do you think we can even get out of the war without him he didnt ask about getting out of the war with featherston still in the gray house that wouldnt happen period exclamation point even forrest sat on the bench with a faraway look in his eyes potter suspected his own face bore a similar expression how would the confederate states do if they had to fight on without that pillar of fire at their heart no he didnt love featherstonfar from it he did reluctantly respect him slowly the chief of the general staff got to his feet maybe well talk about this another time he said i hope we dont but maybe we will he tipped his hat and walked away a starling perched in a shattered tree not far from where potter sat it chirped metallically the shimmering summer gloss was off its feathers it wore a duller autumn plumage potter swore under his breath the gloss was off the war too he thought of one question he hadnt asked himself before could the csa win even with jake featherston at the helm potter had thought so when the barrels charged from the ohio up to lake erie he hadnt believed he was guilty of the old confederate error of underestimating how tough the damnyankees were he hadnt believed it but evidently he was because the united states refused to fold up would even the fall of pittsburgh knock them out of the fight again he just didnt know and did nathan bedford forrest iii know what he was talking about was the president of the confederate states of america nuttier than a fivedollar fruitcake potter shook his head that was the wrong question if featherston was nuttier than a fivedollar fruitcake what about it being out of your tree didnt necessarily disqualify you from holding office some people said only a crazy man would want to be president of the csa potter wasnt one of them but he could see their point was featherston crazy enough to be unfit to lead during wartime that was what it came down to potter would have loved to believe it he wouldnt have been sorry for an excuse to throw jake featherston out on his earno to kill him because he wouldnt go without a fight and hed fight hard he always did forrest said hed seemed crazy when he refused to pull back from pittsburgh maybe the chief of the general staff was right but potter wasnt ready to upset the confederate applecart on a maybe featherston was at least as likely to be crazy like a fox hed proved that time and again taking pittsburgh might prove it once more better to wait potter murmured acting was irrevocable and he didnt think the time ripe if going into pittsburgh proved a fiasco well so what did that mean featherston had gone around the bend or just that hed made a mistake did it matter if pittsburgh proved a fiasco the confederate states were in trouble either way somebody would have to take the blame who else but jake featherston then nodding to himself potter got to his feet with one more thing to worry about if pittsburgh proved a fiasco who took the blame might not matter either to say jefferson pinkard was not a happy man failed to use the full power of language somebody in richmond got a brainstorm who got to make that brainstorm real pinkard did some damnfool negro in jackson blew himself up and a bunch of white women with him yeah all right he was a dirty stinking son of a bitch but get rid of all the negroes in jackson on account of him at once that was lunacy that was also what jeff had orders to do when the telegram came in he telephoned ferdinand koenig and asked how many niggers are we talking about here hell i dont know off the top of my head the attorney general answered which did not fill jeff with confidence koenig said ill get back to you this afternoon you want to know what youre getting into do you you might say so pinkard said tightly yeah you just might ferdinand koenig was as good as his word just after jeffs lunch he got another telegram twentyfive or thirty thousand fk it said what pinkard said when he saw that had an f and a k in it too with a couple of other letters in between he said several other things right afterwards most of them even hotter than what hed started with once his spleen was well and truly ventedonce it had blown off about three counties worth of steamhe called vern green into his office and gave the guard chief the news well jesus christ green said we got to get rid o these niggers we dont just try and stuff em on in here thats what the orders are jeff said grimly how soon they gonna start coming green asked i dont exactly knownot exactly pinkard answered but it wont be longi sure as hell know that fast as they can throw em on trains and ship em out here a few daysa week tops you figuring on using the bathhouses and the trucks jeff nodded dont see how weve got even a prayer of doing it if we dont you get the dozer crews out to the other place too and have em dig lots of new trenches if were doing all of jackson thatll take up some room he didnt talk about mass graves not in so many words the guard chief followed him even so ill see to it he promised were gonna be busy as shit aint we no jeff answered green looked at him in surprise he condescended to explain well be a hell of a lot busier than that oh yeah green said wish to god i could tell you you were wrong but thats how its gonna be all right he scowled well have a fuck of a time keeping the rest of the niggers from figuring out whats goin on too uhhuh that already crossed my mind pinkard said dont know what we can do about it we got orders on thisorders right from the top ferdinand koenig wasnt the top of course but he was only one short step down and hed made it real clear the president of the csa wanted every black from jackson wiped off the face of the earth what jake featherston wanted jake featherston got green sighed well well just have to take care of that when it turns into a problem thats all in the meantime in the meantime ill let the boys know a big pile of shits rolling down the hill and were on the bottom he got to his feet freedom freedom jeff echoed the guard chief left his office jeff pulled his copy of over open sights off the shelf by his desk he knew just the passage he was looking for the one where featherston talked about how killing off a few thousand negroes before the great war would have saved a lot of trouble during and after jeff nodded to himself that was true every word of it when he read the words he could hear jake featherstons hot angry voice even so after a while he scratched his head and put down the book this didnt seem the same as that people on the outside would know jacksons blacks had been sent away to camps but that was all they would know even the negroes already in the camps werent supposed to know theyd never come out alive so what exactly was the point but that did have an answer the point was to get rid of as many spooks as the freedom party and the confederate government could arrange to get rid of jeff didnt see anything wrong with what the party wantedjust the opposite but doing it in such a big lump made things work less smoothly than they might have less smoothly than they should camp determinations profile was going to look like a boa constrictor that had swallowed a big old pig youd be able to see the lump the pig made as it worked its way from one end of the snake to the other both sides of the camp mens and womens were on edge even before the first trains rolled in out of the east the negroes knew something was going on even if they didnt know what they must have got that from the guards pinkard thought about reaming vern green out about it but he didnt the guards wouldnt have been human if they didnt pass on the feeling that something was cooking they hadnt said what for which jeff was duly grateful he went out to watch his crews at work when the first train from jackson came in he was proud of them they had a routine and they stuck to it as much as they could they hauled the luckless blacks off the train and separated them men to the left women and children off to the right then they went through the train and pulled out any negroes whod tried to get cute and hide then more blacksmen as close to trusties as camp determination heldremoved the bodies of those whod died on the way there were more of those than usual the survivors moaned about how theyd been packed like sardines about how they hadnt had anything to eat or drink most of them moaned about how they hadnt even been able to pack a carpetbag the guards did their best to soothe them dont yall worry bout a thing a troop leader called reassuringly smooth and confident as a preacher in the pulpit were gonna ship some of you out to other camps right away and were gonna let the rest of you get cleaned up before we move you you do what people tell you and youll be just fine this way guards yelled this way the negroes obeyed they were too dazed and battered not toand the guards had automatic weapons to make sure they didnt get out of line most of them didnt even try one man did ask how come we gonna git shipped somewheres else when we only just got here nobody answered him and he didnt ask twice listen up yall an officer shouted youre gonna be in two groups one group goes on to a camp by lubbock the other one goes down by el paso there were camps in both places small ones they were there mainly to keep negroes from panicking when they heard something like that the officer went on those of you bound for the lubbock camp were gonna bathe and delouse yall right here on account of we got bigger bathhouses than they do at that camp yall goin to el paso theyll take care of that when you get there pinkard and his top officers had hammered out the story in the time before the trains started coming in he didnt like it it had holes you could throw a dog through but it gave some kind of explanation anyway and the negroes wouldnt have much time to wonder and worry guards started going along the lines of negroes they would say lubbock to some and el paso to others every so often they would add remember where youre supposed to go or youll catch hell when everybody had an assignment officers yelled el paso this way and lubbock this way two columns of men and two of women and children formed now get moving the officers shouted a fat black woman let out a screech my husband goin to de one place an i is goin to de other one the baby she held in her arms wailed cant do anything about it now a troop leader told her when you get where youre goin you talk to the people there theyll do the paperwork and transfer you she still grumbled but she seemed happier pinkard craned his neck to see who that troop leader was hobart martin that was his name hed won himself a commendation letter sure as hell that kind of complaint could have caused real trouble maybe even a riot it was something the guards hadnt thought of and they should have of course separating families made people jump and shout but martin had calmed the woman down and his words kept other men and women from raising a stink as long as they thought everything would be taken care of pinkard nodded to himself everything would be taken care of all right he went with the men who believed they were bound for el paso they had to marchor rather shambleall the way through the camp to get to the bathhouse that wasnt hed posted guards with automatic rifles on both sides of their route he didnt think they would try to break away but he worried that the present inmates might try to rescue them a show of force ahead of time was the best thing he could think of to keep that from happening move along move along guards shouted dont hold up the line or youre in trouble they were already in the worst trouble they could find but they didnt know it this whole charade was to keep themand the present inmatesfrom finding out hipolito rodriguez stood there with a rifle at the ready like most men from the confederate veterans brigades hip liked a submachine gun better because it was lighter and smaller but jeff wanted the guards to have weapons with real stopping power today he nodded to rodriguez the sonoran nodded back then he looked away scanning the inmates for any sign of trouble he knew how things worked the more you showed that you were ready for anything the less likely you were to run into trouble jeff nodded to himself when the last black man passed through the gateway separating the main camp from the bathhouse getting the line through the camp was the hardest most worrisome part already trucks were taking away the first negroes who thought they were heading for el paso their true journey would be a lot shorterand a good thing too because jeff would need those trucks again pretty damn quick to handle more blacks he nodded again when the door to the bathhouse closed behind the last negro man in the queue wasnt there some poem that went all hope abandon ye who enter here once that door closed those negroes lost their last hope theyd get herded into the big room that wasnt a delousing chamber and that would be that when was the next train coming would the camp be able to handle it could the crew get the corpses out of the alleged bathhouse could the trucks get back from the mass grave fast enough they could they did by the time the next trainload of negroes from jackson stopped on the spur between the mens and womens camps the guards were ready the next week was the busiest time jeff remembered he and his crew ran on sleep snatched in the intervals between trains and on endless cigarettes and cups of coffee every storage facility in the camp overflowed even if relatively few of the negroes had brought baggage with them where those negroes went they didnt need baggage and at the end of it jefferson pinkard looked at vern green and said by god we reduced that population sure as hell did the guard chief agreed jeff pulled a pint of whiskey out of his desk drawer he took a snort then passed the pint to green the number two man at camp determination also drank after what theyd just been through theyd damn well earned the booze black clouds boiled up over andersonville georgia where the sky wasnt black it was an ugly yellow the color of a fading bruise the rising wind blew a lock of jonathan moss hair into his eyes he tossed his head the wind got stronger a raindrop hit him in the nose he looked around the prisoncamp grounds pows were heading into the barracks as fast as they could that looked like a hell of a good idea the wind tugged at his clothes as he hurried toward shelter well ill be damned one of the other prisoners said when he walked in moss does have the sense to come in out of the rain pows laughed hell moss laughed himself in andersonville fun was where you found it and you didnt have a lot of places to look but captain nick cantarella whod come in just ahead of moss said noah would find someplace to hide from this it looks like a bastard and a half out there worse than that storm this summer somebody said i think maybe cantarella answered and moss found himself nodding that had been a cloudburst to end all cloudbursts yeah it had also been a cloudburst to end all escape plans at least for the time being but whatever was building out there now looked downright vicious the light was weird almost flickering it might have come from the trickphotography department of a bad horror film somebody sitting close by a window said son of a bitch several people asked him what was going on he pointed the guards are coming down from their towers and running like hell jesus moss said which was one of the milder comments in the barracks the grayuniformed guards never left the towers unmanned never they always wanted to be able to rake the camp with machinegun fire if they were bailing out now oh fuck said the man by the window then he said something even worse tornado somebody with a flat indiana accent said open the doors quick itll try and suck all the air out of any building it comes close to if the air cant get out the buildingsll blow up moss whod shut the door behind him quickly opened it again the midwesterner sounded like a man who knew what he was talking about pows crowded toward windows to watch the twister moss didnt he didnt want to be anywhere near glass that was liable to splinter and fly as if a bomb went off close by godalmightydamn will you look at that motherfucker somebody said more reverently than otherwise wish to hell we had a storm cellar somebody else put in that made good sense moss wished for one too what they had were barracks built as flimsily as the geneva convention allowed or maybe a little cheaper than that if the tornado plowed into them it wouldnt even notice everybody unlucky enough to be inside sure would though he could hear it now and feel it too it sounded like the worlds biggest freight train heading straight for him that wasnt really fair to the tornado if it ran into a train it would scatter railroad cars like jackstraws the lord is my shepherd somebody began the twentythird psalm seemed right the battle hymn of the republic might have fit even better because the lord was doing some serious trampling out there wind tugged at moss trying to pull him out the open door the officer whod suggested opening it knew what was what that air would have escaped anyway with the doors open it could get out without forcing itself out moss stepped away from the door the flow wasnt strong enough to keep him from doing that he looked over his shoulder and got a glimpse of the onrushing funnel cloud that made him do a little praying of his own hed known one or two tornadoes when he lived near chicago but only one or two they visited downstate illinois more often and they visited the csa looks like its not gonna hit us somebody saidshouted actually because that was the only way anyone could make himself heard through the roar and scream of the wind maybe the man whod yelled was a bombardier whoever he was he seemed able to gauge what that horrid funnel would do instead of blowing the barracks to hell and gone it walked along a couple of hundred yards away a few windows blew out but that was all the damage they took the twister snarled away toward the east lord a pow said which summed things up pretty damn well nick cantarella looked outside he said my god too but in an altogether different tone of voice the captain from new york city pointed that fucker just blew half the wire around the camp all the way to the moon prisoners rushed to the windows those that still had glass and those that didnt cantarella wasnt wrong the tornado cared no more about barbed wire and guard towers than it did about anything else in its path three men had the same thought at the same time lets get out of here that sounded good to jonathan moss he even had some brown confederate billsno they called them banknotes down herein his pocket the csa played by the rules of war and paid captive officers at the same rate as their own men of equivalent grade why not in camp the notes were only paper good for poker games but not much else if they catch you they can punish you colonel summers warned the senior us officer went on were a long way from the border odds of making it back to the usa arent good you might be smarter just sitting this one out summers had to say something like that moss understood as much someone needed to be careful and responsible and adult captain cantarella put the other side of things in perspective anybody whos gonna go better get his ass in gear right now those confederate bastards wont waste a hell of a lot of time hunkered down wherever theyre at theyll come out and theyll have guns that made up moss mind for him he wasnt the first one out the door but he was only a couple of steps behind the guy who was cantarella was hard on his heels how did the escape committee sign up a tornado moss asked him cantarellas grin was swarthy and stubbly and full of exhilaration hey mother nature owed us one after the way that thunderstorm fucked us over every once in a while i think maybe theres a god moss had thought so too till that canucks bomb robbed him of laura and dorothy believing in anything but revenge came hard after that he said you want to stick together two heads may be better than one long as we can anyway cantarella answered we may have to split up somewhere down the line but im with you till then he stuck out his hand moss shook it out past the wire they went out past the wreckage of the guard towers a machine gun stuck up from a clump of bushes wish it was a rifle moss said piece like that though its too heavy to lug yeah cantarella said what we gotta do now is we gotta make tracks somethin tells me we dont have a whole lotta time his clotted accent was about as far from a cs drawl as it could be the something that told him was no doubt common sense you think we have a better chance heading north or east toward the ocean moss asked depends the other us officer said if you figure our navys got boats or ships or whatever the hell out in the atlantic we haul ass that way god knows its closer but if we gotta sail up the coast fuhgeddaboutit unless youre a hell of a lot better sailor than i am john paul jones im not moss answered and cantarella laughed what the italian said made an unfortunate amount of sense moss faced the general direction of atlanta north then right maybe we can steal some clothes so we look like a coupla ordinary confederate assholes buy train tickets and get up to richmond or somewheres in style cantarella said they carried no papers they wore elderly us uniforms cantarella did remember that they had the wrong accent they probably didnt have enough money for train tickets but for those minor details it struck moss as a terrific plan he didnt criticize not out loud he liked the idea of hoofing it across georgia the carolinas and virginia no better than cantarella did they hadnt got very far into the pine woods north of andersonville before gunshots rang out behind them ahhh shit cantarella said which summed up moss feelings too the guards had noticed prisoners escaping then without nick cantarella moss figured he would have been recaptured in short order the younger man was an infantry officer and actually knew what he was doing as he clumped along on the ground he and moss splashed along creeks to throw hounds off the scent didnt they do this in uncle toms cabin moss said beats me cantarella answered all i know is this shit works maybe it did moss heard several more bursts of gunfire but he didnt see any cs prison guards or soldiers he did get tired his feet got sore he knew he was slowing cantarella down if you want to go on without me its all right he said nah cantarella shook his head like you said two heads are better than one sides you can come closer to talking like these assholes than i can i wonder moss said midwest overlain by canadian didnt sound much more confederate than strong new york city he figured hed worry about that when he had to not before he had other things to worry about now not only his feet but also the growing emptiness in his belly if this were a planned escape he would have brought food along now he and cantarella would be raiding henhouses before long that would leave a trail a blind idiot or even a confederate guard could follow they came out of the woods into cotton country moss had always pictured swarms of darkies in the fields with hoes it wasnt like that except for a cultivator chugging along in the distance the countryside was eerily empty cantarella had the same thought whered all the smokes go he said beats me moss had trouble believing the atrocity stories hed heard seeing that landscape without people though he had less trouble than before he and nick went on up a poorly paved road till nightfall then they lay down by the roadside all they had to cover themselves with were cotton plants that would help give them away too but it got chilly after the sun went down the plants werent good blankets but they were better than nothing moss wasnt sure he could fall asleep on bare ground five minutes later he was snoring morning twilight turned the eastern sky gray when he woke but the growing light wasnt what roused him those voices werent just part of his dreams he saw three men silhouetted against the sky they all carried rifles he nudged nick whod stayed asleep wake up he hissed were caught one of the armed men came up to them in a low voice he asked you some o the yankees what got outa andersonville thats right suddenly hope flared in moss are you fighting against the confederate government bet your ass ofay the rifletoting negro answered how you like to hep us moss looked toward nick cantarella cantarella was looking back at him moss didnt think it was the sort of invitation they could refuse not if they wanted to keep breathing he got to his feet ignoring creaks and crunches i think we just joined the underground he said nick cantarella nodded should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should auld acquaintance be forgot and days o auld lang syne scipio didnt think hed ever heard auld lang syne sung when it wasnt new years eve he didnt think hed ever heard it sung in such a variety of accents eithernone of them the least bit scots jerry dover grinned at the cooks and waiters and busboys and dishwashers hed bossed for so long id like to tell yall one thing he said they waited expectantly his grin got wider fuck you you sons of bitches they laughed like loons scipio laughed as loud as anybody but his mirth had a bitter edge with jerry dover gone all the negroes who worked for the huntsmans lodge were liable to get fucked who could say what the new manager would be like would he take care of his people the way dover had scipio supposed it wasnt impossible he also knew only too well it wasnt likely you go kill them damnyankees mistuh dover shoot em down like the yellow dogs they is a cook shouted he swigged from a bottle of champagne jerry dovers sendoff was going to put a dent in the restaurants liquor stock if i have to pick up a gun this countrys in deeper shit than anybody ever figured dover said and got another laugh its the quartermaster corps for me that actually made good sense the confederate army was doing it anyway jerry dover knew everything there was to know about feeding people feeding them in the army was different from doing it in a restaurant but not all that different hed help the csa more doing that than he would in the infantry and somebody must have realized as much scipio had an almostempty glass in his hand a moment later as if by magic it wasnt empty anymore he sipped he had had bourbon in there this was scotch hed feel like hell in the morning right now morning felt a million miles away tank you senor dover you give us work that was jose one of the dishwashers from the empire of mexico hed taken a job from a black man scipio wanted to hate him because of thatwanted to and found he couldnt jose was only trying to make a living for himself and he worked like a man with a gun to his head how could you hate somebody like that for hes a jolly good fellow the staff at the huntsmans lodge started singing again louder and more raucously than ever in some ways blacks and whites in the csa understood one another and got along with one another pretty well or they would have if the freedom party hadnt got in the way jerry dover hoisted his own glass hed been drinking as hard as his help you bastards are good he said sometimes i dont reckon yall know how good you are im gonna have to whip some new folks into shape and i dont figure theyll be a patch on you take us with you somebody behind scipio shouted in an instant everyone was yelling it take us with you take us with you hell i would if i could dover said i dont think thatll happen though the clamor went on all the same scipio understood why if these black men were busy cooking for soldiers and serving them theyd be less likely to go to a camp anythinganything at allseemed better than going to a camp i dont want anybody to get in trouble for being out too late dover said after a while the response to that was angry and profane this was a night of license and would have been even if not fueled by booze whatever the restaurant staff did short of burning the place down he would let them get away with it aurelius tapped scipio on the arm how you like bein an old man at a young mens fling the other veteran waiter asked long as is here scipio answered long as is anywhere amen aurelius said scipio beckoned him off to one side once the two old men had put a little distance between themselves and the rest of the staff scipio said tell you what i was afeared of i was afeared of a people bomb i done been through two auto bombs dont reckon id las if somethin else blow up around me auto bombs is nasty business aurelius said people bombs people bombs is worse he shuddered how you walk in somewhere knowin you got splosives strapped on you all you got to do is click the switch or whatever the helland then you is splattered all over the walls way things is nowadays lotta niggers reckon they gots nothin to lose scipio said aurelius nodded i know that i dont like it if it aint a judgment on the confederate states of america i dunno what would be but still no matter how bad things is is they ever bad enough to blow your ownself up dat nigger in jackson done thought so scipio said damn nigger was a waiter too my tips aint been the same since he done it your tips aint all thats hurtin aurelius reminded him they put all the niggers in jackson on trains an ship em off to camps all of em jus like that he snapped his fingers an the freedom party dont try to hide it or nothin hell the freedom party braggin to beat the band not too long after de great war end is in de park takin de air an who should come make a speech but jake featherston scipio shuddered at the memory even if it was almost a quarter of a century old everybody reckon he nothin but a crazy man i reckon de same thing back then but he scare de piss outa me even so aurelius looked around to see if anyone was listening to them once he was satisfied he said that featherston he aint nothin but a crazy man no regretfully scipio shook his head he a crazy man sho but he aint nothin but a crazy man you hear what is sayin nobody whos nothin but a crazy man kin do as much harm as jake featherston aurelius considered that he also considered his glass which was empty when he too shook his head scipio wasnt sure whether he mourned the empty glass or the freedom partys devastation then he said well you is right an i wish you wasnt he could do something about getting more whiskey nobody on the north american continent had had much luck doing anything about jake featherston scipio and aurelius reeled back to the terry together no explosions marred the night no automobiles going up in fireballs threw jagged metal and blazing gasoline in all directions no desperate negroes threw nails and chunks of themselves every which way except for a whippoorwills mournful call everything was peaceful and quiet you damn coons are late grumbled the cop who opened the gate for them even for yall youre late sorry suh scipio slurred we was sayin goodbye to our boss he goin into de army the cops left hand had only the thumb and index finger you didnt notice straight off probably because he kept that hand in his pocket whenever he could good luck to him he said you spooks dont know when youre well off you dont got to worry about shit like that was he right scipio didnt think so if negroes had the same privileges and rights as whites wouldnt they be glad to pick up rifles to help defend the confederacy it looked that way to him but if they had all those privileges and rights the confederacy they were defending would be a very different place just for openers it would be a place where jake featherston could never get elected and neither could anyone like him well it wasnt like that and it never would be the thump of the gate behind scipio and aurelius proved as much and proved it all too well he did have a headache when he got up cassius scowled at him how can you have a good time sayin so long to a damn ofay his son demanded with a sigh scipio answered it aint as simple as you think it is oh yeah cassius said scornfullyhed got to the point where he would quarrel with anything scipio said just because scipio said it how come on account of i be dead if jerry dover dont want me alive an workin there scipio said on account of you an your sister an your mama go to a campor else you jus end up dead too jerry dover still a damn ofay cassius said fine scipio didnt feel like arguing with him especially not with a head pounding like a drop forge he took a couple of aspirins they made his stomach sour but after a while his headache receded he hated walking through the cleanedout parts of the terry on his way to work that afternoon lawns grew tall and untended and full of weeds lots of houses had broken windows quite a few had doors standing open a skinny dog trotted out of one of them and gave scipio a hard stare if it were a little bigger it might have gone for him stray dogs scrounged whatever they could so did stray people the cleanouts hadnt missed many if not for jerry dover they wouldnt have missed scipio and his family and now dover was in the army scipio shook his head dreading what would come next hed got to the age where he feared any kind of change it was too likely to be change for the worse a white man waited just inside the kitchen entrance to the huntsmans lodge are you xerxes or aurelius he asked i is xerxes suh scipio answered the new manager was younger than hed expectedin his early forties he had a thin sharp clever face and cold blue eyes scipio didnt wonder why he wasnt in the army he sat in a wheelchair his legs thin and useless inside his trousers my names willard sloan he said and tapped the arms of the chair with his own arms which seemed fine a moment later he explained why stopped a damnyankee bullet with my back in i used to be a hell of a football player you know so much for that his mouth twisted then he went on jerry dover says youve been here since dirt if i need to know anything special im supposed to ask you i tells you anything i knows suh scipio meant it he didnt expect the white man to like him it might end up happening but he didnt expect it if sloan found him useful that would do almost as well all right if i have to pick your brains ill holler for now you just go on about your business the way you always have ill keep an eye on things cipher out how they are before i decide what works good and what needs tinkering fair enough suh dis place been de bes in town a long time sure enough want to keep it dat way scipio said he and the rest of the staff would be judging willard sloan as he judged them the only trouble was his judgment carried more weight than theirs he did start well when the cooks were unhappy with some of the beef they got he used the telephone like a deadly weapon you bastard you reckon you can screw me over on account of i aint dover he screamed at the butcher you reckon i dont know chet byers you reckon i wont do business with him from here on out if you ever pull this shit on me again make it right in fifteen minutes or i blacken your name all over town new beefof the proper qualitygot there in twelve minutes flat jerry dover couldnt have done better and there was no higher praise than that xvii autumn was when the leaves turned red and gold and then fell off the trees it was when the weather got crisp so your cheeks also turned red and tingled after youd stayed outside a while if you were a fisherman on the north atlantic it was when the ocean started tossing you around not knowingor caringyour boat was out there george enos jr was used to the rhythms of the changing year a massachusetts man had to be in the sandwich islands the year didnt change much the sun still rode high in the sky if not quite so high days remained warm everything stayed green bigger swells did start rolling in out of the north the townsend would slide up over a crest and then down into a trough that didnt seem enough to get excited about when george said so out loud fremont dalby laughed at him christ enos havent you had enough excitement for a while the gun chief said far as im concerned i can stay at my station and gather dust for a while because thatll mean nobodys trying to strafe the ship or drop a bomb on her or stick a torpedo up our ass japs are out there somewhere george said i know i know you dont got to remind me dalby said but i dont like thinking about it every goddamn minute you know what i mean sure chief george didnt want to get the cpo ticked off at him getting any cpo ticked off at you was a bad idea when the man in question happened to be your boss it was four times as bad they kept station with three other destroyers and with the trenton the escort carrier hadnt taken too much damage in her last brush with the japanese her airplanes had given out more than shed got that was the first real naval victory the usa had had in the islands around the sandwich islands for quite a while us fighters buzzed overhead they flew a dawntodusk combat air patrol the townsends yranging antenna went round and round yranging gear could spot incoming enemy aircraft while they were still well out to sea the other destroyers and the carrier all had sets too whatever else happened the japs wouldnt be able to get in a sucker punch at the little flotilla the trenton would be able to scramble all her fighters the destroyers would start throwing up as much antiaircraft as they could and after that what could you do but pucker your asshole and hope fritz gustafson pointed off to starboard the loader didnt bother with words when one finger would do fremont dalby wasnt shy about words though dolphins he said with a smile theyre supposed to be good luck heres hoping anyway george enjoyed the dolphins for their own sake they were swift and graceful and as always they looked as if they were having a good time out there i wonder what they make of us he said till we got ships like this they were some of the biggest toughest things in the ocean they figure were good for a handout anyway dalby said which was true they would follow ships for scraps and garbage sometimes though they would track ships for what looked like nothing more than the hell of it were they skylarking did they really have the brains to play more to the point did they have the brains not to want to work for their sake george hoped so four hours on four hours off when the other crew for the twin mm mount replaced dalbys george went below grabbed himself a couple of sandwiches and some coffee and then found his hammock he laughed as he climbed up into it whats so funny asked another sailor about to grab some shuteye used to be i couldnt sleep for beans in one of these goddamn things george answered used to be i couldnt hardly get into one without falling out on my ear but now i dont even think about it thats cause youre a real navy guy now the other sailor said getting up into his hammock as nimbly as a chimp might have you know how to do shit you arent a little lost civilian anymore looking for somebody to hold your hand and tell you what to do was i really that green george wondered wiggling to get comfortable he supposed he had been he knew the sea from his fisherman days but knowing the sea and knowing the navy werent the same thingnot even close he settled his cap over his eyes two minutes later he was snoring standing watch and watch wore on a man he felt groggy almost underwater when he slid out of the hammock and down to the deck again he got rid of some of the coffee hed drunk just after he came off the last watch then went back to the galley for more it might help keep him conscious anyway fremont dalby was at the gun when he got there the cpo looked fresh and fit maybe dalby didnt need to sleep george yawned he damn well did and he hadnt done enough of it all quiet he asked yeah dalby answered were getting up toward midway too uhhuh george looked north and west as if he expected the atoll to come over the horizon any minute now he didnt they werent that close not by three or four hundred miles anything from the yrange quiet as a mouse far as i know dalby said way it looks to me is the japs havent got a carrier operating south of the island makes sense george agreed if they did they wouldve figured out were around by now hell were almost close enough for landbased air from midway to spot us almost is the word the gun chief said and if they dont have a carrier operating south of midway we really have made them pull in their horns us coming up here is a lot better than them bombing the crap out of oahu you better believe it george said itd be good if we could push em off midway too where would they go then wake fremont dalby replied at once its another pissant little bird turd of an island southwest of midway but ill be damned if id want to hop from island to island across the whole stinking pacific toward japan oh good god no george shuddered at the very idea youd have to be crazy to try something like that youd have to be crazy to want to as long as they get out of the sandwich islands and stay away thats plenty this is a big goddamn ocean theres room enough for us and them thats how it looks to me too dalby said of course how it looks to philadelphia is anybodys guess the big brains back there can screw up anything if they put their minds to it minds he rolled his eyes if they had any wed all be better off treason fritz gustafson said off with your head dalby suggested that the loader lose some other organ important for happiness if not absolutely necessary for personal survival gustafson didnt say another word hed got his lick in and he was content georges watch passed quietly no warning shouts of approaching japanese airplanes came from the loudspeakers the hydrophones didnt pick up telltale noises from lurking japanese submersibles no torpedoes from lurking submersibles the hydrophone hadnt picked up arrowed through the water toward the townsend when the other crew took over the gun george went down to the galley for more sandwiches and coffee he felt as if hed done the same thing just a few hours earlier of course he had done the same thing so no wonder he felt that way these sandwiches were ham on wheat not corned beef on rye other than that he might have been running the film over again standing watch and watch made time blur george tried to come up with the name of the artist whod painted the pocket watch sagging and melting as if it were left out in the rain it was something foreign that was all he could remember yawning he headed for his hammock here we go again he said as he climbed up into it the sailor hed talked with the last time he sacked out laughed we gotta stop meeting like this he said people will get suspicious george laughed too a little nervously was that just a joke or did something faggoty hide underneath it aboard ship you always wondered the townsend went back to oahu often enough to let the crew get their ashes hauled on hotel street but you wondered anyway some guys were flatout queers no two ways about it and they couldnt have cared less about the floozies on hotel street but you couldnt call somebody on what was probably nothing but a harmless joke if the other guy didnt make another like it george figured he would forget about this one if he did ill worry about that later with another yawn an enormous one george decided to worry about everything later and went to sleep night had fallen when he came back up on deck with another mug of coffee it was cool and quiet no cap after dark fremont dalby got to the mm mount with a mug of his own he nodded to george and said weve got to stop meeting like this him too uh yeah george said he could imagine a lot of things but the gun chief as a homo never in a million years should be a little easier this time through dalby said we dont have airplanes coming at us with bombs or torpedoes during the night or trying to crash into us either george put in yeah that was fun wasnt it dalby said fun wasnt the word george would have used he didnt know which one he would have used but it wasnt one he would see in any family newspaper all we gotta worry about now is submarines fritz gustafson said as usual the loader didnt talk much also as usual he got a lot of mileage out of what he did say fremont dalbys suggestion about what submarines could do was illegal immoral and impossible george stared out over the black waters of the pacific starlight glittered off the sea but the moon was down a dozen submersibles could have been playing ring around the rosy half a mile from the townsend and he never would have known it out in the tropical atlantic a confederate boat had sneaked up on his fathers destroyer and sunk it in the middle of the night the same thing could happen to him at times like this he knew it much too well then dalby said those bastards have as much trouble finding us at night as we do finding them that was true enough and reassuring to boot besides what would a jap sub be doing out here in the middle of the night george wished he hadnt asked the question because he saw an obvious answer looking for american ships if a submersible could it would probably go after the trenton ahead of the townsend but it might take whatever it could get he kept his nerves to himself he didnt want his buddies to know hed got the wind up odds were he was flabbling over nothing he understood that which didnt make not doing it any easier the watch passed quietly no airplanes no submarines no nothing just the wide pacific and somewhere not far away the rest of the flotilla the other crew took over the gun george went below for food and coffee and sleep coffee had trouble keeping him awake through watch and watch he came back on at four in the morning and watched the sun rise out of the sea the flotilla turned away from midway during his watch and started back towards oahu now the united states were doing the poking he hoped japan liked getting poked hey mistuh guard suh hipolito rodriguez swung the muzzle of his submachine gun toward the negro whod spoken to him the motion was automatic and not particularly hostile he just didnt believe in taking chances what you want he asked what i want the skinny black man laughed mistuh guard suh i got me a list long as your arm but gettin let outa here do the job all by its ownself rodriguez waited stonily that wouldnt happen and the negro had to know it he did the laughter leaked out of his face as he went on what i wants to ask you suh is where them niggers from jackson is at now they come through here but they dont hardly stop for nothin some go to lubbock rodriguez answered some go to el paso he was stubborn about sticking to the story the guards told the negroes in camp determination not all the mallates believed it but they werent sure what really had happened which was all to the good this prisoner looked sly that a really fotrue fac suh of course it is rodriguez lied without hesitation he had as much of an interest in keeping the negroes quiet as jefferson pinkard did himself aint how i hear it the fellow said what you hear then rodriguez asked tell me what you hear tell me who you hear it from too well the negro suddenly realized he might have talked more than was good for him i aint so sure i recollects now no eh now the muzzle of rodriguezs submachine gun pointed toward the mans midsection in a businesslike way maybe we take you back maybe we ask some questions we find out who telling lies here si the black man couldnt turn pale if he could have he would have if he could have he would have disappeared since he couldnt he said you don need to do nothin like that mistuh guard suh my memory its much better all suddenlike bueno glad to hear it rodriguez said dryly tell me thenwhat you hear well the negro repeated he licked his lips i dont say this or nothinnot me i jus hear it rodriguez gestured impatiently with the submachine gun a weapon that could cut a man in half in the blink of an eye made a hell of a persuader the black man spoke up in a hurry some folks say them niggers didnt go nowheres some folks say they was kilt some folks were rightdead right who say stupid things like this rodriguez asked the negro hesitated he didnt want to squeal on his friends even with the threat from the submachine gun rodriguez asked a different question one that seemed safer on the outside what barracks you live in is in barracks twentyseven suh the negro said twentyseven rodriguez turned to the guards with him remember that will do troop leader the three of them said as if they were one man rodriguez had discovered he liked wearing three stripes on his sleeve he gave more orders than he took these days in orders as in many other things it was better to give than to receive he turned back to the negro i find you lie to me about where you at mallate this camp aint big enough for you to hide you understand i aint lyin mistuh guard suh the prisoner practically radiated innocenceand no doubt would keep doing it till rodriguez looked away or turned his back if is lyin is flyin if you lyin you dyin rodriguez capped the black mans rhyme with one of his own he gestured with the muzzle of the submachine gun once more this time in dismissal the prisoner scurried away glad to be out of the dread eye of officialdom troop leader how come we got to remember that barracks number asked one of the guards rodriguez swallowed a sigh some of these people had no business looking down their noses at negroes for stupidity patiently he answered because pruitt we got to do something about barracks twentyseven like what troop leader pruitt radiated innocence too the trouble was his was real aint gonna talk about it here rodriguez gestured once more this time with his left hand there were four of them in their gray uniforms all around them were negroes thousands of negroes even though the men in gray all carried submachine guns rodriguez found himself sweating despite the cooler weather the negroes could rush them other guards would come try to save them the machine gunners in the guard towers outside the barbedwire perimeter would fire till their gun barrels glowed cherry red they would massacre the blacks rodriguez doubted that would do him much good but no attack came he and his companions finished their patrol when they got back to the guards quarters he reported to an officer what the negro had told him hmm said the chief assault leaderthe equivalent of a captain in the freedom party guards what do you reckon we ought to do clean out barracks twentyseven sir rodriguez answered at once tell them we ship them somewhere else because they talk too much then put them in trucks or send them to the bathhouse hmm the chief assault leader said again i cant decide that ill have to pass it on up the line yes sir rodriguez said resignedly hed seen this sort of thing in the great war some officers knew what needed doing then went and did it others knew what needed doing then waited till somebody over them told them to do it they werent so useful as the first kind but they werent hopeless the ones who didnt know what needed doing those were the officers who got their men killed barracks twentyseven got cleaned out four days later than it should have but it did get cleaned out rodriguez was part of the crew that took care of it he wasnt sorry he wanted to see the job done he also wanted to see it done right gotta make sure we dont spook the spooks another guard said that summed things up though rodriguezs smile was more dutiful than amused hed heard that joke or ones too much like it too many times before a different chief assault leader was in charge of the cleanout rodriguez wouldnt have entrusted it to the man with whom hed spoken either this fellowhis name was higbehandled it with aplomb we are too goddamn crowded here he told the black men lined up in front of the barracks so were shippin your asses down to el paso yall go back in the barracks and get whatever you need much as you can keep on your lap in a truck he looked at his watch you got ten minutes get movin that was a nice touch nothing too bad could happen to a man if he could bring his handful of miserable possessions with him could it one negro hung back rodriguez recognized the black whod spoken to him before at the same time as the mallate recognized him instead of hurrying into the barracks the black man came over to him and said mistuh guard suh i dont want to go to no el paso he knows whats coming all right rodriguez thought i think we fix it so you dont got to he said aloud he didnt want the negro kicking up a fuss the less fuss the better for everybodyexcept the prisoners and they didnt count he went on let me talk to my officer we take care of it you stay here dont go nowhere lawd bless you suh the negro said rodriguez spoke briefly with chief assault leader higbe unlike the other officer higbe didnt hesitate he just nodded that sounds good to me troop leader you take care of it like you said yes sir rodriguez saluted and went back to the negro who was nervously shifting from foot to foot he nodded to the black man you come with me where you takin me suh guards quarters got some questions to ask you oh yes suh the negro almost capered with glee i sings like a canary long as you dont put me on no truck you dont want to go you dont go rodriguez said whats your name is demetrius suh the negro answered another fancy name rodriguez thought scornfully the more raggedy the mallate the fancier the handle he seemed to come with bueno demetrius his words gave no clue to what lay in his mind you come along demetrius came all smiles and relief none of the other prisoners took any special notice guards pulled blacks out of camp for one reason or another all the time what you need to know suh demetrius asked as they got near the barbed wire that segregated prisoners and guards dont matter what not hardly i tell you bueno rodriguez said once more he waved to the gate crew they opened up for him and demetrius rodriguez urged the negro on ahead of him as soon as buildings hid them from the prisoners view he fired a shot into the back of demetrius head he waited to see if he would need give him another one to finish him off but he didnt the black man probably died before he finished crumpling to the ground whats up troop leader another guard asked as casually as if they were talking about the weather troublemaker rodriguez answered a response that could bury any black man we got to get rid of the body quietlike niggersll know he came in here theyll know he didnt come out the trooper said rodriguez shrugged and so we say we catch him dealing in contraband they think he deserve what he get that overstated things a little the prisoners admired people who could smuggle forbidden things into camp determination but they knew the guards came down hard on the smugglers they caught dealers in contraband usually bribed guards to get stuff for them and look the other way guards got fired for doing things like that the negroes got fired too fired on get the body out of here rodriguez told the man whod questioned him he had stripes on his sleeve the other guard didnt yes troop leader he said and took the late unlamented demetrius by the feet i want to congratulate troop leader rodriguez for a fine piece of work jefferson pinkard said at a guards meeting a few days later he spotted trouble he reported it and we dealt with it nobody in barracks twentyseven is going to spread rumors anymore by god chief assault leader higbe deserves commendation for making the cleanout run so smooth a letter will go in his file he didnt talk about a letter going into rodriguezs file even if they were friends rodriguez might get rockers under his stripes but that was it all the commendation letters in the world wouldnt make him anything more than a top kick the confederate states were more likely to name a sonoran peasant an officer than they were to appoint a negro secretary of state but only a little rodriguez didnt worry about it he knew hed done a good job too hed saved everybody in campexcept the negroessome trouble that was plenty major general abner dowling could see the confederate states of america from his new headquarters in clovis new mexico his only major trouble was at the moment he couldnt see much of the eleventh army with which he was supposed to go after the enemy he had a lot of territory to cover and not a lot of men with which to cover it the war out here by texas western border seemed very much an afterthought back in the lost and distant days of peace clovis was a minor trade center on the uscs frontier the town was founded in the early years of the century with the unromantic handle of rileys switch a railroad officials daughter suggested renaming it for the first christian king of france cattle from the west texas prairie paused at its feed lots before going on to supply the meat markets of california it had flourished when western texas under the name of houston joined the usa those same cattle kept coming west only now without a customs barrier houstons return to texas and to the csa sent clovis into a tailspin from which it had yet to recover men in greengray werent cattle even if they were often treated in ways that would have made a rancher blush or turn pale feeding them and separating them from the little money the us government doled out to them had produced a small upturn but the clovis chamber of commerce still sighed for the days when the longhorn ruled the local economy the chamber of commerces sighs were not dowlings worry except when the local greasy spoons all jacked up their prices to gouge soldiers at the same time he growled then when growling didnt work he threatened to move his headquarters and place clovis permanently offlimits to all military personnel a threat to the pocketbook got peoples attention prices promptly came back down up till now that was the biggest victory dowling had won both his side and his confederate counterparts patrolled the border on horseback even command cars were hard to come by in these parts and some of the terrain was too rugged for anything with wheels every so often cavalrymen in greengray and those in butternut would shoot at one another their occasional casualties convinced both sides they were being aggressive enough dowling was plowing through paperwork and patting himself on the back for getting out from under daniel macarthur when his adjutant stuck his head into the office sir theres an officer from the war department here to see you major angelo toricelli said there is dowling blinked why in gods name beats me sir he didnt say toricelli answered cheerfully all he said was that his name is major levitt and hes got something hes supposed to handdeliver to you toricelli paused i had him searched whatever it is its not a people bomb thank you major dowling said maybe youd better show him in major levitt was skinny sandyhaired and not particularly memorable after toricelli ducked out of the office he said your adjutant is ah a diligent young man well yes dowling said in a lowkey way levitt had style dowling knew his features would have been much more ruffled if hed just been frisked what can i do for you today major i have this for you sir levitt set a sealed envelope on dowlings desk major toricelli didnt find anything obviously lethal about it im so relieved dowling murmured not about to let the officer from philadelphia show more sangfroid than he did himself levitt smiled when he did his whole face lit up he looked like a human being and a nice one instead of a cog in the military machine dowling opened the envelope unfolded the papers inside and began to read he suddenly looked up jesus christ he said and then you know whats in these orders yes sir levitt said youre allowed to discuss them with me oh joy dowling went on reading when he finished he looked up again i understand what im supposed to do but why on earth am i supposed to concentrate my forces and launch an attack theres nothing in west texas worth having i know major levitt smiled another of his charming smiles i served there for a while between the wars when it was houston thesedowling tapped the orders with the nail of his index fingerare very strange when i was sent here they told me that as long as the confederates didnt steal albuquerque and santa fe while we werent looking id be doing my job and now this whats going on levitt told him exactly what was going on in about half a dozen sentences any questions sir he finished no dowling said youre absolutely right i can see the need just the same though major and no offense to you im going to keep you here for a while till philadelphia confirms that it really did send these orders they look authenticbut then they would if they were phony too featherstons bound to have some good forgers in richmond same as were bound to be forging confederate papers no offense taken sir levitt said as long as your force gets rolling by that date what happens beforehand doesnt matter ha dowling muttered major levitt was a general staff officer to them logistics was an abstract science like calculus they didnt have to worry about moving actual men and guns and munitions and fuel and food abner dowling did and knew his supply train was as flimsy as the rest of the alleged eleventh army major toricelli he called can i see you for a moment yes sir toricelli was in the office in nothing flat sending levitt a suspicious look what is it dowling handed him the orders please get confirmation of these from philadelphia until we have it major levitt is not to leave this building yes sir toricelli gave levitt a real glare this time highest security dowling added dont compromise the orders to verify them toricelli saluted and hurried away dowling nodded to levitt care for a cigarette no thank you sir i never got the habit i ran track at west point and theyre bad for your wind ah i was a football man myselfa tackle dowling said even back in those days i was built more like a brick than a greyhound he lit up he wasnt running anywhere not quite half an hour later the telephone on his desk rang he picked it up dowling here hello sir this is john abell do you recognize my voice even across twothirds of the country and an indifferent connection dowling did yes indeed general he said good that makes things easier the general staff officer said i can confirm those orders for you we did send major levitt west with them please follow them precisely ill do it dowling promised anything else no sir that covers it abell answered the line went dead dowling nodded to levitt all right major you are what you say you are and thesehe tapped the orders againare what they say they are ill carry them out thank you sir levitt grinned would you be kind enough to let your adjutant know i dont have horns and fangs and a spiked tail dowling smiled too if he frisked you he should already know that but he did get up and let major toricelli know the courier was neither a devil nor worse a confederate i didnt think he was sir but you never can tell his adjutant said i wondered if he was a mormon in disguise too to tell you the truth gark said dowling who hadnt thought of that no wonder you checked to see if he was loaded with explosives its a rum old world sir toricelli said aint it the truth dowling agreed and were going to be the busiest people in it the next few days the eleventh army is strung out from the border with chihuahua to the border with sequoyah i want to concentrate here but i want to leave enough of a screen behind so the confederates dont notice were concentrating till we go over the border that would be easier if we had more men major toricelli said of course it would and if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas dowling said which made his adjutant send him a quizzical look he ignored it and went on lets go to the map room and see what we can work out the more he studied the situation the less happy he got major toricelli had it right if he left enough men behind to fool the foe he wouldnt be able to mount the kind of attack the war department had in mind he grumbled and fumed thinking about bricks without straw his adjutant seemed sunk as deep in gloomtill toricelli suddenly started to laugh now dowling had the quizzical stare whats so funny major nice to think something is sir i dont think we need the screening force toricelli said if the confederates see what were doing and attack us somewhere else along the linewell so what arent they doing exactly what we want them to do dowling eyed the map a little while longer then he laughed too damned if they arent major he said damned if they arent by god all right well keep it just secret enough so featherstons fuckers think were trying to but we arent very good at it we cant be too open or theyll start wondering whats up toricelli nodded got you sir i like that so do i dowling said lets start drafting orders then the orders went out the us eleventh army started concentrating on clovis us air strength in new mexico started concentrating on clovis too the fighters would help keep the confederates from breaking up the concentration with bombers when they noticed it they didnt take long urgent signals started heading east from the cs army of west texas dowlings cryptographers couldnt make sense of all of them but what they could read suggested the enemy was alarmed if i were in west texas id be alarmed too dowling told angelo toricelli id think the us general on the other side of the border had gone clear around the bend why stir things up here because the usa can fart and chew gum at the same time his adjutant suggested thats what were doing all right dowling had to stop because he was laughing too hard to go on if we had a real army here he shrugged but we dont so we do the best we can with what weve got he was ready on the appointed day he was less than an hour away from issuing the order to start the opening barrage when he got another phone call from john abell please hold up for three days sir abell said please made the order more polite but no less an order all right general i can still do thatjust barely dowling said and shouted for major toricelli to put the brakes on things toricelli swore then started making calls of his own dowling asked abell can you tell me why not on a line that isnt secure the general staff officer replied dowling found himself nodding the confederates had a couple of thousand miles of wire on which to be listening in and after a little thought he had a pretty fair notion of the answer anyway november in the north atlantic wasnt so bad as say january in the north atlantic nobody would ever have mistaken it for july off the sandwich islands though the josephus daniels climbed over swells slid into troughs bounced all the time and generally behaved like a toy boat in a bathtub with a rambunctious fouryearold sam carsten took it all in stride hed rounded the horn more than once facing seas that made the north atlantic at its worst seem tame by comparison but he wasnt surprised when the destroyer escorts passageways began to stink of vomit a lot of men were seasick he ordered cleaning parties increased smelling the result of other mens nausea helped make sailors sick the reek diminished but didnt go away he hadnt expected anything different youre a good sailor sir pat cooley said watching sam tear into a roast beef sandwich on the bridge the exec hadnt been sick not so far as sam knew but he did look a little green not too bad sam allowed and took another bite ive had plenty of practice thats for damn sure he looked up at the cloudfilled sky weathers right for people like us anyhow the fair auburnhaired exec eyed the even fairer blond skipper well thats true cooley said but everything comes with a price doesnt it yes he was green it does sam finished the sandwich and wiped crumbs off his hands when were up and down so much and when all this damn sprays in the air the yranging set doesnt give us as much as it would in softer weather cooley gulped i wasnt thinking of the yranging set sir sam thought he would have to leave the bridge in a hurry but he fought down what might have been about to come up sam admired that carrying on in spite of what bothered you was a lot tougher than not being bothered which he himself wasnt i know pat he said now more gently than he was in the habit of speaking but it also means we have to patrol the hard way and it means we cant see as far i hope it doesnt mean something slips past us along with several other destroyer escorts and destroyers the josephus daniels sailed east of newfoundland their goal was simple to stop the british from sneaking men and arms into canada to keep the rebellion there sizzling as with most goals setting it was easier than meeting it the us navy had bigger fish to fry or it would have committed more ships to the job fortunately the royal navy did too if it didnt keep the usa away from the convoys from south america and south africa that fed the united kingdom britain would start to starve losing that fight had made the uk throw in the sponge in the great war under churchill and mosley the limeys were doing their best to make sure it didnt happen again they didnt treat supporting the canuck rebels as job number one but the british had one big advantage the north atlantic was vast and the ships in it relatively tiny a lot of what they sent got through and as for what didntwell if it didnt what did they lose a rusty freighter some munitions and a few sailors captured or killed cheap enough for a country fighting a war meanwhile the united states had to pull ships away from attacking britains supply convoys for this thankless job carsten didnt love convoyhunting hed done too much of it the last time around but it seemed like a trip to coney island next to this up to the crest of a wave as the josephus daniels started to slide down into the trough the yrange operator stirred in his seat something sam asked imnot sure sir the young officer answered i thought so for a second but then we lost the target what bearing sam tried not to sound excited he wanted to go after something about sir said lieutenant jg thad walters mr cooley now sams voice was sharp and crisp change course to all ahead full and sound general quarters if you please changing course to aye aye sir cooley said he called all ahead full down to the engine room his finger stabbed a button near the wheel klaxons hooted sailors dashed to their battle stations sam stared northwest you bastardyou almost snuck past us he thought he knew he might be thinking unkind thoughts at a figment of the electronics imagination that was a chance he took he spoke to the wireless operator on the bridge signal the other ships in the patrol that we are changing course to pursue a possible enemy ship aye aye sir the rating at the morse key reached for the book to find the proper code groups lieutenant walters watched his set like a cat keeping an eye on a mousehole he didnt say anything the first time the josephus daniels climbed to the top of a crest the next time though he jerked as if hed stuck his finger in a light socket its there sir he exclaimed bearing speed eleven knots change course to mr cooley sam said and then to the yrange operator mr walters give me a range as soon as you can eleven knots that sure sounded like a lumbering british freighter he couldnt think of any other kind of ship likely to be in these waters right now after a couple of more climbs to the crest walters said sir range is about six miles thank you sam answered in good weather the target would have been easily visible of course for the limeys to bet that the weather off newfoundland in november would be lousy gave odds a hell of a lot better than putting chips down on doublezero at the roulette table before too long the freighter did come into sight a big lumbering tub not much different from what sam had expected at his order the wireless operator sent more code groups come up alongside mr cooley sam said i think well need to put a prize crew aboard the josephus daniels was a tub herself but she seemed all sharklike grace alongside the freighter sam handled the blinker himself signaling what ship are you heave to for boarding and inspection we are the karlskrona we are swedish we are neutral came the reply fat chance sam said he signaled heave to for boarding and contraband inspection he called to the forward gun turret put one across her bow if she doesnt stop she didnt the shot rang out last warning sam signaled sailors ran across the karlskronas deck for a couple of seconds sam thought it was panic then suddenly he didnt it was too well organized too well drilled sink that ship he shouted at the same time as pat cooley yelled shes got guns ever since taking over the josephus daniels sam had concentrated on gunnery his men hadnt been the best then they were now he would have matched them against the gunners from any other destroyer escort in the navy and they needed to be he and pat cooley both exclaimed in horror when the armed freighter opened fire the size of the spout that miss kicked up shes got sixinchers cooley yelped uhhuh sam said grimly the enemy outgunned his ship and they werent far from pointblank range a couple of hits could sink the josephus daniels flank speed and zigzag mr cooley lets not make it easy for them aye aye sir cooley swung the wheel hard to port then just as hard to starboard another great gout of water rose this one closer to the destroyer escort the limeys were getting the range but the josephus daniels gunners already had it both turrets were firing and the ships violent maneuvers fazed them not a bit hit sam yelled and then hit again he whooped after the second oneit was near the bow where the freighter carried one of her guns the destroyer escorts twin mms opened up toothey were close enough for them to reach the foe he felt as if hed fallen back in time to the war of when ships went toe to toe at short range and slugged away at each other till one surrendered or sank one of those big shellsthe damn freighter had a light cruisers firepowerburst much too close to the josephus daniels stern shrapnel howled through the air that one would cause casualties even if it was a miss if the burst was close enough it might spring hull plates too and make the destroyer escorts seams leak but it wouldnt hurt her badly and she was chewing up the freighter her fourinch guns threw shells that weighed only a third as much as the enemys but she fired much faster and she fired much straighter shes on fire pat cooley yelled and then half a minute later shes struck her colors sure enough the freighters ensign came down and a white flag of surrender went up to replace it cease fire sam ordered the turrets stopped at once the men at the antiaircraft guns needed a few seconds to get the wordor maybe they just didnt want to hear it that went against the rules but not against human nature approach to pick up survivors mr cooley sam said he told the men at the gun turrets what the destroyer escort was doing and added if you see anybody going near her guns open up again but the freightersam didnt suppose she was really the karlskronahad no more fight in her her men were taking to the boatswhich in the north atlantic was no joke sam ordered nets lowered to let the british sailors come up the josephus daniels side his own crew armed with a couple of submachine guns rifles pistols axes and even some big wrenches looked like a nineteenthcentury boarding party as they took charge of the prisoners the pharmacists mate had groaning wounded men to deal with sam went down to the deck for a closer look at the vanquished enemy the british skipper a weary and bedraggled man with a horsy face and bad teeth recognized him for the destroyer escorts captain at once well fought sir the limey said saluting thought we might surprise you but you maneuvered welland those bloody guns damn me if i think you missed even once you gave us a nasty start sam said you were loaded for bear all right that probably made him sound like daniel boone to the englishman but he didnt care if the freighters gunners were better but the best gun crews were bound to be in the royal navy little jaunts like this would have to take whoever was left and whoever was left hadnt been good enough kind of you to take us aboard all things considered his opposite number said if youd fired after the white flag went up idve sunk you sam said matteroffactly short of that though i wouldnt leave a ships cat in an open boat on the north atlantic ive been in the navy better than thirty years ive seen a few things id rather not see again or think about either i believe you sir im grateful all the same the englishman said gratitude is worth its weight in gold sam said and the limey flinched sam went on you and your men are pows now well take you back to the usa when the wars over you can go home for now for now he thought you didnt blow me to hell and gone ill take that irving morrell looked up into the western sky a snowflake hit him right between the eyes by god the bastards werent lying he breathed and his breath smoked as if he had a cigarette in his mouth just this minute he didnt though a pack sat in his pocket for once the weathermen had hit things right on the button theyd said this early snowstorm would get here now and they were right hed gambled and held up his attack three days to wait for it and his gamble looked as if it would pay off meadville pennsylvania lay in the foothills of the alleghenies morrell stood on the grounds of allegheny college the georgian and greek revival architecture told of timeless elegance and dedication to scholarship but confederate bombs and artillery had turned some of the buildings to ruinsnot that the greeks hadnt wrecked masterpieces in their own wars and the barrels snorting on the yellowing lawn were not in perfect keeping with an academic atmosphere only a few blocks away stood the worlds biggest zipper factory morrell wondered if button manufacturers cursed meadville whenever they thought of it that wasnt his worry though he aimed his curses at jake featherston and before long hed aim them through the barrel of a gun he scrambled up into the closest barrel which was his to command when the fighting started he intended to lead from the front generals who stayed in back of the line soon lost track of what was really going on generals who didnt stay back of the line often got killed but morrell refused to worry about that we just about ready sir asked his gunner a dark and darkly clever corporal named al bergeron he was a good soldier and a good gunner morrell missed michael pound all the same and hoped the veteran underofficer was safe wherever pound was hed be acting as if he wore three stars not three stripes but morrell would have to worry about him later too just about frenchy he answered during the great war more than a few people with french names changed them to germansounding ones so their neighbors wouldnt suspect them that kind of hysteria hadnt come again the confederate states were the only enemies people flabbled hard about now morrell put on his earphones this barrel had a fancier wireless setup than any of the rest he could link up not only to other barrels but also to artillery infantry and aviation circuits he wondered whether being able to talk to so many people at once was part of the privilege of his rank or part of the price of it he connected to the artillery web ready at he asked if he got a no somebodys head would rollhhour was only fifteen minutes away but the answer came back at once ready sir the officer who replied sounded young and excited morrell wondered if hed seen action before whether he had or not he would now those fifteen minutes like the last fifteen minutes before every attack seemed to crawl by on their bellies corporal bergeron said almost seems a shame to do this to those damn greasers almostbut not quite morrell said dryly the gunner chuckled morrells mouth stretched in a grin of savage anticipation no he didnt think it was a shame not even slightly if jake featherston was stretched so thin that he needed to use secondgrade troops from the empire of mexico to hold part of his line he had only himself to blame if the usa tried to stomp the stuffing out of them no sooner had that thought crossed morrells mind than the artillery opened up even here inside the turret the thunder was cataclysmic hed been hoarding guns as hard as hed been hoarding barrels the mexicans would like things even less the barrage went on for a precise hour and a half as soon as the guns let up morrell spoke into the intercom to the driver and then over the webs connecting him to the rest of the barrels and to the infantry he said the same thing every time lets go engine roaring his barrel rumbled forward morrell stuck his head out of the cupola so he could see better that was a splendid way to get shot he knew as much it was the chance he took if he got another oakleaf cluster for his purple heart then he did that was all he needed to see what was going on as much as he could and if he stopped one with his face well a general officers pension would leave agnes and mildred without many worries about money along with the rest of the barrels his pushed southwest out of meadville some foot soldiers loped along among the big noisy machines others rode in trucks or in lightly armored carriers to keep up more easily a few infantrymen clambered up onto barrels and let them do the work that was highly unofficial doctrine handed down from on highwhich is to say from philadelphiafrowned on it riding barrels left soldiers vulnerable to the fire they inevitably drew but it also got them where they were going faster and fresher than marching would have done no matter what doctrine the war department laid down morrell liked that he knew just when they broke into the mexicans lines the us barrage had come down right on the button only a few soldiers in that yellowish khaki were in any shape to fight scattered rifle fire and a handful of machine guns greeted the advancing us forces but that was all francisco joses soldiers didnt carry the automatic rifles that made cs infantrymen so formidable they had boltaction tredegars pieces much like us springfields they didnt have barrels they didnt have much artillery they didnt have armored personnel carriers and they didnt have a chance morrell had loaded up with a rock in his fist now he swung it with all his might here and there the mexicans fought bravely knots of them held up morrells forces wherever they could stubborn men who would die before they yielded a position were an asset to any army and the empire of mexicos had its share but the mexicans didnt have enough men like that and the ones they did have couldnt do what they might have done with better equipment more often than not the us advance flowed past those stubborn knots to either side they could be cleaned up at leisure meanwhile the push went on keep moving whenever morrell ducked down into the turret he spread his gospel over the wireless always keep moving once we get in among em once we get behind em theyll go to pieces and then well be able to move even faster and he had the pleasure of watching his prophecy come true till the early afternoon the enemy soldiers in front of his barrels and infantry did everything they could to stop them and even to throw them back after that after that it was like watching ice melt when spring came to a northern river once the rot started it spread fast by that first nightfall he was seeing the enemys backs he didnt want to stop for the darkness he kept going till his driver couldnt see any farther he sent infantry ahead even after that and he had the barrels moving again as soon as the first gray showed in the east the mexicans kept trying to fight back early in the second day but when they saw barrels coming at them out of the swirling snow a lot of them lost their nerve morrell would have lost his nerve too trying to stand up against barrels with no more than rifles some of the men in the yellowish khaki ran away others dropped their rifles and raised their hands a lot of them looked miserably cold they didnt have greatcoats and probably didnt have long johns either down in the empire of mexico they wouldnt have needed them they were a long way from home by the end of that second day morrells barrels had smashed through the crust of enemy resistance behind it lay not much morrell had a gruesomely good time shooting up a confederate truck convoy the big butternut trucks rolled right up to his barrel sure it had to be on their side even if it was the wrong color they found out how wrong they were in a hurry at morrells orders frenchy bergeron wrecked the first truck in the convoy with a wellaimed cannon shell the second truck tried to go around it bergron blasted that one too effectively blocking the road then he and the bow gunner used their machine guns to shoot up the rest of the trucks more us barrels came up and joined the fun it wasnt much fun for the poor bastards on the receiving end soldiers spilled out of some of the trucks and tried to find shelter from the storm of bullets wherever they could other trucks carried munitions not men when they burned they sent tracers flying every which way standing up in the cupola again morrell whooped corporal bergeron got the view through his gunsight he pounded morrell gently on the leg which also amounted to a whoop desperate to escape the trap some of the trucks went off the road and into the fields on either side like their us counterparts they had fourwheel drive that gave them some traction on the wet ground but only some great gouts of mud flew from their tires as they struggled forward while they did the greengray barrels went right on shooting at them and they couldnt shoot back without antibarrel cannon the only weapons foot soldiers had against armor were grenades through the hatches and featherston fizzes they couldnt get close enough to use anything like that here once hed smashed the column of trucks morrell got on the wireless circuit to the barrels closest to his lets get rolling again weve got to keep moving he popped up again and cast a wary eye at the sky so far the promised storm was still rolling through when the weather got better the confederates were going to throw anything that could fly at his armored forces from what he could see air strikes had the best chance of slowing him downif anything could now that hed broken through the cs line he saw nothing in the rear that had much chance of doing the job as his armored column pushed south and west from meadville another slightly smaller us force was driving north from parkersburg west virginia if everything went according to plan morrells men and the troops advancing from west virginia would clasp hands somewhere in eastern ohio and if they did the confederate army infesting pittsburgh would find itself in a very embarrassing position indeed surrounded cut off from reinforcements except perhaps by air cut off from resupply with the same possible exception could featherstons men fly in enough fuel and ammo to keep a modern army functioning morrell didnt know but this whole twopronged attack was based on the assumption that it was damned unlikely and even if the confederates could at first would they be able to build transports as fast as us fighters shot them down he didnt think so what would he do if he were jake featherston try to pull out of pittsburgh and save what he could try to break the ring around the city from the outside try to do both at once did the csa have the men and machines to do both at once with every mile his barrels advanced irving morrell doubted that more and more at the front confederate armies remained formidable even fearsome but they were like an alligator that went ive been sick in an animated cartoon all mouth with no strength anywhere else if you concentrated on the puny little legs and tail instead of the big end that chomped well lets see how jake likes this morrell murmured and he rolled on during the great war chester martin would never have imagined hitching a ride on a barrel for one thing there hadnt been so many of the lumbering monstrosities in the last fight for another a great war barrel going flat out was faster than a man but not by a whole hell of a lot here at the end of though things had changed most of chesters new platoon had attached itself to a platoon of barrels they rumbled through pennsylvaniaor maybe they were in ohio by now one state didnt look a whole lot different from another especially when you were crashing along at fifteen or twenty miles an hour every once in a while the platoon had to fight sometimes the men would drop down from the barrels and shoot at startled confederates sometimes they wouldnt bother descending a pfc from chicago carried a captured confederate submachine gun and sprayed bullets around from the back of a barrel chester kept thinking he should have been called vito or something like that but he was a big blond pole named joe jakimiuk what really amazed chester was the speed of the us advance it wasnt like this in the great war ill tell you he said as he sat by a campfire the second night and ate something alleged to be beef stew out of a can it bore as much resemblance to what rita called beef stew as boiled inner tube in motoroil gravy but it filled him up back then even in a breakthrough we only made a few miles a day and nobody figured out how to do even that much till better barrels and better trucks now that was second lieutenant delbert wheat the platoon commander he spoke with the flat vowels and harsh consonants of kansas odds were he hadnt been born in even so he wasnt an obnoxious twerp like the other shavetails chester had met since reenlisting he actually seemed to have some idea of what he was doingand when he wasnt sure he didnt act as if asking questions would cost him a couple of inches off his cock if he lived and didnt get maimed he wouldnt stay a second lieutenant long chester could see a big future ahead of him for now wheat paused and lit a cigarette chesters nostrils twitched at the fragrant smoke you lifted a pack off of one of featherstons fuckers sir he said the smokes we get with our rations dont smell that good right the first time sergeant wheat grinned his looks were as cornfed as his accent he was a husky blond guy goodsized but not quite so big as joe jakimiuk with a narrower face and sharper features than the pfcs he held out the pack to chester want one sure thanks a lot sir chester answered a lot of lieutenants would have gone right on smoking the good stuff themselves without a thought for their noncoms some officers acted as if they were a superior breed of man just because of their metal rank badges wheat didnt have that kind of arroganceanother sign hed do well for himself if he stayed healthy sentries all around our position tonight he told chester no telling which way the confederates will come at us were really and truly in their rear so they could come from any direction at all yes sir chester said ill take care of it in the enemy rear he didnt think that had ever happened in the great war not to him anyway you could beat back the confederates but get behind them retreating troops had always been able to fall back faster than advancing troops could pursue them through the wreckage of war now now this armored thrust had pierced the zone of devastation and found nothing much behind it you men will want to sleep while you can lieutenant wheat told his soldiers i dont know how much were going to get from here on out listen to him guys chester said he knows what hes talking about he curled up in his own bedroll not long after he stubbed out the mild flavorful confederate cigarette exhaustion blackjacked him moments later he forgot the chilly air and the hard damp ground and everything else he wished he could have slept for a week what was hard on the young guys was a hell of a lot harder for somebody of his vintage instead of a week he got till the end of the wee small hours jakimiuk shook him awake saying sorry sarge but were gonna move out coffee chester croaked like a man in the desert wishing for water the instant coffee that came with rations was nasty but it did help pry his eyelids open and it was hot which was also welcome ham and eggs out of a tin can made the beef stew from the night before seem delicious by comparison chester shrugged the ration would keep him going another few hours maybe hed eat something better then the really scary thing was the soldiers who wore butternut had it worse as the sky grayed toward dawn the barrels the platoon had been riding roared to life chester clambered aboard the one hed ridden the past two days the barrels commander popped out of his cupola like a jackinthebox he was a sergeant too though a younger man than chester we going to give them another boot in the balls today he asked cheerfully heres hoping anyway chester wasnt about to commit the sin of optimism justifiably or not he feared it would jinx everything no one would see the sun even when it rose clouds filled the sky they couldnt seem to make up their mind whether to give rain or snow or sleet since they couldnt decide they spat out a little of each at random even when nothing was coming down the wind out of the northwest had knives in it chester would have disliked the weather much more than he did if it hadnt kept cs asskickers from diving on him here we go lieutenant wheat shouted when the barrels moved out he might have been a kid on a ferris wheel at a county fair chester suspected he wouldnt take long to lose that boyish enthusiasm once youd been through a few fights once youd seen a few horrors you might be ready to go on with the war but you werent likely to be eager anymore a train ahead chugged east on its way to pittsburgh chester wondered he couldnt think of any other reason why an engine pulling a lot of passenger cars should be on its way through what had been territory firmly under the confederate thumb the barrel commander evidently decided the same thing the big snorting machine stopped the turretone of the massive new models with a bigger gunslewed to the left till it bore on the locomotive when the cannon fired the noise was like the clap of doom hearing it a man with a hangover might have his head fall offand if he didnt he might wish he did the shot was perfect it went right through the boiler great clouds of steam rose from the engine only momentum kept it moving after that it wasnt going anywhere under its own power other barrels started shelling and shooting up the passenger cars chester had an abstract sympathy for the soldiers in butternut who tumbled out like so many ants when their hill was kicked the confederates had been going toward battle yes theyd been thinking about it worrying about it no doubt but they hadnt expected it not yet too bad for them life was what you got not what you expected come on boys chester said to the men on the barrel with him lets make them even happier than they are already they got down and started shooting at the dismayed confederates from behind the barrels and whatever other cover they could find the machine guns in the turret and at the bow of each barrel raked the scattering soldiers in butternut too every so often for varietys sake a cannon would lob a highexplosive shell or two into the confederates a few bullets came back at the us barrels and foot soldiers but only a few a lot of the confederates probably hadnt even been able to grab their weapons before they spilled from the train some of the ones who had were bound to be casualties and others instead of returning fire were doing their best to disappear keeping the battered railroad cars between themselves and their tormentors as they ran for the woods chester wasnt so sure he wouldnt have done the same thing sometimes going forward or even staying where you were was asking to be killed hed retreated more than once in the great war and by fredericksburg not so long ago he wouldnt have been surprised if he did it again before too long now though he was going forward that was better he didnt suppose even the confederates could disagree with him theyd done more advancing than retreating in this war he hoped they enjoyed going the other way the sergeant in charge of the barrel he rode popped out of the cupola again weve got orders to get moving the other noncom said faster we put a ring around pittsburgh faster we can pound featherstons fuckers inside to pieces somebody was driving the us forces as if a pack of wolves ran right behind them chester didnt mind they probably needed driving if they werent driven they wouldnt do what needed doing even if they were they might not on they went every so often confederate soldiers would shoot at them that caused a few casualties but only slight delays machinegun and smallarms fire didnt make the barrels slow down they had somewhere important to go and they wanted to get there in a hurry more foot soldiers would be coming along behind them and artillerymen too people like that could deal with the odd set of holdouts from everything chester heard featherstons men and barrels fought that way when they stormed through ohio to lake erie and then again this summer when they smashed east to pittsburgh he didnt think the united states had ever done anything like this before he wondered why not the barrels and the men who rode them and the men who tried to keep up with them did have to slow down when they passed through towns that usually wasnt because confederate soldiers made stands there most towns held hardly any confederates but the people who hadnt fled ahead of the advancing confederate tide came out in droves to welcome the us armys return chester got handed eggs an apple pie a chunk of homecured ham and a pouch of pipe tobacco he got snorts of booze ranging from good scotch to raw corn liquor he got his hand shook and his back slapped several pretty girls kissed him what rita didnt know wouldnt hurt her if he could have stayed in any one place for a little while but the speed of the advance helped hold him to the straight and narrow locals hauled down the stars and bars and burned it up went the stars and stripes in its place chester hoped the csa didnt retake any of these towns people would catch it if the confederates did they didnt seem to care them bastards would just as soon shoot you as look at you an old man said my pa he fought em in the war of secession he always said they fought fair then no more they hanged one poor son of a bitch for thumbing his nose at em when they rode down the street hanged him from a lamppost like he was a nigger in the field the confederates played by the rules most of the time up till now chester hadnt seen what they did behind the lines it didnt make him like them any better it did make him think the atrocity stories he heard were more likely to be true lafayette ohio was a little town notable only for the redbrick tavern in the middle of itthe place looked older than god as chesters barrel paused in the village square more greengray machines rumbled up from the south barrel crews and the infantrymen with them exchanged backslaps and cigarettes lafayette chester said happily here we are theyd encircled the confederates nowwould the ring hold xviii mr president sir we have got to break out from pittsburgh nathan bedford forrest iii said we have got to do it right now right this minute the sooner the better while the machines still have enough gas to go at least partway jake featherston scowled at the head of the confederate general staff were doing all right in there he said we are now mr president forrest said weve still got ammo weve still got fuel when we start running low he shook his head and it wont be long either theyve cut the supply routes same as we cut the usa in half last summer if we cant get the shit in by road or railroad well damn well fly it in jake said thatll keep the men fighting sir weve got a whole army in there forrest replied shaking his head no offense sir but no way in hell we can bring in enough by air to keep that many men going that isnt what the flyboys tell me jake said ive talked with em they say theyre up for the job theyre lying through their teeth mr president on account of theyre scared to tell you you truth nathan bedford forrest iii declared you tell me who you talked to and ill personally go punch the son of a bitch in the nose youll do no such thing they had diagrams and everythingshowed just what they could do featherston said long as they can do it the boys up there can keep fighting right and you can work out some kind of way to break through to em how many damnyankees can there be in that ring anyhow too many forrest said morosely they hit us where we were weakest and punched on through goddamn mexicans i ought to have francisco joses guts for garters if he had any guts by god i would too jake was not only furious he wanted to blame someoneanyoneelse for what was going on in pennsylvania and ohio that way the blame wouldnt come down on his own head the chief of the general staff didnt seem interested in casting blame a blessing and an annoyance at the same time sir we just didnt have enough of our own people to go around thats the trouble with fighting a country bigger than we are he said thats why weve got to get as many of our men in and around pittsburgh out as we can if we lose them all theyll take plenty of damnyankees with em jake broke in yes sir forrest sounded patient he also sounded worried but if we trade men one for one with the usa we lose on account of theyve got more men than we do pretty soon we just run dry and they keep going thats the point of everything weve done up till now to make them pay more than we do if that whole big armys stuck inside of pittsburgh it cant play that game anymore jake featherston grunted however little he wanted to see that forrests picture left him little choice but trying to break out of pittsburgh would be a disastrous admission of defeat what can we get together in ohio he asked what can we use to break through the ring and get those people out forrest frowned it wont be easy mr president we put the best of what we had into the attacking force thats what youre supposed to do sir make the schwerpunkt as strong as you can yeah yeah dont you go spouting german at me jake said goddamn kaisers got troubles of his own youd better believe he does if we can break in far enough for the men in pittsburgh to break out and link up thatll be all right he shook his head it wont be all right but we can take it theres politics in this damn war too dont forget all right sir if thats all i can get from you thats all i can get nathan bedford forrest iii said ill see what we can put together and the air resupply will do the best job it can if youll excuse me he saluted and hurried away fuck featherston muttered he scowled at the map on the wall of his underground and armored office he would have been tougher on forrest if he hadnt seen at once that the head of the general staff wasnt alibiinghe was telling the truth where the devil could they scrape up enough men to relieve pittsburgh wherever it was they had to do it pretty damn quick he turned his head to the bigger map on the far wall the one that showed the whole frontier from sonora to virginia he could yank some soldiers from fuck he said again louder this time the damnyankees were mounting an attack on lubbock he didnt think it would get there but the town had to be held they were kicking up their heels in sequoyah a column from missouri was pushing down into arkansas it wasnt a real big column but it was big enough to keep him from taking men out of the state general macarthur was getting uppity just a little north of richmond too the confederates had already pulled men from the army of northern virginia to load up farther west they couldnt very well pull more featherston repeated the obscenity yet again early in the war somebodyd said that whoever could keep two big campaigns going at once would probably win both sides seemed to have taken that as gospel now suddenly and painfully jake saw it wasnt necessarily so the damnyankees had done one big thing they were also doing a bunch of little things by itself not one of those little things mattered added together though they kept the confederates from properly countering the big thrust it was like being gnawed by rats instead of eaten by a bear it was ignominious it was humiliating you ended up just as dead either way that was the point and hed taken too damn long to see it something somewhere would have to give that was all there was to it while jake eyed the map with the big picture he also scowled at the red pins stuck into the interior of the csa from south carolina all the way west to louisiana and some in the mountains of cuba too they marked spots where negro guerrillas were kicking up their heels he swore so foully he took a hasty look toward the door to make sure nathan bedford forrest iii had closed it behind him he didnt want lulu hearing and wagging a finger at him that was pretty funny when you got right down to it the most powerful man the confederate states had ever known afraid of his own secretary but featherston wasnt laughing at all if the blacks in the country had just stayed quiet he would have had several more divisions to throw at the damnyankees he wouldnt be jumping up and down now about where to find men to try to bail out the force trapped in pittsburgh those bastardsll pay he growled oh lord how theyll pay he got on the telephone and called ferdinand koenig ferd had a new secretary one with a hell of a sultry voice jake wondered if the rest of her lived up to it if it did koenig might be finding afterhours work for her too office of the attorney general she purred as if shed just got out of bed featherston didnt have time for that though this is the president he said get ferd on the line right this second you hear yyes sir most of that sexy lilt disappearedmost but not all ferd koenig the attorney generals deep gruff voice sounded the way it always did jake tried to imagine koenig talking in soft throaty tones he couldnt do it listen we have got to get rid of more niggers faster he said without preamble the damn guerrillas are a running sore weve got to get rid of it or its going to screw us for the rest of the war camps are running pretty close to capacity koenig said dubiously bump it up jake said build more bathhouses build more trucks hell build more camps whatever it takes but bump it up and fast all right sir ill handle that koenig said and he was a man who did what he said he would do he was an old party buddy one of the last ones jake had but he was also damn good at his work he went on the more we step it up against the coons the more theyre liable to try and fight back you know thatll cost us men who could be at the front he was thinking along with jake but jake was a little bit ahead of him jake hoped he was anyhow you handle your end of it ferd he said ill take care of the otheror if i dont somebodys gonna be mighty goddamn sorry and it wont be me or you ill do everything i can the camps will do everything they can koenig promised good thats what i need to hear freedom featherston hung up his next call was to the secretary of state he talked with herbert walker much less often than with ferdinand koenig the secretary of state was a real diplomat and always looked uncomfortable wearing a freedom party uniform instead of striped pants and cutaway coat walker knew better than to keep jake waiting though yes mr president what can i do for you today sir again featherston came straight to the point i need another five divisions of mexicans from francisco jose and i need em yesterday mr president the secretary of state sounded horrified after whats happened to the men he sent you before youll be lucky to get the time of day out of him let alone anything more tell him i wont use them against the damnyankees promise him on a stack of biblesits the truth jake said tell him i want em for for internal security thats what it is all right im gonna sic em on the damn uppity niggers free up our own men to fight against the usa thats what i shouldve done with the last batch of mexicans only i didnt think of it then sometimes youre smarter the second time around well ill try sir walker said on that basis i will try even so i dont know what the answer will be weve got mexicans coming up here to get work now lots of em jake said tell francisco jose that if he doesnt want to give us a hand we wont just seal the borderwell ship the ones who are already here back to mexico the way things are thats liable to hurt us worse than the mexicans walker said jake understood what he meant the mexicans were doing the scutwork negroes had done in the csa for generations they were also filling more and more factory slots white men would have taken if they werent off fighting a war even so he said tell him anyway by god if we dont have mexicans giving us some help with the work its a pain in the ass if francisco joses got a pile of mexicans who cant get any work sitting around its a civil war waiting to happen you reckon he doesnt know it hes dumb but hes not that dumb all right sir ill tell him internal security its a good phrase the secretary of state said he damn well better say yes jake said a small gasp came from the other end of the line hastily he added itll be his hard luck if he doesnt not yours i didnt mean that thank you mr president im glad you didnt and now id better get on with it when jake didnt say no walker hung up jake chuckled harshly he could still make people afraid of him an essential part of the business of ruling but the chuckle cut off as he looked from one situation map to the other how was he supposed to make the damnyankees afraid of him hed hurt them badly hed stopped their first big counterattack now though they were running with the ball and he was going to have a devil of a time tackling them abner dowling had spent too long either retreating before the confederates or banging his head into a stone wall now for the first time since gaining a command of his own he was going forwardand he was enjoying it too so what if the force he had consisted mostly of what nobody else in the usa wanted the force trying to stop him consisted mostly of what nobody else in the csa wanted by the way it had performed so far it was even more raggedy than his own his new headquarters lay in the grand metropolissay a thousand peopleof sudan texas hed been disappointed when one of the locals told him it was named for the kind of grass that fed the local cattle not for the place in africa he supposed the grass was named for the place in africa but it didnt seem the same sudan grass didnt cover everything not far away a brownishyellow ridge line ran east and west it was called bluntly the sand hills people from the north side of the hills were supposed to vote differently from those to the south and each group was supposed to have its own little social sets dowling lost not a moments sleep about that people on both sides of the sand hills were confederates which was everything he needed to know about them his line stood about four miles farther down cs highway halfway between sudan and amherst a town of about the same size another eight or ten miles down the road was littlefield which was the next size up lubbock lay thirtyfive miles southeast of littlefield and lubbock with more than people was a real city if he could take it people as far away as richmond would jump and shout and swear and if he couldnt news from pennsylvania and ohios better than what weve heard before he said to major toricelli yes sir his adjutant agreed now we get to see how tough the enemy is when things dont go his way dowling coughed he wished the younger man hadnt put it that way hed seen the confederates in adversity during the last war and theyd fought like sons of bitches they were sons of bitches as far as he was concerned but that didnt mean they werent brave and tough and stubborn were playing some little part in whats going on there too he said i like that yes sir me too angelo toricelli said wherever they get reinforcements from they wont get em from here were keeping em too busy for that we may even grab lubbock dowling said i didnt think we could when we got started but you know what the confederates around here are even more screwed up than we are toricelli suggested thats just exactly what i was going to say dowling raised an eyebrow by now youve signed my name with by direction after it so many times you really are starting to think like me no offense of course did i say anything like that sir toricelli looked and sounded so innocent dowling wouldnt have been surprised to see a halo suddenly start glowing above his head the general commanding eleventh army chuckled under his breath if his adjutant had started thinking like him he could also start thinking like his adjutant hed been an adjutant for years while toricelli would have to wait for the next war against the confederates for his turn as a co the next war against the confederates the noises dowling made under his breath when that thought crossed his mind werent nearly so amused when the great war ended hed hoped the usa would never have to worry about the csa again hed been too optimistic once he would be a fool to make the same mistake twice nothing kept a man from making a fool of himself now and again dowling did try not to make a fool of himself that way too often half a dozen artillery rounds came down a few hundred yards short of sudan theyre probably after you sir major toricelli said theyre a pack of idiots if they are dowling replied this attack doesnt need julius caesar or napoleon at the top as long as i keep the boys in butternut too busy to head east im a hero a regular robert e lee toricelli said with malice aforethought dowling scowled his severity more or less real if his confederate opposite number talked about officers to emulate lees name would likely be the first one in his mouth why not lee trounced every us general he faced in the war of secession when the war of secession was new just as virginia was going from the usa to the csa abe lincoln offered lee command of us forces had lee said yes the usa might well be one country now lincoln might not share with james g blaine the dubious distinction of being the only republican presidents they also shared the even more dubious distinction of starting warsand losing them dowling tried to remember wasnt it during blaines term that lincoln had pulled out of the republican party and gone over to the socialists he thought so the republicans had never been the same since now dowling a thoroughgoing democrat had to hope the socialists hadnt started a war they were going to lose he had to do whatever he could to help make sure they didnt lose it too more shells crashed down southeast of sudan these were closer dowling and major toricelli both raised eyebrows toricelli said sir i move we adjourn to the storm cellar you may not think youre important but it looks like they do damn nuisance dowling grumbled but he didnt say no an unlit kerosene lantern hung on the wall by the trap door to the cellar tornadoes tore across the west texas prairie every now and again most houses in these partsand on the us side of the line in new mexico toohad shelters that could save lives if you were lucky enough or quick enough to get into them fast enough toricelli ceremoniously lifted the trap door after you sir a couple of the wooden stairs creaked under dowlings weight but they held toricelli followed him down and closed the door behind them ive got a match sir he said and lit one dowling hadnt checked to see if the lamp held fuel just my luck if its dry he said but it wasnt buttery light pushed back shadows it wasnt very bright but it would do four milking stools comprised the cellars furniture he set the lamp on one and perched himself on another it also creaked weve done what we can do sir major toricelli said one more set of booms came in some of them very loud and close im glad we did too he added well now that you mention it so am i dowling allowed his adjutant smiled dowling didnt think of himself as particularly brave general custer now had been as brave a man as any ever born even up into his seventies and eighties dowling admired that without being convinced it made custer a better commander it might have made him a worse one since he didnt worry about his own safety he also didnt worry much about his mens daniel macarthur also had as much courage as any four ordinary people needed which didnt make him any less a vain blowhard or any more a commanding general in command of himself if you werent a hopeless cowardmore to the point if the soldiers you led didnt know you were a hopeless cowardyou could function as a commanding officer more shells crashed down in sudan i hope the sentries outside the house are all right toricelli said theyve got foxholes but even so yes even so dowling said we ought to be going after the confederates guns they must have pushed them well forward to land shells this far back of the line our own artillery should be able to pound on them heres hoping his adjutant said do you want me to go up and get on the telephone with our batteries no no no dowling shook his head if the people in charge of them cant figure that out for themselves they dont deserve to have their jobs thats always a possibility too toricelli had seen enough incompetents in shoulder straps to know what a real possibility it was so had abner dowling if they just sit around and waste the chance that will tell us what we need to know about them he said and if they do just sit around well have some new officers in those slots by this time tomorrow by god what do we do with the clodhoppers then toricelli asked not always simple or neat to courtmartial a man for moving slower than he should youre righta lot of the time its more trouble than its worth dowling agreed but somebody who cant do what he needs to when the chips are down shouldnt be facetoface with the enemy we damn well can transfer people like that out of here as long as theyre in charge of the coastdefense batteries of montana they dont do much harm the major toricelli broke off and sent him a reproachful stare every so often the devil inside you comes out doesnt he who me dowling said innocent as a mustachioed baby his adjutant laughed out loud about ten minutes later the confederate shelling suddenly stopped maybe some of our people had a rush of brains to the head toricelli said heres hoping dowlings devil must still have been loose for he went on hmm theyre shooting at us what should i do why illill shoot back he snapped his fingers as if that were a brilliant idea arrived at after weeks or maybe months of research in tones more like the ones he usually used he went on if we need to send people to west point or harvard to figure that out lord help us no sir toricelli said if we sent people to west point or harvard and they cant figure that out lord help us and some of them cant thats probably why weve got coastdefense batteries in montana wouldnt be a bit surprised dowling picked up the lantern and started up the stairs lets see if theyve blown sudan to hell and gone i dont suppose many people will miss it if they have no shells had landed on the house when dowling went outside he found the sentries just coming out of their holes in the ground they saluted him and then went back to brushing themselves off an irate local shouted at him you damnyankee son of a bitch you trying to get me killed i dont know why youre blaming me i didnt shoot at you jake featherstons men did dowling answered the hell you say the texan wouldnt believe a word of it we used to have to belong to the usa when yall called this place houston jake featherston done gave us back our freedom the last word wasnt quite the party howl but it came close watch how you talk to the general buddy one of the sentries warned swinging his springfield toward the local its all right hopkins dowling said by the look on the sentrys face it wasnt even close to all right dowling turned back to the texan jake featherston gave you thisall of it if he was as tough and smart as he said he was it never could have happened right since it has happened hes not so tough and hes not so smart right somehow that didnt make the unhappy civilian any happier somehow abner dowling hadnt thought it would and somehow he couldnt have cared less about one day in three the skies above central ohio cleared those were the days when confederate dive bombers and fighters struck savagely at the us soldiers in and around lafayette chester martin liked being strafed and bombed no better than anyone else in his right mind but the us position was a lot stronger than it had been when troops moving southwest out of pennsylvania joined hands with men coming up from west virginia antiaircraft guns followed close on the heels of barrels and harddriving soldiers they werent much use against hound dogs the cs fighters more often than not struck and then vanished but asskickers slower and clumsier paid a high price for screaming down on us entrenchments and fighters with the us eagle in front of crossed swords came overhead as often as their cs counterparts did they were a match for hound dogs and more than a match for asskickers confederate aircraft hurt the men in greengray down on the ground but the confederates hurt themselves too and badly how many airplanes can they throw away to soften us up chester asked scooping hash out of a ration can with a spoon he sat by a campfire with several other men from the platoon banks of earth shielded the fire from any lurking cs snipers thats only part of the question lieutenant delbert wheat lit a cigarette it smelled good which meant it was confederate after taking a drag he went on the other part is when do they counterattack on the ground thats got to be what theyre softening us up for chester nodded hed been thinking the same thing ever since the linkup here i would have looked for them to try it already sir he said i wonder why they havent only one answer i can think of lieutenant wheat said they arent strong enough to bring it off theyll be sorry if they wait around much longer chester said they may be getting stronger but so are we not far away from the fire lay the wreckage of a downed asskicker the crumpled tail pointing pathetically toward the sky del wheats smile made his mouth crooked and youre sorry for this because chester laughed not me sir not even a little bit but this is the first time ive seen em where it doesnt look like they know what they want to do makes me suspiciousknow what i mean hed seen in the last war that the confederates could be beaten that their plans didnt always work but to find them without any plans that struck him as a more typical us failing they were taking a chance when they struck at pittsburgh wheat said taking it away or even wrecking it hurts the usa maybe theyve gone and wrecked themselves too though heres hoping chester said rain and a little sleet came in the next morning that meant the mules and the asskickers would stay away till the weather got better it didnt mean the throb of airplane engines left the sky up above the clouds confederate transports were doing what they could to keep jake featherstons surrounded army supplied the antiaircraft guns near lafayette boomed firing by what one gunner called earsight it would take a lot of luck to knock down any airplanes that way as long as the guns had plenty of ammo though why not put it in the air shoot off enough and you were bound to hit something sooner or later besides the ring around the confederates trapped in pittsburgh was getting thicker as the usa rushed more troops through the gaps the men and barrels in greengray had torn in the cs flank defenses these werent the only antiaircraft guns that would be shooting at the cargo planes on their way to pennsylvaniafar from it if they didnt go down in flames here they might yet farther east and us fighters also prowled above the clouds transports werent made to go fast and be nimble any more than buses were if fighters attacked them their best hope lay in how much damage they could take before they fell out of the sky sometimes the confederate transports had hound dogs of their own to escort them to the target and drive off us wright fighters sometimes they didnt when they didnt they paid for it why dont the confederates send escorts along all the time chester asked when a burning transport crashed less than half a mile from his foxhole well i dont know for sure but i think i can make a pretty fair guess lieutenant wheat answered sir chester said hed served under a couple of platoon commanders whose opinions he didnt want but who insisted on giving them anyhow del wheat wasnt like that some of the things he had to say were worth hearing but he didnt make a big deal out of them those other guys seemed to think they were the pope speaking ex cathedra well my guess is that the confederate states dont have enough airplanesor maybe enough pilotsto be able to do all the things theyd like to do wheat said now they can do this now they can do thatbut it doesnt look like they can do this and that at the same time chester thought about it after a moment he nodded that does make sense yes sir he paused again then resumed getting that cargo into pittsburgh is pretty important for them right now if they cant take care of that because of everything else theyve got going on maybe they bit off more than they can chew thats true sergeant maybe they did lieutenant wheat looked like a cat contemplating a saucer of cream civilians came from csoccupied territory farther west they claimed the confederates there were building up for an attack on the us ring lieutenant wheat listened to them and sent them on to intelligence officers back at division hq youre not flabbling much about this chester remarked nope not me the platoon commander said if the enemy does try to come through here well do our damnedest to stop him thats all we can do but what do you want to bet that some of those socalled civilians are really confederate plants and theyre trying to make us jump at shadows ah chester said well sir since you put it that way i wouldnt be a bit surprised neither would i delbert wheat said so ill worry when my superiors tell me to but not till then chester did notice that some of the ammunition coming in for the antiaircraft guns had the blackpainted tips of armorpiercing rounds the confederates used their antiaircraft guns against barrels with vicious effect imitation was the sincerest and most deadly kind of flattery not long before christmas word came down from on high that the confederates would be coming soon the united states had taken advantage of the weather to break through in november a new snowstorm might give the confederates the same sort of extra concealment the cs bombardment had gas shells in it they were less deadly in cold weather and gas masks more nearly tolerableunless your mask froze up that didnt mean chester wanted to put on his mask want it or not he did hed seen gas casualties in the great war and a few this time too getting shot was bad enough he knew just how bad it was from twofold experience by everything he knew except that direct experience getting gassed was worse as soon as the shelling let up lieutenant wheat shouted be ready up and down the us line that same cry rang out the troops in greengray had the advantage of standing behind the tuscarawas river chester hoped that would mean something the confederates had more practice crossing in the face of resistance than any great war army had where chesters platoon was stationed the river which ran mostly north and south took an eastwest bend instead of pressing down on that eastwest length the soldiers in butternut trundled past it to hit the next northsouth stretch theyre giving us their flank wheat exclaimed in amazement true the confederates did stay out of effective rifle range of the men on the south bank of the tuscarawas but several of their barrels trundled along only a few hundred yards from the antiaircraft guns that could also fire against ground targets when the gunners got targets that artillerymen mostly only dreamt of they made the most of them four or five barrels went up in flames in a few minutes time us machine guns and riflemen harried the crewmen bailing out of the machines they were shooting at long range but with enough bullets in the air some probably struck home some barrels paused presented their glacis plates to their tormentors and fired back others scooted farther north so the us guns wouldnt bear on them any more artillery fire fell around those antiaircraft guns sometimes it fell on them had the weather been better asskickers would have gone after them one by one with clouds huddling low though dive bombers were liable to fly straight into the ground instead of pulling up in time when yet another confederate barrel brewed up because it incautiously came too close to the us antiaircraft guns chester yelled and pounded the dirt at the front of his foxhole those butternut bastards arent buying anything cheap today he yelled but he could see only his little corner of the fight early in the afternoon orders came to fall back to the east why somebody said indignantly were pounding the crap out of em here here yes lieutenant wheat said but featherstons fuckers are over the tuscarawas south of coshoctonsouth and west of here if we dont give up some ground theyll hit us in the flank and enfilade us taking enfilading fire was like getting your t crossed in a naval battle all the enemys firepower bore on you but most of yours wouldnt bear on him it was in other words a damn good recipe for getting killed have we got positions farther east that face west instead of north chester asked good question sergeant del wheat said well both find out at the same time he paused i hope we do we must have known this was coming if we didnt get ready for it then weve got the same old muddle up at the top when they came to zigzag trenches hastily dug and bulldozed out of fields chester felt like cheering somebody with stars on his shoulder straps could actually see a step or two ahead that made chester think things might go better than hed expected the confederates who came up against those trenches went to earth in a hurry when a fierce blast of fire met them more than a few us soldiers carried captured cs automatic rifles for extra firepower they had to get ammunition from dead enemy soldiers but thered been a lot of them around before long chester and his comrades needed to fall back again again though they fell back into prepared positions in spite of retreating he felt more confident the confederates could overrun any one position but each one cost them how many could they overrun before they started running out of men to do it not far from ellaville georgia ran a stretch of highway locally called the memorial mile marble stelae stood by the side of the road brass plaques mounted on the marble commemorated sumter county soldiers whod served in the great war wia by a name meant the soldier had been wounded in action kia by a name meant hed been killed the negro guerrillas whod attached jonathan moss and nick cantarella to their number hated the memorial mile with a fierce and terrible passion how many names you reckon they be if they put up all the niggers from here they done killed asked their chief who went by the name of spartacus moss suspected that was a nom de guerre it was as far as he was concerned a damn good one if youre gonna keep on playing this game youll put some more crackers names on some kinda stones nick cantarella said his clotted new york vowels and spartacus lazysounding drawl hardly seemed to belong to the same language sometimes they had to pause so each could figure out what the other was saying but they had something in common they both wanted to cause the confederates as much grief as they could a convoy of trucks rumbled along the road from ellaville towards americus command cars with machine guns shepherded the trucks along opening up on them would have invited massive retaliation one advantage youve got with these pine woods moss said whats that spartacus asked they dont lose their leaves this time of year moss replied easier to hide here than it would be in a forest full of barebranched trees not gonna be much snow on the ground neither cantarella said its really a bitch tryin to cover your tracks in the snow spartacus pursed his lips then slowly nodded he was about fortyfive just going gray at the temples with a scar that looked like a bullet crease on his right forearm if he hadnt been black he would have put moss in mind of a career noncomhe had that air of rough nononsense competence about him suddenly moss asked did you fight for the csa the last time around sure enough did spartacus answered got shot fo mah countryreckoned it was mah country in them days case you wonderin aint no niggers names on them goddamn memorials neither i even vote oncethey let me do it in on account of they was afeared that featherston fucker was gonna win then but he los an i never seen the inside o no votin booth since aint seen nothin but trouble since the freedom party come in a boxy oldfashioned birmingham with a whitehaired white man at the wheel drove by you could nail somebody like him easy enough make the confederates try and go after you here then hit somewhere else cantarella said dont want to shoot that there ofay spartacus said that theres doc thomason an he been settin bones an deliverin babies for buckra and niggers for damn near fifty years if you can only pay him a chicken he take your chicken if you cant pay him nothin he set your arm anyways aint all white folks badjus too many of em all right fine we dont shoot the doc he aint gonna be the only guy on the road though cantarella said shoot somebody else maybe even hang around to shoot at the first fuckers who come to see what you went and did then when theyre all flabbling about that kick em in the nuts some other place make them react to you we done some o that spartacus said we done a couple of people bombs too over by americus them freedom party assholes they dont like people bombs none he spoke with a certain grim satisfaction moss looked at cantarella the army captain was looking back at him moss didnt need to be able to read minds to know what cantarella was thinking they didnt like people bombs either but as weapons the weak could use against the strong they were hard to match how do you get people to volunteer to blow themselves up moss asked carefully not sure if the question would offend spartacus but the guerrilla leader looked at himlooked through him reallyand answered dont gotta drug em none or get em drunk dont gotta say wes gonna kill their wives an chillun neither dats what you mean aint it moss gave back an unhappy nod spartacus went on seeyou is a white man even if you comes from the us of a you is happy most o the time an you reckons everybody else happy most o the time aint like dat if you is a nigger in these here confederate states somebody blow hisself up here he a lucky man do jesus he mighty lucky he go out quickit dont hurt none he make the ofays pay and he dont go to no goddamn camp where they let him in but he dont come out no mo i got mo people wants to be people bombsn i got splosives an chances to use em shit nick cantarella said softly his comment was at least as reverent as spartacus he added that explains the mormons up in the usa tooto hell with me if it doesnt we is powerful jealous o them mormons spartacus said because they thought of people bombs and you didnt moss asked no no spartacus waved that aside on account o they is white jus like the rest o you damnyankees cant tell who a mormon is jus by lookin he go where he please before he press the button nobody worry about him none till too late moss and cantarella looked at each other again the negro wasnt wrong and he understood the difference between deaths and effective deaths a lot of great war generals hadnttheir method for smothering fires was burying them in bodies some officers in this war had the same disease daniel macarthurs name sprang to mind had spartacus worn stars on his shoulder straps instead of a collarless shirt with rolledup sleeves and dungarees out at the knees he might have made a formidable officer not just a sergeant but the united states didnt let negroes enlist in the army as privates let alone send them to west point to learn the art of command and the fine points of soldiering in a troubled voice moss said you make me wonder about my own country spartacus not just yours good the black man rumbled wonderins good aint nothin gonna change till you wonder if it oughta a band of his raiders slipped south from ellaville toward plains a small town west of americus moss and cantarella went along with them boltaction tredegars in their hands they were moving south and west from andersonville deeper into the confederacy in a way that was goodthe camp guards and county sheriffs and whoever else went after escaped pows were less likely to look for them there but they had to move cautiously negroes walking through peanut fields could be sharecroppers looking for work but whites doing the same thing were bound to rouse suspicion burnt cork the staple of minstrel shows for generations solved the problem up close cantarella and especially the fairer moss made unsatisfactory negroes but they passed muster at a distance what do we do when we get there moss asked spartacus much as we kin spartacus replied burn kill and then git that seemed to cover everything that needed covering as far as he was concerned real sharecroppers and farm laborers put the guerrillas up for the night the way the other blacks accepted them said everything that needed saying as far as moss was concerned not all the negroes in the csa would fight against the freedom party that took more spirit than some people owned he couldnt imagine a black betraying those who would fight to the authorities though negroes raised eyebrows at him and cantarella but relaxed when they heard the white men were escaped us pows damnyankees is all right said an old man with only a few teeth he didnt seem to know any other name for people from the united states sowbelly fatback hominy sweet potatoes harsh moonshinethe locals fed them what they had gots to make the ofay pay moss heard that again and again the band that approached plains numbered about fiftya platoons worth of men moss worried as he trudged through the night toward the little town if the confederates had a real garrison there they could slaughter the raiders dont flabble about it nick cantarella said when he worried out loud first thing is the smokes around here would know if they were layin for us second thing is they dont have enough guys to garrison every little pissant burg not if they want to fight a war with us too logic said he was right sometimes logic let you down with a thud but sounds good moss said sentries did patrol the peanut fields around plains with almost contemptuous ease the negroes disposed of the one who might have discovered them the grayhaired man died almost before he knew someone was drawing a knife across his throat only a small startled sigh escaped him a guerrilla threw aside his own squirrel gun and appropriated the sentrys tredegar too good a piece to waste on a damn fool he said lets go spartacus said they trotted silently into plains the silence didnt last long they started firing into some houses and tossing featherston fizzes into others fires roared to life alarm bells started ringing volunteer firemen emerged from their houses to fight the flames the raiders picked them off one after another niggers somebody shouted holy jesus theres niggers loose in plains phone wires cut cantarella demanded of spartacus we done took care of it the guerrilla leader said with a savage grin dont want no help comin from nowhere else here and there townsfolk fired from windows with rifles or shotguns those houses got volleys of fire from the negroes as well as gasoline bombs to kill the resisters or drive them out in the open where they made easier prey moss also heard womens screams that sounded more outraged than terrified you wont find any fighting force in the world where that shit doesnt happen cantarella said moss nodded which didnt mean he liked it any better somebody in plains organized defenders who fought as a group not as so many individuals over here jimmy a woman called we got trouble over here be there real quick miss lillian a man answered moss got a glimpse of him in the firelight a kid with a mouthful of teeth wearing a dark gray cs navy tunic over pajama bottoms home on leave whatever the reason he was here he was tough and smart and brave and hed make real trouble if he got even half a chance he didnt moss made sure of that the tredegars stock didnt fit his shoulder quite the same way as the us army springfield hed trained with but the difference didnt matter he pulled the trigger gentlyhe didnt squeeze it the rifle bucked jimmy the navy man here in the middle of georgia spun and crumpled good shot spartacus yelled without a commander who sounded as if he knew what he was doing the defenders went back to fighting every man for himself spartacus raiders werent well disciplined but they had a better notion of what they were doing than their foes they killed as many whites as they could started fires all over town and faded back into the countryside well moss said we yanked their tails pretty good sure did nick cantarella agreed now we see how hard they yank back clarence potter had been going at a dead run ever since he put on the confederate uniform again hed been going even harder than that since the war started and he was going harder still these past few weeks since things started turning against the csa to make matters worse he and nathan bedford forrest iii flinched whenever they saw each other even if they were just getting bad fried chicken in the war department cafeteria he wished forrest had kept his mouth shut now the chief of the general staff had him thinkingalways a dangerous thing to do what if jake featherston wasnt crazy like a fox what if he was just plain crazy period around the bend nutty as a fruitcake two cylinders short of a motor well what then potter muttered he wouldnt have been surprised if there were microphones in his subterranean office the president of the csa wouldnt need to be crazy to mistrust him not after everything that had happened between them over the past twentyfive years featherston wouldnt need to be crazy to mistrust his spymasters either no matter who they were but that handful of words seemed safe enough potter could have been wondering about any number of things he laughed as people will laugh when the other choice is crying their eyes out the rescue drive toward pittsburgh was moving forward the map on his wall showed that but it wasnt moving forward fast enough and the cargo airplanes that were supposed to supply the confederates trapped in the pittsburgh pocket were taking an ungodly beating potter didnt know what the officers whod promised transports could do the job had been smoking whatever it was he wished he had some now reality needed some blurring and featherston still wouldnt let the men in the pocket fight their way west to meet their wouldbe rescuers either what we have we hold he said over and over again clarence potter didnt know what hed been smoking either just to make matters more delightful lubbock was liable to fall some of the nuisance drives the usa had launched to keep the confederates from strengthening themselves for the rescue effort in ohio and pennsylvania were turning into bigger nuisances than even the generals whod launched them probably expected the attorney generals office of all things was having conniptions about this one somewhere southeast of lubbock was something called camp determination clarence potter didnt know what that was not in any official way he didnt want to know not in any official way he had a pretty good unofficial idea he also saw the need for places like that negro raiders were getting more and more annoying that navy man in that little georgia town shot down in front of his mother half the town was wrecked too and it wasnt the only one guerrillas had hit two people bombs in augusta one in savannah another in charleston potter whistled tunelessly between his teeth the really alarming part was things could have been worse the usa did only a halfhearted job of supplying black guerrillas whites up there didnt love them either if the damnyankees had gone allout they could have caused even more trouble than they did one bit of good newsmexican troops would take some of the spookfighting off the csas hands potter didnt know what jake featherston said to maximilian whatever it was it got the emperor of mexico moving it probably scared the living bejesus out of him too jake featherston was not a subtle man someone knocked on potters door he paused to put a couple of papers into drawers before he said come in here you are sir a lieutenant handed him a manila envelope thanks potter said do i need to sign for it no sir the junior officer answered which surprised him all right then the lieutenant saluted and disappeared when potter opened the envelope he understood it was a progress report from henderson v fitzbelmont that project was so secret it didnt have a paper trail this way no yankee spy filing signoff sheets would wonder about it better safe he quickly read through the report it was for the most part an account of technical difficulties uranium hexafluoride was poisonous and savagely corrosive fitzbelmont and his people were still working out techniques for handling it till they did separating u from u couldnt even start do you have any idea how the us project is proceeding fitzbelmont wrote potter didnt he wished he did he didnt think anyone in the confederate states did if someone did the report would have come through him wouldnt it if it didnt it would have gone only one place straight to jake featherston the president knew potter was loyal to the csaotherwise he wouldnt have got involved in this uranium business in the first place so everyone else in the country was probably as ignorant as he was about yankee progress if any featherston didnt seem to have found out he and nathan bedford forrest iii had met there in capitol square if the president did know neither man would still be free potters first thought was that neither would still be alive after a moment he realized that wasnt necessarily so some of the people ferd koenig bossed could keep a man alive and hurting for a long long time before they finally gave him peaceor maybe just made a mistake and hit him too hard or once too often potter rolled a sheet of paper into the typewriter on his desk and started an answer to professor fitzbelmont if he worked on something important he wouldnt have to think about some of the people who took the attorney generals orders dear professor he typed i hope you and your fmaily are well the error in the first sentence assured fitzbelmont the letter really came from him a simple code but an effective one thank you for your recent letter which i have just received i wish i were more familiar with the japanese project you mention but i am afraid i cannot tell you how close they are to invading the sandwich islands that of course was also code it might be obvious to anyone who intercepted the letter that potter wasnt talking about japan what he was talking about wouldnt be so obvious though he wondered if the japanese were working on nuclear fission they werent white men but theyd proved they could play the white mans game he shrugged that wasnt his worry it was probably the usas nightmare if one bomb could wreck pearl harbor or honolulu how did you defend them back to what was his problem he clacked away at the big upright machine it had a stiff action but that didnt matter he was a twofingered typist with a touch like a tapdancing rhinoceros you did not state when we could expect success from your own work its early completion could result in a major increase in efficiency hoping to hear from you soon on this point i have the honor to remain he finished the flowery closing phrases on automatic pilot took out the sheet of paper and signed the squiggle that might have been his name he put the letter in an envelope sealed it and wrote professor fitzbelmonts name and washington university on the outside then he took it down the hall to the couriers office first carefully locking the door to his own office behind him he nodded to the major in charge of the war departments secret couriers morning dick he said i need one of your boys to take this out of the city yes sir we can do that the dispatching officer took the envelope glanced at the address and nodded do you want someone whos been there before or a new man that was the only question he asked who henderson v fitzbelmont was and what the professor was working on were none of his business and he knew it either way will do potter answered fitzbelmont might recognize a courier hed seen before then again he might not he wasnt quite the absentminded professor people made jokes about but he wasnt far removed either potter got the feeling subatomic particles and differential equations were more real to him than most of the human race well take care of it then the major said youll want the courier to report delivery i expect orally when he gets back here potter said the major raised an eyebrow potter looked back as if across a poker table he held the high cards and he knew it so did the major whatever you say sir thanks dick potter went back to his own office whatever you say sir he liked the sound of that as a general he heard it a lot the more he heard it the more he liked it how long had it been since jake featherston heard anything but whatever you say sir since he took the oath of office in certainly in most things nobodyd tried arguing with him for years before that and he was a man whod liked getting his own way even when he was only an artillery sergeant if somebody had tried telling the president more often the country might be in better shape right now or it might notfeatherston might just have ordered naysayers shot or sent to camps hed done a lot of that potter lit a cigarette and blew a meditative cloud of smoke up toward the ceiling two questions was jake featherston leading the confederate states to ruin and could anybody else do a better job if featherston came down with a sudden case of loss of life with the building disaster in pittsburgh with featherstons stubborn refusal to cut his losses and pull out which looked worse now than it had when nathan bedford forrest iii and potter sat on the park bench the answer to the first had gone from unlikely through maybe and on toward probably even if it hadnt got there yet as for the second potter blew out more smoke that wasnt nearly so obvious nobody could wear jake featherstons shoes the vice president don partridge was a cipher a placeholder somebody to fill a slot because the confederate constitution said you needed to fill it his only virtue was knowing he was a lightweight ferdinand koenig the attorney general would have the freedom party behind him if the long knives came out he was able enough in a gray bureaucratic way but about as inspiring as a mudflat as a leader potter shuddered ferd koenig was one of those people who made a terrific number two but a terrible number one unlike some of them he had the sense to realize it which leftwho congress was a freedom party rubber stamp potter couldnt think of any governor worth a pitcher of warm spit besides most people outside a governors home state had never heard of him what about forrest clarence potter blinked there in the privacy of his office he was surprised the idea had taken so long to occur to him he laughed at himself you old whig you he murmured if the armed forces were going to overthrow the presidentand it wouldnt happen any other waywho better to take over the government than the chief of the general staff the freedom party had danced on the spirit of the constitution while holding on to most of the letter throwing it out the window altogether seemed not just unnatural but wicked but forrest just might do losing the war is wicked anything else next to losing this war to the usa anything else looks good anything at all potter nodded decisively about that he had no doubts at all the united states had forced a harsh peace on the confederate states in but hadnt kept it going for very long terms would be even worse this time and the united states would make sure the confederates never got off their knees again the next time potter saw nathan bedford forrest iii in the cafeteria he nodded casually and said something id like to talk to you about when we have the chance really forrest said as casually can we do it here potter shook his head no sir he answered needs privacy from one general to another that wasnt a surprising thing to say for a split second forrests eyes widened then he nodded and put some silverware on his tray michael pound grinned as his barrel rumbled forward jouncing over rubble and grinding a lot of the big chunks into smaller ones advancing feels good doesnt it sir he said lieutenant don griffiths nodded youd better believe it sergeant weve done too much falling back yes sir pound wouldnt have argued with that for a moment looks to me like the confederates are starting to feel the pinch heres hoping griffiths said i wouldnt want to try reinforcing and supplying an army the size of theirs by air ill tell you that and i dont think theyve got an airstrip left that our artillery cant reach my heart bleedsbut not as much as theyre going to bleed before long pound said i wonder why they havent tried to break out to the west somebody in their high command must have his head wedged too bad for them he had no respect for his own superiors finding out some dunderheads wore butternut was reassuring a rifle bullet pinged off the barrels armored side that wouldnt do the confederates any good as if to prove it wouldnt the bow machine gun chattered pound peered through his own gunsight but he couldnt see what the bow gunner was shooting atif he was shooting at anything it hardly mattered sometimes off to the left something on the confederate side of the line blew up with a roar loud enough to penetrate the barrels thick skin that sounded good pound said wonder what it was want me to stick my head out and look around lieutenant griffiths asked not important enough sir pound answered who knows if our machine gun took out whoever was shooting at us barrel commander was a dangerous job now that pound had finally found an officer with some notion of what he was doing he didnt want to lose him for no good reason there were too many times when a barrel commander had perfectly good reasons for exposing himself to enemy fire something else blew up even louder griffiths put a hand to his earphones he often did that when he was getting a wireless message sergeant pound had no idea whether it helped or how it could but hed never said anything about it to the officer it couldnt hurt lieutenant griffiths leaned forward to use the speaking tube to the drivers position forward again and a little to the left but slowly he said he turned to pound that was an ammunition dump they wont be able to shell us so well for a while we hope said pound ever willing to see the cloud next to the silver lining well yes we hope theres always that griffiths agreed but weve got infantry moving up with us with luck theyll keep the shortrange trouble away from us as for the other sides barrels and antibarrel gunsweve done all right so far of course weve got a pretty good gunner so we do pound knew his own talents too well to be modest about them half a second later than he should have he added youre not bad at spotting trouble before it spots us best way to get rid of it that i know no sooner had he said that than something clanged against the front of the turret with force enough to shake the whole barrel im dead pound thought only a moment later did he realize he would have been too dead to think if that round had got through thank god for the upgraded armor on the new turret if this beast hadnt been retrofitted id be burnt meat right now without waiting for orders the driver roared forward looking for cover behind the nearest pile of rubble then abruptly he slammed on the brakes did you see it sir pound asked no goddammit griffiths sounded angry at himself that son of a bitch knows where were at and i didnt spot the muzzle flash wherever he is hes hidden good not sporting pound agreed hed been more than happy enough to ambush cs barrels from an empty garage but having them turn the tables on him wasnt playing fair someone with a more objective view might not have found that unfair but so what it wasnt the impartial observers neck it was his he traversed the turret staring through the gunsight as he did the hatch opened lieutenant griffiths stood up to get a better look than he could through the periscopes in the cupola this was one of those times griffiths might get shot but he also might get a better look at the hidden cannon or barrel that had just come within inches of incinerating him it didnt fire again which argued that the rubble in front of pounds barrel gave pretty good protection a rifle bullet snapped past as always the sound seemed hatefully malicious lieutenant griffiths ducked a littleyou did that without thinkingbut he didnt come back inside the steel shell he had balls pound nodded approvingly probably not somewhere close the gunner thought looking for straight lines that broke the irregular pattern of the ruins of pittsburgh if the enemy were close he would have a better shot at the us barrel and if he were close his round likely would have penetrated in spite of the improved turret a cannon made a damned effective door knocker there or pound thought so anyhow armorpiercing he snapped armorpiercing cecil bergman answered the loader slammed a blacktipped cartridge into the breech pound worked the elevation handwheel fifteen hundred yards was a long shot as near as he could tell he fired at the same time as the cs gunner the enemys shot snarled past a few feet high pounds struck home the enemy barrel started to burn hit lieutenant griffiths shouted how on earth did you make that shot twentyodd years of practice sir pound answered the confederate gunner hadnt had so muchthough hed hit pounds barrel before pound even knew he was there he wouldnt get another chance now a great cloud of black smoke was rising almost a mile away the shot ricocheting inside the barrel would have killed or maimed some of the crew the fire would be searing the rest by the way the smoke billowed out that barrel was a total loss odds were the crew was too pound had bailed out of a crippled barrel but then only the engine compartment was burning could anyone get out here he didnt think so i just killed five men most of the time he didnt worry about that when he watched a barrel brew up it was only a machine that died but hed just had his own brush with death and it reminded him of the soldiers inside the barrels he knew what they were going through hed come close to going through it himself if hed met them in a bar he could have drunk the night away talking shop with them but theyd just done their best to kill him and their best was hideously close to good enough theyre dead and im alive and thats how i want it to be we can move up a little more now sir he said griffiths thought about it then nodded he called up to the driver the barrel came out from behind the pile of wreckage and clattered towards another one pound tensed when it came out into the open if the confederates had drawn a bead on them but no hardenedsteel projectile tore into the machines vitals he breathed again as a pile of tumbled bricks came between his machine and the people who wanted to do unto it as hed done unto theirs us foot soldiers ran forward with the barrels a confederate machine gunner opened up on them front lieutenant griffiths shouted identified pound answered he turned his head and shouted to the loader he he bergman said a whitetipped highexplosive round went into the breech pound lined up the sights on the cs machine guns winking muzzle he jerked the lanyard the cannon bellowed the shell casing clanked on the floor of the fighting compartment a inch shell didnt have room for a whole lot of explosive a threeincher from one of the confederate barrels would have held almost twice as much sandbags and rubble flew from in front of the cs gun but it kept shooting tracers drew fiery lines through the air pound abstractly admired the enemy gunners nerve if a round burst right in front of him he would have got the hell out of there they kept doing what theyd been trained to do another round he said in went the shell he swung the cannons muzzle a gnats hair to the left and fired again another hit but the enemy gun went on firing he needed two more rounds before it fell silent the stink of cordite was thick in the turret stubborn bastards lieutenant griffiths said yes sir pound agreed coughing theyre the ones youve especially got to get rid of with the machine gun knocked out us infantry moved up some more they took casualties with automatic rifles and submachine guns the confederate soldiers could outshoot them but how long could the confederates keep outshooting them if more ammunition didnt come into pittsburgh the confederates couldnt use captured us ammo unless they also used captured springfields theyd chosen different calibers on purpose to make it harder for us soldiers to turn captured automatic rifles against them it must have seemed a good idea at the time it probably was but it cut both ways off to the left a us barrel got hit and started burning nothing in pittsburgh came cheap nothing came easy the confederates werent going to quit and they fell back only when they had no choice how long could they keep it up he shrugged that wasnt his worry people with shoulder straps and metal ornaments on them had to fret about such things all he had to do was shoot whatever he and lieutenant griffiths spotted in front of their barrel and hope like hell nobody shot him he nodded that would do nicely shells started bursting around them the bursts werent the ordinary kind they sounded wrong and even through the gunsight he saw the crawling mist that spread from them gas he yelled griffiths clanged down the hatch on top of the cupola i saw it he said i was hoping those fuckers were running short no such luck i guess no sir pound said as he put on his mask out in the open us infantrymen paused to do the same pound went on now well throw some at the confederates just to make sure they have to wear masks too as long as both sides have it it doesnt change anything im not saying youre wrong griffiths answered he had his mask on too but i am saying its out there pound couldnt very well quarrel with that the barrel commander started to wave to emphasize his point he choked off the gesture before it was well begun the inside of a turret was a crowded place michael pound made a good prophet as he often did a us gas barrage followed in short order it was heavier than the one the enemy had laid down infantrymen advanced in short rushes the barrel moved up to the next decent firing position another block of pittsburgh cleared of confederates xix new years eve one more day till flora blackford was back in her philadelphia apartment she hadnt expected to be anywhere else even if she hadnt campaigned at all she thought she would have beaten sheldon vogelman people in her district were used to reelecting her she nodded to herself it was a nice habit for them to have joshua was out with friends ill be back next year hed said how long had people been making that joke probably as long as people had divided time into years he was liable to come back drunk too even if he was underage well if he did the hangover the next morning ought to teach him not to do it again for a while she could hope so anyhow underage she muttered and clicked her tongue between her teeth he would turn eighteen in old enough to be conscripted and conscripted he probably would be he was healthy he didnt have flat feet a punctured eardrum or bad eyes nothing could keep him out of the warexcept being a congresswomans son and he was as stubborn and as stupid as her brother had been in the last war he didnt want her to do anything to keep him out not even uncle davids artificial leg could make him change his mind he didnt believe anything like that would happen to him no one ever believed anything would happen to himtill it did the telephone rang it made her start she hurried towards it more relieved than anything else if she was talking to somebody she wouldnt have to worry about joshua so much hello flora that cheerful baritone could belong to only one man hello franklin she said what can i do for you roosevelt had never called her at the apartment before how would you like to ring in the new year with me at the war department she hesitated only a moment ill be over as soon as i can get a cab see you in a little while then he hung up she didnt think the usas military planners had a fancy party waiting for her but the assistant secretary of war wasnt going to go into detail about why he wanted to see her not over the telephone she called the cab company they started to tell her she would have to wait half an hour its our busiest day of the year lady sorry the dispatcher didnt sound the least bit sorry this is congresswoman blackford flora didnt tell him he would be sorry if she didnt get a cab sooner than that but she didnt need to either he got the message loud and clear a cab sat waiting when she got to the street an ordinary person wouldnt have been able to summon one so fast remembering that chafed at her socialist sense of equality she consoled herself by thinking she carried more responsibility than an ordinary person from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs right now she needed to get to the war department in a hurry the cabby hopped out and held the door open for her where to maam he asked she told him as she got in he nodded fast as i can he promised the dispatcher must have let him know who she was he kept his word but he couldnt go very fast confederate bombers had been over the night before so some of the roads had fresh craters while sawhorses and red tape closed off others so specialists could try to defuse time bombs flora had heard their life expectancy was measured in weeks that information was secret from the public but she feared the specialists knew it not far from downtown the wreckage of a downed cs airplane further snarled traffic nice to see we nail one every once in a while the taxi driver said those people need to pay for what they do the little pause said hed remembered just in time that he carried someone important yes flora almost spoke more strongly herself there wasnt enough plywood and cardboard in philadelphiathere probably wasnt enough in the worldto cover up all the windows the confederates had blown out so many buildings had pieces bitten from them or were only charred ruins ordinary bombs could start fires and the confederates dropped incendiaries too one popular propaganda poster showed a long skinny incendiary bomb with jake featherstons bony face at one end clamped in a pair of tongs and about to go into a bucket of water underneath the sizzling confederate president were three words cool him off here you go maam the driver pulled up in front of the war department it had taken plenty of damage too even if it was built from the best reinforced concrete taxpayer dollars could buy most of its business went on underground these days flora didnt know how far underground the tunnels ran she didnt need to know not many people did she paid the cabby her breath smoked as she went up the battered steps she showed the sentries her identity papers im here to see assistant secretary roosevelt she said hold on for a minute maam one of them picked up a telephone and spoke into it after not much longer than the promised wait he hung up and nodded to her you can go ahead maam youre legit all right willie take her to mr roosevelts office willie looked younger than her own joshua he led her down endless flights of stairs all she knew when he walked her along a corridor was that at least one more level lay below the one she was on he stopped at a door with assistant secretary of war neatly painted on the frostedglass window here you are maam when you need to come up call the front desk and somebody will come down to guide you dont go wandering around on your own he meant all right flora answered willie looked relieved she opened the door hello flora come in franklin d roosevelt said sitting at his desk a cigarette holder in his mouth at a jaunty angle he looked strong and virile but he sat in a wheelchair and went on youll have to excuse my not rising im afraid a shrug of his broad shoulders might have added what can you do of course flora said quickly and then happy new year she couldnt go wrong with that same to you roosevelt answered and i hope it will be a happy new year for the country too were in better shape now than we were when started anyhow i dont think the confederates will be able to get out of the noose around pittsburgh and that will cost them that will cost them plenty good flora said lord knows theyve cost us plenty is that what you wanted to talk about tonight as a matter of fact no i wanted to tell you columbus has discovered america flora didnt know how to take that with a smile seemed the best way i thought he might have she agreed otherwise wed be doing this somewhere else and speaking a different languagea couple of different languages i expect roosevelts big booming laugh filled the office well when youre right youre right but thats the message we got back from washington statehanford the name of the town isthe other day it means theyve done the first big part of what they set out to do and what is that franklin she asked ive sat on the secret for so long dont you think im entitled to find out thats what i wanted to talk about tonight he answered i have clearance from the president to tell you whats what he cocked his head and gave her a coy even an arch smile so you want to know eh maybe a little flora said and roosevelt laughed again tell me everything you know about uranium he said flora sat silent for perhaps half a minute there she said i just did this time roosevelt positively chortled well thats what i said when this whole thing startedmy exact words to tell you the truth now im going to tell you what the professors with the slide rules told me and he did he was a lively wellorganized speaker he could have lectured at any college in the country floras head soon started spinning even so uranium u uranium hexafluoride centrifuges gaseous diffusion thermal diffusion it all seemed diffuse to her and quite a bit of it seemed gaseous what have they done out there now she asked theyve enriched enough uranium to have a selfsustaining reaction roosevelt replied enriched flora had learned meant getting a mix with more uthe kind that could explodeand less u which couldnt a sustained reaction wasnt an explosion but she gathered it was a long step on the way towards one if everything goes right and we get the weapon soon enough this could win us the war couldnt it flora said well nobody knows for sure roosevelt answered but the professors seem to think so the germans are working on it too she asked yes no doubt about it theyre the ones who found fission in the first place he said all right what about the confederates flora asked we think they have something going on the assistant secretary of war said carefully we dont know as much about it as we wish we did were trying to find out more that sounds like a good idea floras own calm meant she would have started screaming at him if hed told her anything else how much do they know about what were doing that is the question maybe roosevelt was quoting hamlet maybe just answering her the truth is were not sure counterintelligence hasnt picked up whatever intelligence theyve gathered on us i hope youre trying everything under the sun flora said again in lieu of yelling oh yes roosevelt said so far weve only figured out one defense against these atomic explosions really thats one more than id imagined flora said what is it to be somewhere else when they go off oh flora laughed but franklin roosevelt wasnt laughing now he meant it another thing she hadnt imagined was a race where the winners won everything and the losers were probably ruined forever how long between the uh sustained reaction and a real bomb we can use roosevelt spread his hands thats what were trying to find out the physicists say anywhere between six months and ten years depending on how fast they can solve the engineering problems thats no good flora said if its ten years for us and six months for the csa well never get the chance to finish they tell me its more likely to be the other way around roosevelt said for one thing we do seem to have started before the confederates did for another weve got three times as many physicists and engineers and such as they do serves them right for not educating their negroes flora stopped and grimaced these days the confederates were doing worse with their negroes than not educating them thinking of what they were doing made her say wed better win this race i think we will franklin roosevelt sounded confidentbut then he usually did whether well win it in time to use one of those bombs in this war that i dont know and id be lying if i said i did what about germany and england and france what about japan flora asked as i said we have to guess the kaiser is somewhere ahead of us how far i dont know roosevelt said the others i dont know that either if we have intelligence about what theyre doing it doesnt come through me flora thought it should have but that wasnt her province she decided she had done the right thing by not making a fuss about the budget entry shed found if this worked it would win the war and if it didnt how many hundreds of millions of dollars would they have thrown down a rathole as passed into she tried not to think about that armstrong grimes had charge of a platoon in the middle of salt lake city in the middle of winter he could have done without the honor but lieutenant streczyk was somewhere far back of the line his left leg gone below the knee hed been unlucky or incautious enough to step on a mine one of these days they might send another junior officer out to the front to take charge of things but the utah campaign got what other fronts didnt want or need and these days didnt get a whole lot of that till some luckless and probably brainless lieutenant showed up armstrong had the job yossel reisen commanded the squad that had been his if this shit keeps up well be majors by the time we got out of here armstrong said i dont even care if im a corporal when i get out of here yossel answered as long as i get out thats all that matters well yeah im not gonna tell you youre wrong on account of youre not armstrong said wish to god the mormons would pack it in and quit they gotta know aint no way in hell they can win i dont think they care i think all theyve got left is going down swinging yossel paused to light a cigarette he and armstrong sprawled behind a stone wall that protected them from snipers if armstrong stuck his head up he could see the rebuilt and rewrecked mormon temple ahead he didntif he were so foolish a mormon rifleman would put a round in his ear after a drag yossel went on jews were like that once upon a time they rose up against the romans whenever they saw the chance and the romans handed them their heads every damn time palestine these days was a sleepy ottoman province it had lots of arabs some jews and just enough turks to garrison the towns and collect taxes no matter how holy it was nothing much ever happened there odds were nothing ever would something erupted from behind the mormon lines screaming meemie armstrong yelled the spigotmortar bomb came down a few hundred yards away even that was close enough to shake him with the blast they really do love you yossel reisen said ever since you had that mormon strip weve got more little presents like that than anybody else oh shut up armstrong said not because reisen was wrong but because he was right armstrong wished he hadnt given the mormon a hard time too fighting these maniacs was hard enough when you were just one enemy among many when they were trying to kill you in particular the most armstrong could say was that they hadnt done it yet us artillery woke up about ten minutes later shells screamed into the area from which the screaming meemie had come but then the launcher was bound to be long gone how far do you think it is to the temple armstrong asked his voice sounded strange because he was talking through his gas mask some of the crap the army threw at the mormons was liable to blow back into the us positions and the mormons still had gas of their own which they fired from mortars whenever the artillery used it against them armstrong didnt know whether they got it from the csa or cooked it up in a basement in ogden he didnt care either he did know it was a major pain in the rear yossel reisen also looked like a pigsnouted martian monster in a bad serial couple miles he answered sounding almost as unearthly as he looked yeah about what i figured armstrong agreed how long you think well need to get there how hard will those mormon fuckers fight to hang on to it too long and even harder than theyve fought already yossel said that wasnt scientific but it matched what armstrong was thinking much too well he said what do you think the odds are well live through it this time reisen didnt answer right away when he did he said well were still here so far armstrong almost asked him what the odds of that were the only reason he didnt was he already knew the answer the odds were damn slim he wouldnt have been leading a squad if that people bomb hadnt got sergeant stowe he wouldnt have had the platoon if that mine hadnt nailed lieutenant streczyk either or both of those disasters could have happened to him just as easily so could a thousand others the same went for yossel but they were both still here neither of them much more than scratched in the next few days armstrong really started wondering how long he would last more and more barrels came forward most were the waddling monsters kept in storage since the great war but some more modern machines went into the mix none though had the stouter turrets and bigger guns that marked the latest models every time one of those rolled off the assembly line it headed straight for the closest confederate concentration more artillery came in too and when the weather cleared enough for bombers and fighters to fly there were more of them and less antiquated machines than usual he knew the signs the united states were gearing up for another big push all the support would help when the balloon went up though it would still be man against man rifle against rifle machine gun against machine gun land mine against dumb luck armstrong had a wholesome respect for the men he faced nobody whod been in the line more than a few days had anything but respect for the men of what they called the republic of deseret armstrong respected them so much he wished he didnt have to go after them one more time such wishes usually mattered not at all this time his fairy godmother must have been listening the high command pulled his battered regiment out of the line and stuck in a fresh one that was at full strength breaks my heart armstrong said as he trudged away from what was bound to be a bloody mess yeah i can tell yossel reisen agreed im pretty goddamn disappointed myself if anybody wants to know the truth they both laughed the giddy laughs of men whod just got reprieves from the governor the rest of the soldiers heading back into reserve were every bit as relieved they were dirty and skinny and unshaven their uniforms were faded and torn and spotted a lot of them wore ordinary denim jackets and canvas topcoats liberated from the ruins instead of armyissue warm clothing their eyes were far away by contrast the men replacing them might have stepped out of a recruiting film they were clean their uniforms were clean their greatcoats were the same greengray as everything else armstrong was younger than most of the rookies but felt twenty years older these fellows hadnt been through hellyet does your mama know youre here he called to a natty private moving up by the privates expression he wanted to say something about armstrongs mother too he didnt have the nerve it wasnt just that armstrong outranked him either the kid probably hadnt seen action yet armstrongs grubby clothes his dirt and his whiskers said he had hed earned the right to pop off before long the youngster would enjoy it tooif that was the word and if he lived look at all these men yossel nodded toward the troops marching past remember when our regiment was this big been a while armstrong tried to work out just how long it had been he needed some thought shit i think wed taken enough casualties after the first time we ran into the confederates in ohio to be smaller than that outfit i think youre right yossel said and they never send enough replacements to get us back up to strength either nope armstrong pulled out a pack of cigarettes stuck one in his mouth and offered them to yossel the other noncom took one he lit it armstrong leaned close to get his started then went on the ones we do get arent worth much either if they live long enough they mostly learn yossel said those first few days in the line though yeah armstrong knew hed lived through his opening brushes with combat as much by dumb luck as for any other reason after that hed started to have a better idea of what went into staying alive when featherstons fuckers or mormon fanatics tried to do him in that gave him no guarantee of living through the war something he knew but tried not to think about but it did improve his chances replacements got killed and wounded in large numbers just because they didnt know how not to they didnt dig in fast enough they didnt recognize cover when they saw it they didnt know when to stay down and when to jump up they couldnt gauge whether incoming artillery bursts were close enough to be dangerous and that wasnt the worst of it the worst was that they got veterans killed too because they gave things away without even knowing they were doing it most veterans tried to stay away from them those first couple of weeks that wasnt fair it meant even more replacements became casualties than might have been otherwise but it saved veterans livesand it saved the pain of getting to know somebody who wasnt likely to stick around long anyway a swarm of soldiers waited at the makeshift bus depot to go from the line back to some of the comforts of civilization hot showers hot food clean clothes real beds armstrong surveyed the swarm with a jaundiced eye somethings fucked up somewhere he predicted bet your ass sarge that was one of the men already milling around goddamn mormons snuck a machine gun somewhere down the highway they shot up a bus like you wouldnt believe now everybodys trying to hunt em down christ i hope so armstrong said thatd be what everybody needs wouldnt it getting your goddamn head blown off when youre on your way to r and r sooner we kill all the mormons happier ill be the other soldier said then we can get on with the real war finally starting to go our way a little maybe maybe yeah depends on how much you believe of what they tell you armstrong knew damn well the wireless didnt tell the truth all the time when he was in ohio it had gone on and on about us victories and advances while the army got bundled back and back and back again he couldnt prove it wasnt doing the same thing about what was going on in ohio and pennsylvania now the other soldier spat a stream of brown tobacco juice there is that he allowed armstrong had thought about chewing tobacco himself you could do it where the sight of a match or a glowing coal or even the smell of cigarette smoke would get you killed an officer called the route south has been resecured boarding will commence in five minutes do i want r and r enough to risk getting shot on the way armstrong wondered he must have because he got on the bus when his turn came when cincinnatus driver walked into the des moines army recruiting station the sergeant behind the desk looked up in surprise from his paperwork cincinnatus eyed him the same way the sergeant held his pen between the claws of a steel hook what can i do for you the sergeant asked i want to join up cincinnatus answered sorry pal we dont use colored soldiers the sergeant said navy takes colored cooks and stewards if you want to you can talk to them you dont mind my saying so though youre a tad overage that cane wont do you any good either you got a uniform on even though you got a hook cincinnatus said i was in the last one the recruiting sergeant said thats where i got it im no damn good at the front but i can do this well i was in the last one too cincinnatus said drove a truck haulin men an supplies in kentucky and tennessee been drivin a truck moren thirty years now sure as hell can do it some more put me in a deuceandahalf and you got one more white boy can pick up a rifle and shoot at featherstons fuckers ah the sergeant looked more interested so you want to be a civilian auxiliary do you if thats what you call it these days cincinnatus answered last time around i was just a truck driver he eyed the man behind the desk they pay any better on account of the fancy name oh yeah paland then you wake up the sergeant said cincinnatus chuckled he hadnt expected anything different the veteran reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a fresh form he did that with his left hand which was still flesh and blood then he poised the pen over the blank form name cincinnatus driver after the sergeant wrote it down he glanced over at cincinnatus heard of you i think didnt you get exchanged from the confederates not so long ago yes suh thats right cincinnatus said you dont call me sir you call me sergeant the noncom scribbled a note he handled the pen very well as he wrote he went on just so you know theyre gonna check you seven ways from sunday on account of you were in the csa they can do that cincinnatus agreed they reckon a colored mand help jake featherston though theyre pretty goddamn stupid yeah youd think so wouldnt you but it all depends the sergeant said maybe they got your wife an kids down there and theyll feed em to the alligators unless you play along my wife an kids are right here in des moines cincinnatus said good for you good for them the sergeant said you know what i mean though theyll check nowyou say you drove an army truck in the great war what was your base who commanded your unit i drove out of covington kentucky where i come from cincinnatus replied fella who ran things was a lieutenant name of straubing the sergeant raised his right eyebrow think hed remember you straubing had shot a confederate diehard dead on cincinnatus front porch with a jerky nod cincinnatus said reckon he would he still in the army oh you might say so the sergeant wrote another note theres a straubing whos a brigadier general in logistics these days might not be the same man but you dont hear the name every day and the specializations right you know what logistics is are you a dumb nigger he meant but cincinnatus did know the answer to that one gettin men and stuff where theyre supposed to go when theyre supposed to get there right the first time the sergeant nodded bet you did drive a truck in the last war where else would you have heard the word i done said i did cincinnatus paused but i bet you hear a lot o lies sittin where youre sittin oh you might say so the sergeant repeated deadpan you sure you want to go through with this mr driver yes suhuh sergeantan i tell you why cincinnatus answered the sergeant raised a polite eyebrow cincinnatus went on you just called me mistuh aint no white man anywhere in the whole csa call a colored man mistuh call him boy call him uncle if his hairs goin gray like mine is mistuh never in a thousand years an if you dont respect a man you dont have no trouble killin him off uhhuh the sergeant wrote something else on cincinnatus papers cincinnatus tried to read what it was but he couldnt not upside down the man with the hook looked across the desk at the man with the cane thanks for coming in mr driver like i told you were going to have to look at you harder because the confederates turned you loose you have a telephone no suh cincinnatus answered all right well send you a letter then the sergeant said probably be ten days two weeks something like that well see what general straubing has to say about you thank you sergeant cincinnatus did it right this time when he was in covington he always treated the colored fellows who drove for him like they was men reckon he was the first white man i ever knew who did cincinnatus went home not so happy as hed hoped but not so disappointed as he might have been he felt as if he were cluttering up the apartment that was another reason hed visited the recruiting station but his urge to get even with the confederates counted for more dont want to jus sit here playin with my grandbabies he told elizabeth i love my grandbabies but i got some doin in me yet i didnt say nothin dear his wife answered i love you too cincinnatus said mostly because she hadnt said anything theyd been married a long time despite the separations theyd gone through she knew him better than anybody the letter from the recruiting station came eight days later that was sooner than the sergeant had said cincinnatus didnt know whether the quick answer meant good news or bad he opened the letterand still didnt know it just told him to come back to the station two days hence why couldnt that blamed man say one way or the other he asked when he took it upstairs you find out then thats all elizabeth said she was calmer than he wasand she wasnt trying to find out what shed be doing for the rest of the war cincinnatus took a trolley to the recruiting station bright and early on the appointed day he got there before it opened and went across the street to a diner to get out of the cold the guy behind the counter who served him a cup of coffee gave him a fishy look but took his five cents without saying anything the onehanded sergeant got to the station when cincinnatus was about halfway through the cup he left it on the counter and limped over to find out what was what the sergeant was getting his own pot of coffee going on a hot plate he looked up without much surprise when the bell above the door jingled good morning mr driver he said you didnt waste any time did you no suhuh no sergeant cincinnatus said and the noncom smiled at the selfcorrection cincinnatus wished hed got it right the first time he went on you gonna let me drive a truck or shall i see what i can do in a war plant gotta do my bit some kind o way reaching into the top desk drawer the recruiting sergeant pulled a sheet of army stationery heres what brigadier general straubing has to say about you mr driver he set a pair of reading glasses on his nose i remember cincinnatus well he was a solid driver clever and brave and resourceful i have no doubts as to his loyalty or devotion to the united states hows that thatsmighty fine sergeant mighty fine cincinnatus said so you let me drive again well let you drive the sergeant answered you said it yourselfif you go behind the wheel a younger man gets to pick up a springfield aint quite what i said cincinnatus knew he ought to leave it there but he couldnt what i said was a white man gets to pick up a springfield i still dont reckon thats fair do jesus in the last war the confederates let some o their colored men carry guns yeah and theyve been regretting it ever since the sergeant said dryly he held up his hook you can say it wouldnt be like that here you can say it and i wouldnt give you any grief about it mr driver cause i think youre likely right but i dont make the rules and neither do you the war department says well play the game like this so we will do you want to do it or dont you if you do youve got about a million forms to fill out if you dont well thanks for stopping by he had no give in him he didnt need to the government backed him straight down the line cincinnatus sighed let me have the damn forms you aint what you oughta be but youre a damn sight bettern jake featherston the sergeant had to go back to a filing cabinet to get the papers youre a sensible man mr driver the difference between bad and worse is a lot bigger than the difference between good and better cincinnatus started to answer then stopped before he said anything that would give him something to think about when he had the time now paperwork the recruiting sergeant had exaggerated but not by much cincinnatus filled out forms till he got writers crampnot an ailment he worried about very often officially he wasnt joining the army officially he was becoming a civilian employee of the us government the undersigned agrees acknowledges and accepts that his duties may require him to enter areas not definitively known to be safe he wasnt sure what definitively meant but he signed anyway he knew he wasnt going to be driving from idaho to minnesota for purposes of selfprotection employees hired for the aforementioned duty may be permitted to carry firearms another form told him he looked at the recruiting sergeant the confederates catch me with a gun they gonna shoot my ass he said dont worry about it the sergeant answered if they catch you without a gun theyll shoot your ass anyway since cincinnatus couldnt very well argue with that he signed again at last only one sheet of paper was left a loyalty oath cincinnatus signed that too then set down the pen and shook his hand back and forth to work out the kinks lot o paper to go through he said what do i do next go home the sergeant told him which caught him by surprise bring a suitcasea small suitcasewith you monday morning you report to the state capitol room after that you do what they tell you all right thank you kindly sergeant cincinnatus said thank you mr driver you said ityoure doing your bit the sergeant looked down at his hook for a moment then up at cincinnatus again and if you have to use a gun make it count i do that sergeant cincinnatus promised yes suh i do that aclear predawn morning in midjanuary when irving morrell looked west he saw red flares in the skyconfederate recognition signals when he looked east he saw more red flares the confederates to the east and west could probably see each others flares too only twenty or thirty miles separated them twenty or thirty miles and the force morrell commanded so far the cs rescue force pushing east hadnt been able to reach the men trapped in and around pittsburgh morrell didnt intend that they should either he turned to his wireless man send rosebud to philadelphia jenkins he said rosebud yes sir the wireless operator didnt know what the code phrase meant he sent it anyway a moment later he nodded to morrell received sir good morrell said now we see how they like that yes sir jenkins repeated uh whats it all about sir morrell didnt think the wireless man could be a confederate plant he didnt think so but he didnt take any chances either it means featherstons fuckers are going to have some tough sledding thats what he said that seemed safe enoughthe younger man still didnt know where or how he could have meant sledding literally snow blanketed eastern ohio and western pennsylvania everywhere he looked everything was whiteexcept for the soot smears that marked burntout barrels wrecked strongpoints and other works of man artillery boomed off to the north those were us guns throwing death at the confederates pushing in from the west the men in butternut who hung on around pittsburgh hadnt pushed west to try to join them maybe they were too short of fuel to move by now featherstons transport aircraft had taken a devil of a beating and they were flying in from farther and farther away too as us bombers plastered their fields had morrell been running the confederates show he would have ordered the cs troops in pittsburgh to break out no matter what yes they would have given up the city yes they would have taken losses but if theyd done it soon enough they would have saved most of their men and somemaybe a lotof their equipment now they were in real trouble that didnt break morrells heart for the first year of the war everything jake featherston tried seemed golden hed jumped on the united states with both feet hed held the usa down too even though he ran a smaller country that had really alarmed morrell featherston didnt just intend to lick the united states he intended to conquer them morrell wouldnt have believed it was possibletill the confederates cut the usa in half after that it was hang on tight and try to survive looking back on things the us counteroffensive in virginia was illconceived sure charge right into the teeth of the enemys defenses featherston had known the united states were coming and hed baked a cakea reinforcedconcrete cake fredericksburg the wilderness nobody in his right mind would want to attack in places like those that didnt stop daniel macarthur of course he attacked and paid for it and attacked again and got another bloody nose he hurt the csa too but not in proportion sir theres enemy pressure near cambridge jenkins reported is there morrell said the men and barrels in butternut would be coming along the eastwest highway that went through the manufacturing town a northsouth road also ran through cambridge morrell and the couple of dozen barrels he personally commanded were in bivouac along it a few miles south of the place charging to the attack was a majors job not a onestar generals all at once morrell didnt care then lets hit them shall we within twenty minutes his barrels were rolling north the sun came up as they got moving infantrymen accompanied them some riding barrels some in trucks some in halftracked troop carriers that could cross ground where even a fourwheeldrive truck bogged down when the fighting started the foot soldiers would jump out and go to work the confederates had stalled just outside of cambridge morrell could see why it was a tough nut to crack it sat on a rise and dominated the ground on which featherstons men had to approach several butternut barrels burned but there was already fighting just outside the town the chatter of automatic weapons made morrell grind his teeth the confederates had plenty of firepower still he was hitting them in the flank when all their attention was focused ahead of them front he called to his gunner identified frenchy bergeron answered a quarter of a heartbeat slower than he should have maybe morrell was overcritical maybe michael pound had spoiled him for other gunners morrell yelled to the driver the barrel stopped the gun slewed a few degrees to the left it roared thats a hit morrell whooped with glee as the cs barrel caught fire a pair of crewmen got out and ran for the closest trees they didnt make it morrell picked another target front the one next to the upsidedown auto identified bergeron sang out the turret traversed again the cannon shouted the confederate barrel went up in flames morrell whooped again for two or three minutes the us machines had it all their own way their enemies didnt seem to realize where the devastating fire was coming from then the confederates rallied most of their barrels were new models with the wellsloped armor and the big gun when they turned toward the us barrels on their flank they suddenly became much harder to knock out and those threeinch guns began taking a toll on the barrels morrell led but in confronting morrells barrels the confederates left themselves vulnerable to the us defenders holed up in cambridge the force in the town didnt seem to have many barrels but did have plenty of antibarrel cannons those began picking off the cs barrels that turned to expose their thinner side armor to them a clear day had disadvantages as well as advantages confederate asskickers screamed down out of the sky to bomb the antibarrel cannons the dive bombers put several guns out of action in the space of a few minutes asskickers were hideously vulnerable to us fighters but no us fighters seemed to be in the neighborhood they were probably out chasing pittsburghbound transports morrell swore under this breath and then over it no matter how you tried the pieces didnt all fit together the way you wanted them to if everything worked the way you hoped it would youd win the war in a couple of weeks and youd hardly take any casualties if fortunately the fuckup fairy visited both sides considering all the confederates trapped in the pittsburgh pocket shed sprinkled more of her magic dust on jake featherston lately than she had on the us general staff and if that wasnt a miracle of rare device morrell had never seen one he ducked down into the turret to use his fancy wireless set close with them he called to his crews front to front they can hurt us from farther away than we can hurt them if we get in close it evens out what had horatio nelson said no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy that was it nelson had a better turn of phrase than irving morrell they both thought the same way though engine growling morrells barrel raced forward his driver had got the order along with the others a couple of bullets clanked off the machines steel hull bullets didnt matter confederate foot soldiers could shoot at the barrel till the cows came home a threeinch armorpiercing round unfortunately was another story it was a wild melee there on the snowcovered fields the two barrel forces got within pointblank range of each other whoever shot first won us barrel turrets had hydraulic traverse the confederates had to crank theirs around by hand it gave the greengray barrels a small edge on the ones painted butternut and the antibarrel fire from cambridge didnt stop after as wild a half hour as morrell had known the confederates sullenly drew back theyd lost fifteen or twenty barrels and taken out about half as many us machines we smashed em sir bergeron exclaimed maybe morrell said i hope so but maybe theyre just waiting till reinforcements come forward if they are weve got some problems he smiled that was putting it mildly he didnt know where he would find reinforcements the confederates had stretched him about as thin as theyd stretched themselves if what he had here and what was in cambridge couldnt stop featherstons men they might link up with their trapped comrades after all that wouldnt be good not even slightly he drew back to the outskirts of the town he had more cover for his remaining barrels there the confederates had got themselves mired in a big housetohouse fight in pittsburgh if they tried coming this way again he aimed to give them a smaller one in cambridge time crawled by the confederates didnt return to the attack maybe they couldnt scrape together any more reinforcements after all morrell hoped not theyd already put in a stronger attack from the west than hed expected they were bastardsno doubt about that but they were formidable bastardsno doubt about that either after the confederates left him alone for a couple of hours he sent foot soldiers down the westfacing slope to reoccupy the open ground where his force and theirs had clashed when another hour went by with everything still quiet he sent three or four barrels down there too they took up positions behind the burntout hulks of dead machines not like those assholes to stay quiet so long bergeron remarked no not usually morrell said i hope i know why theyre doing it but im not sure yet the longer the confederates held off the higher his hopes rose the officer in charge of the infantry down below showed initiative he ordered scouts west to see what the enemy was up to when he got on the wireless to morrell he sounded as if he could hardly believe what the men told him sir theyre pulling back he said looks like almost all of em are heading west as fast as they can go are they morrell breathed that was as far as his hopes had gone and maybe a couple of furlongs further yes sir the infantry officer said ive got four independent reports and they all tell me the same thing theyre leaving a screen behind to slow us down if we come after them but most of their force is going like nobodys business thank you major thank you very much morrell said out after he broke the connection he murmured son of a bitchit worked sir bergeron asked rosebud morrell could talk about the code name now we took what we could piece together in northern indiana and the northwestern corner of ohio and threw it east against the confederates from there and they dont have anything around those parts that can stop it they stripped themselves naked to mount this push toward pittsburgh the only prayer theyve got of holding the corridor up to lake erie is breaking off the attack and using their men from this force to defend instead but if they do that their guys inside pittsburgh are screwed the gunner saw the key point in a hurry they sure are morrell said this still wasnt the two big simultaneous attacks planners on both sides dreamt of it was about one and a half it might be enough maybe the confederates position in ohio would unravel even if they did go over to the defensive morrell aimed to make it unravel if he could he got on the allhands wireless circuit the enemy is retreating were going after him jefferson pinkard stood outside the house in snyder texas where his wife and two stepsons lived he kept staring northwest toward lubbock and toward the damnyankees not far outside the town he couldnt hear the artilleryit was too far away but it was close enough to let him imagine he could when he was feeling gloomy he felt plenty gloomy this morning edith came out with him in spite of the raw wind blowing down from the north hed never seen such a place for wind as the west texas prairie no matter what direction it came from it had plenty of room to get a good running start whats the matter she asked him wondering what the devil were gonna do if lubbock falls he answered if lubbock falls theres not a heck of a lot between the yankees and here just miles he didnt worry that much about snyder itself the locals could always evacuate to the east but camp determination camp determination was a different story they cant expect you to take all the niggers out of that place edith knew he worried about the camp not the town no dont reckon they can jeff let it go at that but the bathhouses that werent bathhouses the trucks with the sealed passenger compartments the mass gravesall those would be worth millions to damnyankee propaganda richmond wouldnt want such secrets getting out how could he do anything to stop that though you could drive the trucks away you could he supposed blow up the bathhouses that would make camp determination look like an ordinary concentration camp till the damnyankees found the mass graves how many tens how many hundreds of thousands of corpses lay in them pinkard didnt know though he could have figured it out from camp records he did know the graves were too big to hide even if he bulldozed the ground flat the bodies and bones remained below and somebody was bound to blab somebody always blabbed some secrets you couldnt keep and that was one of them records he said to himself records edith said the kind you listen to the kind you dance to jeff didnt answer those werent the records he had in mind just like any other big operation the camp generated lots of paperwork if the us army got close that paperwork would have to disappear too right this minute he didnt know where all of it was he did know it wasnt all in the same place and he couldnt get rid of all of it in a hurry and he realized he would have to fix that as soon as he could the things you never reckon youll have to worry about he thought but that was foolish hed fought not too far from here a generation before the yankees had pushed east from new mexico then why shouldnt they be able to do it again because we were going to lick em this time because jake featherston promised wed lick em this time jeff believed what jake featherston said hed believed him ever since first hearing him in birmingham not long after the end of the last war he didnt want to thinkhe hardly dared thinkthe president of the csa might be wrong he muttered again this time without words whether he wanted to or not he had to be ready to do what he could in case the confederates didnt come out so well in this particular part of the war putting it like that meant he didnt have to dwell on how things were going across the length and breadth of the north american continent when edith looked northwest she had other things on her mind jeff she said what is it will will the boys be all right the wars not as far away as i wish it was things arent bad now i dont reckon theyll turn bad real quick if the damnyankees get into lubbock or if they get past lubbock maybe you and the boys ought to go east for a bit his wife nodded ive got some stuff packed up in case we have to leave in a hurry good thats good babe jeff said should be easy enough to get away nothing around here is what youd call a great big target what about the camp edith asked nah he shook his head dont you worry none about that whats in the camp niggers who gives a darn about niggers to anyone else he would have said who gives a rats ass or something like that but he tried to watch his language around edith he answered his own question nobody does not on either side of the border she nodded again reassured well youre right about that lord knows theyre nothing but our misfortune jeff kissed her thats just what they are all right not even saul goldman and the other fancypants sloganmakers for the freedom party had ever put it any better he went on theyre not going to be such a big misfortune after a while though thats for sure he didnt talk in any detail about what camp determination did not even to edith not even if shed been married to a guard at camp dependable in louisiana before she said her i dos with him nobody who didnt wear the uniform needed to know the details he felt a certain lonely pride in the knowledge of what he did to serve the confederate states he was part of the war just as much as if he commanded a division of troops edith didnt ask for details either she just said all right and let it go at that when jeff got back to camp determination he summoned the camps chief engineer a dour assault band leaderthe party equivalent of a majornamed lyle schoonover and told him what he needed one of the reasons schoonover was dour and that he held a party rank and not one in the regular army was that hed lost his right leg below the knee he heard pinkard out nodded and said ill take care of it not just the bathhouses mind jeff said set something up where we can get rid of the records in a hurry too i said id take care of it schoonover sounded impatient i meant all of it you meant all of it jefferson pinkard tapped the three wreathed stars on the left side of his collar the engineer had only one star on each side of his collar and no wreath he gave jeff a dirty look but said what he had to say sir thats more like it jeff said im in charge here dammit for better and for worse now that things dont look so good weve got to ride it out the best way we know how schoonovers expression changed there was respect on his narrow features nowreluctant respect maybe but respect all the same jeff smiled down inside where it didnt show educated people often started out looking down their noses at him he hadnt finished high school before he wound up running prison camps he was a steelworker and a soldier of fortune but he had a good eye for what needed doing hed always had it and it let him get and stay ahead of a lot of people who thought they were more clever than he was youre not running from trouble anywaysir schoonover said troubles like a dog you run from it itll chase you and bite you in the ass pinkard said a startled grunt of laughter escaped schoonover jeff went on you go at it though sometimes you can make it run instead wish we could make the damnyankees run the assault band leader said that aint the point educated or not jeff knew enough to say isnt he used aint with malice aforethought the damnyankees are the armys trouble them finding out about what all were doin herethats our trouble thats what we can take care of on our own some of it anyhow schoonover said those graves wont disappear all by themselves well youre right i already figured that out myself too jeff said but since we cant do anything about em no point to flabbling about em either we got to take care of what we can take care of thats all lyle schoonover got to his feet he moved well as long as he didnt have to get anywhere in a tearing hurry fair enough sir thats a sensible attitude his salute didnt seem too grudging he left pinkards office if you didnt know hed been maimed in the great war his gait wouldnt give it away he hadnt been gone more than ten minutes before the telephone on jeffs desk jangled jeff picked it up pinkard here he wondered what had gone wrong now telephone calls while he was at work were rarely good news hello pinkard this is ferd koenig what can i do for you sir jeff tried to stay cool calls from the attorney general were never good news youve got the damnyankees a little closer to you than we thought you might koenig said yes sir thats a fact jeff began to suspect he knew why koenig was calling were doing what we can to get ready just in case are you the attorney general said like what with the conversation with the camp engineer fresh in his mind pinkard went into detailmaybe more detail than ferdinand koenig wanted to hear he finished nothin we can do about the graves sir except for them though we can have this place looking like an ordinary concentration camp mighty quick all right koenig said when he got done the attorney general sounded more that a little stunned yes jeff had told him more than he wanted to know serves you right jeff thought after a moment to gather himself koenig continued sounds like youve done everything you could you come up with anything else sir you just tell me and ill take care of it pinkard promised he didnt believe koenig could if hed thought the man back in richmond would have orders for him he would have kept his mouth shut ill do that by the attorney generals tone he didnt want to talk to anybody from camp determination for quite a while that suited jeff fine he didnt want to talk to ferd koenig either koenig added ill tell the president how thorough youve been out there hell be glad to have the good news thank you kindly sir jeff might not be an educated man but he could read between the lines he heard what koenig didnt say that jake featherston hadnt had much good news lately things arent going so good up in yankeeland are they they could be better by the attorney generals heavy sigh they could be a lot better koenig went on but with any luck at all the army will do its job up there by lubbock and everything youre doing will be like putting a storm cellar into a houseitll be nice to have but you wont really need it heres hoping sir pinkard said yeah heres hoping freedom ferdinand koenig hung up freedom jeff echoed but he was talking to a dead line he put the handset back in its cradle how much freedom could the csa enjoy if the usa came down and took it away the negroes in his domain their freedom they never entered his mind january in the north atlantic was about as bad as it got waves threw the josephus daniels this way and that the destroyer escort had a course she was supposed to follow keeping to itkeeping anywhere close to itwas a long way from easy even knowing exactly where the ship lay was a long way from easy sam carsten had only one thing going for him he didnt get seasick no matter what pat cooley was a good sailor but the exec looked a little green a lot of the men seemed even less happy with their own insides than they had when they whipped the british auxiliary cruiser a couple of months earlier cleaning crews with mops and buckets kept patrolling the heads and passageways the faint reek of vomit persisted all the same too many sailors were too sick to hold in what they ate more often than not they couldnt use the rail either to try would have asked to get washed overboard waves and spray made the yranging gear much less reliable than it would have been in better weather and calmer seas thad walters looked up from his screens and put the best face on things he could well sir the damn limeysll have just as much fun finding us as the other way round oh boy sam said in hollow tones theyll find newfoundland theyll find the maritimes theyll find trouble for the usafind it or make it thats the name of the game for them sir lieutenant cooley said i know but the name of the game for me is stopping them if i can sam answered sir with that gunship to our credit were still a long way ahead the exec answered no sam shook his head thats ancient history anything that happened yesterday is ancient history what we do today matters what were going to do tomorrow matters forget the old stuff weve still got a big job ahead of us the yranging officer and the exec exchanged glances sir im sorry you didnt go to annapolis cooley said to hell with me if you wouldnt have flag rank youve got more killer instinct than anybody else i know what i havent got is the brains to make an admiral sam said you know it i know it and the navy department sure as hell knows it im damn proud ive come as far as i have youve got plenty of brains sir youve got as many as any officer ive served under cooley said its just too bad you had to start late well thank you very much pat thats white of you carsten answered he knew the exec meant it whatever else the younger man was he was no brownnoser a wave crashed over the josephus daniels bow white water cascaded back no sailors manned the ships antiaircraft guns they would have gone overboard in a hurry if theyd tried no carrierbased aircraft could fly or hope to land in weather like this either so things evened out boy this is fun lieutenant jg walters said raising his eyes from the electronic display for a moment this time of year the weathers a worse enemy than the limeys and the frogs and the damn confederates all rolled together sam said when spring finally comes around well all get serious about the war again sub drivers are always serious cooley said thats a fact and theyve got it easy once they submergethats another fact sam agreed but god have mercy i wouldnt want to be a submersible skipper here and now not even a little bit they have to get into position on the surface remember theyre way too slow underwater to do it there ill tell you one thingi wouldnt like to be a sub captain trying to stay up with us here wouldnt be a whole lot of fun would it the exec allowed after a moments contemplation not hardly sam thought about the wave his ship had shrugged off he thought about the captain of a submarine standing on top of the conning tower when a wave like that washed over his boat he thought about that skipper either washed out to sea or if held in place by a line doing his best imitation of a drowned puppy he thought about lord only knew how many gallons of the north atlantic going down the hatch and into the submersible he was glad to be thinking about such things as the captain of a destroyer escort they couldnt happen to him they sure could to a sub driver somewhere out in the north atlantic such things probably were happening to several submarines from both sides right this minute sam hoped no enemy boats were within a hundred miles then he hoped no us boats were within a hundred miles either you were just as dead if your own side sank you as you were any other way and in weather like this mistakes were too simple things only got worse snow and sleet blew down out of the north coating the josephus daniels deck and lines and railings with ice sam ordered everyone who had to go up on deck to wear a lifeline ice made slipping even easier than it had been before after leaving the bridge sam went down to the wireless shack one of the yeomen there was telling the other a dirty story he broke off when his pal hissed both ratings sprang to attention as you were sam said you can finish that joke if you want to hrolfson dont mind me if i dont laugh real hardive heard it its all right sir petty officer hrolfson said not relaxing from his stiff brace itll keep what can we do for you sir whats the last weather forecast sam asked ours or theirs hrolfson said the usa and the uk both sent predictions to their ships the united states had broken the british weather code the limeys had likely broken the american code too it wasnt a tough cipher both sides had weather stations in greenland and newfoundland and labrador and baffin island to keep an eye on conditions as they developed sam had heard quiet deadly warfare went on up there in the northernmost reaches of the world whatever youve got he said now well sir the limeys figure the storms good for about another three days our guys figure itll blow out sooner than that hrolfson said sam grunted id bet on the englishmen he usually did when their reports disagreed with the ones from the navy department and the blow he was in now felt strong enough to last a long time weve got more stations up there than they do hrolfson said how come their forecasts are better than ours more experience i guess sam answered theyve been doing this a long time and we didnt get serious about it till the war the ship plunged down into a trough he steadied himself without even knowing hed done it what else have we got besides the weather reports well the bbc says england won a big battle against the germans in the north sea hrolfson told him the kaisers englishlanguage news station says churchills full of shit sam sighed that figures i guess nobody who wasnt there will really know whats whatand the people who were there wont be sure either i still couldnt tell you who won the battle of the three navies you were there sir said the other yeoman whose name was lopatinsky my uncle was there too he used to say the same thing he was in the dakota when the hits jammed her steering and she made that circle through the fleet son of agun sam said i was in the dakota too whats your uncles name kruk sir lopatinsky answered jerzy krukpeople call him jerry most of the time son of a bitch this time sam didnt sanitize it i knew him kind of a big gut eyes green like a cats ears that stuck out and a gotohell grin he fought one of the onepounders topside right thats him lopatinsky said his guts even bigger nowadays but hes still got that damn grin whats he doing these days carsten asked coal miner were a family of miners down in west virginia lopatinsky said i went down below myself for a couple of years but i figured theres got to be a better way to make a living thats how i got off the farm sam said take it all together and i expect i was right i feel the same way sir the yeoman said yeah we get shot at but so what at least we can shoot back the roof comes down or the mine floods what can you do about it not much heres something sir hrolfson had been listening intently to whatever was coming in through his earphones our wireless says weve sent the confederates in pittsburgh a messenger under flag of truce hes asking for their surrender that is good news sam said what are the confederates doing hrolfson listened for a little while longer before shrugging they dont say anything about that sir ha lopatinsky said that means the confederates told em to fold it till it was all corners carsten nodded that was his guess too if you listened to the wireless much these days you had to learn to sift through the crap to get at the few nuggets of truth the broadcasters were as likely as not trying to hide if they dont give up pretty soon well kill all of them hrolfson sounded as if he looked forward to it so did sam even so he said depends on how many of our guys they can take out before they go down if they hurt us bad enough then its not a bad bargain for them even if they do buy a plot think they can do that sir lopatinsky asked anxiously i hope not and thats the best answer i can give you sam tapped the two broad gold stripes on his sleeve he was proud hed got them he hadnt dreamt of coming so far when he scrambled up the hawse hole into officers country i know a little something about what we do on the water land fightingthe only thing i know is im glad im not in it its a nasty bloody business when we go into action here its usually over in a hurry anyhow yes sir lopatinsky said how long did we need to knock that limey out i didnt look at my watch but it wasnt long sam let it go at that if one of the karlskronas big shells had hit the josephus daniels the fight might have been over even quicker with the wrong side winning that bastard carried big guns even if she had no armor and only a freighters engines could she have sunk us if she hit us hrolfson asked proving ignorance could be bliss you bet your sweet ass she could sam blurted hrolfson and lopatinsky both stared at him he laughed selfconsciously you wanted a straight answer you got one you usually give em skipper thats good lopatinsky said hrolfson nodded they made sam almost as proud as knocking out the karlskrona had done xx on the womens side again in a way hipolito rodriguez had to be more careful there than he did on the other side of camp determination he knew in his gut that the black men were dangerous with the women he and the other men in gray could let down their guard they could regret it if they did too the women tried to make the men set over them let down their guard they dressed provocatively and acted provocative and it wasnt just an acta lot of them would deliver they wanted more food better food better quarters they wanted to stay out of the bathhouses they hadnt needed long to realize those were news as bad as it got the trucks by contrast nobody seemed to mind the mallates knew they would be leaving camp determination in them so didnt worry about climbing aboard that the trips had no destination they hadnt figured out hello mistuh sergeant suh the black woman who spoke to rodriguez was falling out of her blouse you takes care o me i takes care o you i takes care o you real good she had only her body to get what she wanted she used what she had striking a pose that would have got her arrested on any street corner in the csa rodriguez just kept walking hed found that worked best if you stopped to talk it over and argue with every colored woman who made advances youd never go anywhere and youd never get anything done all day sometimes nothing worked you lousy fairy the woman snarled at his back he ignored her if he turned around he could get her into whatever kind of trouble he wanted up to and including a trip to the bathhouse he kept walking anyhow with or without his help shed get hers soon enough any which way even if she latched on to some other guard as a protector shed get hers before long either hed get bored with her or hed find somebody else or hed be off duty when she got picked in a cleanout he might even be sorry afterwards she wouldnt be not for long another woman came up to him mistuh sergeant suh none of them ever called him troop leader they knew about army ranks the ranks freedom party guards used might have been in some foreign language for them since rodriguez felt the same way about those ranks he couldnt blame the womennot for that anyhow what you want he asked unlike most this one wasnt trying to act like a slut the novelty intrigued him because it did he answered her instead of pretending she wasnt there mistuh sergeant suh my little boy he powerful hungry he only five year old you got chilluns your ownself suh i got children rodriguez said im sorry but i cant do nothin children died fast in the camp their mothers often died with them from trying to share rations that werent enough for one the negro woman sighed you find him some extra food mistuh sergeant suh i do anything you want reckon you know what i mean i dont want nothin for me but he too little to die like dat he aint done nothin to nobody i dont want nothing like that i got a wife too rodriguez occasionally forgot about magdalenatemptation would get the better of him but he didnt forget more than occasionally you sound like you is a christian man the colored woman sounded surprised almost all mallates were protestants to rodriguez that meant they hardly counted as christians themselves he didnt want to argue with the woman the less he had to do with the prisoners the less he had to think of them as people the job went better when they were justthingsto him so all he said was i try and he started to go on with his rounds if you is a christian man suh an if you loves jesus christ what you doin here the woman asked he knew what he was doing reducing population as far as he was concerned that needed doing if it werent for the negroes the confederate states wouldnt have had so many troubles hed got his first taste of combat not against the usa but stamping out a negro socialist republic in georgia were blacks any more loyal to the stars and bars than they had been a generation earlier if they were would the country need camps now reckon i ax somebody else then the woman said with another sigh you seemed like you was a decent fella but i gots to do what i gots to do to keep my septimius alive another raggedyass pickaninny with a tendollar name rodriguez almost asked the woman why she couldnt have called him joe or fred or pete or something sensible in the end he held his tongue that little kid had nothing left but his fancy name why not let him make the most of it for whatever small span of days he had here when rodriguez walked on the woman didnt try to stop him he wondered what her chances of hooking up with some other guard were she wasnt anything special to look at with so many women throwing themselves at the men in gray it was a buyers market the freedom party guards could pick and choose ordinary girls got left behind off to the northwest something that might have been distant thunder muttered but it wasnt thunder not on a day that was fine and bright if chilly it was artillery rodriguez knew the soundhe knew it at much closer range than this just the other side of lubbock confederate and damnyankee gunners were doing their best to blow each other to hell and gone if the men in greengray broke through if they started down the highway toward snyder and toward camp determination that wouldnt be so good the guards had orders to get rid of as many negroes as they could and then to blow up the bathhouses and escape themselves more mutters in the distance would the prisoners know what those sounds meant some of the men would rodriguez was sure of that either theyd fought for the cs government or against itmaybe both any which way they would know what artillery was that could mean trouble rodriguez glanced at the young men with submachine guns who accompanied him they showed no signs of recognizing the faroff rumble that only proved theyd never seen combat why arent you in the real army rodriguez wondered the answer wasnt hard to figure outtheyd pulled strings this was bound to be a safer duty than facing soldiers in greengray the mallates here might be troublesome but they didnt shoot back and they definitely didnt have artillery an airplane buzzed over the camp it was a confederate hound dog rodriguez could make out the cs battle flags painted under the wings us warplanes had made appearances too if they wanted to bomb or strafe they could camp determination wasnt set up to defend against air attack nobody had ever thought it would have to so far the us aircraft had left the place alone maybe the fliers didnt know what this place was or maybe they knew and didnt care it wasnt as if people in the usa loved negroes either they complained about what the confederates were doing to them but that struck rodriguez as nothing but propaganda if the united states really cared about negroes they would have opened their borders to them they hadnt they werent about to either two women got into a catfight they screeched and scratched and wrestled and swore rodriguez and his comrades hurried toward the squabble the women were shrieking about somebody named adrian was he a guard rodriguez couldnt think of any guards named adrian but he might have missed somebody was he a black man in the other half of the prison or was he somebody theyd known back where they came from whoever he was he wasnt worth disturbing the peace for enough rodriguez yelled break it up the women ignored him they were too intent on maiming each other to care what a guard said you whore one of them shouted i aint no whore the second woman pulled the first ones hair which produced a shrill scream you the whore break it up rodriguez yelled again punishment cell for both of you life at camp determination was hard anyway it was harder in a punishment cell they didnt give prisoners room to stand up or sit down they had no stovesyou froze in the winter in the summer you baked but everybody in the camp baked in the summer you got starvation rations even skimpier and nastier than the cooks doled out to anybody else but the two women really meant this brawl they wouldnt stop no matter what a man in uniform said that was unusual rodriguez nodded to the junior guards with him take care of it he said they did using the butt ends of their submachine guns some of the models that went up to the front were of allmetal construction so cheap theyd fall to pieces if you dropped them on the sidewalk but the guards got bettermade weapons with real wooden stocks one reason they did was for times like this even if you didnt want to shoot somebody you sometimes had to knock sense into an empty head now the women shrieked on a different note back when they first got half the camp to themselves some of the guards were reluctant to clout them no more familiarity had bred contempt didnt you hear the troop leader yell for you to break it up one of the guards panted he tells you to do something you cut the crap and you do it you hear if rodriguez hadnt had three stripes on his sleeve he likely would have been nothing but a damn mexican to the guard of course even a damn mexican stood higher on the confederate ladder than a nigger unless you were a white texan from down near the rio grande and a troop leader stood infinitely higher than a prisoner in an extermination camp one of the women had an eye swollen shut the other one had blood running down the side of her head they pointed at each other at exactly the same time they both said she started it nobody cares who start it rodriguez said you dont stop when i say to stop i say twice you still dont stop now you pay he turned to the guards to the punishment cells they start this shit again you shoot you hear yes troop leader they chorused their timing almost as good as the womens rodriguez wondered if the negroes thought he was joking if they did it was the last mistake theyd ever make nobody in the confederate statesnobody who mattered anywaywould care whether a couple of colored women died a little sooner than they would have otherwise far away in the distance artillery rumbled again as long as it didnt get much closer everything was all right rodriguez hoped everything would go on being all right too willard sloan was not a nice man scipio listened to him screaming on the telephone you call that lettuce holy jesus only thing it was good for was wiping my ass what do i mean ill tell you what i mean it was limper than an old mans dick thats what and it looked like the bugs ate as much as you sold me nobody pulls that kind of shit on me twice you hear bang down went the receiver sloan might have been nice before the yankee bullet paralyzed him from the waist down or he might have been a son of a bitch from the start if hed ever heard the old saying about catching more flies with honey than with vinegar he didnt believe it maybe he just didnt like flies most restaurant managers worth their pay had some son of a bitch in them jerry dover sure did but the new man at the huntsmans lodge took it to extremes when something made him unhappy you heard about it loudly and profanely sloan operated on the theory that the squeaky wheel got the grease he didnt just squeakhe screeched he cussed scipio out when the black man made mistakes scipio did make somewith all the things that went on in a busy restaurant he couldnt help it but he didnt make many and willard sloan noticed well looks like dover knew what he was talking about he said one day you do know what the fuck youre doin i thanks you suh scipio said you do somethin you likes to do it good ha sloan said most peoplehe didnt say most niggers for which scipio gave him creditonly want to do enough to get by you show up every day and you work like a bastard i does my job bes way i knows how scipio said well thats what youre supposed to do the manager said doesnt happen as often as it ought to though i can hire a hundred people who could wait tables kinda halfassed you know what i mean good enough to get by but not really good one of you is worth all of them put together youre the kind of waiter a place like this is supposed to have youre the kind of waiter who makes the huntsmans lodge the kind of place it is thank you suh dont reckon i hear many finer compliments scipio meant it willard sloan didnt have to waste praise on him if sloan did it he meant it maybe hearing that praise made scipio rash for he went on how much it matter though when they kin ship me off to a camp whenever they please as soon as the words were gone he wished he had them back whining to a white man never did a negro any good willard sloan didnt answer for a while then he said when i got shot i was out in nomansland between our lines and the damnyankees a nigger soldier brought me back or maybe i wouldve died out there what happen to him afterwards scipio asked sloan sighed xerxes i dont know i just dont know i dont know where hes from i dont know his name i dont know if he got himself killed next day or next week or next month i cant tell you thats all i wasnt an officer leading colored troops or anythingtheir sector was next to ours thats all i dont even know if he was out there already or if he came out to get me i was in the hospital a hell of a long time after that i never had the chance to find out all right suh thus encouraged scipio felt bold enough to add if he still live now reckon he either in a camp or worried about goin in dont hardly seem fair sloan sighed again he spread his hands aint much i can do about it who pays attention to a guy in a wheelchair who runs a restaurant maybe i can help my own people some i hear tell dover did things are getting tougher all the time i dont know if itll still work i aim to try anyhow cant ask for no moren dat scipio said so a human being did lurk under that acidtongued exterior worth knowing maybe human being or not sloan didnt put up with slackness any more than jerry dover had when a cook came in late three times in two weeks he was gone the mexican who took his place spoke next to no english but showed up early every day he picked up the language in a hurry especially the obscenities that laced the conversation of the rest of the kitchen staff how many mexicans were in augusta these days how many mexicans were in towns and fields all over the confederacy doing what had been nigger work till blacks started getting cordoned off by barbed wire and disappearing into camps not so many as the negroes they replaced surely but enough to keep crops coming in wheels turning meals cooked and served hair cut they can get along without us the idea terrified scipio he hadnt thought the freedom party could strike at negroes in any really important way he hadnt thought the csa could do without the hard unglamorous labor colored men and women provided he hadnt thought so but maybe he was wrong one good thing about a busy shift it left him no time to brood he was always hopping taking orders bringing food out from the kitchen barking at the busboys trying to hear the gossip at his tables without letting the whites know he was listening everybody talked about pittsburgh the more that people knew the gloomier they sounded some of them sounded very gloomy indeed were going to lose that whole army a colonel home on leave told his banker friend were going to lose a big piece of ohio too its just a messa mess i tell you what can we do the banker asked hold on tight everywhere else and hope we can ride it out the officer answered dont know what else there is to do give up not while weve still got bullets in the gun you reckon the last peace was bad itd be a walk in the park next to what wed get from the damnyankees this time around scipio wished for the destruction of the freedom party with all his heart he had mixed feelings about the confederate states of america every man needed a country and the confederate states for better and often for worse were his hed had no trouble getting along before jake featherston took power things hadnt been perfect or even very good but they hadnt been so bad either hed known where he fit but negroes didnt fit anywhere in featherstons csa and enough whites agreed with featherston to bring him and his followers into places where they could do something about their ideas and so and so when scipio went home that night he passed the barbedwire perimeter around the terry no street lights inside kept him from tripping power had been off for a long time he stepped slowly and carefully falling would be bad not just because he was an old man and getting brittle but because he might tear his trousers that would be a real disaster he made it back to the apartment undamaged it was chilly in there no buildings in the terry had heat anymore the handful of people left here used makeshift woodburning stoves for cooking and heating one of these days maybe a fire would get loose scipio dreaded that but didnt know what he could do about it bathsheba stirred when he came to bed sorry he said didnt mean to bother you none s all right his wife answered sleepily sunday tomorrow we kin go to church all right scipio didnt argue he thought god had long since stopped listening to the confederacys negroes but bathsheba still believed going along was easier than quarreling he thought so anyway in the morning cassius said i aint goin i got to see some people about some business what kind of business scipio asked his son just looked at himlooked through him really cassius didnt answer some kind of resistance business then scipio sighed but didnt insist bathsheba tried to it didnt work cassius was going to go his own way seeing what things were like these days scipio had a harder time thinking him wrong than he would have a couple of years earlier the church was as rundown as everything else in the terry the preachers coat and trousers were shiny with age the reverend preached a careful sermon praying for peace and for justice and for an end to misery and oppression he made a point of not saying that the members of his congregation should rise up against oppression somebody was bound to be listening for the authorities if the government or the freedom partyassuming there was any difference between the twodidnt like what he said he would vanish off the face of the earth as if hed never been born he might have preached fire and brimstone he might have preached revolt and revolution it wouldnt have mattered he was just finishing his sermon when somebody at the back of the church exclaimed lord have mercy dey is out dere nobody wondered who they were with gasps of horror people sprang up from their rickety seats and hurried out of the church hoping to get away before it was too late god be with you brothers and sisters the preacher called after them he didnt try to get them to stay maybe he had his own escape route planned scipio and bathsheba and antoinette scurried away with the rest of the congregation like rats he thought any kind of hiding place would do now but there were no hiding places augusta policemen and freedom party stalwarts and guards waited out in the street they had smiles on their faces and rifles and submachine guns in their hands one of them shifted a wad of tobacco into his cheek so he could talk more clearly yall can come along with us quietlike or yall can get shot right here dont matter none to us whichll it be one young man only a little older than cassius ran for it a submachine gun spat fire the young man fell and writhed on the cracked pavement the stalwart whod cut him down ambled over and put a bullet through his head the negro groaned and lay still anybody else asked the cop with the chaw no one moved no one spoke cassius thank god cassius isnt here someone may get away scipio thought he glanced over at his wife she nodded when their eyes met she had to be thinking along with him the policeman spat a brown stream of tobacco juice in the dead mans direction all right he said get moving away the negroes went the congregation was only part of the cleanout some men tried to offer money to get away some women tried to offer themselves the white men only laughed at them out of the terry they went a lot of white augustans were worshiping and praying at this hour of the day maybe god listened to them he sure hadnt paid any attention to the colored preacher the whites who werent at church stared at the negroes herded along like cattle some just stared some jeered no one called out a word of protest confederate station was by eighth and walker right next to st patricks catholic church did god listen harder if you called on him in latin scipio wouldnt have bet on it the station wasnt far from the terry the captured negroes were lucky in that because he was sure they would have had to walk no matter how far it was and then all their luck ran out everything happened so fast neither willard sloan nor anyone else had the slightest chance to do anything in get in god damn you shouted the white men with guns they stuffed cars tighter than should have been humanly possible by the way the boxcar scipio and his family went into smelled it had hauled cattle the last time the whites packed it till no one could sit down then slammed the door shut that cut off almost all of the air scipio resigned himself to dying before he got wherever the train was going with a jerk and a lurch it began to roll dr leonard odoull sometimes thought he was trapped in one of the nastier suburbs of hell one bleeding mangled screaming man after another from the time he gulped coffee to wake up to the moment he lay down for a stolen bit of sleep some of the soldiers wore greengray others butternut hed almost stopped noticing which color uniform he had to cut away to get at the latest mutilation when will this end he groaned to granville mcdougald after amputating a shattered arm youre asking the wrong guy the medic answered only one who can tell you is the confederate co he should have quit three weeks ago odoull said mcdougald shrugged hes got orders to hold to as long as he can and hes got ammo for his guns featherston would probably send a people bomb after him if he did throw in the towel as soon as we smash him flat that frees up all of our men here to roll west and knock the confederates out of ohio so hes holding down a lot more men than hes still got left himself you spent all these years as a medic right odoull asked mcdougald nodded the doctor went on so how come you talk like you come from the general staff me granville mcdougald laughed im just picking up stuff i hear from the wounded weve got enough of em well god knows youre right about that odoull said the university of pittsburgh hospital held us wounded ranging in rank from private to brigadier generaland confederates ranging from private to full colonel it was always stuffed men lay on gurneys in the hallway sometimes on mattresses on the floor sometimeswhen things were at their worston blankets on the floor the confederates never had made it over the allegheny river they never had tried to break out of pittsburgh to the west either theyd waited till the relieving column could link up with thembut it never did now outside the pocket there were no confederate soldiers for miles and miles the men whod tried to relieve pittsburgh had turned west themselves to try to stem the us advance out of northwestern ohio and indiana one thing odoull said mcdougald raised an eyebrow odoull went on i bet the poor bastards stuck here dont think jake featherston is always right anymore that doesnt matter mcdougald said what matters is the people down in the csa when they figure out featherstons led em down the primrose path thats when things get interesting maybebut maybe not odoull said yeah some of them may hate featherston after things go wrong but wont they go on hating us even worse they really do you know hed listened to wounded men too and some of the captured confederates were alarmingly frank i dont care if they hate us i hate them too granville mcdougald was so matteroffact he might have been talking about the weather what i want em to remember is if they mess with us were going to pound the kapok out of em and they better get used to the idea oderint dum metuant odoull murmured mcdougald made a questioning noise half embarrassed odoull explained i did a lot of latin when i was an undergradin those days you had to when you went to college its helped with the medical terms i will say but the emperor caligula said that caligula the crazy one thats him he was nuttier than jake featherston to hell with me if he wasnt but it means let them hate as long as they fear three words mcdougald said admiringly boy that packs more into three words than anything this side of i love you there i was yakking about how i feel about the confederates and that old son of a bitch got it into three words he wasnt an old son of a bitch he was a young son of a bitch odoull said i think he was twentyseven when they murdered him well hes been dead long enough that he seems old mcdougald said odoull nodded he was right about that it was something over years now he didnt get the chance to cudgel his brains over exactly how many years it was because the pa system brayed major odoull sergeant mcdougald report at once to or three major odoull sergeant mcdougald report at no rest for the wicked mcdougald said i thought that was weary odoull said works both ways dont you think mcdougald was right about that too they hastily scrubbed in and gowned and masked then they found what they were dealing with a soldier whod stepped on a mine that was an even worse misfortune than it might have been because the confederates or possibly the devil had come up with a new model instead of just exploding and blowing off a mans foot or his leg it bounced up to waist height and then burst with the results they had in front of them the kid on the table was shrieking in spite of surely having had a morphine shot he held his hands in front of his crotch like a maiden surprised and wouldnt move them no matter what my nuts he moaned it got my nuts youre gonna be all right son odoull feared he was lying through his teeth he turned to mcdougald and spoke in a quick low voice get him under right doc in one swift practiced motion mcdougald put the ether cone over the soldiers face and turned the valve on the gas cylinder the wounded man choked on the pungent fumes but didnt try to yank off the mask the way a lot of people did his hands stayed right where they were till the ether got him and he went limp lets see how bad it is odoull said grimly now he could move those blooddripping hands when he did he wished he hadnt what he saw made him want to cover himself up the same way how bad mcdougald asked well he wont need to worry about getting a girl in trouble anymorethats for damn sure odoull answered ill see if i can put his dick back together well enough for him to piss through it and hes got some nasty belly wounds too remember we were talking about the geneva convention a while ago mcdougald said as odoull his mouth a tight line behind the mask got to work yeah he answered absently trimming mangled tissue as conservatively as he could what about it nobodyd thought of popping paula back when they were hammering it out mcdougald said otherwise itd be on the list for sure its filthy all right odoull agreed and you know whats even worse i bet you anything the engineer who came up with it got a bonus i wont touch that mcdougald said if you look at it the right wayor the wrong way dependingits almost the perfect weapon whod want to maybe trade his family jewels for a hundredyard advance im just glad they dont have many of those little toys here odoull said and weve got all their airstrips under our guns now so they wont be bringing in more always parachute drops mcdougald said helpfully but there werent many of those anymore pittsburgh had cost the csa a godawful lot of transports no more than a handful tried to make the trip these days us wright fighters ruled the skies above western pennsylvania outside the hospital the thunder of us guns went on around the clock odoull hardly noticed it he might have looked up in surprise if it stopped incoming rounds were growing scarcer that confederate army might have got into pittsburgh it didnt look as if it would get out how are you doing there mcdougald asked after a while oh hell live im not so sure hell think thats doing him a favor though odoull said i think hell have a penis that works even if he wont get much fun out of it i sure hope it worksotherwise its catheter time ouch mcdougald winced dont even want to think about that its a bitch odoull used the smallest needles and finest catgut for his sutures he couldnt remember the last time hed done such delicate work he wished he could have done more for the wounded soldier but the essential parts were gone at last the job was done mcdougald surveyed the site well i think you did about as much as anybody would have been able to he said yeah odoull gave back a somber nod i wish i could say more i wish i had a drink too dont blame you a bit why dont you once you get out of the or when i come off maybe i will odoull said dont want to do it nowodds are ill be operating again before long there is that mcdougald allowed ill tell you something thoughive known plenty of docs that wouldnt have stopped for a second let alone a minute some of the oldtimers in the last war the guys whod been in the army since hooboy he rolled his eyes yeah i ran into some of those fellows too odoull said this one surgeon named schnitzleri dont think he drew a sober breath all the time i knew him but put a wounded man in front of him and a scalpel in his hand and hed do as good a job as anybody youd ever want to meet he could operate in his sleep i think he did sometimes thats the kind i mean mcdougald said theres the drunk who goes and drinks till he passes out and then theres the other kind the guy who gets a buzz in the morning and stays buzzed all day long and as long as he is hes fine till his liver craps out on him anyway odoull said oh sure by the way mcdougald said that he took it for granted of course there are some of the first kind too part of the way i learned surgery was when one of the docs who should have been doing it got too toasted to see let alone operate if i didnt cut this soldier was ruined for sure if i did maybe he had a chance so i did and he made itand i thought son of a bitch i can do this shit i was hooked it grows on you all right odoull agreed what happened to the drunken doctor he kept at it whenever he was sober enough to work mcdougald answered after a while people said i was doing better work than he was i dont know about that he had the training after all and i was amateur city but i sure was doing more work than he was cause he got loaded more and more often they should have discharged the fool though a catholic odoull had more than a little new england puritan sternness in him granville mcdougald shook his head it was a war doc if he was only a quarter of what he should have been that was still a quarter of a surgeon more than they would have had if they canned him hell he may be in the army yet he may be in the or next door for all i know he probably killed patients he should have saved odoull said so have i mcdougald said he didnt ask if odoull had that was generous of him like any doctor odoull had buried some of his mistakes it came with being human the most important thing was trying not to make the same mistake twice hotel street in honolulu was a raucous drunken place twentyfour hours a day seven days a week sailors who had liberty got drunk and got laid caring about nothing but the moment george enos jr knew exactly how they felt he should havehe was one of them hed drunk enough to make the sidewalk seem to sway and twist under his feet like the townsends deck in a heavy sea but the pavement wasnt listinghe was where do we go now he asked fremont dalby hed pretty much given up thinking on his own if the gun chief could manage it george would follow along dalby made a production out of pondering hed taken plenty of antifreeze on board too well do we want to drink some more or do we want to screw he asked george frowned he didnt want to decide anything he wasnt sure he could decide anything fritz gustafson settled things by walking through the next open door they passed if it had been a brothel they would have done their best there but it was another gin mill the air smelled of cigarette smoke and spilled beer and vomit a record player was cranking out hawaiian music much too loud georges head started to ache and he wasnt even hung over yet that would come tomorrow morning and tomorrow morning might as well be ten years away he and his buddies from the townsend elbowed their way up to the bar a couple of the men they muscled by gave them sour stares but nobody threw a punch whatll you have gents the barkeep asked whiskey fremont dalby said george nodded so did fritz gustafson the man behind the bar poured the booze into three glasses added ice and waited till he saw money before sliding the drinks across the bar dalby gulped his so did gustafson george went a little slower by himself he would have stuck with beer he liked it better but when he was out with friends whiskey got him drunk faster on a fortyeighthour liberty speed mattered he wasnt sorry this had turned out to be a bar not a cathouse he always felt bad about being unfaithful to connie oh not while he was in the actit felt wonderful then it always did how could it not even with a bored chinese floozy who chewed gum while you pounded away but he never failed to feel guilty afterwards drink up george dalby said the night is young and you arehell i aint drunk enough to think youre beautiful george laughed he knocked back his drink then coughed two or three times the rotgut in the glass was smooth as sandpaper gustafson pounded him on the back thanks he wheezed sure the loader said even pretty well lit up he spent words as if he paid for them out of his own pocket another round dalby told the the bartender coming up the mans gray hair said hed been around a while so did his faint british accent the sandwich islands had belonged to the limeys before the usa took them away in a lot of the oldtimers had been here since the union jack flew alongside the flag of the sandwich islands which joined it to the stars and stripes in what had been the old kingdom of hawaiis doomed effort to keep everybody happy george would have loved to spend the rest of his life in the sandwich islands he didnt suppose many people who came here didnt want to stay after the winter hed just been through he would never look at january in boston the same way again he wouldnt look at the north atlantic in january the same way again either oh they had swells here but nothing hed seen came within miles of the nantucket sleighride and youd never have to worry about working on deck in the middle of an ice storm again dalby and gustafson poured down their drinks in nothing flat again they waited not too patiently for him to finish his he was about to go bottoms up when a brawl broke out behind him he never knew what started it an argument over a barmaid two sailors from the same ship who didnt like each other sailors from two ships that didnt like each other the roll of the dice at a corner table whatever got it going it was everywhere fifteen seconds later nobody tried to stop it everyone just joined in if that didnt prove there were a lot of drunks in the place nothing ever would have somebody swung at george a big burly machinists mate the haymaker would have knocked him into the middle of next week had it landed but it missed by at least a foot george threw what was left of his drink in the other sailors face the man roared and rubbed frantically at his eyes george hit him in the belly he folded up with an explosive oof oh shit the bartender was probably yelling it but george had to read his lips to understand it everybody in the joint was shouting at the top of his lungs the noise of things breaking didnt help somebody took a swing at fremont dalby the gun chief ducked so the punch caught him on top of the head that hurt the puncher much more than it hurt dalby one of the things you learned in a hurry was not to punch bony places by the way the sailor clutched his wounded hand hed probably broken a knuckle or two a heartbeat later he had other things to worry about dalby a barroom veteran didnt waste time fighting fair he kneed the sailor in the crotch the man howled like a wolf george stopped a punch with his forehead he saw stars it probably hurt the other guy worse than it hurt him but that didnt mean he enjoyed it plenty of sailors got into fights for the fun of it george didnt understand that watching a fight was fun getting punched and kicked and elbowed that wasnt what he called a good time he hit the other guy in the ribs hed aimed for the sailors solar plexus if hed hit it that would have taken the sob out of the brawl till his motor started working again but a shot to the ribs just pissed the sailor off he gave george a punch identical to the one hed just taken george grunted and swore that would leave a bruise and hed probably be sore whenever he breathed for the next week nobody in a barroom brawl played much defense george slugged the guy in front of him again then fritz gustafson hauled off and belted the sailor in the chops the man went down like a felled tree with a small smile gustafson displayed a set of brass knucks he would have made a hell of a boy scout he was prepared for anything halfway down the bar somebody who didnt have brass knuckles improvised he picked up a longlegged stool and swung it like a flail felling whoever he could reach maybe the rising and falling screech that burst from him was intended for a rebel yell maybe it just meant he was enjoying himself whatever it meant the screech abruptly cut off someone coldcocked the stool swinger from behind with a beer bottle the bar stool crashed to the floor so did the sailor bleeding from a scalp wound a fighting knife gleamed in the hand of a marine in a forestgreen uniform george didnt see the leatherneck stick anybody all the same he decided he was up way past his bedtime getting out of a brawl without getting a name for running away from brawls wasnt so easy though george didnt want to skip out on his buddies and so he stayed there and took some punches and dealt out a few more dalby and gustafson both seemed happy enough where they were then somebody yelled shore patrol that sent everybody surging toward the door george hoped the bartender had shouted out the warning to get the sailors to quit tearing his place to pieces no such luck the navy equivalent of mps waded into the fray nightsticks swinging george counted himself luckyhe didnt get hit in the head he did get hit in the ribs which made the punch hed taken there seem a love pat by comparison fremont dalby got a bloody stripe over one eye fritz gustafson knocked a shore patrolman ass over teakettle with his knuckleduster that could have won him a pounding to end all poundings but none of the shore patrolmans pals saw him do it some people had all the luck gustafsons luck didnt keep himand george and most of the rest of the people in the bar including the barkeepfrom getting grabbed and tossed into one of the paddy wagons that pulled up outside the sps had a brig set up a couple of blocks away it had probably been there for years but george hadnt known about it they found out he and dalby and gustafson had legitimate liberty papers and they found out the three men from the townsend hadnt started the fight when they discovered gustafsons persuader they took it away from him he looked aggrieved but he didnt say anything under the circumstances that was bound to be smart of course gustafson never had much to say another paddy wagon delivered them to their ship and two more men to the destroyer tied up next to her the officer of the deck eyed them as if hed found them in his apple well well he said what have we got here drunk and disorderly sir a shore patrolman answered tavern brawl on hotel street all right well take care of them the ood said and they did no one got very excited about it captains mast was something that happened now and again george had never come up in front of one before he might have been more worried if he were less hung over that made him think more about internal miseries than any the townsends skipper would inflict by their expressions dalby and gustafson also had a bad case of the morning afters lieutenant commander brian mcclintock glowered at each of them in turn anything to say for yourselves he growled no sir dalby said george and fritz gustafson shook their heads george wished he hadnt it only made the throbbing behind his eyes worse why the devil didnt you get out of there before the sps came now i have to notice this mcclintock sighed three days in the brig bread and water the brig was tiny and cramped through most of the first day george didnt want anything resembling food he drank lots of water it helped the hangover a little by the time he got out he was sick of piss and punk navy slang for the punishment rations making him sick of them so he didnt want to do it again was part of the point of the sentence but that didnt occur to him ordinary chow on the townsend was no better than it had to be it tasted like manna from heaven when they turned him loose greasy fried chicken lumpy mashed potatoes coffee like battery acid he made a pig of himself didnt figure you for a brawler enos somebody said yeah well george shrugged and let the wellgnawed bone from his drumstick fall to the plate in front of him he had a few bruises to show hed been in a fight and delivered the classic line with as much conviction as if no one had ever said it before you ought to see the other guy some british poet talked about ending the world with a whimper not a bang tom colleton figured that meant the limey had missed out on the great war it sure as hell proved hed never set foot in one of the two or three confederate pockets left in pittsburgh that tom didnt know how many positions his countrymen still held spoke volumes about how bad things were he was hungry he was cold he was lousyhe itched all the time the regiment he commanded might have had a companys worth of effectives which made it one of the stronger units in this pocket they were desperately low on ammo for their automatic weapons most of them carried captured us springfields instead they had no trouble scrounging cartridges for them only a couple of hundred yards from the edge of the pocket the allegheny rolled south towards its junction with the monongahela tom colleton felt a certain somber pride at being where he was his regiment had pushed as far east as any confederate outfit theyd done everything flesh and blood could do theyd done it and it hadnt been enough confederate commanders had already refused two us surrender demands tom didnt know who was in charge over the twitching dying cs positions in pittsburgh a light airplane had sneaked into the city and taken out general patton at the direct order of jake featherston patton might be useful somewhere else later on nobody could do much about what was going on here the wind picked up snow started to swirl crouched in the ruins of what had been a secondhand book shop tom lit a cigarette he muttered something foul under his breath it was us tobacco and tasted like straw hed taken the pack from a dead yankee no way to get the good stuff from home not anymore us barrels rattled forward before long the damnyankees would take another shot at overrunning this pocket and they just might bring it off few confederate barrels were still in working order even fewer had fuel fighting enemy armor with grenades and featherston fizzes was a losing game give it up a us soldier shouted across the narrow strip of nomansland youre dead meat if you stick it out we play fair with prisoners tom knew some of his men had thrown down their rifles and saved their skins they had orders to hold out but blaming them for surrendering wasnt easy still what would happen ifno whenthe yankees didnt have to worry about the confederates in pittsburgh anymore how many us soldiers and barrels and guns and airplanes would that free up how much would cs forces elsewhere have to pay all those things mattered living mattered more to a lot of people tom was too hungry and weary to care anymore one way or the other and he thought like a soldier as long as he still had bullets in his rifle he wanted to shoot them at the damnyankees he wasnt a professional he hadnt gone to vmi or the citadel or one of the other schools that turned out the confederacys professional officer corps but hed made it through the great war and through more than a year and a half of this one he knew what he was doing he hadnt had any experience when they gave him a captains uniform in but hed come from a plantationowning family in those innocent days they didnt think he needed anything else he was innocent himself back then he was sure he would come home the yankees whipped in time for the cotton harvest innocence died fast on the roanoke front so did soldiers in both butternut and greengray the dashing war hed imagined turned into a brutal slog of trenches and barbed wire and machine guns and gas and always always the stench of death hed lived he hadnt even been badly hurt and hed liked spending the next twentyodd years as a civilian hed gone into this second war with his eyes open this time hed known from the start the yankees would be tough and everything went just the way jake featherston said it would tom was part of the lightning thrust that carried confederate troops all the way to lake erie no one could have imagined the operation would go so well and no one could have imagined having it go well could mean so little maybe my eyes werent so wide open after all tom thought unhappily he didnt know one single confederate who hadnt been sure the united states would fold up once they got cut in half but the usaagain proved tougher than the csa figured pittsburgh then taking pittsburgh would surely knock the damnyankees out of the fight and give the confederates the victory they deserved except they didnt take it and if they were getting what they deserved in that case god had a nastier sense of humor than even tom had imagined pittsburgh then and pittsburgh now pittsburgh now was cold and smoke and blood and fear pittsburgh now was that yankee yelling awright then you ast for it most of the time letting your enemy know you were going to hit him would be stupididiotic even if you already held all the aces though what difference did it make artillery and mortar fire came first dive bombers followed a few minutes later the us airplanes didnt scream in a dive like confederate mules they didnt have an impressive nickname like asskickers nobody ever called them anything but boeing s the damnyankees made war as romantically as a bunch of insurance salesmen but their uninteresting bombers did a fine job of blowing holes in the landscape where they needed them most barrels somebody yelled us barrels werent as good as their cs counterparts they had more of them than the confederates did though in this pocket of pittsburgh that was all too painfully true and after a while quantity took on a quality of its own the leading us barrel commander rode with his head and shoulders out of the cupola he was brave and smart he wanted to see more of what was going on than he could all buttoned up he didnt see tom draw a bead on him and fire two quick shots he crumpled as if made from paper when they both struck home tom had long since forgotten about his sidearm he carried a captured springfield himself in a battlefield full of artillery and machine guns even a rifle seemed pitifully inadequate tom worked the bolt and chambered a new round springfields didnt measure up to automatic tredegars either but they were good enough or more than good enough despite losing its commander the barrel still came on tom hadnt expected anything else the gunner would run the behemoth now but it wouldnt fight so well as it had with a full crew a machine next to it hit a mine and threw a track that barrel slewed sideways and stopped the five men inside stayed where they were they could still use the turret and the bow gun but they werent going forward anymore the barrels steel skin protected them from smallarms fire if a cannon started shooting at the crippled machine they were in trouble the confederates in the pittsburgh pocket were as short on guns and shells as they were on everything else though the yankees in there might make it there werent enough mines to stop the rest of the barrels either the us machines really were ugly compared to the sleek elegant confederate new models it wasnt a beauty contest though the damnyankees could do the job which was the only thing that mattered if they kept coming they would tear a hole in the cs line tom knew only too well what lay behind it not much he didnt know what anybody in the line could do about it some men were ready to give up their lives to try to stop them two soldiers ran out with featherston fizzes wicks alight a yankee foot soldier cut down one of the confederates before he got close enough to throw his as he fell the burning gasoline gave him his own pyre tom hoped he was already dead if he wasnt that was a hard way to go but the other soldier flung his fizz fire spread across a barrels turret and dripped down into the engine compartment paint and grease made barrels vulnerable to fire anyway when the engine started to burn too hatches popped open as the crew bailed out tom colleton wasnt the only man who fired at them one barrelman might have reached the shelter of a pile of bricks the rest lay dead but all that only put off the inevitable the yankees had the firepower and the confederates didnt the yankees threw reinforcements into the battle the confederates didnt have enough men to begin with fight as the men in filthy butternut would the pocket shrank tom stumbled back to the next line of trenches and foxholes if he hadnt fallen back the damnyankees would have flanked him out and killed him oh maybe he could have surrendered but maybe not too us soldiers treated prisoners all rightwhen they took them they didnt always sometimes they were too busy to be bothered then wouldbe pows ended up dead it wasnt anything the confederates didnt do just part of the game another weary unshaven confederate soldiera corporalcrouched in a hole a few feet from toms the noncom managed a smile aint this fun he said as a matter of fact tom said no reckon well win the war anyways the corporal asked i stopped worrying about it a while ago tom answered after a moments thought whatever happens in the rest of it i think itll happen without me he popped up and snapped off a shot at what might have been motion it stopped maybe hed cut down a damnyankee maybe hed fired at nothing freedom the corporal said thats what its all about aint it fighting so the confederate states can be what they want and do whatever they please i never thought about it much said tom who avoided jake featherstons slogan whenever he could all i know is i never liked the damnyankees they gassed my brother and they bombed my sister and i owe em plenty ive paid back a lot but i want to get some more mortar rounds started falling tom pulled in his head like a turtle and wished he had his own hard shell machinegun bullets snarled overhead yes this was going to be a big push here they come the corporal yelled freedom he firedonce twice three times tom fired too at the yankees coming from the front but more were slipping around the right flank he turned and got off a couple of quick shots at them then he had to slap a fresh clip into the springfield an automatic tredegar took a twentyround magazine not a fiveround box of course you could empty it faster too if he and the corporal didnt fall back again they were dead the men in greengray would surround them and hunt them down ill cover you tom said the corporal ran for a hole deeper in the pocket he made it then waved for tom to follow him up run like hell hunch over to make yourself a smaller target how many times had tom done it before this was once too often the bullet caught him in the back he spun and toppled his chin hit the snowy rubblestrewn ground his legs didnt want to work he reached for the springfield one more shot oh no you dont a yankee said he fired from no more than ten feet away and tom colleton didnt awan earlyfebruary sun shone on the snowy sootstreaked disaster that had been pittsburgh the last confederate pocket on the north side had surrendered or was supposed to have surrendered an hour earlier sergeant michael pound hadnt made it this far by being trusting he had a round of he in the barrels cannon if any of the men going into captivity felt like getting cute he would do his damnedest to make sure they couldnt lieutenant griffiths stood up in the cupola he had a much broader view of the devastation than pound did he said something in a language that wasnt english what was that sir pound asked the barrel commander laughed selfconsciously latin sergeant from tacitus the roman historian they make a desert and they call it peace oh pound weighed that he approved of the sentiment taken all in all but he was not the sort of man to resist discordant details its sure as hell a desert out there sir but we dont have peace not everywhere griffiths agreed but nobodys shooting at anybody in pittsburgh anymore after another moment of judicious consideration michael pound nodded well no sir nobodys shooting right here and if anybody in butternut tried shooting right here pound intended to shoot first here they come griffiths squeaked in excitement pound peered through the gunsight his reticulated window on the world while he was in the barrel the confederates were a sorrylooking lot out they came a long draggling column of them from the last few square blocks of pittsburgh theyd held their breath smoked in the chilly air none of them was smoking a cigarette though the us infantrymen guarding them had no doubt already relieved them of their tobacco lucky bastards pound thought without rancor the confederates were skinny and dirty and hairy theyd been living mostly on hope the past few weeks pound had heard of raids with the sole aim of stealing us rations if that wasnt desperation he didnt know what was when you were empty any food looked good a lot of the confederates looked miserably cold their issue greatcoats were thinner than us models some of the men were all lumpy and bumpy because theyd stuffed crumpled newspapers under the greatcoats for a little extra warmth others wore a variety of captured civilian coats on top of or instead of their greatcoats they didnt have good winter boots either those needed to be oversized to allow for extra padding they needed to be but the confederates werent there they are lieutenant griffiths said jake featherstons supermen they dont look so tough do they sir if they arent tough what have we been doing here since november pound asked griffiths didnt answer a newsreel crew cranked away filming the enemy soldiers trudge into captivity maybe the confederates would look like beaten men on the bijou screen in st paul well they were beaten mennow if michael pound knew the way propagandists minds worked the newsreels would make the confederates out to be weaklings and cowards if they were though how had they fought their way into pittsburgh in the first place the newsreels wouldnt talk about that and most people unless pound was wildly wrong would never think to ask i wonder where well go from here griffiths said wherever it is i dont think itll be as tough as this pound answered it had better not be or theres no way in hell ill live through it how many confederates were holed up in that pocket more than hed figured some of them helped wounded men along others carried stretchers how many unburied dead lay in the pocket good thing we fought through the winter griffiths said thinking along with him can you imagine what this battlefield would be like in august yes sir i can pound answered that probably wasnt what the barrel commander expected to hear but pound had gone through the great war the stench of those fields soaked into your clothes soaked into your lungs soaked into your skin you thought youd never be rid of it pound still sometimes smelled it in his nightmares so maybe he wasnt even now the young barrel commander sighed i sometimes forget youre on your second goround wish i could sir pound said was that strictly true a lot of what hed learned the last time around helped keep him alive here some of it helped keep lieutenant griffiths alive too whether griffiths knew it or not that wasnt the main thing on the gunners mind though those damned foot soldiers will plunder the bodies we wont get a crack at em and well have to pay through the nose for good tobacco and whatever else theyve got wont be much of that stuff left griffiths said they werent quite eating their boots when they gave up but they werent far from it either michael pound grunted more in annoyance than anything else the shavetail saw something hed missed it was supposed to be the other way around most of the time it wasmost of the time but not always well sir youre right pound said youre a strange man sergeant griffiths said me sir how come pound thought himself normal enough or as normal as anyone could be after close to thirty years in the army well for starters you just say well youre right griffiths answered most people would want to argue and fuss whats the point pound said genuinely puzzled you are right i said something silly and you called me on it you should have if i tried to tell you it wasnt silly id just make a bigger fool of myself clinging to a position that was bound to fall seemed as senseless to him as jake featherstons failure to pull his troops out of pittsburgh while he still had the chance being stubborn just cost you more in the long run at last the stream of confederates slowed up there were bound to be stragglers heading west and south hoping to link up with other units in butternut or simply to get away but for them though pennsylvania was clear of confederates and if half of what people said on the wireless was true confederate control in ohio was crumbling too hes not going to win not anymore pound said thinking aloud im sorry sergeant lieutenant griffiths said what was that jake featherston pound answered hes not going to win the war i dont see how he can now only question left is can he still get a draw nice to know youve got it all worked out griffiths said dryly takes a lot of the strain off philadelphia pound laughed good shot sir but i still think its true well i hope youre right the barrel commander said with this damn war though you never can tell theyve done some awfully surprising things and so have we now the move that pinched off pittsburgh was as pretty as youd ever want to see general morrell knows whats what pound said griffiths started to rise to that then caught himself no wait you were his personal gunner for a while how did that stop he got wounded sir michael pound answered remembering morrells weight on his back when he carried the armor commander general to cover after a confederate sniper hit him they didnt think i deserved that long a vacation and so now youre stuck with me griffiths said his voice still dry youve got a pretty good idea of what youre doing sir from michael pound that was highest praise by the barrel commanders quiet snort he realized as much pound went on i hope we get a vacation after this were way way overdue for rest and refit i know griffiths said i havent got any more say over that than you do though well go where they tell us to go and well do what they tell us to do anybody would think we were in the army or something pound said wonder why that is lieutenant griffiths grew intense here come their big shots pound peered through the gunsight a few days earlier he would have loved to put a couple of rounds of heor better yet shrapnelon that group of eight or ten confederate officers all the men had three stars on the collar tabs of their greatcoats all but two or three had those stars enclosed in wreaths which meant they were generals not colonels they all looked to be in their late thirties or early forties younger than most us officers of similar grade and they all looked as if theyd just watched a bulldozer run over their kitten they really didnt think this could happen to them pound said theyve been whipping us for a year and a half they figured it would go on forever too damn bad griffiths said one of the us soldiers guarding the highranking confederate officers carried an automatic tredegar rifle another a captured cs submachine gun pound wondered whether the colonels and generals in butternut appreciated the compliment he was inclined to doubt it they get off easy griffiths said they stay in a camp away from the fighting for the rest of the war and the us government pays their salary the rest of us still have to go on out here some of the cs officers looked as if they would rather be dead if they were smart though they wouldnt say anything about that to the men in greengray who herded them along the us soldiers might oblige them if we get a refit where do you suppose well go next pound asked lieutenant griffiths ducked down into the turret to favor him with a wry grin i said that before sergeant i thought youd have a better idea than i did not me not now pound shook his head general morrell would tell me what was up sometimes far as everybody else is concerned im just a damn noncom he spoke without heat cant imagine why that would be griffiths said and pound chuckled the young lieutenant went on well all i can tell you is well go wherever they need us most once we get our refitif we get our refit sounds about right pound pictured a map he pictured what was likely to happen over the next few weeks virginia or ohio he said whichever heats up fastest i guess i wouldnt bet against either one of them lieutenant griffiths said i hope its ohio to tell you the truth me toowe have a better chance of hurting them bad there i think pound said but wherever it is by god well get the job done
