other worlds than these stories of parallel worlds edited by john joseph adams go then there are other worlds than these jake chambers to roland deschain of gilead from the gunslinger by stephen king foreword when i read the chronicles of narnia as a child it didnt so much introduce me to the idea that there was another world as confirm my already grave suspicions on the subject even at the tender age of eight i wasas i suspect you were and are if youre reading this bookone of realitys natural critics oh i knew that the real world had its good points one must be charitable after all candy for example and cats and hot baths but by and large the material was just a bit thin the jokes werent funny the catering was uneven and the less said about ones fellow players the better i had a powerful urge to see what was on in the next theater over until i read the lion the witch and the wardrobeand alices adventures in wonderland and the phantom tollbooth and the wonderful wizard of oz and the chronicles of amberi thought i was the only one who felt that way of course this cant be all there is this ludicrous excuse for a universe can only be a rough draft a temporary substitute the amateur opening act before the main event which will be more magical more exciting more meaningful more ecologically sound and otherwise superior in every way this wasnt actually the point of any of those books of course that fact was lost on me then but it isnt now now i understand that the children in the narnia books went to another world in order to imbibe crucial life lessons at the paws of the liongod aslan then when they were deported back to england at the end of the book they could experience reality such as it was with a renewed appreciation and they could spread the word of jesuslan to the unenlightened that would have been the correct lesson to draw from the chronicles of narnia but if any child has ever read those books correctly i will eat my hat when he wrote them lewis unwittingly let loose a monster of an idea one even more powerful than the idea he was actually trying to put across the lesson you receive from the chronicles of narnia is that reality is not where its at my friend so get out by any point of egress you can find and get into somewhere better of course lewis didnt invent that idea its an old fantasy far older than narniafar older i suspect than christianity the idea that you can enter another world generally heaven or some heavenanalog without having to die first exists in any number of religions it is technically known as ascension or assumption or my personal favorite translation the virgin mary managed it as did elijah and for that matter bilbo and frodo baggins it was given new life in the twentieth century and a new spin pun intended by the socalled manyworlds interpretation of quantum theory which posits the idea that all possible universes are in fact real and the multiple possible outcomes of every event spawn multiple universes in which each of those outcomes is realized schr√∂dingers cat is dead in one and alive and purring in another this theory is actually taken seriously by quite a few noninsane physicists far more compelling would be a verymanyworlds hypothesis in which all universes exist both the possible and the impossible but unfortunately no one sane believes that not even an old traveler in the realms of gold like me fortunately there is a device entirely real which can take you into those other realities not permanently but for short ecstatic flights that are very much worth taking youre lucky enough to be holding one such device in your hands right now as aslan would say further up and further in introduction what if you could not only travel any location in the world but to any possible world that is the central conceit of this anthology or to be more precise it aims to collect the best stories that fall into one of two categories parallel worlds stories or portal fantasies a portal fantasy is a story in which a person from one world usually the real world is transported to some other world via some magical or unexplained means usually one full of impossibilities and generally much stranger than the one they come from a parallel worlds story is one in which a person from one world usually the real world is transported to some other world via some scientifictechnological means usually a parallel universealternate reality either just slightly different than the one they left or else vastly different with different physical laws but strictly scientifically plausible as you can see from the parallels in those two descriptions the portal fantasy and the parallel worlds story are essentially two sides of the same coin heads you get fantasy tails you get science fiction but in each the characters journey is essentially the same to explore and wonder at these strange other worldsor to do their damnedest to get back home when i first set out to assemble this anthology i had been thinking primarily of parallel worlds fiction until the above realization occurred to me once it did i knew that if i were to consider one side of the coin i had to also consider the other and at that point the entire anthology clicked into place accordingly it felt to me like the two types of story should be in dialogue with each other in the context of the anthology so i did not separate them in the table of contents instead both types of story are mixed together throughout the book it should also be noted that i shied away from including any stories that are primarily based on time travelas time travel stories are their own genre though of course time travel does in essence create parallel worlds the tropes of other worlds fiction have fired the imaginations of millions of readers over the years the portal fantasy has the earliest roots with prominent early examples including the wonderful wizard of oz alices adventures in wonderland and the chronicles of narnia the tradition has continued with modern day writers picking up the torch such as stephen king the dark tower philip pullman his dark materials and lev grossman the magicians although one might assume that parallel worlds stories are of a more recent vintage the hypothetical idea of multiple universes has actually been around since the late nineteenth century and indeed some early examples of parallel worlds fiction can be found in the works of science fictions most prominent early practitioner h g wells however it is fair to say that the majority of this type of story has been written after the manyworlds interpretation theory of quantum mechanics was first postulated and popularized in the late s for parallel worlds stories there are fewer obvious classics to reference but there are the gods themselves by isaac asimov the female man by joanna russ and the big time by fritz leiber with recent examples including the neanderthal parallax trilogy by robert j sawyer the mirage by matt ruff and alastair reynoldss absolution gap for more other worlds novellength works see the for further reading appendix located at the end of this anthology so lets take a trip through the looking glass or into the universe next door thirty different other worlds await you to visit the first simply turn the page moon six stephen baxter was born in liverpool england with a background in math and engineering he is the author of over fifty novels and over a hundred published short stories he has collaborated with sir arthur c clarke and is working on a new collaboration with sir terry pratchett among his awards are bsfa awards the philip k dick award and locus asimov and analog awards his latest novel is stone spring first of a new series bado was alone on the primeval beach of cape canaveral in his white lunarsurface pressure suit holding his box of moon rocks and sampling tools in his gloved hand he lifted up his gold sunvisor and looked around the sand was hard and flat a little way inland there was a row of scrub pines maybe ten feet tall there were no icbm launch complexes here there was no kennedy space center in fact no space programme evidently save for him he was stranded on this empty desolate beach as the light leaked out of the sky an unfamiliar moon was brightening bado glared at it moon six he said oh shit he took off his helmet and gloves he picked up his box of tools and began to walk inland his blue overshoes still stained dark grey from lunar dust left crisp moonwalk footprints in the damp sand of the beach bado drops down the last three feet of the ladder and lands on the foilcovered footpad a little grey dust splashes up around his feet slade is waiting with his camera okay turn around and give me a big smile atta boy you look great welcome to the moon bado cant see slades face behind his reflective golden sunvisor bado holds onto the ladder with his right hand and places his left boot on the moon then he steps off with his right foot and lets go of the lm and there he is standing on the moon the suit around him is a warm comforting bubble he hears the hum of pumps and fans in the plsshis backpack the portable life support systemand feels the soft breeze of oxygen across his face he takes a halting step forward the dust seems to crunch beneath his feet like a covering of snow there is a firm footing beneath a soft resilient layer a few inches thick his footprints are miraculously sharp as if hes placed his ridged overshoes in fine damp sand he takes a photograph of one particularly welldefined print it will persist here for millions of years he realises like the fossilised footprint of a dinosaur to be eroded away only by the slow rain of micrometeorites that echo of the titanic bombardments of the deep past he looks around the lm is standing in a broad shallow crater low hills shoulder above the close horizon there are craters everywhere ranging from several yards to a thumbnail width the low sunlight deepening their shadows they call the landing site taylor crater after that district of el lagoclose to the manned spacecraft center in houstonwhere he and fay have made their home this pond of frozen lava is a relatively smooth flat surface in a valley once flooded by molten rock their main objective for the flight is another crater a few hundred yards to the west that theyve named after slades home district of wildwood surveyor an unmanned robot probe set down in wildwood a few years before the astronauts are here to sample it this landing site is close to tycho the fresh bright crater in the moons southern highlands as a kid bado had sharp vision he was able to see tycho with his naked eyes a bright pinprick on that ashwhite surface with rays that spread right across the face of the full moon now he is here bado turns and bounces back towards the lm after a few miles he got to a small town he hid his lunar pressure suit in a ditch and dressed in his tubecovered cooling garment snuck into someones back yard he stole a pair of jeans and a shirt he found hanging on the line there he hated having to steal he didnt plan on having to do it again he found a small bar he walked straight in and asked after a job he knew he couldnt afford to hesitate to hang around figuring what kind of world hed finished up in he had no money at all but right now he was cleanshaven and presentable a few days of sleeping rough would leave him too dirty and stinking to be employable he got a job washing glasses and cleaning out the john that first night he slept on a park bench but bought himself breakfast and cleaned himself up in a gas station john after a week he had a little money saved he loaded his lunar gear into an old trunk and hitched to daytona beach a few miles up the coast they climb easily out of taylor their first moonwalk is a misshapen circle which will take them around several craters the craters are like drill holes the geologists say excavations into lunar history the first stop is the north rim of a hundredyardwide crater they call huckleberry finn it is about three hundred yards west of the lm bado puts down the tool carrier this is a handheld tray with an assortment of gear rock hammers sample bags core tubes he leans over and digs into the lunar surface with a shovel when he scrapes away the grey upper soil he finds a lighter grey just under the surface hey slade come look at this slade comes floating over how about that i think we found some ray material ray material here will be debris from the impact which formed tycho lunar geology has been shaped by the big meteorite impacts which pounded its surface in prehistory a main purpose of sending this mission so far south is to keep them away from the massive impact which created the mare imbrium in the northern hemisphere ray material unpolluted by imbrium debris will let them date the more recent tycho impact and here they have it right at the start of their first moonwalk slade flips up his gold visor so bado can see his face and grins at him how about that we is looking at a fullup mission here boy they finish up quickly and set off at a run to the next stop slade looks like a humanshaped beach ball his suit brilliant white bouncing over the beachlike surface of the moon he is whistling they are approaching the walls of wildwood crater bado is going slightly uphill and he can feel it the carrier loaded up with rocks is getting harder to carry too he has to hold it up to his chest to keep the rocks from bouncing out when he runs and so he is constantly fighting the stiffness of his pressure suit hey bado slade says he comes loping down the slope he points take a look bado has he realises reached the rim of wildwood crater he is standing on top of its dunelike eroded wall and there planted in the craters centre is the surveyor it is less than a hundred yards from him it is a squat threelegged frame like a brokenoff piece of a lm slade grins does that look neat we got it made bado bado claps his commanders shoulder outstanding man he knows that for slade getting to the surveyor bringing home a few pieces of it is the finish line for the mission bado looks back east the way they have come he can see the big shallow dip in the land that is taylor with the lm resting at its centre like a toy in the palm of some huge hand it is a glistening filmy construct of gold leaf and aluminium bristling with antennae docking targets and reaction control thruster assemblies two sets of footsteps come climbing up out of taylor towards them like footsteps on a beach after a tide bado tips back on his heels and looks at the sky the sky is black empty of stars his pupils are closed up by the dazzle of the sun and the reflection of the pale brown lunar surface but he can see the earth a fat crescent four times the size of a full moon and there crossing the zenith is a single brilliant unwinking star the orbiting apollo csm with al pond their command module pilot waiting to take them home there is a kind of shimmer like a heat haze and the star goes out just like that it vanishes from the sky directly over bados head he blinks and moves his head stiffly thinking he might have just lost the apollo in the glare but it is gone what then can it have moved into the shadow of the moon but a little thought knocks out that one the geometry of sun and moon and spacecraft is all wrong and anyhow what was that heat haze shimmer you dont get heat haze where theres no air he lowers his head hey slade you see that but slade isnt anywhere to be seen either the slope where hes been standing is smooth empty bado feels his heart hammer he lets go of the tool carrierit drifts down to the dust spilling rocksand he lopes forward come on slade where the hell are you slade is famous for gotchas he is planning a few that bado knows about and probably some he doesnt for later in the mission but it is hard to see how hes pulled this one off there is nowhere to hide damn it he gets to where he thinks slade was last standing there is no sign of slade and there arent even any footsteps he realises now the only marks under his feet are those made by his own boots leading off a few yards away to the north and they start out of nothing it seems like man friday steps in the crisp virgin moonsnow as if hes stepped out of nowhere onto the regolith when he looks back to the east he cant see the lm either slade this isnt funny damn it he starts to bound hastily back in the direction of the lm his clumsy steps send up parabolic sprays of dust over unmarked regolith he feels his breath getting shallow it isnt a good idea to panic he tells himself that maybe the lm is hidden behind some low ridge distances are deceptive here in this airless sharpness houston bado i got some kind of situation here there isnt a reply immediately he imagines his radio signal crawling across the lightseconds gulf to earth im out of contact with slade maybe hes fallen somewhere out of sight and i dont seem to be able to see the lm and and someones wiped over our footsteps while i wasnt looking nobody is replying he realises that stops him short dust falls over his feet on the surface of the moon nothing is moving he looks up at the crescent earth ah houston this is bado houston john come in capcom just silence static in his headset he starts moving to the east again breathing hard the sweat pooling at his neck he rented an apartment he got himself a better job in a radio store in the air force before joining nasa hed specialised in electronics hed been apprehensive that he might not be able to find his way around the gear here but he found it simplealmost crude compared to what hed been used to they had transistors here but they still used big chunky valves and paper capacitors it was like being back in the early s radios were popular but there were few tvs small black and white gadgets the reception lousy he began watching the tv news and reading the newspapers trying to figure out what kind of world hed been dropped in the weather forecasts were lousy and foreign news reports even on the tv were sent by wire like theyd been when he was a kid and were often a day or two out of date the vietnam war was unfolding but thered been none of the protests against the war here that hed seen back at home there were no live tv pictures no colour satellite images of soldiers in the mud and the rain napalming civilians nobody knew what was happening out there the reaction to the war was more like what he remembered of world war two there really was no space programme not just the manned stuff had gone there were no weather satellites communication satellites sputnik explorer and all the rest just hadnt happened the moon was just a light in the sky that nobody cared about like when he was a kid it was brighter though because of that big patch of highland where imbrium should have been on the other hand there were no icbms as far as he could tell his mouth is bonedry from the pure oxygen he is breathing hard he hears the hiss of water through the suits cooling system the pipes that curl around his limbs and chest there is a rational explanation for this there has to be like if hes got out of line of sight with the lm somehow hes invisible to the lms radio relay the lunar communications relay unit he is linked to that by vhf and then by sband to the earth yeah that has to be it as soon as he gets back in line of sight of the lm he can get in touch with home and maybe with slade but he cant figure how he could have gotten out of the lms line of sight in the first place and what about the vanished footsteps he tries not to think about it he just concentrates on loping forward back to the lm in a few minutes he is back in taylor crater there is no lm the regolith here is undisturbed bado bounces across the virgin surface scuffing it up can he be in the wrong place the lunar surface does have a tendency to look the same everywherehell no he can see he is right in the middle of taylor he recognises the shapes of the hills there cant be any doubt what then can slade have somehow gotten back to the lm taken off without him but how can bado not have seen him seen the boxy lm ascent stage lift up into the sky and besides the regolith would be marked by the ascent stages blast and he realises dimly there would of course be an abandoned descent platform here and bits of kit and their footsteps his thoughts are sluggish his realisation coming slowly symptoms of shock maybe the fact is that save for his own footfalls the regolith is as unmarked as if hes been dropped out of the sky and meanwhile nobody in houston is talking to him he is ashamed to find he is crying mumbling tears rolling down his face inside his helmet he starts to walk back west again following his own footstepsthe single line he made coming back to find the lmhe works his way out of taylor and back to the rim of wildwood hell he doesnt have any other place to go as he walks he keeps calling for slade for houston but there is only static he knows his signal cant reach earth anyway not without the lms big sband booster at wildwoods rim there is nothing but the footfalls he left earlier he looks down into wildwood and there sits the surveyor glistening like some aluminium toy unperturbed he finds his dropped carrier with the spilled tools and bagged rocks he bends sideways and scoops up the stuff loading it back into the carrier bado walks down into wildwood spraying lunar dust ahead of him he examines the surveyor its solar cell array is stuck out on a boom above him maybe ten feet over the regolith the craft bristles with fuel tanks batteries antennae and sensors he can see the crafts mechanical claw where it has scraped into the lunar regolith and he can see how the crafts white paint has turned tan maybe from exposure to the sunlight there are splashes of dust under the vernier rocket nozzles the surveyor is designed to land hard and the three pads have left a firm imprint in the surface he gets hold of a landing leg and shakes the surveyor okay he calls up im jiggling it its planted here there was a fear that the surveyor might tip over onto the astronauts when they try to work with it that evidently isnt going to happen bado takes a pair of cutting shears from his carrier gets hold of the surveyors tv camera and starts to chop through the cameras support struts and cables just a couple more tubes he says then that babys mine hell finish up his moonwalk he figures according to the timeline in the spiralbound checklist on his cuff hell keep on reporting his observations in case anyone is listening and then and then when he gets to the end of the walk hell figure out what to do next later there will be another boundary when his plsss consumables expire hell deal with those things when they come for now he is going to work the camera comes loose and he grips it in his gloves got it its ours he drops the camera in his carrier breathing hard his mouth is dry as sand hed give an awful lot for an icecool glass of water right here and now there is a shimmer like heat haze crossing between him and the surveyor just like before he tilts back and looks up there is old earth the fat crescent and a star bright and unwavering is crossing the black sky directly over his head it has to be the apollo csm he drops the carrier to the dirt and starts jumping up and down in great big lunar hops and he waves as if he is trying to attract a passing aircraft hey al al pond can you hear me even without the lm pond in the csm might be able to pick him up his mood changes to something resembling elation he doesnt know where the hell apollo has been but if it is back maybe soon so will be the lm and slade and everything that will suit bado right down to the lunar ground he is standing on hell be content to have it all back the way it had been the way it is supposed to be and figure out what has happened to him later al its me bado can you hear me can you there is something wrong that light isnt staying steady it is getting brighter and it is drifting off its straight line coming down over his head it isnt the csm in orbit it is some kind of boxy craft much smaller than a lm descending towards him gleaming in the sunlight he picks up his carrier and holds it close to his chest and he stays close to the surveyor as the craft approaches he feels an unreasoning fear his kidneys send him a stab of distress he stands still and lets go into the urine collection condom he feels shamed it is like wetting his pants the craft is just a box on four spindly landing legs it is coming down vertically standing on a central rocket he can see no light from the rocket of course but he can see how the downward blast is starting to kick up some dust it is going to land maybe fifty yards from the surveyor right in the middle of wildwood crater the whole thing is made of some silvery metal maybe aluminium it has a little control panel set at the front and there is someone at the controls it looks like a manan astronaut in facthis face hidden behind a goldtinted visor bado can see the blue of a nasa logo and a dustcoated stars and stripes painted on the side of the craft maybe fifty feet above the ground the rocket cuts out and the craft begins to drop the sprays of dust settle back neatly to the lunar soil now little vernier rockets stuck to the side of the open compartment cut in to slow the fall kicking up their own little sprays it is all happening in complete silence the craft hits the ground with a solid thump bado can see the pilot the astronaut flick a few switches and then he turns and jumps the couple of feet down off the little platform to the ground the astronaut comes giraffeloping across the sunlit surface towards bado he stops a few feet from bado and stands there slightly stooped forward balancing the weight of his plss his suit looks pretty much a standard emu an apollo extravehicular mobility unit there is the usual gleaming white oversuitthe thermal micrometeorite garmentwith the lower legs and overshoes scuffed and stained with tycho dust bado can see the plss oxygen and water inlets on the chest cover and penlight and utility pockets on arms and legs and there is old glory stitched to the left arm but bado doesnt recognise the name stitched over the breast williams there is no astronaut of that name in the corps back in houston bados headset crackles to life startling him i heard you when the lfu came over the horizon as soon as i got in line of sight i could hear you talking describing what you were doing and when i looked down there you are bado is astonished it is a womans voice this williams is a goddamn woman bado cant think of a thing to say he didnt find it hard to find himself a place in the community here to gather a fake id around himself computers were pretty primitive and there was little crosschecking of records maybe back home the development of computers had been forced by the apollo project he speculated he couldnt see any way he was going to get home he was stuck here but he sure as hell didnt want to spend his life tuning crummy sdesign radios he tinkered with the surveyor camera hed retrieved from the moon it was a much more lightweight design than anything available here as far as he could tell but the manufacturing techniques required werent much beyond what was available here he started to take camera components to electronic engineering companies he took apart his lunar suit in all this world there was nothing like the suits miniaturised telemetry system he was able to adapt it to be used to transmit ekg data from ambulances to hospital emergency rooms he sent samples of the betacloth outer coverall to a fibreglass company and showed them how the stuff could be used for fire hoses other samples went to military suppliers to help them put together better insulated blankets the scratchproof lens of the surveyor camera went to an optical company to manufacture better safety goggles and other gear the miniature highperformance motors driving the pumps and fans of his plss found a dozen applications he was careful to patent everything he developed from his lunar equipment pretty soon the money started rolling in maybe im dreaming this williams says dehydration or something uh i guess im pleased to meet you she has a tennessee accent he thinks bado shakes the hand he can feel it through his own stiff pressure glove i guess youre too solid for a ghost ditto she says besides ive never met a ghost yet who uses vhf frequencies he releases her hand i dont know how the hell you got here she says and i guess you dont understand this any better than i do thats for sure she dips her visored head what are you doing here anyway he holds up the carrier sampling the surveyor i took off its tv camera oh you couldnt get it though sure here it is she turns to the surveyor look over there the surveyor is whole again its tv camera firmly mounted to its struts but when he looks down at his carrier there is the tv camera hes cut away lying there decapitated wheres your lm she asks taylor crater where he describes the craters location oh okay were calling that one san jacinto ah no your lm isnt there i know i walked back the craters empty no it isnt she says but there is a trace of alarm in her voice thats where my lm is with my partner and the payload module payload module the hell with it she says lets go see she turns and starts to lope back to her flying craft rocking from side to side he stands there and watches her go after a few steps she stops and turns around you want a lift can you take two sure come on what choice do you have if youre stuck here without a lm her voice carries a streak of common sense that somehow comforts him side by side they bound over the moon they reach williamss flying machine it is just an aluminium box sitting squat on its four legs with vernier rocket nozzles stuck to the walls like clusters of berries the pilot has to climb in at the back and stand over the cover of the main rocket engine which is about the size of a car engine bado supposes big spherical propellant and oxidiser tanks are fixed to the floor there is an sband antenna and a vhf aerial there is some gear on the floor hammers and shovels and sample bags and cameras williams dumps this stuff out briskly onto the regolith williams hops up onto the platform and begins throwing switches her control panel contains a few instruments a crt a couple of handsets bado lugs his heavy tool carrier up onto the platform then he gets hold of a rail with both hands and jumps up what did you call this thing an lfu yeah lunar flying unit ive got vague memories says bado of a design like this it was never developed when the extended apollo missions were cancelled cancelled when did that happen when we were cut back to stop when we get to apollo uh huh she says dubiously she eyes the tool carrier you want to bring that thing sure its not too heavy is it no but what do you want it for bado looks at the battered dusty carrier with its meaningless load of rocks its all ive got okay lets get out of here she says briskly williams kicks in the main rocket dust billows silently up off the ground into bados face he can see frozen vapour puff out of the attitude nozzles in streams of shimmering crystals as if this is some unlikely steam engine a victorian engineers fantasy of lunar flight the basin of wildwood crater falls away the lift is a brief comforting surge williams whoops wheehoo what a ride huh pal she takes the lfu up to maybe sixty feet and slows the ascent she pitches the craft over and they begin sailing out of wildwood the principles of the strange craft are obvious enough to bado you stand on your rockets tail you keep yourself stable with the four peroxide reaction clusters the little vernier rockets spaced around the frame squirting them here and there when the thrust of the single big downwards rocket is at an angle to the vertical the lfu goes shooting forwards or sideways or backwards across the pitted surface williams shows him the hand controls they are just like the lms the attitude control moves in clicks every time williams turns the control the reaction rockets will bang and the lfu will tip over by a degree at a time the thrust control is a toggle switch when williams closes it the lift rockets roar to give her a deltavee of a foot per second these are neat little craft williams says they fly on residual descent stage propellants theyve a range of a few miles and you can do three sorties in each of them each we bring two rescue capability bado thinks he is starting to see a pattern to what has happened to him in a way the presence of the camera in his carrier is reassuring it means he isnt crazy there really have been two copies of the surveyor one of which hes sampled and one he hasnt maybe there is more than one goddamn moon moon one is the good old lantern in the sky that he and slade touched down on yesterday maybe slade is still back there with the lm but bado sure isnt somehow he stumbled onto moon two the place with the surveyor but no lm and then this williams showed up and evidently by that time he was on another moon moon three with its own copy of the surveyor and a different set of astronauts exploring with subtly different equipment as if travelling to one moon isnt enough he thinks about that strange heathaze shimmer maybe that has something to do with these weird transfers he cant discuss any of this with williams because she hasnt seen any of the changes not yet anyhow bado clings to the sides of the lfu and watches the surface of the moon scroll underneath him there are craters everywhere overlaid circles of all sizes some barely visible in a surface gardened by billions of years of micrometeorite impact the surface looks ghostly rendered in black and white too stark unmoving to be real he knew he was taking a risk but he took his lunar rocks to a couple of universities he got laughed out of court especially when he wouldnt explain how these charcoaldark rocks might have got from the moon to the earth maybe they got blasted off by a meteorite strike he said to an expert at cornell maybe they drifted in space until they landed here ive read about that the guy pushed his reading glasses further up his thin nose well thats possible he smiled no doubt youve been reading the same lurid speculation i have in the popular science press what if rocks get knocked back and forth between the planets perhaps there are indeed bits of the moon even mars to be turned up here on earth and since we know living things can survive in the interiors of rocksand since we know that some plants and bacteria can survive long periods of dormancyperhaps it is even possible for life to propagate itself across the trackless void in such a manner he picked up bados moon rock dubiously but in that case id expect to see some evidence of the entry of this rock into the atmosphere melting some glass and besides this rock is not volcanic mr bado everyone knows the moons major features were formed exclusively by vulcanism this cant possibly be a rock from the moon bado snatched back his rock thats colonel bado he said he marched out he gave up and went back to daytona beach the lfu slides over the rim of taylor crater or san jacinto bado can see scuffedup soil below him and the big huckleberry finn crater to his left where he and slade made their first stop at the centre of taylor stands a lm it glitters like some piece of giant jewellery the most colourful object on the lunar surface an astronaut bounces around in front of it like a white balloon heor sheis working at what looks like a surface experiment package whitepainted boxes and cylinders and masts laid out in a star formation and connected to a central nuclear generator by orange cables it looks like an alsep but it is evidently heavier more advanced but the lm isnt alone a second lm stands beside it squat and spidery bado can see that the ascent stage has been heavily reworked the pressurised cabin looks to be missing replaced by cargo pallets thats your payload module right yeah williams says the lunar payload module laboratory it got here on automatics before we left the cape this is a dual saturn launch mission bado weve got a stay time of four weeks again he has vague memories of proposals for such things dual launches wellequipped longstay jaunts on the surface but the funding squeezes since have long since put paid to all of that evidently wherever williams comes from the money is flowing a little more freely the lfu tips itself back to slow its forward velocity williams throttles back the main motor and the lfu starts to drop down bado glances at the numbers the crt display evolves smoothly through height and velocity readings bado guesses the lfu must have some simple radarbased altimeter now the lm and its misshapen partner are obscured by the dust williamss rocket is kicking up at fifty feet williams cuts the main engine bado feels the drop in the pit of his stomach and he watches the ground explode towards him resolving into unwelcome detail sharp boulders and zap pits and footprints highlighted by the low morning sun then vernier dust clouds billow up around the lfu bado feels a comforting surge of deceleration the lfu lands with a jar that bado feels in his knees for a couple of seconds the dust of their landing cloaks the lfu and then it begins to settle out around them coating the lfus surfaces his suit there is a heathaze shimmer oh shit williams is busily shutting down the lfu she turns to face him anonymous behind her visor there wasnt much astronomy going on at all in fact he found out when he looked it up in the libraries just a handful of big telescopes scattered around the world with a few crusty old guys following their obscure decadeslong projects and all the projects were to do with deep space the stars and beyond nobody was interested in the solar system certainly in nothing as mundane as the moon he looked up at moon six uneasily with its bright unscarred northwest quadrant if that imbrium meteorite hadnt hit three billion years agoor in where the hell was it now maybe that big mother was on its way right now quietly he pumped some of his money into funding a little research at the universities into earthneighbourhood asteroids he also siphoned money into trying to figure out what had happened to him how he had got here as the last dust settles bado looks towards the centre of taylor crater to where the twin lms stood he can make out a blocky shape there he feels a sharp surge of relief thank god maybe this transition hasnt been as severe as some of the others or maybe there hasnt been a transition at all but williamss lm has gone with its cargocarrying partner and so has the astronaut with his surface package but the crater isnt empty the vehicle that stands in its place has the same basic geometry as a lm bado thinks with a boxy descent stage standing on four legs and a fat ascent stage cabin on top but it is just fifteen feet tallcompared to a lms twenty feetand the cabin looks a lot smaller my god williams says she is just standing stock still staring at the little lander welcome to moon four bado whispers my god she repeats that over and over he faces her and flips up his gold visor so she can see his face listen to me youre not going crazy weve been through some kind oftransition i cant explain it he grins it makes him feel stronger to think there is someone else more scared more shocked than he is he takes her through his tentative theory of the multiple moons she turns to face the squat lander again i figured it had to be something like that he gapes at her you figured how the hell else could you have got here well what are we supposed to do now she checks the time on her big rolex watch bado how long will your plss hold out he feels embarrassed shocked or not shes cut to the chase a lot more smartly than hes been able to he glances at his own watch on the cuff next to his useless checklist a couple of hours what about you less probably come on she glides down from the platform of the lfu her blue boots kicking up a spray of dust where are we going over to that little lm of course where else its the only source of consumables i can see anywhere around here she begins loping towards the lander after a moment he picks up his carrier and follows her as they approach he gets a better look at the lander the ascent stage is a bulbous misshapen ball capped by a fat wide disk that looks like a docking device two dinnerplatesized omnidirectional antennae are stuck out on extensible arms from the descent stage the whole clumsylooking assemblage is swathed in some kind of green blanket maybe for thermal insulation a ladder leads from a round hatch in the front of the craft and down to the surface via a landing leg the ground there is scuffed with footprints its a hell of a small cabin she says has to be one man you think its american not from any america i know that ascent stage looks familiar it looks like an adapted soyuz orbital module you know the russian craft their apollo equivalent russian can you see any kind of docking tunnel on top of that thing he looks nope just that flat assemblage at the top the crew must have to spacewalk to cross from the command module what a design an astronaut comes loping around the side of the lander swaying from side to side kicking up dust when he catches sight of bado and williams he stops dead the stranger is carrying a flag on a pole the flag is stiffened with wire and it is clearly bright red with a gold hammerandsickle embroidered into it how about that williams whispers i guess we dont always get to win huh the strangerthe cosmonaut bado labels himtakes a couple of steps towards them he starts gesticulating waving his arms about making the flag flutter he wears a kind of hoop around his waist held away from his body with stiff wire i think hes trying to talk to us williams says itll be a miracle if we are on the same frequency maybe hes sband only to talk to earth no vhf look how stiff his movements are yeah i think his suit is semirigid must be hell to move around in whats with the hula hoop bado asks it will stop him falling over in case he trips dont you get it hes on his own here thats a oneman lander theres nobody around to help him if he gets into trouble the cosmonaut is getting agitated now he hoists up the flag and throws it at them javelinstyle it falls well short of bados feet then the cosmonaut turns and lopes towards his lander evidently looking for more tools or improvised weapons look at that bado says there are big funky hinges down the side of his backpack that must be the way into the suit williams lifts up her visor show him your face weve got to find some way to get through to this guy bado feels like laughing what for the light changes bado stands stock still shit not again williams says what another transition he looks around for the telltale heathaze flicker i dont think so williams says softly not this time a shadow slim and jetblack hundreds of feet long sweeps over the surface of taylor crater bado leans back and tips up his face the ship is like a huge artillery shell gleaming silver standing on its tail it glides over the lunar surface maybe fifty feet up and where its invisible rocket exhaust passes dust is churned up and sent gusting away in great flat sheets the ship moves gracefully if ponderously four heavy landing legs with big springload shock absorbers stick out from the base a circle of portals glows bright yellow around the nose a huge bullseye of red white and blue is painted on the side along with a registration number shit bado says that thing must be a hundred feet tall four or five times as tall as his lost lm what do you think it weighs two three hundred tons direct ascent she says huh look at it its streamlined its built for landing on the moon in one piece ascending again and returning to earth but that was designed out years ago by von braun and the boys a ship like thats too heavy for chemical rockets so who said anything about chemical it has to be atomic some kind of fission pile in there superheating its propellant one hell of a specific impulse anyhow its that or antigravity the great silver fish hovers for a moment and then comes swooping down at the surface it flies without a quiver bado wonders how it is keeping its stability he cant see any verniers big internal flywheels maybe as the ship nears the surface dust comes rushing across the plain away from the big tail like a huge circular sandstorm there is a rattle almost like rain as heavy particles impact bados visor he holds his gloved hands up before his face and leans a little into the rocket wind the delicate little russian lander just topples over in the breeze and the bulbous ascent stage breaks off and rolls away in the mirror of his bedroom he studied his greying hair and spreading paunch oddly it had taken a while for him to miss his wife fay maybe because everything was so different not that he was sorry in a sense his job he figured was to survive hereto earn a living to keep himself saneand moping after the unattainable wouldnt help he was glad theyd had no kids though there was no point searching for fay in houston of course houston without the space programme was just an oil town with a big cattle pasture north of clear lake where the manned spacecraft center should have been el lago the taylor housing development had never been built he even drove out to atlantic city where hed first met fay a couple of decades ago he couldnt find her in the phone book she was probably living under some married name he figured he gave up he tried a few times to strike up relationships with other women here he found it hard to get close to anyone though he always felt he needed to guard what he was saying this wasnt his home after all so he lived pretty much alone it was bearable it even got easier as he got older oddly he missed walking on the moon more than anything else more than anything about the world hed lost he kept reliving those brief hours he remembered slade how he looked bouncing across the lunar sand a brilliant white balloon how happy hed seemed the silver ship touches down with a thump and those big legs flex the springs working like muscles a hatch opens in the ships nose maybe eighty feet from the ground and yellow light spills out a spacesuited figure appears and begins rolling a rope ladder down to the surface the figure waves to bado and williams calling them to the ship what do you think bado asks i think its british look at that bullseye logo i remember war movies about the battle of britainwherever the hell thats come from its some place very different from the worlds you and i grew up in you figure we should go over there he asks she spreads her hands what choice do we have we dont have a lm and we cant last out here much longer at least these guys look as if they know what theyre doing lets go see what boris thinks the cosmonaut lets williams walk up to him he is hauling at his ascent stage but bado can see the hull is cracked open like an aluminium egg and the cosmonauts actions are despairing williams points towards the silver ship where the figure in the airlock is still waving at them listlessly the cosmonaut lets himself be led to the ship close to the silver craft looks even bigger than before so tall that when bado stands at its base he cant see the nose williams goes up the ladder first using just her arms pulling her mass easily in the moons shallow gravity well the cosmonaut takes off his hoop dumps it on the ground and follows her bado comes last he moves more slowly than the others because he has his tool carrier clutched against his chest and it is awkward to juggle while climbing the rope ladder it takes forever to climb past the shining metal of the ships lower hull the metal here looks like lead actually shielding around an atomic pile he thinks of the energy it must take to haul this huge mass of metal around he cant help comparing it with his own lm which to save weight was shaved down to little more than a bubble of aluminium foil the hull shivers before his face heat haze he looks down the wreckage of the little russian lander and williamss lfu has gone the surface under the tail of this big ship looks unmarked lacking even the raying of the landing and the topography of the area is quite different now he is looking down over some kind of lumpy sundrenched mountain range and a wide fat rille snakes through the crust how about that williams says drily from above him her voice signal is degraded the amplifier on the lfu is no longer available to boost their vhf link were on moon five he says moon five it seems important to keep count yeah whatever bado this time the geologys changed maybe one of the big primordial impacts didnt happen leaving the whole lunar surface a different shape they reach the hatch bado lets the astronaut take his tool carrier and clambers in on his knees the astronaut closes the hatch and dogs it shut by turning a big heavy wheel he wears a british union flag on his sleeve and there is a name stitched to his breast taine the four of them stand around in the airlock in their competing pressure suit designs air hisses briefly an inner door opens and taine ushers them through with impatient gestures bado enters a long corridor with nozzles set in the ceiling the four of them stand under the nozzles water comes gushing down and runs over their suits williams opens up her gold sunvisor and faces williams showers she says what for to wash off radioactive crap from the exhaust she begins to brush water over her suit arms and legs bado has never seen anything like such a volume of water in lunar conditions before it falls slowly from the nozzles gathering into big shimmering drops in the air greyblack lunar dust swirls towards the plug holes beneath his feet but the dirt is ingrained into the fabric of his suit legs they will be stained grey forever when the water dies they are ushered through into a third larger chamber the walls here are curved and inset with round toughlooking portholes it looks as if this chamber reaches most of the way around the cylindrical craft there are people here dozens of them adults and children and old people dressed in simple cotton coveralls they sit in rows of crude metalframed couches facing outwards towards the portholes they stare fearfully at the newcomers the astronaut taine has opened up his faceplate it hinges outward like a little door bado pushes back his hood and reaches up to his fishbowl helmet he undogs it at the neck and his ears pop as the higher pressure of the cabin pushes air into his helmet he can smell the sharp woodsmoke tang of lunar dust and overlaid on that there is a smell of milky vomit baby sick the russian his own helmet removed makes a sound of disgust eta oozhasna williams pulls off her snoopy flight helmet she is maybe forty bado guessesaround bados own agewith a tough competent face and closecropped blond hair taine shoos the three of them along welcome to prometheus he says come there are some free seats further around here his accent is flat sounding vaguely bostonian definitely british bado thinks probably from the south of england youre the last we think we must get away the impact is no more than twelve hours hence bado lugging his tool carrier walks beside him what impact the meteorite of course taine sounds impatient thats why were having to evacuate the colonies and you alternates the massolite got most of them off of course but williams says massolite taine waves a hand a mass transporter of course it was a rushed job and it had some flaws but we knew we couldnt lift everybody home in time not all those thousands in the big colonies not before the strike the massolite was the best we can do you see they come to three empty couches these should do i think if youll sit down ill show you how to fit the seat belts and instruct you in the safety precautions but williams says what has this massolite got to do with she dries up and looks at bado he asks with moving between alternate worlds taine answers with irritation why nothing of course thats just a design flaw were working on it nonlinear quantum mechanical leakage you see i do wish youd sit down we have to depart bado shucks off his plss backpack and he tucks his helmet and his carrier under his seat taine helps them adjust their seat restraints until they fit around their pressure suits it is more difficult for the russian his suit is so stiff it is more like armour the russian looks young no more than thirty his hair sticks up in the air damp with sweat and he looks at them forlornly from his shell of a suit gdye tooalyet the portholes before them give them a good view of the lunar surface it is still moon five bado sees with its mountains and that sinuous black rille he looks around at their fellow passengers the adults are unremarkable some of them have run to fat but they have incongruously skinny legs and arms longterm adaptation to lunar gravity bado thinks but there are also some children here ranging from babies in their mothers arms up to young teenagers the children are extraordinary spindly attenuated children who look facially as young as seven or eight tower over their parents the passengers clutch at their seatbelts staring back at him bado hears a clang of hatches and a siren wails echoing from the metal walls the ship shudders smoothly and there is a gentle surge mnye nada idtee k vrachoo groans the russian and he clutches his belly as the years wore on he followed the news trying to figure out how things might be different back home the cold war went on year after year there were no icbms here but they had squadrons of bombers and nuke submarines and massive standing armies in europe and there were no spy satellites nobody had a damn clue what the russiansor the chinesewere up to a lot of shit came down that bado figured might have been avoided with satellite surveillance it slowly leaked out into the paper press usually months or years too late like the chinese nuking of tibet for instance and what the soviets did to afghanistan the soviet union remained a monolith blank threatening impenetrable everyone in the us seemed paranoid to bado generations of them with their bomb shelters and their iodine pills it was like being stuck in the late s and that damn war in indochina just dragged on almost forgotten back home sucking up lives and money like a bloody sponge around he felt a sharp tug of wistfulness right now he figured on the other side of that heat haze barrier someone would be taking the first steps on mars maybe it would be his old buddy slade or someone like john young bado might have made it himself bado missed the live sports on tv in free fall taine gives them spare cotton coveralls to wear which are comfortable but dont quite fit the name stitched to bados is leduc and on williamss hassell bado with relief peels off the three layers of his pressure suit the outer micrometeorite garment the pressure assembly and the inner cooling garment the other passengers look on curiously at bados cooling garment with its network of tubes bado tucks his discarded suit layers into a big net bag and sticks it behind his couch they are served food stodgy stew lukewarm and glued to the plate with gravy and then some kind of dessert like bread with currants stuck inside it spotted dick taine calls it there is a persistent whine of fans and pumps a subdued murmur of conversation and the noise of children crying once a fiveyearold all of six feet tall comes bouncing around the curving cabin in a spidery tangle of attenuated arms and legs pursued by a fat panting queasylooking parent taine comes floating down to them smiling captain richards would like to speak to you hes intrigued to have you on board weve picked up quite a few alternatecolonists but not many alternatepioneers like you would you come forward to the cockpit perhaps youd like to watch the show from there williams and bado exchange glances what show the impact of course come your german friend is welcome too of course taine adds dubiously the cosmonaut has his head stuck inside a sick bag i think hes better off where he is bado says you go williams says i want to try to sleep her face looks worn to bado her expression brittle as if she is struggling to keep control maybe the shock of the transitions is getting to her at last he thinks the cockpit is coneshaped wadded right in the nose of the craft taine leads bado in through a big oval door charts and mathematical tables have been stuck to the walls alongside pictures and photographs some of these show powerfullooking aircraft of designs unfamiliar to bado but others show what must be family members pet dogs tools and personal articles are secured to the walls with elastic straps three spacesuits flaccid and empty are fixed to the wall with loose ties they are of the type taine wore in the airlock thick and flexible with inlaid metal hoops and hinged helmets at the top three seats are positioned before instrument consoles right now the seats face forward towards the nose of the craft but bado can see they are hinged so they will tip up when the craft is landing vertically bado spots a big chunky periscope sticking out from the nose evidently there to provide a view out during a landing there are big picture windows set in the walls the windows frame slabs of jetblack starsprinkled sky a man is sitting in the central pilots chair he is wearing a leather flight jacket a peaked cap andbado cant believe ithe is smoking a pipe for gods sake the guy sticks out a hand mr bado im glad to meet you jim richards raf thats colonel bado bado shakes the hand us air force lately of nasa nasa national aeronautics and space administration richards nods american interesting not many of the alternates are american im sorry we didnt get a chance to see more of your ship looked a little cramped for the three of you it wasnt our ship it was a russian a oneman lander really richards murmurs not very interested take a seat he waves bado at one of the two seats beside him taine takes the other sipping tea through a straw richards asks have you ever seen a ship like this before colonel bado bado glances around the main controls are a conventional stickandrudder design adapted for spaceflight the supplementary controls are big clunky switches wheels and levers the fascia of the control panel is made of wood and in one place where a maintenance panel has been removed bado sees the soft glow of vacuum tubes no he says not outside the comic books richards and taine laugh it must take a hell of a launch system oh says richards we have good old beta to help us with that beta this lunar ship is called alpha taine says beta gives us a piggyback out of earths gravity we launch from woomera in south australia beta is a hypersonic athodyd richards winks at bado these doubledomes eh he means beta is an atomic ramjet bado boggles you launch an atomic rocket from the middle of australia how do you manage containment of the exhaust taine looks puzzled what containment you must tell me all about your spacecraft richards says bado haltingly starts to describe the apollo system richards listens politely enough but after a while bado can see his eyes drifting to his instruments and he begins to fiddle with his pipe knocking out the dottle into a big enclosed ashtray richards becomes aware of bado watching him oh you must forgive me colonel bado its just that one encounters so many alternates you do huh the massolite you know that damn quantummechanical leakage plessey just cant get the thing tuned correctly such a pity anyhow dont you worry the boffins on the ground will put you to rights im sure bado is deciding he doesnt like these british they are smug patronising icy he cant tell what they are thinking taine leans forward almost time jim aha richards gets hold of his joystick the main event he twists the stick and bado hears what sounds like the whir of flywheels deep in the guts of the ship stars slide past the windows a bit of showmanship colonel bado i want to line us up to give the passengers the best possible view and us of course after all this is a grandstand seat for the most dramatic astronomical event of the centurywhat the moon fat and grey and more than halffull slides into the frame of the windows the moonmoon five bado assumes it to belooks like a ball of glass its surface cracked and complex as if starred by buckshot tinged pale white the moons centre looms out at bado given threedimensional substance by the earthlights shading the moon looks different he tries to figure out why there close to the central meridian are the bright pinpricks of tycho to the south and copernicus in the north he makes out the familiar pattern of the seas of the eastern hemisphere serenitatis crisium tranquillitatisgrey lakes of frozen lava framed by brighter older lunar uplands he supposes there must be no apollo lm descent stage standing on this version of the sea of tranquillity the moon is mostly full but he can see lights in the remaining crescent of darkness they are the abandoned colonies of moon five something is still wrong though the western hemisphere doesnt look right he takes his anchor from copernicus there is mare procellarum to the western limb and to the north of that nothing but bright highlands hey he says where the hells mare imbrium richards looks at him puzzled faintly disapproving bado points up there in the northwest a big impact craterthe biggestflooded with lava eight hundred miles across richards frowns and taine touches bados arm all the alternate moons are different to some degree he says placating differences of detail mare imbrium is not a goddamn detail bado feels patronised again youre talking about my moon damn it but if the imbrium impact has never happened no wonder the surface of moon five looks different richards checks his wrist watch any second now he says if the bigbrains have got it right there is a burst of light in the moons northwest quadrant the surface in the region of the burst seems to shatter the bright old highland material melting and subsiding into a redglowing pool a fiery lake that covers perhaps an eighth of the moons face bado watches huge waves concentric wash out across that crimson circular wound even from this distance bado can see huge debris clouds streaking across the lunar surface obscuring and burying older features and laying down bright rays that plaster across the moons face the lights of the nightside colonies wink out one by one richards takes his pipe out of his mouth good god almighty he says thank heavens we got all our people off only just in time sir taine says bado nods oh i get it here this was the imbrium impact three billion years late richards and taine look at him curiously it turned out that to build a teleport devicea star trek beaming machineyou needed to know about quantum mechanics particularly the uncertainty principle according to one interpretation the uncertainty principle was fundamentally caused by there being an infinite number of parallel universes all lying close to each otheras bado pictured itlike the pages of a book the universes blurred together at the instant of an event and split off afterwards the uncertainty principle said you could never measure the position and velocity of any particle with absolute precision but to teleport that was exactly what you needed to do to make a record of an object transmit it and recreate the payload at the other end but there was a way to get around the uncertainty principle at least in theory the quantum properties of particles could become entangled fundamentally linked in their information content what those british must have done is take sets of entangled particles left one half on their moon as a transmitter and planted the other half on the earth there was a lot of technical stuff about the einsteinpodolskyrosen theorem which bado skipped over what it boiled down to was that if you used a description of your teleport passenger to jiggle the transmitter particles you could reconstruct the passenger at the other end exactly from the corresponding jiggles in the receiver set but there were problems if there were small nonlinearities in the quantummechanical operatorsand there couldnt be more than a billionbillionbillionth part according to bados researchersthose parallel worlds underlying the uncertainty principle could shortcircuit the moon five brits had tried to build a cheapanddirty teleport machine because of the huge distances involved that billionbillionbillionth nonlinearity had become significant and the damn thing had leaked and so they had built a parallelworld gateway by accident this might be the right explanation bado thought it fit with captain richardss vague hints about nonlinear quantum mechanics this new understanding didnt make any difference to his position though he was still stranded here the teleport devices his researchers had outlinedeven if theyd got the theory right from the fragments hed given themwere decades beyond the capabilities of the mundane world bado found himself in reentry is easy bado estimates the peak acceleration is no more than a couple of gs no worse than a mild rollercoaster even so many of the passengers looks distressed and those spindly lunarborn children cry weakly pinned to their seats like insects after the landing alphas big doors are flung open to reveal a flat barren desert bado and williams are among the first down the rope ladders lugging their pressure suits and bados tool carrier in big net bags bado can see a small town laid out with the air of a military barracks staff are coming out of the town on little trucks to meet them they are processed efficiently the crew of the prometheus gives details of where each passenger has been picked up and they are all assigned little labels and forms standing there in the baking sunlight of the desert the spindly lunar children are lowered to the ground and taken off in wheelchairs bado wonders what will happen to them stranded at the bottom of earths deep gravity well williams points look at that another prometheus there is a launch rail like a pencil line ruled across the sand diminishing to infinity at the horizon a silver dart clings to the rail with a slim bullet shape fixed to its back another beta and alpha bado can see protective rope barriers slung around the rail taine comes to greet bado and williams im afraid this is goodbye he says he sticks out a hand we want to get you people back as quickly as we can you alternates i mean what a frightful mess this is but the sooner youre out of it the better back where bado asks florida taine looks at them thats where you say you started from isnt it williams shrugs sure and then back to your own world he mimes stirring a pot of some noxious substance we dont want to muddy the time lines you see we dont know much about this alternating business we dont know what damage we might do of course the return procedures still experimental but hopefully well get it right well the best of luck look just make your way to the plane over there he points the plane is a ramjet bado sees immediately taine moves on to another bewilderedlooking knot of passengers the russian cosmonaut is standing at williamss side he is hauling his stiff pressure suit along the ground it scrapes on the sand like an insects discarded carapace out of the suit the russian looks thin young baffled quite ill he shakes bados hand do svidanya yeah so long to you too kid hope you get home safely a hell of a ride huh mnye nada k zoobnomoo vrachoo he clutches his jaw and grins ruefully schastleevava pootee zhilayoo oospyekhaf yeah whatever a british airman comes over and leads the russian away goddamn williams says we never found out his name he got a report in from his meteorite studies group yes it turned out there was a large object on its way it would be here in a few years time bado figured this had to be this universes edition of that big old imbrium rock arriving a little later than in the moon five world but this rock was heading for earth not the moon its path would take it right into the middle of the atlantic if the calculations were right but the margins of error were huge and and bado tried to raise public awareness his money and fame got him onto tv even such as it was but nobody here took what was going on in the sky very seriously anyhow and they soon started to think he was a little weird so he shut up he pushed his money into bases at the poles and at the bottom of the oceans places that mightnt be so badly affected somebody might survive meanwhile he paid for a little more research into that big rock in space and where and when exactly it was going to hit the ramjet takes ten hours to get to florida it is a military ship more advanced than anything flying in bados world it has the bullseye logo of the raf painted to its flank just behind the gaping mouth of its inlet as the ramjet rises bado glimpses huge atomic aircraft immense oceangoing ships networks of monorails this is a gleaming world an engineers dream bado has had enough wonders for the time being though and before the shining coast of australia has receded from sight hes fallen asleep they land at a small airstrip bado figures somewhere north of orlando a thin young englishman in spectacles is there to greet them he is wearing royal air force blue coveralls youre the alternates i guess so williams snaps and youre here to send us home right sorry for any inconvenience youve been put through he says smoothly if youll just follow me into the van the van turns out to be a battered dieselengined truck that looks as if it is world war two vintage williams and bado with their bulky gear have to crowd in the back with a mess of electronic equipment the truck windowless bumps along badly finished roads bado studies the equipment look at this stuff he says to williams more vacuum tubes williams shrugs theyve got further than we have or you here theyve built stuff weve only talked about yeah oddly hes forgotten that he and williams have come from different worlds the roads off the peninsula to merritt island are just farmers tracks and the last few miles are the most uncomfortable they arrive at merritt island in the late afternoon there is no kennedy space center bado gets out of the van he is on a long flat beach he figures he is a way south of where in his world the lunar ship launch pads will be built right here there will be the line of launch complexes called icbm row but he cant see any structures at all marsh land coated with scrub vegetation stretches down towards the strip of beach at the coast further inland towards the higher ground he can see stands of cabbage palm slash pine and oak the place is just scrub land undeveloped the tracks of the british truck are dug crisply into the sand there is no sign even of a road near here and out to the east over the atlantic he can see a big full moon rising its upper left quadrant the fresh imbrium scar still glows a dull crimson bado feels vaguely reassured that is still moon five things seem to have achieved a certain stability in the back of the truck the british technician powers up his equipment ready when you are he calls oh we think its best if you go back in your own clothes where possible he grins behind his spectacles dont want you muddying up the time lines williams says we know bado and williams shuck off their coveralls and pull on their pressure suits they help each other with the heavy layers and finish up facing each other their helmets under their arms bado holding his battered tool carrier with its baggies full of moon rocks you know bado says when i get back im going to have one hell of a lot of explaining to do yeah me too she looks at him i guess were not going to see each other again doesnt look like it bado puts down his carrier and helmet he embraces williams clumsily then on impulse bado lifts up his helmet and fits it over his head he pulls his gloves over his hands and snaps them onto his wrists completing his suit williams does the same bado picks up his tool carrier the brit waves reaches into his van and throws a switch there is a shimmer of heat haze williams has gone the truck has vanished bado looks around quickly there are no icbm launch complexes he is still standing on an empty desolate beach the moon is brightening as the light leaks out of the sky there is no ancient imbrium basin up there no recent impact scar either moon six bado says to himself oh shit evidently those british havent ironed out all the wrinkles in their experimental procedures after all he takes off his helmet breathes in the ozoneladen ocean air and begins to walk inland towards the rows of scrub pine on the day he drove out to merritt island it was morning and the sun was low and bright over the ocean off to the east and the sky was clear and blue blameless he pulled his old moon suit out of the car and hauled it on first the cooling garment then the pressure layer and finally the white micrometeorite protector and his blue lunar overshoes it didnt fit so well any more especially around the waistwell it had been fitted for him all of a quartercentury agoand it felt as heavy as hell even without the backpack and it had a lot of parts missing where hed dug out components and samples over the years but it was still stained grey below the knees with lunar dust and it still had the nasa logo his mission patch and his own name stitched to the outer garment he walked down to the beach the tide was receding and the hardpacked sand was damp his ridged soles left crisp sharp prints just like in the lunar crust he locked his helmet into place at his neck to stand here as close as he could get to ground zero wasnt such a dumb thing to do actually hed always remembered what that old professor at cornell had told him about the rocks bearing life being blasted from planet to planet by meteorite impacts maybe that would happen here somehow today might be the last day for this earth but maybe somehow some piece of him fused to the glass of his visor maybe would finish up on the moonmoon sixor mars or in the clouds of jupiter and start the whole thing over again he felt a sudden sharp stab of nostalgia for his own lost world hed had a good life here all things considered but this was a damn dull place and hed been here for twentyfive years already he was sure that back home that old vietnam war wouldnt have dragged on until now like it had here and funds would have got freed up for space at last enough to do it properly by god by now he was sure nasa would have bases on the moon hundreds of people in earth orbit a couple of outposts on mars plans to go on to the asteroids or jupiter hell he wished he could just look through the nonlinear curtains separating him from home just once he tipped up his face the sun was bright in his eyes so he pulled down his gold visor it was still scuffed from the dust kicked up by that british nuclear rocket he waited after a time a new light brighter even than rocket light came crawling down across the sky and touched the ocean a brief guide to other histories before becoming a fulltime writer paul mcauley worked

or plot the american bund sheaf shared most of our history but it had taken a different turn in the s when a bunch of generals and tycoons who didnt like where their country seemed to be heading under the new deal had assassinated franklin d roosevelt and installed a military government one of the generals turned out to be more ruthless than the rest after the coup hed seized power by a ruthless programme of murder and arrest made himself presidentforlife and established a tyranny that had lasted for more than thirty years towards the end of his rule hed become insane hed styled himself the dear leader ordered the construction of hundreds of grandiose monuments to himself put millions in prison or in work camps massacred millions more hed been about to go to war against europe when in scientists in our version of history had opened a turing gate onto his version of history the central intelligence group had sent through agents whod made contact with rebels and supplied them with weapons and intel as soon as civil war kicked off two divisions drove through the mirror quickly took control of the eastern seaboard captured the dear leader as he tried to flee to argentina and pushed over what turned out to be a regime hollowed by corruption and selfinterest when my platoon and the rest of the third brigade came through the mirror a year later deadenders who refused to accept that the war was over were waging a guerrilla campaign up and down the country they used car bombs and land mines improvised explosive devices from fertiliser fuel oil and scrap metal and detonated them when convoys drove past they fired mortars into our bases they shot at us with sniper rifles or rocketpropelled grenades from vantage points in buildings or took potshots at us and melted into panicked crowds as in any insurrection it was almost impossible to tell the good guys from the bad guys and that was why one of my men ended up killing three innocent civilians we had been ordered to set up a traffic control point on the west side ten blocks south of the green zone two apcs backed by a martindale light tank razorwire coiled across the street the men waving vehicles forward one by one doing stop and checks the traffic was bunched up and jumpy simmering in hundreddegree heat so humid you could have wrung water out of the air and we were all jumpy too at any moment someone could pop a trunk and find weapons or a primed car bomb or some screwedup munchkin could decide to take a shot at us just for the hell of it so when a taxi lurched forward after it was directed to an inspection point accelerating crazily scattering men bobby sturges behind the caliber machine gun on top of one of the apcs made a splitsecond decision and put two hundred rounds into the taxi in less than a minute punching holes in the hood exploding the tyres shattering the windshield shredding the driver and his two passengers a man and his seventyyearold mother sudden silence as the taxi rolled to a stop engine dead blood leaking from its door sills blood and human meat spattered all over the interior that evening tommy mcafee said if these fucking munchkins learned to drive this shit wouldnt happen munchkinsthats what we called the locals new york citythe american bund sheafs version of new york citywas oz the green zone in oz built up around a palace that before the revolution had been owned by one of the dear leaders sons was the emerald city like many of the men tommy mcafee had trouble accepting that the people on this side of the mirror were as real as the people back home couldnt believe that americans could have brought themselves so low he treated them with rough contempt made endless jokes about them he had a quick sharp wit knew how to time a punch line and cap someone elses joke with a zinger of his own was gaining a solid reputation as the platoons joker so when he made his quip he was surprised and upset when ernie wright told him to can it and the rest of the men either made murmurs of agreement or looked away they were all lounging around by the side of the entrance that curved down to the underground garage where the dear leaders eldest son had once stored his limousines sports cars and motorcycles where we now parked our apcs and jeeps we ate and slept in what had been servants quarters nearby and had set up a barbeque pit outside folding chairs a basketball hoop a tabletennis set liberated from somewhere in the palace tommy mcafee was sitting on a case of oil cans a rangy kid with rusty hair cropped short a tattoo of a boxing leprechaun on his right bicep looking at ernie wright and saying jesus youd think i was the one shot that fucking taxi to death ernie wright was the biggest man in the platoon but he could move quickly he stepped up to tommy mcafee and grabbed the front of his fatigues and pulled him to his feet in a single fluid motion and asked him their faces inches apart any more smart remarks about what went down i cant think of any wright set mcafee down and patted him on the shoulder but that wasnt the end of it later on that evening they got into a fistfight it was supposedly over who should have the last steak but it was really about mcafee trying to regain some face after wright had shamed him mcafee could box but wright was stronger and heavier and after some sparring he knocked mcafee on his ass with a solid punch mcafee got up and came back at wright and was knocked down again and this time he stayed down sprawled flat on his back on floodlit concrete under the basketball hoop breathing hard his nose and mouth bloody one eye swelling shut after a while he got up and went to the icechest and washed his face with a handful of ice chips i didnt think much of it at the time wed all been on edge after the shooting and the fistfight seemed to have dissipated much of the tension and besides i was more concerned about bobby sturges he was a gentle kid barely eighteen sick to his soul over what hed done when id told him that he wouldnt get any blame when i wrote up the incident that i accepted full responsibility because it had happened under my command hed given me a haunted look and said doesnt make it right lieutenant theyre americans like us americans shouldnt be killing americans i agree but some of them are trying to kill us which is why you did the right thing maybe it was the right thing to do bobby sturges said but that doesnt make it right i put in a request to pull him off the line for a few days rr but it was kicked back immediately there was sand in the gears of the mission we couldnt spare any men i took him off the cal but he had to ride out with us on patrol the next day and the day after that we manned checkpoints we escorted convoys of supplies to hospitals and aid stations we escorted a convoy of construction material to a power station that had been badly damaged during the warjackhammers were pounding all over the city cranes were swinging to and fro and scaffolding was springing up like kudzu as the munchkins patched and repaired and rebuilt as if tearing down one movie set and erecting another in its place i noticed that ernie wright did his best to keep behind tommy mcafee during foot patrols and guessed what he was thinking tommy mcafee might want to even things out after his beating we were all carrying guns and it wasnt unknown for a soldier with a beef to put a round or two into their rivals back in the middle of a firefight but tommy mcafee seemed to have forgotten the incident and although the deadenders were staging hitandrun raids in texas and parts of the midwest and washington dc was paralysed by a spate of car bombings new york was pretty quiet it was august hot and sunny i remember one day we were parked up near a playground and dave brahma and leroy moss started handing out candy bars and cans of soft drink to the kids two men in flak jackets and helmets ms slung over their shoulders up to their waists in a crowd of happy children another time todd cooper was checking ids at a control point and a man started shaking his hand and wouldnt let go this old man in a dusty suit and battered fedora pumping todd coopers hand and thanking him for being there tears rolling down his cheeks then a supply convoy running the expressway from brookhaven into new york city was hit by a massive improvised explosive device buried at the side of the highway five died instantly six were badly wounded that night my platoon took part in a raid on an apartment building in brooklyn according to an informer the deadenders who had planted the ied were storing weapons and explosives there it kicked off at two in the morning a psyops vehicle blasted out a message telling everyone to leave their doors open and wait with their hands on their heads for questioning two cherokee helicopters beat above the buildings flat roof lighting up the front with searchlights a squad of explosives specialists hit the basement first and then everyone else went in my platoon had been assigned the top two floors i was determined to do things by the book i told the men to knock first and break down doors only if they had to to keep their fingers off their triggers and treat everyone with respect even so it was a pretty brutal business wed storm in grab the man of the house and throw him down pacify the rest of the family and interrogate the man in front of them ask him if he owned a weapon or had any insurgent propaganda if he was involved in insurgent activity in any way then wed rip up the place pulling out drawers and tossing the contents ripping through closets looking for anything that could be used as a weapon the people were mostly passive but wed been told to expect trouble and we had no idea what we might find or if the situation might suddenly turn ugly despite my orders there was quite a bit of roughhousing and horseplay to relieve the tension shouts and screams the smash of glass and crockery a frat house party with half the participants armed to the teeth and the possibility of sudden death hanging in the air i was going from apartment to apartment trying to curb excesses when dave brahma came up and told me that something weird was going down smiling his gentle stoned smile saying you have to see this lieutenant itll blow your mind truly i followed him downstairs to a singleroom apartment with bookshelves along one wall posters above the couch books in piles on the floor it was very hot a standard lamp had been knocked over and threw huge shadows everywhere searchlights pried through blinds at the window the whippy flutter of the helicopters matched my racing heartbeat todd cooper and tommy mcafee stood behind a man kneeling on the bare boards with his wrists plasticuffed ernie wright stood in front of him studying an id card tell me what you think lieutenant tommy mcafee said and jerked up the prisoners head by his hair is he on the list take a real good look tommy mcafee said both he and todd cooper were lit up grinning his eyes the colour of his hair you dont see it show the lieutenant that id todd cooper said ernie wright handed the card to me he had a baffled dazed expression as if hed run fulltilt into an invisible wall you see it tommy mcafee said as i studied it you see it now the name under the black and white photo card was ernest c wright tommy mcafees grin widened when he saw my reaction i reckon we found ourselves ernies double bullshit ernie wright said hes nothing like me he doesnt even have the same date of birth oh yeah then how come he just told us he was born in the same dipshit town as you his parents have the same names as your parents he has your name and he has your eyes too tommy mcafee said jerking the prisoners head up again it was true the prisoners eyes were the same sharp blue as ernie wrights and his hair was the same dirty blond but otherwise he didnt look much like ernie wright at all he was shy about fifty pounds his face was leaner and paler and he had a mustache hes your doppelg√§nger dude dave brahma said your dark half i asked if theyd found any explosives or weapons there isnt anything to find ernie wright said aint this sweet mcafee said ernie is in love in love with his own self brahma asked the prisoner why he had all these books im a teaching assistant at brooklyn university the man said his voice was lighter than ernie wrights yeah what do you teach mcafee said american literature ernie wright shook his head if youre a teacher i guess youre a party member mcafee said grinning at me this guy is guilty of something lieutenant i can smell it there were fifty million party members the man said including everyone who worked in every university and high school it was the law all these books mcafee said i bet we could find something subversive what do you say lieutenant shall we take him in i thought that this was more about the beef tommy mcafee had with ernie wright than about uncovering a potential suspect i pulled my knife cut the plasticuffs that bound the mans wrists and looked straight into mcafees grin and asked him if he had a problem no one said anything the man knelt on the floor rubbing his wrists carefully not making eye contact with anyone move on i said everyone right now ernie wright was staring at the man then he shuddered all over like a man waking in the middle of a dream and marched straight out the fallen lamp wheeled his shadow over the bookcase and ceiling as mcafee cooper and brahma trooped after him i remembered that i was still holding the mans id card sorry i said and dropped the card in front of him and bolted from the apartment thoroughly spooked by the situation the men ragged ernie wright about his alleged double or doppelg√§nger on the ride back to emerald city most of it was goodnatured but he turtled up hunched in the back of the apc in a glowering silence that he broke only once when tommy mcafee told him that something must have gone badly wrong with his life seeing as hed ended up in the shit while his doppelg√§nger had a good job an education thats the point ernie wright said that guy he isnt anything like me so can your shit mcafee it aint right it isnt even funny after a silence dave brahma said in his dopers drawl know what they say about your doppelg√§nger that its just like you in every way but it doesnt have a soul and it knows that and it wants one real bad so if you ever meet it its like meeting a vampire hungry for like your exact blood type one look it can suck the soul right out of you turn you into what it was make itself into you theres something to that leroy moss said he was at the wheel of the apc inclining his head so that the men in the back could hear him over the roar of the engine everyone agrees that there can be no miraculous multiplication of souls if there are two people the same one in the real one in some other history there can be but the one soul and you cant divide a soul either so only one person can be in possession of it you ask me all the munchkins lack souls todd cooper said theyre all ghosts it was a common belief the munchkins were spooks unreal and because they were unreal it didnt matter what you did to them thats what doppelg√§nger means dave brahma said its german for ghost double they say its okay to fuck your doppelg√§nger todd cooper said really its like jacking off only you know double the fun yeah but the only problem is you have to waste him right afterward tommy mcafee said otherwise hell waste you most of the men laughed dave brahma said it must have been pretty intense ernie meeting your own ghost back there ernie wright didnt reply i turned around and told the men to knock it off but tommy mcafee had to have the last word the big question is which is the ghost and which is the man you think about that ernie a couple of days later i saw ernie wright sitting on one of the plastic chairs in the rr area barechested in shorts and sandals reading the pamphlet wed all been given before coming through the mirror a brief guide to other histories i asked him how he was doing and he said he was doing fine pretty interesting reading you have there he shrugged you read it carefully itll explain why that guy isnt really your double i know it ernie wright said i knew it when i saw he was three years younger than me as i understand it if he was born after the history of this sheaf split from the history of the real he has to be a completely different person i said because all of his experiences are different from yours id been reading a brief guide to other histories too after that night thats pretty much what it says here ernie wright said he was holding the pamphlet in one hand his forefinger marking his place you are what you do and whats done to you the sum of all your experiences him and me weve had such different lives we arent even like brothers thats how i understand it i said still he said i guess we had the same mother and father i didnt understand the significance of that remark then it was hardly my fault i had trouble remembering the names of all my men in my platoon let alone the details of their lives before theyd joined up or been drafted but even though i could hardly have been expected to remember that ernie wrights mother had died in childbirth when he was just two years old that hed been brought up by a father who was a bitter and violent drunk i still feel guilty about what happened i still have the irrational idea that i should have known about ernie wrights unhappy childhood that i should have done something to prevent what happened next instead of making some inane remark about being pleased to see that he was putting the encounter in perspective it was weird he said but weird shit happens through the mirror we just have to deal with it glad to hear it and after that ernie wright did seem to be dealing with it i overheard him having an earnest conversation with leroy moss who carried a copy of the bible in the breast pocket of his flak jacket about the nature of souls and their indivisibility he shrugged off tommy mcafees jibes and then two weeks later the platoon was given a day of rr and he disappeared i didnt find out what had happened until the next day when the military police took charge of ernest wright the man tommy mcafee had claimed to be ernie wrights doppelg√§nger it seemed that ernie had changed into civilian clothes hitched a ride out of emerald city in a contractors truck and turned up at ernests apartment later that evening drunk but lucid saying he wanted a quiet word offering cigarettes and a bottle of four roses a gift he said for the trouble a couple of weeks back ernest had deep misgivings but he also felt sorry for ernie who seemed sad and bewildered and lost and he was curious too so he invited ernie in and made coffee and they got to talking they shared the same parents but ernies had met several years before ernests had ernies mother had died giving birth to a stillborn baby when he was two his father had become a serious drunk and ernie had joined the army to get away from the son of a bitch who had died three years ago when his liver had finally given out on him i dont miss him ernie said not one bit ernests fatherthe american bunds version of ernies fatherhad died in a traffic accident when ernest was less than a year old a couple of years later his mother had remarried to another teacher in the high school where she worked thats how you got to be a college professor uh there were always books in the house they talked about the town where they had been born the little house where ernie had lived with his father until he joined the army ernest and his mother had moved out when he was three he didnt remember much about it i think there was a cherry tree in the front yard he said ernie smiled it was still there last time i looked same tree different lives two different trees really ernest said he told ernie how hed won a scholarship and come to new york to teach and study literature ernie told him a little bit about his socalled career in the army fighting in a sheaf wrecked by nuclear war and now policing the streets of new york i never really knew my mom he said and my dad was a mean drunk who beat me til i got big enough to beat him but you had a real family you have a college degree all those books if you knew what it was like growing up here under the thumb of the dear leader and his psychopathic sons and his secret police you might not think it was so great ernest said hed been tense and nervous all through their conversation growing more and more resentful about the intrusion look it was nice to talk to you strange but nice but i have to go to work tomorrow me too out on the streets hey i was just wondering ernie said with ponderous casualness about your mother is she still alive that was why hed come there of course it wasnt anything to do with ernest who was at best a brother hed never known no ernie wright was chasing the ghost of his longdead mother he looked for a long time at a snapshot ernest reluctantly gave him asked if she was still living in their home town maybe he could look her up some time he said and grew agitated after ernest said that he didnt think that this was a good idea ernie blustered said that he barely remembered his mother all he wanted was to see how she had turned out what was the harm sharp words were exchanged ernie started to paw through papers on the table ernest used as a desk drew his pistol when ernest asked him to stop ernest panicked threw coffee in ernies face and the pistol went off the shot barely missed ernest there was a struggle another shot that one hit ernie in the thigh nicking his femoral artery there was a lot of blood ernest went to the apartment next door which had a phone and called an ambulance but it took two hours to arrive because there were road blocks everywhere despite the best efforts of ernest and his neighbours ernie wright bled to death on ernest wrights old persian carpet ernest wright told me all this in a bleak interrogation room in camp xray the holding facility for suspects in bombings or shootings people caught trafficking weapons and explosives curfew violators and anyone else who had gotten into some kind of trouble with the occupying army hed been arrested on suspicion of murder by the local police but theyd handed him over to us after they had discovered that the dead man in his apartment was a soldier my commanding officer had advised me not to visit him but it had happened on my watch and i felt responsible i wanted to know what had happened so that i could figure out what i had done wrong also i had read the transcript of ernest wrights interrogations i had talked to the local police who had handled the case and i was convinced that he was innocent when i told him this he thanked me for my concern and for my offer to give supporting testimony should his case come to trial he told me the story while smoking several of the cigarettes i had brought and at the end lit a fresh one and said theres a writer who described time as a garden of forking paths whenever someone makes a decision it doesnt matter how small it splits time into two so theres this time here and now and another time where you decided not to help me i told him that i was familiar with the concept by this time i had read a brief guide to other histories several times from cover to cover trying to find something that would help me understand what had happened an infinite series of paths some divergent some convergent some running in parallel ernest wright said until a year ago i thought it was just a story a philosophical conceit but then your people made themselves known when the revolution started you sent troops through their turing gates and helped defeat the dear leader you told us that their agents had been visiting our history secretly before that helping set up the revolution you told us that you wanted to help us build a better america but what youre really doing is shaping us in your image we really do want to help you your path is only one of an infinite number of paths and no one path can claim to be better or more privileged than any other all are equal except we have the turing gates i said which gives your history the ability to interfere with other histories other americas but it doesnt give your history moral superiority you brought us freedom democracy fine were grateful for it but were not beholden we have the right to make from that freedom what we will whether you approve of it or not if were forced to become nothing more than a pale imitation of your version of america what kind of freedom is that i told him that he sounded a little like the deadenders and he shook his head he was thinner than i remembered but because his head had been shaved and he had lost his mustache it seemed to me that he looked a lot more like ernie wright now or my memory of ernie the deadenders believe that they can restore the bund if they can push you back through the mirror we want to restore democracy but on our own terms its like your friend he didnt really understand that we were two completely different people strangers my mother was not his mother ernest wright said and this is not your history that was in i was twentyfour back then so innocent so foolishly hopeful now just turned thirty im a published writer with five short stories and a novel under my belt ive already used parts of this story in the novel although in my version ernie wright doesnt end up bleeding out on the floor of ernest wrights apartment shot by his own pistol instead he finds out where ernest wrights parents are living and goes awol and hitches back to the american bunds version of his home town he spends a day watching ernest wrights mother trying and failing to get up the courage to talk to her finally realising that he has nothing to say to her because she isnt in any way like his mother that nothing in ernest wrights life could explain what had gone wrong in his own although this version worked well enough within the frame of the novel although it was true to ernie wrights need to understand and reach a reconciliation with his own history although it clarified real events and gave them a neat ending it was a contrivance i was never satisfied with it and felt guilty too at the way id trivialised ernest wright used him as a bit player a ghostly reflection whose only function was to give ernie wright the information he needed to make his pilgrimage this is as close to the truth as i can make it and theres no neat ending no bittersweet resolution ernest wright was released back to the local authorities after two months in camp xray he didnt make bail and was stabbed to death in a prison riot before his case came to trial todd cooper was killed in a firefight a couple of months later and dave brahma was badly wounded the same day bobby sturges injected his foot with a syrette of morphine and shot off his big toe a milliondollar wound that was his ticket back to the real i wrote it up as an accident the kid had never gotten over shooting up that car then leroy moss was killed when a rocketpropelled grenade hit his apc i was sitting next to him and spent two months in hospital while doctors worked to save my leg and shrapnel some of it bone fragments from leroy moss surfaced in different parts of my body some of it is still in there tommy mcafee reupped served another year and survived without a scratch after my novel was published he phoned me late one night he was drunk and wanted to talk about old times he told me that he had a bunch of stories i could help him make into a book as good as mine i listened to him ramble on for a while letting him vent whatever it was my novel had stirred up making the right kind of noises and when he finally hung up i realised that hed hit on something useful and started making notes for this story we are what we do and whats done to us if a brief guide to other histories was right about one thing its this and because what happens to us in war is more intense than ordinary life it marks us more deeply changes us more profoundly every soldier who comes back from war is haunted by the ghosts of the comrades who didnt make it the people he killed or saw killed by the things he did and the things he should have done and most of all by the innocent kid he once was before the contingencies and experiences of war took that innocence away i have summoned up my ghosts here and tried to lay them to rest but it seems to me now that all of us who passed through the mirror into different histories have become like ghosts lost in the infinite possibilities of our stories ceaselessly searching for an ideal we can never reach crystal halloway and the forgotten passage seanan mcguire was born and raised in northern california resulting in a love of rattlesnakes and an absolute terror of weather she shares a crumbling old farmhouse with a variety of cats far too many books and enough horror movies to be considered a problem seanan publishes about three books a year and is widely rumored not to actually sleep when bored seanan tends to wander into swamps and cornfields which has not yet managed to get her killed although not for lack of trying she also writes as mira grant and talks about horrible diseases at the dinner table thats the last of them crystal said we should be safe for now the dire bats headless body lay on the floor of the cave like an accusation blackish blood still seeping from its neck crystal looked at it and shuddered disgusted before giving it a sharp kick it rolled over the edge of the chasm and fell into darkness vanishing without a trace theyd have to find the head eventually but that could wait are you sure chester asked her companion peered anxiously down into the dark his nose twitching crystal knew that his earswhich would have been better suited to a jackrabbit than a boy as shed teased him so many times over the yearswould have been doing the same if they hadnt been tucked up under his hat hed done that to protect them from the shrieking of the dire bats she briefly considered snatching the hat from his head but set the thought aside nervous as he still was he wouldnt take the prank as innocently as it was meant im sure she slid her dagger back into its sheath before wiping the sweatmatted hair away from her forehead listen you can hear the wind again not just the wind there was also the gentle tapping of inhuman legs making contact with stone the pair turned to see a great black spider easily the size of a small car come walking down the cavern wall it reached the floor and continued walking toward them on its bristlehaired legs stopping just a few short feet away with an air of deep solemnity the spider bowed the land of otherways is in your debt once again young crystal said the spider in a deep voice that was softer than its appearance suggested we thank you dont thank me naamen it was my pleasure its always my pleasure crystal leaned forward to rest a hand on the spiders back digging her fingers into the coarse black hair that grew there this is my home just as much as its yours even so your service here is all the more heroic because it is freely offered you could return to your world of origin at any time leaving us to our fate and yet you choose time and again to stay and fight for our survival the spider straightened until the largest of its eyes were on a level with crystals own you are not the first to come from your world to otherways but you are far and away the bravest yeah brave me said crystal softly and pulled her hand away talk of others coming to otherways before her always made her uncomfortable although she could never put her finger on exactly why that was maybe it was the fact that her friends in otherways who were otherwise forthright in all ways would never describe the others as anything more than the ones who came before you they had no names they had no faces they had no stories to explain what could possibly have caused them to abandon a world as wonderful and magical as otherways they were just gone oh bush and bother crystal look chesterwho could always be counted on to panic over nothing and to show surprising bravery in the face of actual dangerpointed toward the sky not already not so soon a sick knot of dread formed in her stomach as she followed the direction of his finger there was nothing there but darkness she relaxed a little saying i dont understand what are we looking at the passage star is shining again chester let his hand fall looking at her sorrowfully he was always the first to see the passage stars light even as crystal herself was always the last you can go home now the dread returned clenched tighter than ever oh you can go if you wish said naamen almost as if he could see what she was feeling the choice to stay or go is always yours you know you would be welcome if you chose to remain the passage star will only burn for three hours said crystal slowly arguing a side she wasnt sure that she believed in after that after that it will go out but it will light again once a fortnight until a year has gone without someone passing from our world to yours you would still have the opportunity to change your mind crystal took a shaky breath forcing her first answer aside naamen always asked if she would stay and every time it got a little bit harder to tell him no how was she supposed to focus on school and chores and picking the right colleges to apply to when she was the champion of otherways the hero of the endless fields and the savior of the caverns of time the world shed been born in seemed more like a dream every time she came to the otherways and this worldthis strange beautiful terrible world with its talking spiders and its deadly scheming rosesseemed more like the reality naamen and chester looked at her hopefully theyd been her best friends and sworn companions since she was just a little girl chester was barely more than a bunny when they first met now she was almost a woman and chester was chester naamen had been slightly smaller in those days but no less ancient and no less wise just the thought of leaving them made her heart break a little hearts can heal she thought remembering something naamen once told her after they saved the princess of thorns from her mother the wicked rose queen crystal took another steadier breath and gave the answer shed been giving since her twelfth birthday when the great spider first asked if she would stay not yet my parents would miss me too much let me turn eighteen thats when they expect to lose me to college anyway they can lose me to otherways instead naamen shifted his pedipalps in the gesture she had come to recognize as his equivalent of a nod if that is your wish crystal halloway it will be honored we will count the hours until you return to us dont stay gone too long okay crystal asked chester i never do do i crystal leaned over and hugged him hard he was her best friend and her first love hed been her first kiss the year she turned fourteen and saved the meadows of mourning from the machinations of the timeless child i miss you too much when im gone please then take this to remember us by naamen reached out one long black leg a dreamcatcher dangled from his foot the strands woven from silk so fine that it seemed almost like light held captive in a circle of willow wood and twine hang it above your bed and only good dreams will come to visit you crystal knew the dreamcatcher would do nothing against her nightmares naamen had been giving her the same tokens since the first time he asked her to stay and they hadnt stopped a single bad dream still making the dreamcatchers seemed to soothe him in some way she couldnt quite understand and so she reached out and took it feeling the weight of it settle in her palm simultaneously featherlight and heavy as a stone naamen returned his foot to the cavern floor thank you my friend she said as she tucked the dreamcatcher into her pocket ill hang it in a place of honor see that you do naamen waved his pedipalps again this time in the motion that denoted concern i wish you would reconsider crystal i wish that you would stay crystal paused frowning naamen always asked her not to go hed never tried to change her mind before naamen whats wrong its just that you are growing up crystal and i worry for your safety the great spider stilled looking at her gravely the choice as always is yours oh my friend crystal moved almost without thinking stepping forward and wrapping her arms around the body of the spider just behind the smallest of his eyes naamen leaned into her embrace but only enough to show that he welcomed it not enough for his greater size to knock her off her feet as had happened so often in her younger days dont worry about me ill always make it back to you always naamen stroked her back with the tip of one foreleg faceted eyes focused on the endless black in front of him and said nothing there was nothing left that he could say crystal approached the welcome stone slowly alone as she always did the dread was still there in the pit of her stomach tangled with warring desires she wanted to go home to sleep in her own bed and hug her parents in the morning she wanted to stayalwaysto sleep in the cobwebdecked bedroom naamen had spun for her in the brambles that ringed the endless fields she wanted to graduate from high school she wanted to kiss chester again and again forever most of all she wanted to be there when the next child stumbled into the light of the passage star she never wanted to be one of the children naamen refused to name she wanted to stay but she couldnt the passage back to her own world only took a few seconds she stepped into the light of the passage starwhich always shone in a perfect circle right at the center of the welcome stoneblinked and was back in the world in which shed been born standing in the tiny room housing the magic telescope that let her travel into otherways she closed the telescope lens quickly before something unpleasant could find a way to follow her and turned to head down the narrow stone passageway that connected to the secret door at the back of her closet shed found the secret door and the room beyond by accident when she was six playing at seeking narnia now she couldnt imagine a world where she didnt have the route to otherways etched deep into her heart like an ache that never quite went away the passage was tighter than it used to be she had to stoop a little to keep her head from knocking against the ceiling and there were places where she had to turn and scoot along sideways in order to avoid getting stuck one more growth spurt and shed wind up staying in otherways because she couldnt make it back to her bedroom or shed wind up trapped in the world where she was born without ever once choosing to stay she couldnt keep going back and forth forever she knew that shed known for a long time somehow the feel of the walls pressing against her back and chest as she inched through the tighter spaces just made that fact more real soon she would have to decide the passage widened as it came to an end letting her into an antechamber almost as large as the telescope room she walked the last few steps to the door with her head high and placed her hand upon the doorknob my name is crystal halloway she said and i am coming back from the most incredible adventure the doorknob turned under her hand of its own accord and the door of her closet swung open crystal pushed her way through the hanging coatswhich were more windowdressing than anything else she would never dream of using her closet to store clothing when she might need to rush to otherways at a moments noticeand she was back in the familiar bedroom that had been hers practically since she was born moving more on autopilot than anything else she walked to the bed where she removed her dagger and shoved it under her pillow it was unlikely to be seen by prying parental eyes while it was there and she slept better knowing it was close at hand she yawned vastly suddenly aware of how tired she was and how hungry she was and how much her battle with the dire bats had left her in need of a shower the dreamcatcher stayed in the pocket of her jeans as she shucked off her clothes and put on her nightshirt which was so old and faded that she was probably the only one in the world who still saw mickey mouse in the shapeless blurs on the front the dreamcatcher stayed in the pocket of her jeans as she kicked them to one side and went to take her shower shampooing her hair three times to get the smell of dire bat blood out the dreamcatcher stayed in the pocket of her jeans as she went to the kitchen for a midnight snack as she checked the locks as she came back into the room and climbed into her bed the stuffed tarantula she slept with every nightbought for her when she was eight two years after she first entered otherwayswas waiting for her on her nightstand she picked it up and hugged it tightly good night little naamen she said with the gravity of a teenage girl who knows shes doing something silly but does it anyway because its what shes always done spin me good dreams tonight okay on some other night maybe that silly ritual phrase would have reminded her of the dreamcatcher maybe she would have pulled it out of her pocket dusted the lint from its strands and hung it above her bed where it belonged it had happened before but she was tired and sore from fighting the dire bats and sick at heart from the knowledge that soon she would have to choose one world over the other and all she wanted was to stop thinking for a little while the dreamcatcher stayed in the pocket of her jeans as she reached over to her bedside table and turned off the light crystal halloway savior of the otherways closed her eyes and slept there was no one single thing that woke her one moment crystal was asleep and the next she was awake staring into the darkness and trying to figure out why every nerve was screaming something was wrong as always when something she couldnt name was wrong crystals thoughts leapt to otherways the passage star was shiningit had to be shiningand something was stopping her from seeing its light properly but the star never rose this soon after a visit filled with an unnamed dread crystal tried to jump out of the bed and run for the closet the sheets that had been snarled so carelessly around her while she slept drew instantly tight becoming a net as effective as one of naamens webs crystals dread suddenly solidified into concrete fear she struggled harder and the sheets drew even tighter tying her down opening her mouth she prepared to scream and stopped herself before the sound could escape sheets didnt move on their own not in this world whatever was happening it was tied to the otherways if she screamed her parents would come and whatever was attacking her would take them too she was trapped alone in the dark and there was no one who could save her crystals mind raced trying to figure out which of her many enemies from otherways could be behind this invasion the rose queen the old man of the frozen north even the timeless child all of them were somewhere in otherways and all of them hated her but none of them had ever demonstrated that they had the ability to travel through the light of the passage star before oh good youre awake its easier when theyre awake the voice was sweet female and unfamiliar crystal turned toward it squinting to make out anything through the gloom dont try to move youll only hurt yourself the idea that she could hurt herself caused crystal to strain even harder against the sheets hurting herself implied movement and movement could imply breaking loose the woman sighed youre going to be a troublesome one arent you ah well it cant be helped you should never have been left so long whatever they were using to hide you worked very very well i knew there was one of you little runaways still in this town but i couldnt seem to find you before tonight the sweetvoiced woman flew languidly out of the shadows and hovered above crystal smiling serenely down at her whatever you did wrong my dear thank you i appreciate it the dreamcatcher thought crystal wildly thinking of it for the first time since returning to her room she took a short sharp breath and stopped struggling all her guesses as to her attackers identity had been wrong this wasnt one of the enemies she knew this was a stranger the woman in the air above her was roundfaced and ruddycheeked with soft brown curls and twinkling blue eyes she looked like she would have been perfectly at home baking cookies or reading stories in a preschoolexcept for her rapidly fluttering mayfly wings those and the large knife in her hand established her as clearly supernatural and just as clearly hostile who are you crystal hissed barely raising her voice above a whisper oh theres no need to whisper you can scream yourself hoarse and no one will hear you but i recommend against it laryngitis is no fun for anyone the woman continued to smile still if it will make you feel better go right ahead get out of my room snarled crystal the sheets were still tangled tight around her but that gave her an idea naamens webs worked by turning each captives strength against them letting the strong batter themselves into weakness the sheets had tightened every time she struggled glaring at the woman she forced herself to go limp now now dear has no one taught you how to greet a guest your manners are sorely lacking the sheets were no looser than they had been but they were getting no tighter i dont think manners apply to the uninvited manners apply to the uninvited most of all the woman dipped lower in the air reaching down to tap the fingers of her right hand against crystals cheek remember that if you can crystal took a breathand then she moved calling on everything shed learned from her games of catchandkeep with chester who was faster than anyone else shed ever known the sheets reacted to the motion but they were too slow if only by a fraction of a second missing her wrists as she yanked them free then her dagger was in her hand and she was slashing wildly at the sheets still holding her down preparing to lunge for the woman who had dared to invade her home who had dared the binding spell crashed down on her with enough force to slam her against the mattress knocking the air out of her lungs her dagger fell to the floor slipping out of her nerveless fingers as she stared unmoving into the dark above her bed oh you naughty thing i see why they worked so hard to hide you you were quite the catch for them werent you im sorry to have to bind you but you left me no choice try to breathe this will all be over soon and this silliness will fade away the woman fluttered out of crystals view the mattress creaked as a weight settled on it then a gentle hand grasped crystals chin turning her head until she was facing the little woman who sat beside her crystal glared with all the force that she could find the woman smiled youre sixteen arent you dont try to answer i already know dont you think its past time you stopped running off to some childish fantasy land leaving this worldthis good world that you were born a part ofwanting its time to grow up my dear she tapped crystals cheek again this time she bore down enough that the sharp tips of her nails bit into crystals skin im here to help you im the truth fairy you see and that means i can do what you havent been able to do on your own crystal tried to struggle crystal failed havent you ever noticed how fairies only come when there are things to be taken away santa claus the easter bunny the birthday pig they come to leave things behind them presents and chocolates and things like that but the tooth fairy comes when you lose a tooth and she takes that tooth away and you never see it again what she leaves is a hole something that your new tooth can fill do you understand yet my dear crystals eyes screamed hate at herhate and terror because something of what the truth fairy was saying made perfect terrible sense all the children shed known in elementary school the ones who had traveled to worlds of their own worlds like her own otherways but different theyd all forgotten their adventures hadnt they shed wondered why with increasing confusion as friend after friend suddenly swore their quests and their trials had been nothing but fantasies shed been to some of their worlds traveling through mechanisms as strange and wondrous as her own passage star and then one day those children just forgot and there had been other children in otherways before her you cant be part of two worlds forever the heart doesnt work like that there isnt room any more than theres room in a mouth for two sets of teeth baby teeth fall out childhoods end thats how adult teeth and adult lives find the space to grow the truth fairy leaned close voice almost a whisper as she said havent you ever noticed how so many people seem to walk around empty inside like theres a hole cut out of the middle of them a space where something used to be and isnt anymore someone has to dig the holes crystal when your baby teeth dont fall out someone has to pull them hearts can heal that was what naamen had told her but thered been more to it hadnt there hearts can heal as long as they remember the way home hearts could forget the way home the truth fairy rose on buzzing wings crystals eyes widened the reality of the moment sinking into her bones there was no rescue there was no salvation her name was going to be added to the quiet ranks of the forgotten and never spoken again not now not tomorrow not to the next child to stumble through the light of the passage star she was never going home again the knife went up the knife came down and somewhere deep inside her in the place that the truth fairys knife sought with such unerring skill crystal halloway screamed morning dawned as mornings always do paul and maryanne halloway were in the kitchen when their daughter came down the stairs still yawning and wiping the sleep from her eyes morning mom and dad she said voice muffled by the hand she pressed against her mouth breakfast scrambled eggs and toast said maryanne how did you sleep really well crystal smiled a little blearily as she dropped herself into a seat at the kitchen table i had the weirdest dreams her father looked up from his laptop leaving his halfcomposed email unsent what about you know i dont remember now crystals smile became a puzzled frown something about a rabbit i think i dont know for a moment her frown deepened taking on an almost panicked edge it seemed so important dont worry yourself dear maryanne put a plate of eggs and toast down in front of her daughter eat up you dont want to be late for school yeah the frown faded replaced by calm were talking about college applications today i should probably be on time for that crystal ate quickly and mechanically and after she left her parents marveled at how focused and collected shed seemed like she was finally ready to face the challenges of growing up neither of them saw the empty space behind her eyes in the place where a lifetime of adventures used to be neither of them saw the hole cut through her heart waiting to be filled by a world that would never satisfy her although she would never until she died be able to articulate why neither of them really saw her at all and it wouldnt have mattered if they had done was done and a heart once truly broken could never remember the way home crystals father had grown up in that same house had known adventures and excitement in a world whose name he no longer knew he would love his daughter all the more for having lost the same things he had lost and her mother she didnt remember the talking horses or the magical wars or the young prince with webs between his fingers not consciously even if sometimes in the night she cried both of them knew that empty space more intimately than they could understand and none of them not crystal not her parents could hear the distant thready sound of a giant spiderthe guardian of the passage to the beyond the one who had guided and guarded a hundred generations of human children nurtured them

earth and the dog said bowwow he is the winner of numerous awards including the hugo nebula sturgeon locus and world fantasy awards the television set is upside down i need its company while i clean but not its distraction sipping gingerly at a glass of wine i vacuum the oriental rugs onehanded with great care ah katherine youd be amazed the job ive done the house has never been so clean i put the vacuum cleaner back in the closet cleanup takes next to no time at all since i eliminated all the unneeded furniture rugs done im about to get out the floor polish when it occurs to me that trash pickup is tomorrow humming i roll up the carpets one by one tie them with string carry all three out to the curb then since its no longer needed i set the vacuum cleaner beside them back in the house the living room is all but empty the dried and bleached bones of our life picked clean of meat and memories one surviving chair the television and a collapsible tray ive used since discarding the dining room table the oven timer goes off the pot pies are ready i get out the plate knife and fork slide out the pies and throw away the foil roasting tray i wipe the stove door with a damp rag rinse the rag wring it out and put it away pour myself another glass of wine the television gibbers and shouts at me as i eat people hang upside down like bats they scuttle across the ceiling smiling insanely the news bimbo is chatting up the latest disaster mouth an inverted crescent somebody in a woodpecker suit is bashing his head into the bed of a pickup truck over and over again is all this supposed to mean something was it ever the wine in my glass is halfgone already making good time tonight all of a sudden the bad feelings well up like a gusher of misery i squeeze my eyes shut screwing my face tight but somehow the tears seep through and im sobbing crying uncontrollably because while im still thinking about you while i never do and never can stop thinking about you its getting harder and harder to remember what you looked like its going away from me oh katherine im losing your face no self pity i wont give in to it i get out the mop and fill a bucket with warm water and ammonia detergent swabbing as hard as i can i start to clean the floors until finally its under control i top off my glass take a sip feel the wine burning in my belly drinking like this will kill a man sooner or later which is why i work at it so hard im teaching myself how to die if i dont get some fresh air ill pass out if i pass out ill drink less timing is all i get my coat walk out the door wibbledywobbledy down the hill i go past the row houses and corner hoagie shops the chocolate factory and the gas station under the railroad bridge and along the canal all the way down into manayunk the wine is buzzing in my head but still the traitor brain dwells on you a droning monologue on pain and loss and yearning if only id kept you home that day if only id only fucking only even im sick of hearing it i lift up and above it until conscious thought is just a drear mumble underfoot and i soar up godlike in the early evening air how you loved manayunk its old mill buildings tumbledown collieries and bluecollar residences the yuppies have gentrified main street but three blocks uphill from it the people havent changed a bit still hardheaded suspicious good neighbors i float through the narrow streets to the strip of trendy little restaurants on main my head swells and balloons and my feet barely touch the ground i pass through the happy evening crowd attached to the earth by the most tenuous of tethers id sever it if i could and simply float away then i see the man strangling in midair nobody else can see him they stride purposefully by some even walking through the patch of congealed air that darkly sparkling contains his struggling figure he is twisting in slow agony on a frame of chrome bars like a fly dying on a spiders web the outlines of his distorted body are prismatic at the edges like a badly tuned video he is drowning in dirty rainbows his body is a cubist nightmare torso shattered into overlapping planes limbs scattered through nine dimensions the head swings around eyes multiplying and being swallowed up by flesh and then there is a flash of desperate hope as he realizes i can see him he reaches toward me outflung arm spreading through a fan of possibilities caught in jellied air dark and sparkling his body shattered into strangely fractured planes mouth opens in a silent scream and through some form of sympathetic magic the faintest distant echoes of his pain sound a whispering screech of fingernails across the back of my skull i know a man who is drowning when i see one people are scurrying about some right through the man they glance at me oddly standing there frozen on the sidewalk i reach up and take his hand it hurts it hurts like a sonofabitch i feel like ive been hit with a twobyfour one side of my body goes completely numb i am slammed sideways thought whiting out under sheets of hard white pain and it is a blessing because for the first time since you died oh most beloved i stop thinking about you when i come to i draw myself together stand up i havent moved but the street is empty and dark must be late at night which is crazy because people wouldnt just leave me lying there its not that kind of neighborhood so why did they it doesnt bear thinking about i stand up and there beside me is the mans corpse hes dressed in a kind of white jumpsuit with little hightech crap scattered all over it a badge on his chest with a fan of arrows branching out diverging from a single point i look at him dead poor bastard and nothing i can do about it i need another drink home again home again trudge trudge trudge as i approach the house something is wrong though there are curtains in the windows and orange light spills out if i were a normal man id be apprehensive afraid fearful of housebreakers and psychopaths theres nothing id be less likely to do than go inside i go inside someone is rattling pans in the kitchen humming is that you love i stand there inside the living room trembling with something more abject than fear its the kind of curdling terror you might feel just before god walks into the room no i say to myself dont even think it you walk into the room that didnt take long you say amused was the store closed then seeing me clear alarm touches your face and you say johnny im trembling you reach out a hand and touch me and its like a world of ice breaking up inside and i start to cry love whats wrong which is when i walk into the room again the two of me stare at each other at first to be honest i dont make the connection i just think theres something odd about this man strangest damn guy i ever did see and i cant figure out why all those movies and television shows where somebody is suddenly confronted by his exact double and goes slackjawed with shock lies the batch of them he doesnt look a bit like the way i picture myself johnny katherine says in a strangled little voice but shes not looking at me but at the other guy and hes staring at me in a bemused kind of way as if theres something strange and baffling about me and then all of a sudden the dime drops hes me hes me and hes not getting it anymore than i was katherine he says who is this a very long evening later i find myself lying on the couch under a blanket with pillows beneath my head upstairs katherine and the other me are arguing his voice is low and angry hers is calm and reasonable but he doesnt like what it says it was my wallet that convinced her the drivers license identical to his in every way the credit and library and insurance cards all the incidental pieces of identification one picks up along the way and every single one of them exactly the same as his save for the fact that his belong to a man whose wife is still alive i dont know exactly what youre saying up there but i can guess at the emotional heart of it you love me this is in a sense my house i have nowhere else to go you are not about to turn me out meanwhile ithe me upstairs i meanam angry and unhappy about my being here at all he knows me better than you do and he doesnt like me onetenth as much knowing that theres no way you could tell us apart he is filled with paranoid fantasies hes afraid im going to try to take his place which if i could i most certainly would but that would probably require my killing him and im not sure i could actually kill a man even if that man was myself and how could i possibly hope to square it with katherine im in uncharted territory here i have no idea what might or might not happen for now though its enough to simply hear your voice i ignore the rest and close my eyes and smile a car rumbles down the road outside and then abruptly stops as do the voices above all other noises cease as sharply as if somebody has thrown a switch puzzled i get up from the couch out of nowhere strong hands seize my arms theres a man standing to the right of me and another to the left they both wear white jumpsuits which i understand now to be a kind of uniform they wear the same badgea fan of arrows radiant from a common locusas the man i saw strangling in the air were sorry sir says one we saw you trying to help our comrade and we appreciate that but youre in the wrong place and we have to put you back youre time travelers or something arent you i ask or something the second one says hes holding onto my right arm with his free hand he opens a kind of pod floating in the air beside him an equipment bag i think its filled with devices which seem to be only half there a gleaming tube wraps itself around my chest another around my forehead but dont worry well have everything set right in just a jiff then i twig to whats going on no i say shes here dont you understand that ill keep my mouth shut i wont say anything to anyone ever i swear only let me stay ill move to another city i wont bother anybody the two upstairs will think they had some kind of shared hallucination only please for gods sake let me exist in a world where katherines not dead there is a terrible look of compassion in the mans eyes sir if it were possible we would let you stay done says the other the world goes away so i return to my empty house i pour myself a glass of wine and stare at it for a long long time then i get up and pour it into the sink a year passes its night and im standing in our tiny urban backyard katherine looking up at the stars and a narrow sliver of moon talking to you i know you cant hear me but ive been thinking about that strange night ever since it happened and it seems to me that in an infinite universe all possibilities are manifest in an eternal present somewhere youre happy and that makes me glad in countless other places youre a widow and heartbroken surely one of you at least is standing out in the back yard like i am now staring up at the moon and imagining that im saying these words which is why im here so it will be true i dont really have much to say im afraid i just want you to know i still love you and that im doing fine i wasnt for a while there but just knowing youre alive somehow however impossibly far away is enough to keep me going youre never really dead i know that now and if it

pale pewter and salmon red save where the shrunken moon cast its huge gloomy shadow here the moon clung close to the counterearth in a universe chilling toward absolute zero julie peered out at a universe cooling into extinction below their orbit hung the curve of counterearth its night side lit by the pale countermoon both these were lesser echoes of the real earthmoon system a universe awayor twentytwo centimeters whichever came first massive ice sheets spread like pearly blankets from both poles ridges ribbed the frozen methane ranges the equatorial land was a flinty scarred ribbon of ribbed black rock hemmed in by the oppressive ice the planet turned almost imperceptibly a major ridgeline just coming into view at the dawn line julie sighed and brought their craft lower al sat silent beside her yet they both knew that all of earthsidethe real earth she still thoughtlistened and watched through their minicams the focal point is coming into sunlight bout now al reported lets go get it she whispered this gloomy universe felt somber awesome they curved toward the dawn line data hummed in their board displays spatters of light reporting on the gravitational pulses that twisted space here they had already found the four orbiting gravitational wave radiators just as predicted by the science guys now for the nexus of those four down on the surface the focal point the coordinator of the grav wave transmissions that had summoned them here and just maybe to find whatever made the focal point somewhere near the dawn line they came arcing over the counternight a darkness deeper than she had ever seen crept across counter night here without the shrunken moons glow had no planets dotting the sky only the distant sharp stars at the terminator shadows stretched jagged black profiles of the ridgelines torn by pressure from the ice the warming had somehow shoved fresh peaks into the gathering atmosphere ragged and sharp since there was atmosphere thicker and denser than anybody had expected the stars were not unwinking points they flickered and glittered as on crisp nights at high altitudes on earth near the magnetic poles she watched swirling blue auroral glows cloak the plains where fogs rose even at night a cold dark world a universe away from sunny earth through a higher dimension she did not really follow the theory she was an astronaut it was hard enough to comprehend the mathematical guys when they spoke english for them the whole universe was a sheet of spacetime called brane for membrane and there were other branes spaced out along an unseen dimension only gravity penetrated between these sheets all other fields which meant all mass and light was stuck to the branes okay but what of it had been her first response just mathematics until the physics guysit was nearly always guysfound that another brane was only twentytwo centimeters away not in any direction you could see but along a new dimension the other brane had been there all along with its own mass and light but in a dimension nobody could see okay maybe the mystics but that was it and between the two branes only gravity acted so the counterearth followed earth exactly and the countermoon likewise they clumped together hugging each other with gravity in their unending waltz only the counterbrane had less matter in it so gravity was weaker there julie had only a cartoonlevel understanding of how another universe could live on a brane only twentytwo centimeters away from the universe humans knew the trick was that those twentytwo centimeters lay along a dimension termed the qcoordinate ordinary forces couldnt leave the brane humans called the universe or this brane but gravity could so when the first big gravitational wave detectors picked up coherent signals from nearbytwentytwo centimeters awayit was just too tempting to the physics guys and once they opened the portal into the lookingglasslike countersystemshe had no idea how except that it involved lots of magnetssomebody had to go and look julie and al it had been a splitsecond trip just a few hours ago in quick flashimages she had seen purplegreen limbs and folds oozing into glassy strutselongating then splitting into red smoke leathery oblongs and polyhedrons folded over each other twinkling jarring slices of hard actinic light poked through them and it all moved as though blurred by slices of time into a jostling hurry enough concentrate on your descent trajectory stuff moving down there al said right where the focal point is at the dawns ruby glow looks like he closeupped the scene below a long ice ridge rose out of the sea like a great gray reef following its earthly analogy it teemed with life quilted patches of vivid bluegreen and carrotorange spattered its natural pallor out of those patches spindly trunks stretched toward the midmorning sun at their tips crackled bright blue st elmos fire violettinged flying wings swooped lazily in and out among them to feed some already filled alighted at the shoreline and folded themselves waiting with their flat heads cocked at angles the sky even at counters midmorning remained a dark backdrop for gauzy auroral curtains that bristled with energy this world had an atmospheric blanket not dense enough to scatter the wan sunlight for on this brane the sun itself had less mass too she peered down she was pilot but a biologist as well and they knew there was something waiting going in she said into this slow world they came with a high roar wings flapped away from the noise a giant filled the sky julie dropped the lander closer her legs were cramped from the small pilot chair and she bounced with the rattling boom of atmospheric braking she blinked suddenly alarmed beside her in his acceleration couch al peered forward at the swiftly looming landscape hows that spot he jabbed a finger tensely at the approaching horizon near the sea sure plenty of life forms there kind of like an african watering hole analogies were all she had to go on here but there was a resemblance their reconn scans had showed a ferment all along the shoreline al brought them down steady above a rocky plateau their drive ran redhot now here was a problem nobody on the mission team for all their contingency planning had foreseen their deceleration plume was bound to incinerate many of the life forms in this utterly cold ecosystem even after hours the lander might be too hot for any life to approach not to mention scalding them when nearby ices suddenly boiled away well nothing to do about it now fifty meters and holding al glanced at her ok touchdown she said and they settled onto the rock to land on ice would have sunk them hipdeep in fluid only to then be refrozen rigidly into place they eagerly watched the plain something hurried away at the horizon which did not look more than a kilometer away look at those lichen she said eagerly in so skimpy an energy environment how can there be so many of them were going to be hot for an hour easy al said his calm careful gaze sweeping the view systematically the ships computers were taking digital photographs automatically getting a good map i say we take a walk she tapped a key giving herself a voice channel reciting her id opening without thinking okay now the good stuff as we agreed i am adding my own verbal comments to the data i just sent you they had not agreed not at all many of the counter mission control engineers wedded to their mathematical slang and nasas jawbone acronyms felt that commentary was subjective and useless let the expert teams back home interpret the data but the pr people liked anything they could use counter is a much livelier place than we ever imagined theres weather for one thinga product of the planets sixday rotation and the mysterious heating turns out the melting and freezing point of methane is crucial with the heatingup the mean temperature is well high enough that nitrogen and argon stay gaseous giving counter its thin atmosphere of course the ammonia and carbon dioxide are solid as rockcounters warmer but still incredibly cold by our standards methane though can go either way it thaws every morning even better the methane doesnt just sublimenope it melts then it freezes at night now the dawn line was creeping at its achingly slow pace over a ridgeline casting long shadows that pointed like arrows across a great rock plain there was something there she could scarcely believe hard to make out even from their thousandkilometerhigh orbit under the best magnification something they werent going to believe back earthside so keep up the patter and lead them to it just do it meanwhile on the dark side theres a great heat sink like the one over antarctica on earth it moves slowly across the planet as it turns radiating heat into space and pressing down a column of cold airi mean of even colder air from its lowest coldest point winds flow out toward the day side at the sunset line they meet sunwarmed airand it snows snow maybe i should take up skiing huh at least al laughed it was hard talking to a mute audience and she was getting jittery she took a hit of the thick jolting columbian coffee in her mug onward on the sunrise side they meet sunlight and melting methane ice and it rains gloomy dawn permanent moving around the planet like a veil she closeupped the dawn line and there it was a great gray curtain descending marching everwestward at about the speed of a fast car so weve got a perpetual storm front moving at the edge of the night side and another that travels with the sunrise as she warmed to her subject all pretense at impersonal scientific discourse faded from julies voice she could not filter out her excitement that verged on a kind of love she paused watching the swirling alabaster blizzards at twilights sharp edge and on the dawn side the great solemn racks of cloud although admittedly no jupiter this planether planet for the momentcould put on quite a show the result is a shallow sea of methane that moves slowly around the world following the sun whod a thought eh you astro guys since methane doesnt expand as it freezes the way water doesokay the astro guys know that she thought but the public needs reminders and this damn well was going out to the whole wide bloomin world rightim sure its all slush a short way below the surface and solid ice from there down but so what the sea isnt stagnant because of what the smaller countermoon is doing its close to the planet so it makes a permanent tidal bulge directly underneath it and the two worlds are trapped like two dancers forever in each others arms so that bulge travels around from daylight to darkness too so sea currents form and flow and freeze on the night side the tidal pull puts stress on the various ices and they hump up and buckle into pressure ridges like the ones in antarctica but much bigger miles high in fact in counters weak gravity massive peaks worthy of the best climbers but her enthusiasm drained away and she bit her lip now for the hard part shed rehearsed this a dozen times and still the words stuck in her throat after all she hadnt come here to do closeup planetology an unmanned orbital mission could have done that nicely julie had come in search of lifeof the beings who had sent the gravitational wave signals and now she and al were about to walk the walk the cold here was unimaginable hundreds of degrees below human experience the suit heaters could copethe atmosphere was too thin to steal heat quicklybut only if their boots alone actually touched the frigid ground sophisticated insulation could only do so much julie did not like to think about this part her feet could freeze in her boots then the rest of her even for the landers heavily insulated shockabsorber legs they had told her it would be touchandgo beyond a stay of a few hours their onboard nuclear thermal generator was already laboring hard to counter the cold she could see creeping in from their external thermometers their craft already creaked and popped from thermal stresses and the thermal armor from the viewpoint of the natives must seem a hot untouchable furnace yet already they could see things scurrying on the plain some seemed to be coming closer maybe curiosity was indeed a universal trait of living things al pointed silently she picked out a patch of dark bluegray down by the shore of the methane sea on their console she brought up the visual magnification in detail it looked like rough beach shingle tidal currents during the twentytwo hours since dawn had dropped some kind of gritty detritusnot just ices apparentlyat the seas edge nothing seemed to grow on the flat andswiveling point of viewup on the ridges knifeedge also seemed bare relatively free of life itll have to do she said maybe a walk down to the beach al said turn over a few rocks they were both tiptoeing around the coming moment with minimal talk they got into their suits skillfully gingerlyand by prior coinflipjulie clumped down the ladder she almost envied those pioneer astronauts who had first touched the ground on luna backed up by a constant stream of advice or at least comment from houston the mars landing crew had taken a mutual fourperson single step taking a breath she let go the ladder and thumped down on counter startlingly sparks spat between her feet and the ground jolting her there must be a lot of electricity running around out here she said fervently thanking the designers for all that redundant insulation al followed she watched big blue sparks zap up from the ground to his boots he jumped and twitched ow that smarts al said only then did she realize that she had already had her shot at historical pronouncements and had squandered it in her surprise wowwhat a profound thought huh she asked herself ruefully al said solemnly we stand at the ramparts of the solar system well she thought fair enough he had actually remembered his prepared line he grinned at her and shrugged as well as he could in the bulky suit now on to business against the gray ice and rock their lander stood like an h g wells martian walkingmachine splayfooted and ominous rocks anyone they began gathering some using long tweezers soil samples rattled into the storage bin lets take a stroll al said hey closeup that she pointed out toward sea things were swimming toward them just barely visible above the smooth surface they made steady progress toward shore each had a small wake behind it looks like somethings up al said as they carefully walked down toward the beach she tried her link to the landers wideband receiver happily she found that the frequencies first logged by her lost devoured probe were full of traffic confusing though each of the beastsfor she was sure it was themseemed to be broadcasting on all waves at once most of the signals were weak swamped in background noise that sounded like an old am radio picking up a nearby hightension line one however came roaring in like a popmusic station she made the landers inductance tuner scan carefully that patternyes it had to be quickly she compared it with the probelog shed had the wit to bring down with her these were the odd cadences and sputters of the very beast whose breakfast snack had been her first evidence of life listen to this she said al looked startled through his face plate the signal boomed louder and she turned back the gain she decided to try the radio directionfinder al did too for crosscheck as they stepped apart moving from some filmy ice onto a brooding brown rock she felt sparks snapping at her feet little jolts managed to get through even the thermal vacuumlayer insulation prickling her feet the vector reading combined with als startled her why the things practically on top of us if counters lords of creation were all swimming in toward this island ridge for lunch this one might get here first fired up by all those vitamins from the lost probe she wondered suddenly excited julie peered out to seaand there it was only a roiling frothing ripple like a ships bow wave but arrowing for shore and others farther out then it bucked up into view and she saw its great segmented tube of a body with a sheen somewhere between motherofpearl and burnished brass why it was huge for the first time it hit her that when they all converged on this spot it was going to be like sitting smackdab in a middlingsized dinosaur convention too late to back out now she powered up the small lander transmitter and tuned it to the signal she was receiving from seaward with her equipment she could not duplicate the creatures creative chaos of wavelengths for its personal identification sign the beast seemed to use a simple continuous pulse pattern like morse code easy enough to simulate after a couple of dryrun hand exercises to get with the rhythm of it julie sent the creature a roughly approximate duplicate of its own id she had expected a callback maybe a more complex message the result was astonishing its internal rocket engine fired a bright orange plume against the skys blackness it shot straight up in the air paused and plunged back its splash sent waves rolling up the beach the farthest tongue of sluggish fluid broke against the landers most seaward leg the beast thrashed toward shore rode a wave inand stopped the living cylinder lay there half in half out as if exhausted had she terrified it made it panic cautiously julie tried the signal again thinking furiously it would give you quite a turn she realized if youd just gotten as far in your philosophizing as i think therefore i am and then heard a thin toneless duplicate of your own voice give back an echo she braced herselfand her second signal prompted a long suspenseful silence then hesitantlyshylythe being repeated the call after her julie let out her breath in a long shuddering sigh she hadnt realized she was holding it then she instructed dis the primary computer aboard venture to run the one powerful program counter mission control had never expected her to have to use the translator wiseguy the creation of that program climaxed an argument that had raged for a century ever since whitehead and russell had scrapped the old syllogistic logic of aristotle in favor of a far more powerful methodsufficient they believed to subsume the whole of science perhaps the whole of human cognition all to talk to counters gravitational signals she waited for the program to come up and kept her eyes on the creature it washed gently in and out with the lapping waves but seemed to pay her no attention al was busily snapping digitals he pointed offshore looks like we put a stop to the rest of them heads bobbed in the sea waiting for what in a few moments they might have an answer to questions that had been tossed around endlessly could all language be translated into logically rigorous sentences relating to one another in a linear configuration structures a system if so one could easily program a computer loaded with one language to search for another languages equivalent structures or as many linguists and anthropologists insisted does a truly unknown language forever resist such transformations this was such a strange place after all forbidding weird chemistry alien tongues could be strange not merely in vocabulary and grammatical rules but in their semantic swamps and mute cultural or even biological premises what would life forms get out of this place could even the most inspired programmers just by symbol manipulation and numbercrunching have cracked ancient egyptian with no rosetta stone with the counter project already far over budget the decision to send along wiseguywhich took many terabytes of computational spacehad been hotly contested the deciding vote was cast by an eccentric but politically astute old skeptic who hoped to disprove the bugeyed monster rosetta stone theory should life unaccountably turn up on counter julie had heard through the gossip tree that the geezer was gambling that his support would bring along the rest of the dis package that program he passionately believed in wiseguy had learned japanese in five hours hopi in seven what smatterings they knew of dolphin in two days it also mastered some of the fiendishly complex multilogic artificial grammars generated from an earthbased mainframe the unexpected outcome of six billion dollars and a generation of cyberfolk was simply put a good translator had all the qualities of a true artificial intelligence wiseguy was a guy of sorts itor she or he nobody had known quite how to askhad to have cultural savvy and blinding mathematical skills julie had long since given up hope of beating wiseguy at chess even with one of its twin processors tied off she signaled again and waved hoping to get the creatures attention al leaped high in the onetenthofag gravity and churned both arms and legs in the ten seconds it took him to fall back down excited the flying wings swooped silently over them the scene was eerie in its silence shouldnt birds make some sort of sound the auroras danced in julies feed from venture she heard wiseguy stumblingly mutteringand beginning to talk she noted from the digital readout on her helmet interior display that wiseguy had been eavesdropping on the radio crosstalk already now it was galloping along in contrast to the simple radio signals she had first heard the spoken acoustic language turned out to be far more sophisticated wiseguy however dealt not in grammars and vocabularies but in underlying concepts and it was fast julie took a step toward the swarthy cylinder that heaved and rippled then another ropy muscles surged in it beneath layers of crusted fat the cluster of knobs and holes at its front moved it lifted its headthe snubbedoff blunt forward section of the tubeand a bright fast chatter of microwaves chimed through her ears followed immediately by wiseguys whispery voice discourse another step more chimes wiseguy kept this up at increasing speed she was now clearly out of the loop data sped by in her ears as wiseguy had neatly inserted itself into the conversation assuming julies persona using some electromagnetic dodge the creature apparently still thought it was speaking to her its head swiveled to follow her the streaming conversation verged now from locked harmonies into brooding meandering strings of chords julie had played classical guitar as a teenager imagining herself performing before concert audiences instead of bawling into a mike and hitting two chords in a rock band so she automatically thought in terms of the musical moves of the data flow major keys gave way to dusky harmonies in a minor triad to her mind this had an effect like a cloud passing across the sun wiseguy reported to her and al in its whisper it and awk had only briefly had to go through the metarzanyoujane stage for a life form that had no clearly definable brain she could detect it proved a quick study she got its proper name first as distinguished from its identifying signal its name definitely for the translator established early in the game that these organisms had no gender the quand they called themselves and this onecall it awk because that was all wiseguy could make of the noise that came beforearkquand maybe wiseguy whispered for julie and al alone awk was just a placenote to show that this thing was the presently here of the quand it seemed that the name was generic for all of them like earth tribes al said who name themselves the people individual distinctions get tacked on when necessary al was like thatsurprising erudition popping out when useful otherwise a straight supernerd techtype his idea might be an alternative to earths tiresome clash of selfish individualisms and stifling collectivisms julie thought the political theorists back home would go wild julie took another step toward the dark beach where the creature lolled its head following her progress it was nokidding cold she realized her boots were melting the ground under her just enough to make it squishy and she could hear the sucking as she lifted her boot too so she wasnt missing these creatures callsthey didnt use the medium one more step chimes in her ears and wiseguy sent them a puzzled it seems a lot smarter than it should be look they need to talk to each other over distance out of sight of each other julie said those waxy allonewing birds should flock and probably need calls for mating right so do we not that she really thought that was a deep explanation how do we frame an expectation about intelligence al put in yeah im reasoning from earthly analogies julie admitted birds and walruses that use microwaveswho woulda thought i see wiseguy said and went back to speaking to awk in its ringing microwave tones julie listened to the ringing interchange speed up into a blur of blips and jots wiseguy could run very fast of course but this huge tubular thing seemed able to keep up with it microwaves higher frequencies had far greater carrying capacity than sound waves and this awk seemed able to use that well evolution would prefer such a fasttalk capability she supposedbut why hadnt it on earth because sound was so easy to use evolving out of breathing even herewiseguy told her in a subchannel asideindividual notes didnt mean anything their sequence did along with rhythm and intonation just like sound speech nearly all human languages used either subjectobjectverb order or else subjectverbobject and the quands did too but to wiseguys confusion they used both apparently not caring basic values became clear in the quick scattershot conversation something called rendezvous kept coming up modified by comments about territory selfmerge the ultimate freely chosenapparently with all the quands working communally afterward to care for the young should there luckily occur a birthing respect for age because the elders had experienced so much more al stirred restlessly watching the sea for signs that others might come ashore hey theyre moving in al said apprehensively julie would scarcely have noticed the splashing and grinding on the beach as other quands began to arriveapparently for rendezvous their mating and wiseguy stressed that it deserved the capital lettersave that awk stopped to count and greet the new arrivals her earlier worry about being crunched under a press of huge quand bodies faded they were social animals and this barren patch of rock was now awks turf arrivals lumbering up onto the dark beach kept a respectful distance spacing themselves like walruses yes julie felt a sharp cold ache in her lower back standing motionless for so long the chill crept in she was astounded to realize that nearly four hours had passed she made herself pace stretch eat and drink from suit supplies al did the same saying were eighty percent depleted on air damn it i dont want to quit now how bout you get extra from the lander al grimaced he didnt want to leave either they had all dedicated their lives to getting here to this moment in this place okay capn sir he said sardonically as he trudged away she felt a kind of silent bliss here just watching life strange and wonderful went on all around her her running digital coverage would be a huge hit earthside unlike axelrods empire the counter project gave their footage away as if answering a signal the quand hunched up the slope a short way to feed on some brown lichenlike growth that sprawled across the warming stones she stepped aside awk came past her and another quand slid up alongside it rubbed against awk edged away rubbed again a courtship preliminary julie guessed they stopped and slid flat tongues over the lichen stuff vacuuming it up with a slurp she could hear through her suit tentatively the newcomer laid its body next to awk julie could hear the pace of microwave discourse awk was broadcasting and it took a lurch with the contact slowing slowing and awk abruptlyeven curtly it seemed to julierolled away the signal resumed its speed she laughed aloud how many people had she known who would pass up a chance at sex to get on with their language lessons or was wiseguy into philosophy already it seemed to be digging at how the quand saw their place in this weird world julie walked carefully feeling the crunch of hard ice as she melted what would have been gases on earthnitrogen carbon dioxide oxygen itself she had to keep up and the lowg walking was an art with so little weight rocks and ices that looked rough were still slick enough to make her slip she caught herself more than once from a full facedown splatbut only because she had so much time to recover in a slow fall as the quand worked their way across the stony field of lichen they approached the lander al wormed his way around them careful to not get too close wiseguy interrupt julie explained what she wanted it quickly got the idea and spoke in short bursts to awkwho resent a chordrich message to the quand they all stopped short i dont want them burned on the lander julie said to al who made the switch on her suit oxy bottles without a hitch burnt i dont want them eating it al said then the quand began asking her questions and the first one surprised her do you come from lightgiver as heralds in the next few minutes julie and al realized from their questions alone that in addition to a society the quand had a roughandready view of the world an epic oral literature though recited in microwaves and something that resembled a religion even wiseguy was shaken it paused in its replies something she had never heard it do before not even in speed trials agnostic though she was the discovery moved her profoundly lightgiver after all she thought with a rush of compassion and nostalgia we started out as sunworshippers too there were dark patches on the quands upper sides and as the sun rose these pulled back to reveal thick lenses they looked like quartztough crystals for a rugged world their banquet of lichen doneshe took a few samples for analysis provoking a snort from a nearby quandthey lolled lazily in their long day she and al walked gingerly through them peering into the quartz eyes their retinas were a brilliant blue with red wirelike filaments curling through and under convergent evolution seemed to have found yet another solution to the eye problem so whats our answer are we from lightgiver well youre the capn remember he grinned and the biologist she quickly sent no we are from a world like this from near uh lifegiver do not sad it sent through wiseguy lightgiver gives and lightgiver takes but it gives more than any it is the source of all life here and from the dark bless lightgiver quands did not use verb forms underlining existence itselfno words for are is be so sad became a verb she wondered what deeper philosophical chasm that linguistic detail revealed still the phrasing was startlingly familiar the same damned comfortless comfort she had heard preached at her grandmothers rainswept funeral remembering that moment of loss with a deep inward hurt she forced it away what could she say after an awkward silence awk said something renderable as i need leave you for now another quand was peeling out awks personal identification signal with a slight tagend modification traffic between the two quands became intense wiseguy did its best to interpret humming with the effort in her ears then she saw it a pearly fog had lifted from the shoreline and there stood a distant spire old worn rocks peaked in a scoopedout dish al theres the focal point he stopped halfway between her and the lander damn yes the quand built it butwheres their civilization gone they lost it while this braneuniverse cooled the idea had been percolating in her and now she was sure of it al said awed once these creatures put those grav wave emitters in orbit and built this focal pointall to signal to us on our brane we know this universe is dyingand so do they the counterbrane had less mass in it and somewhat different cosmology here spacetime was much further along in its acceleration heading for the big rip when the expansion of the counteruniverse would tear first galaxies then stars and planets apart pulverizing them down into atoms julie turned the translator off first things first and even on counter there was such a thing as privacy theyve been sending signals a long time then al said waiting for us to catch up to the science they once hadand now have lost she wondered at the abyss of time this implied as if we could help them al ever the diplomat began yknow its been hours even on this tenthg world she was getting tired the quand lolled lifegiver stroking their skinswhich now flushed with an induced chemical radiance harvesting the light she took more digitals thinking about how to guess the reaction yknow yeah right lets go outside they prepped the lander for liftoff monotonously as they had done earthside a few thousand times they went through the checklist tested the external cables rapped the valves to get them to open tried the mechanicals for freezeupand found two legs that would not retract they took all of als powerful heft to unjam them julie lingered at the hatch and looked back across the idyllic plain the beach the sea like a pink lake she hoped the heat of launching carried through this frigid air would add to the suns thin rays and and what maybe to help these brave beings who had sent their gravwave plea for help too bad she could not transmit wagners grand liebestod to them something to lift spiritsbut even wiseguy could only do so much she lingered gazing at the chilly wealth here held both by scientific curiosity and by a newfound affection then another miracle occurred the way they do matteroffactly sections of carbon exoskeleton popped forth from the shiny skin of two nearby quands jerkily these carbonblack leaves articulated together joined swelled puffed with visible effort into one great sphere inside she knew but could not say why the two quands were flowing together coupling as one being selfmerge for some reason she blinked back tears then she made herself follow al inside the lander back towhat checked and rechecked they waited for the orbital resonance time with venture to roll around each lay silent immersed in thought the lander went ping and pop with thermal stress al punched the firing keys the lander rose up on its roaring tail of fire her eyes were dry now and their next move was clear back through the portal to earth tell them of this vision a place that tells us what is to come eventually in our own universe goin home al shouted yes she answered and with us and the quand together maybe we can find a way to save us both to rescue life and meaning from a universe that in the long run will destroy itself cosmological suicide she had come to explore and now they were going back with a task that could shape the future of two species two branes two universes that dwelled a hands thickness from each other quite enough for a mere one trip through the portal through the lookingglass back to a reality that could never be the same anas tag william alexander studied theater and folklore at oberlin college and english at the university of vermont his short stories have been nominated twice for the pushcart prize and published in various strange and wonderful places including weird tales lady churchills rosebud wristlet interfictions and fantasy the best of the year his first novel goblin secrets debuted in kirkus described the book as evocative in its oddities ana and rico walked on the very edge of the road where the pavement slumped and crumbled they were on their way to buy sodas and there were no sidewalks they made it as far as the spot where the old meatpacking factory had burned down when deputy chad drove up and coasted his car alongside at a walking pace ana was just tall enough to see the deputy through his car window and the empty space of the passenger seat her brother rico was taller but he wasnt trying to look through the car window rico was staring straight ahead of him hi kids said deputy chad hi said ana i need to ask you both about the incident at the school the deputy said okay said ana when rico didnt say anything its very important the deputy said this is the first sign of gang activity everyone knows that gang activity he tried to arch one eyebrow but it didnt really work and his forehead scrunched other cars slowed to line up behind the squad car coasting along whats the second sign ana asked the second sign said deputy chad taking a deep breath happens at night on the highway it involves headlights do you know that keeping your highbeams on at night can blind oncoming traffic ana didnt she nodded anyway usually a driver has just forgotten to turn them off and the way to let them know is to flash your own highbeams just briefly but they drive around with the highbeams on deliberately if you flash at one of their cars they pull a quick and violent uturn and follow you very close sometimes they just do it to see where you live sometimes they run you off the road bam he smacked the top of his steering wheel ana jumped he grinned at her and she grinned back whats the third sign rico asked without grinning i cant tell you that said deputy chad ask your parents it is the last ceremony of initiation and it involves blonde tenyearolds im ten said ana youre not blonde so youre probably safe probably oh said ana good the line behind deputy chad was now seven cars long coasting slowly none of them dared to pass a cop so said the deputy you can see why we need to put a stop to this kind of thing right away before it escalates do you know anything about the incident at school no said rico whats the graffiti of asked ana it is deliberately illegible said the deputy its in code probably a streetname a tag graffiti is often somebodys tag delineating whose turf is whose it looks like it could be in spanish ana and ricos parents spoke spanish they used it as their secret language and slipped into spanish whisperings whenever they didnt want ana or rico to understand them sometimes in public ana and rico liked to pretend they could speak it too they would toss together random words and gibberish and use an accent because both of them could fake a pretty good one they hadnt played that game for a while rico bent forward a little so he could look through the passenger window ill let you know if i hear anything about it he said good boy said the deputy and smiled a satisfied smile be safe now he drove off cars followed him like ducklings perro muerto said ana it meant dead dog or maybe dead hair it was one of their nonsense curses he thinks you did it yeah said rico did you ana asked yeah said rico oh what does it say not telling oh said ana rico pushed ana to his right side so he could walk between her and the moving cars and then he made a sign with his left hand he tried not to let ana see him do it she saw anyway but she didnt ask she cared more about the graffiti ill do all the dishes if you tell me what it says no okay ana thought about how long it would take to get to the east wells high school try to read the painted wall write down all of her guesses and walk home she decided she could make it before dinner maybe rico would tell her if she guessed right they were almost to the gas station which had a much better selection of soda to pick from than the corner store the last part of the walk was uphill and ana had to work harder to keep up with her brother do you think there really are gangs she asked rico shrugged and smiled a little gangs of what i dont know gangs i doubt it he said east wells isnt big enough to put together a gang of anything bigger than two people deputy chad is just really really bored he reached up and twisted his new earring stud hed pierced it himself with a sewing needle ana had held the swabs and rubbing alcohol while he did it shed felt obliged to help because she already had pierced ears so she could offer him the benefit of her knowledge dont forget to clean that when we get home she said i wont he said he sounded annoyed ana decided to change the subject to something casual and harmless why isnt there a west wells she asked rico stopped walking they were in the gas station parking lot only a few steps away from soda and air conditioning ana turned around her brother was staring at her what did you say west wells she said again trying to be extra casual and harmless we live in east wells but it isnt actually east of anything theres just you know the woods by the school and then endless fields of grain on all sides theres no west wells rico exhaled loudly thats right he said there is nothing to the west of this dinky little town you are absolutely right he walked by her and went inside ana followed she had questions endless questions bubbling up somewhere near her stomach and she had to swallow to keep them there because rico was definitely not in an answering kind of mood she shivered in the air conditioning even though shed been looking forward to it rico knew which soda he wanted but ana took a long time to choose ana got her cat backpack from her bedroom closet it was brown and furry and had two triangular ears sewn onto the top she pulled a stack of library books out of it and replaced them with a flashlight rope chocolatechip granola bars bandaids a notebook and magic markers she filled up the small square canteen that had been tio frankies with water and packed that too then she took out the flashlight because it was summer and it didnt get dark outside until long after dinnertime and she needed to be back by dinner anyway did you clean your ear she asked ricos bedroom door no he said from behind it dont forget you dont want it to get infected i wont forget he said she walked to the east wells high school taking a shortcut through two cornfields to keep off the highway it wasnt a long walk but during the school year almost everybody took the bus anyway because of the highway and the lack of sidewalks rico liked walking even in wintertime ana saw him sometimes through the bus window on her way to east wells elementary she walked between cornrows and underneath three billboards two of them said something about the bible one was an ad for a bat cave ten miles further down the road ana had never seen the bat cave rico said it wasnt much to see but she still wanted to go ana crossed the empty parking lot in front of the high school and skirted around the athletic field to the back of the gym she knew where to find the gym because it doubled as a theater and last summer a troupe of traveling actors had put on the pirates of penzance after the show ana had decided to become a traveling actor then she decided that what she really wanted to be was a pirate king a little strip of mowed lawn separated the gym from the western woods three of ricos friends were there standing in front of the graffiti ana could see green paint behind them they were smoking of course julia and nick smoked cloves sweetsmelling garth wore a marlboroman kind of hat so he was probably smoking that kind of cigarette his werent sweetsmelling hey ana said hey said julia ana liked julia hey said nick nick was julias boyfriend ana was pretty sure that her brother was jealous of this nick and julia were both in ricos band and both of them were really really tall they were taller than rico and much taller than garth garth didnt say anything he chose that moment to take a long drag on his cigarette probably to demonstrate that he wasnt saying anything garth was short and stocky and scruffy he wasnt in the band he had a kind of beard but only in some places he also had a new piercing in his eyebrow it was shaped like the tusk from a very small elephant the skin around it was red and swollen and painfullooking ana thought eyebrow rings were stupid she liked earrings and she could understand nose rings bellybutton rings and even pierced tongues but metal sticking out of random facial places like eyebrows just looked to her like shrapnel from a boobytrapped jewelry box she didnt like it the fact that garths eyebrow was obviously infected proved that she was right and that the universe didnt like it either you should use silver for a new piercing ana told him and you need to keep it clean this is silver said garth he didnt look at her as he said it he looked at the tops of trees dont worry about him said nick he likes pain he gets confused and grumpy if something doesnt hurt oh said ana she edged around them trying to get a better look at the wall and the paint garth threw down his cigarette stepped on it and reached out to knock the cloves from nick and julias hands berthas coming he said bertha walked around the corner she was the groundskeeper rico used to help her mow the school lawn as a summer job but this year he hadnt bothered her name wasnt really bertha and ana didnt want to ever call her that but she didnt know what berthas name really was bertha sniffed and smiled her hair was a big feathered mullet one of you isnt smoking cloves she said one of you is smoking real cigarettes and i am going to bet it isnt the one with the kitten backpack one of you is gonna buy my silence why no officer i sure didnt see any young hooligans smoking near your site of vandalism ana nick and julia all looked at garth garth grunted handed over his pack of cigarettes and walked away he walked away into the woods bye ana julia said say hi to rico tell him we need to rehearse she took nicks arm and the two of them followed garth ana could see the graffiti now it was red and green and it wasnt anything ana knew how to decipher parts of it were swoofy and other parts had sharp edgy bits it looked like it was made up of letters but she wasnt sure which letters they were bertha lit one of garths cigarettes gonna have to rent a sandblaster she said wont come off without a sandblaster and its brick so i cant just paint over it deputy chad thinks it was gangs that did it ana said bertha snorted town isnt big enough for gangs she said doesnt matter anyway this is just somebody marking their territory this is colored piss with artistic pretensions ana took out her notebook but she didnt have any guesses to write down yet hows the novel she asked bertha this was the usual thing to ask bertha had always been writing a novel terrible bertha said sorry said ana she wondered if it was better to be a novelist or a traveling actor and decided it would still be better to be a pirate king whats with the notebook bertha asked she flicked her cigarette butt at the graffiti and it hit the bricks above the paint with a shower of orange sparks im going to draw it ana said ill take it home and figure out what it says and then then maybe ill know who did it ill solve the mystery have fun bertha said she opened a door in the gym wall with one of the many jingling keys at her belt and went in the door shut behind her with a loud metal scrape ana drew the graffiti tag luckily she had the right colors of magic marker it took her seven tries to get it right the screen door squeaked when ana opened it the kitchen lights were on one cold plateful of food sat on an otherwise bare table anas mother sat at the other end face down on her folded arms she was snoring ana hid her backpack under the table and put the plate of food on a chair and out of sight wake up mama she said her mother woke up where have you been child she asked annoyed but mostly groggy here ana said ive been here for hours sorry i missed dinner you should be said her mother where ana pretended to yawn her mother couldnt help yawning then and this made ana yawn for real bedtime she said once she was able to say anything her mother nodded and both of them went upstairs ana snuck back downstairs to throw away her dinner and fetch her backpack she ate the chocolate granola bars while sitting on the floor of her bedroom and studying the graffiti in her notebook she thought it might say roozles rutterkin or rumbustical but there were always extra letters or at least extra swoofs and pointy edges to the letters and the longer she stared at it the less each word fit ana slept she dreamed that her kittenbackpack climbed snuffling onto the foot of her bed she woke up when it stepped on her toes and once she was awake she could see its pointyeared outline a car drove by outside and made strange windowshade shadows sweep across the wall and ceiling maybe the car had its highbeams on her bag moved she kicked it and it fell off the edge landing with more of a soft smacking sound than it should have ana wanted to turn on the light but the light switch was across the room she would have to touch the floor to get there she decided that now would be a really excellent time to develop telekinetic powers and spent the next several minutes concentrating on the light switch another car went by she got up tiptoed across the floor and turned on the light she turned around the backpack was right at her feet she didnt scream she swallowed an almostscream the furry pointyeared bag wasnt moving she pulled on the edges of the zipper and peeked inside her expedition supplies were still there she poked through them with the capped tip of a magic marker just in case there was also something else in there the notebook lay open to the seventh graffiticovered page she tried to nudge it aside but the tip of the marker went through the colored surface she dropped the pen it passed through the graffiti and vanished the page rippled like a pond she took another magic marker and used it to close the notebook cover then she looked out in the hallway to see if ricos bedroom light was on it was she took the notebook tiptoed by her parents room and sped up to pass the stairway the air felt different at the top of the stairs it felt like the stairway was holding its breath it felt like the open space might breathe her in and down and swallow her she knocked on ricos door no answer she knocked again because she knew it would be locked from the inside so there wasnt any point in trying to open it herself he still didnt answer she tried the doorknob and it turned he wasnt there she tread carefully on the few clear and visible parts of the floor and took a better look around from the middle of the room he wasnt standing behind his dresser or lurking behind the armrest of the ratty old couch he wasnt hiding in his closet because it was filled with too much junk already and nothing more would fit she looked under the bed and he wasnt there either she looked at the empty bed and found a rolled up piece of parchment you play tomorrow night musician it said be ready the parchment crumbled into several brown leaves and drifted to the floor settling among the socks and books and torn pieces of sheet music he must be rehearsing she said to herself ill try to find him tomorrow she went back to her room and hung the backpack up on the knob handle of one of her dresser drawers to keep it from wandering and went to bed she left the light on she didnt see anything move for the rest of the night including her backpack she heard things move instead rico wasnt at breakfast this wasnt unusual because he almost always slept until lunchtime so their parents didnt seem worried as they bustled and joked and made coffee and went away to work after kissing ana on each cheek ana went back upstairs as soon as they were gone rico wasnt in his room bits of brown leaves crunched and crumbled in the carpet under her feet ana got dressed and took her backpack down from the knob shed hung it on dont go walking anywhere without me she said she took more granola bars from the kitchen and refilled her little square canteen and locked up the house it started to rain when she reached the first highway billboard and anas clothes and backpack were soggy by the time she got to the gym the bags sopping ears lay flat against the zipper she stood in front of the graffiti took a deep breath and wondered if she was supposed to say something out loud maybe she was supposed to say whatever the graffiti said and she still couldnt read it something snarled in the trees behind her ana turned around took a step backwards and tried to press herself against the wall it didnt work she pressed and passed through it hello said a voice that scraped against the insides of her ears ana faced another painted wall stone instead of brick she took a breath the air was still and it smelled like thick layers of dust she turned around an old man thin and spindly sat on a stool and polished a carved flute he had a wispy beard he tested two notes on the flute and set to polishing again behind him were several shelves of similar instruments some were plain and a pale yellowgrey some were carved with delicate patterns and others inlaid with metals and lacquered over hello ana said the grey lady brings deliveries every second tuesday and today is neither thing are you delivered here has she changed schedules i dont know any grey ladies ana said except math teachers do you mean mrs huddle no huddling things the old man said he set down the flute on a carved wooden stand picked up a bone from his workbench and took a rasp to the knobby joints tell me your purposes then if no lady brought you are you here to buy a flute no ana said im looking for my brother unfortunate that you should look for him here how old hes sixteen so old good good i wont have pieces of him then ana looked around for pieces of people there was a straw cot in the corner beside a green metal stove there were baskets and tin lanterns hanging by chains from a high ceiling there were no windows a staircase against one wall led up to the only doorway there was a workbench and shelves full of flutes and a mural of moonlight and trees where she had stepped through the wall hes a musician ana said a singer hes in a band i think last week they were the paraplegic weasels but i dont know if thats still their name it keeps changing very prudent said the old man rasping bone hes supposed to play for someone tonight i dont know who tonight there are many festivities or so ive heard rumor he swapped the rasp for a finer file and began to scrape the bone more delicately ana took a step closer the invitation turned into leaves after i read it then hell likely play his music in the glen the old man said you should be on the forest paths and not here in the city city oh yes underneath it a few layers down he wiped away loose bonedust and set both bone and file down on the workbench the stone floor youre standing on used to be a road but the city is always growing up over itself oh ana said she looked down at the floor the old man reached down scooped her up by the armpits and set her on the edge of the workbench she swallowed an almostscream when he pinched each leg squeezing down to the thighbones and then she kicked him in the stomach ana jumped down ran to the mural and smacked the surface of it with the palms of both hands the surface held behind her the old man wheezed and coughed and laughed a little no matter he said both bones broken and all the music leaked out from the fractures cant make any kind of flute from either leg how did you break them both ana turned around to watch him he sat back on his stool wheezing and he seemed to want to stay there i jumped off the roof and what flying thing were you fleeing from he asked nothing rico dared me to jump so i did i didnt tell on him either he still owes me for that well the old man said i hope you can collect what he owes when you find him such a shame that your bones were broken there are a great many children and there isnt enough music there isnt nearly enough so how do i get out she hated admitting that she didnt already know the old man smiled and widened up his eyes boo he said puffing out his thin beard ana took a step backwards and passed through the stone her face was inches away from her brothers graffiti it was dark and she could barely see the colors by moonlight she looked around she was alone her backpack was gone i told it not to wander off she said there was only one forest path she could find ana took a walking stick from a pile of broken branches near the edge of the woods and took a deep breath and set out she wished she had her flashlight she wished she had her backpack in her head she promised to give it a scratch behind the ears if it would come back and to never again hang it up on a dresser drawer knob it had looked uncomfortable there the air smelled like wet leaves heavy and rich she followed the path uphill and downhill and around sudden corners cut into the sides of hills she passed trees that looked like tall twisted people until she looked at them directly ana hoped she was following the right trail she saw a wispy orange light between the tree trunks and decided to follow that instead the orange light brightened as garth inhaled cigarette smoke he was leaning on a boulder he looked up and blew smoke at the moon half of his face was swollen hey said ana what are you doing nothing he said waiting for little girls maybe your infections worse true he said but this bit of silver is keeping me from gnawing on your bones oh said ana good everybody should stay away from my bones he took another drag brightening up the wispy orange light and tugged his hat down to cover more of the swollen half of his face ana held on to her stick do you know where rico is she asked maybe he plays tonight can you take me to him maybe garth dropped the cigarette and stepped on it crushing the little orange flame he walked off away from the path ana waited for some signal from him that she should follow she didnt get one she followed garth took long strides and his boots hit the ground like he was trying to punish it for something ana tried to keep up and she tried to keep a little bit behind him at the same time she didnt want to be too close he hunched staring at the ground and she thought he was moping more than usual until he dove snarling he came up holding a lanky thing covered in short spiky fur where does the guard keep watch tonight he asked the lanky thing shrugged and grinned many teeth where does the guard watch the glen he shook the thing in his hand it snickered please ana asked very sweetly the lanky thing blew her a kiss tonight there is no waking guard it said tonight he is sleeping and dreaming that he guards and he crosses no one unless they cross into his dreaming while he sleeps at his post which is easy to do and see to it that you dont everything within a pebbles toss of him in all directions is only the substance of his dream and inside it the guard is a much better guard than he ever was awake he guards the western arch how many arches are there garth asked tonight there is only the western arch all others are overgrown it rained today thank you ana said the lanky thing bowed which was difficult to do while garth held it up by the scruff of its neck then it bit him hard on the wrist and dropped to the ground garth howled the lanky thing snickered from somewhere nearby let me see your wrist ana said she had bandaids in her backpack then she remembered that she didnt have her backpack garth looked at her garth never made eye contact but he did so now and he held it and he also made a little rumbling noise in the back of his throat no he said okay she said you should know that im not interested in dying for your brother hes alright i like him but im not interested in death on his behalf im not interested in any of the things so close to death that the distinction makes no difference this is something you should know before we go any further okay she said again he walked away she followed she wondered where her backpack was they found an enormous figure in full plate armor asleep the guard was dreaming a desert the size of a pebbles throw all around it was sunlight and sand and nowhere to hide thats the western gate garth said where ana whispered behind the desert cut into the wall of thorns there he pointed ana stood at the very edge of the desert and squinted she could only see sand and sun in front of them garth dropped another finished cigarette driving it further into the dirt than he really needed to good luck he said wait ana told him dont go yet im going to try something she picked up a pebble took aim and threw it at the precise moment that she stepped forward into desert sand for just a instant she knew what it was like to be an unimportant part of someone elses dream then the pebble struck the guards gold helmet clanging loudly and waking it up the desert vanished ana ducked behind a tree that hadnt been there before and leaned against the trunk she could hear the metal movements of plate armor on the other side she didnt know where garth was i am a pirate king ana whispered to herself its a glorious thing to be a pirate king she ran and switched directions twice and tried to circle back towards the western gate she almost stumbled in the dark but she didnt the guard almost caught her anyway she felt gauntleted fingers snatch at her shoulder then she heard it clang and crash against the ground she stopped panting and turned around to look garth stood over the guard who was much shorter and less impressive than it had dreamed itself earlier garth looked at ana snarled and jerked his chin towards the gate then he spit on the guards golden armor ana backed further away she watched the guard pull itself up off the ground it plucked out garths silver piercing with a little spray of blood garth howled and his face began to change ana turned away and slipped inside the glen was at least as big as a cornfield and covered over with a dome of branches high overhead inside the branches were orange wisps of light glowing and fading again it was full of dancers ana looked at them and closed her eyes and looked again she could hear rico singing over the noise of the crowd im still a pirate king she whispered to herself weaving her way in between dancers and trying to find the stage she dodged the dancing things and bumped into some and passed through the shimmering substance of others she saw colors and antlers and sharp teeth in strange places she found the stage she found her brother he sang and the language sounded a little bit like spanish but not very much nick played a red guitar acoustic and covered in gold ivy julia played a yellowgrey flute both of them were even taller than they usually were rico saw her and ana saw a lot of white around the edges of his eyes when he did he nudged julia and she started a flute solo and he got down off the stage and pulled ana behind it she opened her mouth and he shushed her okay dont eat or drink whatever else you do dont eat anything and dont drink anything now tell me what you think youre doing looking for you ana said im impressed he said biting on his lower lip i really am but this is very very bad and im not sure how to fix it whats the problem ana asked folding her arms and looking at him as though she were the older one okay rico said taking deep breaths do you see those guys over there the ones with the tattoos theyre the gang ana asked yeah sure kind of and this is supposed to be my last task for them and then after the concert ill learn how to sing up every chrome piece of a motorcycle and ride it from town to town stopping only to hum the fuel tank full again ill learn how to sing hurricanes and how to send them away ill learn how to sing something people can dance to for a full year and never notice the time passing sounds like fun ana said sure the catch is that this crowd has to be happy and dancing until the dawn light comes if they stop before then i fail and i have to serve the guys with the tattoos for at least a hundred years so you should either go right now however you came here or else hide somewhere and dont eat or drink or talk to anyone until dawn and dont do anything distracting because the crowd might stop dancing and that would be very bad they like children here but they care about music a lot more than they care about kids ana looked up at julia and her yellowgrey flute i have go back onstage now rico said okay ana said hide he said okay he went back onstage julia finished her solo and rico sang he was good ana thought she saw her backpack scamper between someones hooves she followed then she saw garth or at least she assumed it was garth he had started to eat people near the western arch crap ana said he was distracting the crowd some of them werent dancing anymore she ran back to the arch and slipped through she looked everywhere kicking up leaves she found her walking stick and used it to poke through the leaves that were dark and wet and sticky then she found one golden gauntlet blood pooled underneath it a small silver tusk sat in its palm she picked up the silver it was very sharp she ran back through the arch and followed the screaming garth was gnawing on a severed antler with his long wolfmuzzle some things in the crowd were shouting and more were laughing and most were still dancing but not all of them were hey perro muerto ana said she threw her walking stick at him it got his attention he dropped the antler bounded forward and knocked her to the ground slavering ana grabbed one of his furry ears with her left hand and shoved the tusk through it with her right the skin of his ear resisted stretching a little before the silver broke through garth rolled over and howled ana got to her feet and looked around her the crowd danced even those who were bleeding from the fight with garth were dancing again she took a deep breath and she didnt get a chance to let it out all the way before someones hand took her by the elbow and pulled her towards the stage she looked up at the arm attached to the hand it had green and red letters tattooed all up and down its length rico julia and nick bowed to the sound of applause and unearthly cries the sky began to lighten above the branches grey and rosecolored and pale the owner of the green and red arm pushed ana forward in front of rico whats this rico asked your last initiation said a very deep voice behind ana she didnt want to turn around she looked straight ahead at her brother sing her to sleep let her sleep for a thousand years or at least until another glacier passes this way ive already finished my initiation rico said they all danced until dawn yes said the voice you held them most of them and they were deer in headlights highbeamed by your song those you lost you gained again as they danced bleeding it was good but it was not your last task the last requires a tenyearold crap said ana rico took her hand pulled her closer and tossed red and green colors into the air between them and the crowd colors settled into the shape of his tag ana still couldnt read it home rico said ill follow when i can you have to tell me what it says ana told him but he just smiled and pushed her through their parents were as frantic as one might expect ana managed to slip into her brothers room and find green and red spraypaint hidden behind the couch before her mother and father and deputy chad came in to look for clues to ricos whereabouts ana kept the spraypaint hidden under her own bed it took a long time for ana to get back to the high school because her parents kept closer tabs on her after rico disappeared bertha had already sandblasted the graffiti and ana couldnt find the forest path and she didnt know where garth was she hoped he wasnt dead or something very close to dead she walked home and listened to three nervous phone messages from her mother on the answering machine ana called her back and told her she was home and that everything was fine even though it wasnt really she went up to her room and found her backpack sitting on her bed she gave it a hug it purred when she scratched behind its ears im really really angry at you for leaving she said it kept purring inside she found three pages torn from her notebook they were folded in half together with ana written on the front the first page was in ricos handwriting ill see you as soon as i find a way out of a hundred years of servitude it said dont worry ill manage do not come looking for me keep a pinch of salt in your pocket at all times and stay out of the woods and do not keep following me around im serious ana snorted and turned the page it was her seventh drawing with a note written underneath this is my name dumbass she turned to the last page this is yours ana looked at it and saw that it was she took out her magic markers and practiced marking her territory on the back wall of her closet nothing personal pat cadigan sold her first professional science fiction story in she is the author of fifteen books including two nonfiction books on the making of lost in space and the mummy a young adult novel and the two arthur c clarke awardwinning novels synners and fools pat lives in gritty urban north london with the original chris fowler her musician son robert fenner and miss kitty calgary queen of the cats she can be found on facebook and google and she tweets as cadigan detective ruby tsung could not say when the dread had first come over her it had been a gradual development taking place over a period of weeks possibly months with all the subtlety of any of the more mundane life processesweightgain greying hair ageing itself time marched on and one day you woke up to find you were a somewhat dumpy greying middleaged homicide detective with twentyfive years on the job and a hefty lump of bad feeling in the pit of your stomach the dread it was a familiar enough feeling the dread ruby had known it well in the past waiting for the verdict in an officerinvolved shooting looking up from her backlog of paperwork to find a stonefaced iad officer standing over her the doctor clearing his throat and telling her to sit down before giving her the results of the mammogram answering an unknown trouble call and discovering it was a cops address then there were the ever popular rumours rumours rumours of budget cuts of forced retirement for everyone with more than fifteen years in of mandatory transfers demotions promotions stings grand jury subpoenas not to mention famine war pestilence disease and deathbusiness as usual after a while she had become inured to a lot of it you had to or youd make yourself sick give yourself an ulcer or go crazy as she had grown more experienced she had learned what to worry about and what she could consign to denial even just temporarily otherwise she would have spent all day with the dread eating away at her insides and all night with it sitting on her chest crushing the breath out of her the last ten years of her twentyfive had been in homicide and in that time she had had little reason to feel dread there was no point this was homicidesomething bad was going to happen so there was no reason to dread it someone was going to turn up dead today tomorrow it would be someone else the next day still someone else and so forth nothing personal just homicide nothing personal she had been coping with the job on this basis for a long time now and it worked just fine whatever each murder might have been about she could be absolutely certain that it wasnt about her whatever had gone so seriously wrong as to result in loss of life it was not meant to serve as an omen a warning or any other kind of signifier in her life just the facts maam or sir then punch out and go home nothing personal she was perfectly clear on that it didnt help she still felt as if she had swallowed something roughly the size and density of a hockey puck there was no specific reason that she could think of she wasnt under investigationnot as far as she knew anyway and she made a point of not dreading what she didnt know she hadnt done anything lately that would have called for any serious disciplinary action there were no questionable medical tests to worry about no threats of any kind her son jake and his wife lita were nested comfortably in the suburbs outside boston making an indecent amount of money in computer software and raising her grandkids in a big old victorian house that looked like something out of a storybook the kids emailed her regularly mostly jokes and scans of their crayon drawings whether they were all really as happy as they appeared to be was another matter but she was fairly certain they werent suffering but even if she had been inclined to worry unduly about them it wouldnt have felt like the dread almost as puzzling to her as when the dread had first taken up residence was how she had managed not to notice it coming on eventually she understood that she hadntshe had simply pushed it to the back of her mind and then being continuously busy had kept on pushing it all the way into the worry about later file where it had finally grown too intense to ignore which brought her back to the initial question when the hell had it started had it been there when her partner rita castillo had retired she didnt remember feeling anything as unpleasant as the dread when rita had made the announcement or later on at her leaving party held in a cop bar the festivities had gone on till two in the morning and the only unusual thing about it for ruby had been that she had gone home relatively sober not by design and not for any specific reason not even on purposeshe had had a couple of drinks that had given her a nice mellow buzz after which she had switched to diet cola some kind of new stuffsomeone had given her a taste and shed liked it who right tommy dicenzo tommy had fifteen years of sobriety which was some kind of precinct record but the dread hadnt started that night it had already been with her then not the current fullblown knot of dread but in retrospect she knew that she had felt something and simply refused to think about the bit of disquiet that had sunk its barbed hook into a soft place but she hadnt been so much in denial that she had gotten drunk you left yourself open to all sorts of unpleasantness when you tied one on at a cops retirement party bad thoughts bad memories bad dreams and real bad morningsafter of course knowing that hadnt always stopped her in the past it was too easy to let yourself be caught up in the moment in all the moments and suddenly you were completely shitfaced and wondering how that could have happened whereas she couldnt remember the last time shed heard of anyone staying sober by accident could have been the nineyearold that had brought the dread on that had been pretty bad even for an old hand like herself rita had been on vacation and she had been working alone when the boys body had turned up in the dumpster on the south sideor south town which was what everyone seemed to be calling it now the sudden namechange baffled her she had joked to louie levant at the desk across from hers about not getting the memo on renaming the hoods louie had looked back at her with a mixture of mild surprise and amusement on his pale features south town was what we always called it when i was growing up there he informed her a bit loftily guess the rest of you finally caught on louie was about twenty years younger than she was ruby reminded herself which meant that she had two decades more history to forget she let the matter drop either way south side or south town the area wasnt a crime hotspot it wasnt as upscale as the parklike west side or as stolidly middleworking class as the northland grid but it wasnt east midtown either murder in south town was news the fact that it was a nineyearold boy was worse news and worst of all it had been a sex crime somehow she had known that it would be a sex crime even before she had seen the body lying small naked and broken amid the trash in the bottom of the dumpster just what she hadnt wanted to catchkiddie sex murder kiddie sex murder had something for everyone nightmares for parents hysterical ammunition for religious fanatics and lurid headlines for all and a very special kind of hell for the family of the victim who would be forever overshadowed by the circumstances of his death during his short life the boy had been an average student with a talent for things mechanicalhe had liked to build engines for model trains and cars he had told his parents he thought hed like to be a pilot when he grew up had he died in some kind of accident a car wreck a fall or something equally unremarkable he would have been remembered as the little boy who never got a chance to flytragic what a shame light a candle instead he would now and forever be defined by the sensational nature of his death the public memory would link him not with littlekid stuff like model trains and cars but with the pervert who had killed him she hadnt known anything about him none of those specific details about models and flying when she had first stood gazing down at him at that point she hadnt even known his name but she had known the rest of it as she had climbed into the dumpster trying not to gag from the stench of garbage and worse and hoping that the plastic overalls and booties she had on didnt tear that had been a bad day bad enough that it could have been the day the dread had taken up residence in her gut except it wasnt thinking about it remembering the sight the smell the awful way it felt when she had accidentally stepped on the dead boys ankle she knew the dread had already been with her not so cumbersome at the time still small enough to snub in favour of more immediate problems but definitely there had it been ricky carstairs then about a month before the nineyearold she had been on her way out of the precinct house when she had passed two uniformed officers bringing him in and recognized him immediately she had no idea how she had managed that mental feathe had been skinny dirty and obviously strung out and she hadnt seen him since he and jake had been in the seventh grade together but she had known him at once and it hadnt been a good moment its just plain wrong she had said when rita asked her why she looked as if she had just found half a worm in the middle of an apple your kids old school friends are supposed go away and live lives with no distinguishing characteristics become office workers in someplace like columbus or chicago or duluth and thats just plain weird rita replied her plump face wearing a slightly alarmed expression or maybe not weird enoughi dont know you been watching a lot of tv lately like the hallmark channel or something never mind she said making a short dismissive wave with one hand it made more sense before i said it out loud rita had burst into hearty laughter and that had been that theyd gone with the rest of the day whatever that had involved probably a dead body the dismaying sight of one of jakes old school friends sweating in handcuffs had lodged in her mind more as a curiosity than anything else uncomfortable but hardly criticalnot the fabled moment of clarity not a short sharp shock or a reality check or a wakeup call from planet earth just a moment when she hoped that poor old ricky hadnt recognized her too so had the dread already been lodged in her gut then she tried but she honestly couldnt remember one way or the otherthe incident was just too far in the past and it had lasted only a minute if thatbut she thought it was very possible that it had it was unlikely she realized that she would ever pinpoint the exact moment when something had shifted or slipped or crackedgone faulty anywayand let a sense of something wrong get in and take root and for all she knew it might not even matter not if she were in the first stage of one of those onthejob crackups that a lot of cops fell victim to just what she neededa slowmotion trainwreck christ what the hell was the point of having a breakdown in slowmotion unless you could actually do something about it actually prevent it from happening too bad it didnt work that wayevery cop she knew who had come out the other side of a crash described it as unstoppable if it had to happen why couldnt it be fast crack up quick and have an equally rapid recovery get it over with she pictured herself going to the department shrink for help overclock me doci got cases to solve and theyre gaining on me haha good one the shrink might even get a chuckle out of it unless she had to explain what overclocking was would a shrink know enough about computers to get it hell she wouldnt have known herself if she hadnt picked things up from jake who had blossomed into a tech head practically in his playpen her mind snagged on the idea of talking to the shrink and wouldnt let go why not she had done it before granted it had been mandatory thenall cops involved in a shooting had to see the shrinkbut shed had no problem with that and what the hell it had done her more good than shed expected it to she had known at the time that shed needed help and if she were honest with herself she had to admit that she needed help now going around with the lead weight of the dread dragging on her wasnt even on the extreme assend of acceptably screwedup that was in the range of normal for a homicide detective the more she thought about it the more imperative it seemed that she talk to the department shrink because she sure hadnt talked to anyone else about it not her lieutenant not tommy dicenzo not even rita well she wouldnt have talked to lieutenant ostertagthat was a nobrainer throughout her career she had always had the good sense never to believe any mydoorisalwaysopen bullshit from a superior officer ostertag hadnt even bothered with the pretense tommy dicenzo on the other hand she could have talked to and counted on his complete confidence theyd gone through the academy together and shed listened to plenty from him both before and after hed dried out tommy might even have understood enough to tell her whether she was about to derail big time or just experiencing another sideeffect of being middleaged overworked and underpaid but every time she thought about giving him a call or asking him to go for coffee something stopped her maddeningly she couldnt think of a single good reason why hell she couldnt even think of a crappy reason there was no reason she simply could not bring herself to talk to him about the dread and that was all there was to it and ritawell there had been plenty of reasons not to talk to her they were busy far too busy to devote any time to anything that didnt have a direct bearing on the cases piling up on their respective desks not that rita wouldnt have listened but whenever she considered bringing it up saying you know rita lately ive had the damnedest feeling a sense of being in the middle of something real bad thats about to get a whole lot worse the image of the nineyearold boy in the dumpster would bloom in her brain and she would clench her teeth together of course she could go to rita now she could trot on over to her neat little fourthfloor condo sit out on the balcony with her amid the jungle of plants with a few beers and tell her all about it only she knew what rita would probably say because rita had already said it that had been the night before she had put in her retirement papers she had taken ruby out to dinner and broken the news to her privately i always planned to put in my twenty and get out while i was still young enough to enjoy it she said cheerfully sawing away at a slab of bloody steak you could have done that five years ago do it now and youll be in good shape all the way around maybe you want to get in thirty but is putting in another five years really worth it five years ruby had shrugged whats five years blink of an eye practically all the more reason to get out rita had insisted before its too late to get a life bristling inwardly ruby had looked down at her own steak why she had ordered that much food was beyond her the dread didnt leave anywhere nearly enough room for it i have a life the job is not a life rita said chewing vigourously and then dragging her napkin across her lips the job is the job what do you do when youre not on the job talk to the grandkids on email shop rent dvds you ever go out to a movie or out to dinnerwith anyone other than me rita added quickly before she could answer hell girlfriend when was the last time you got laid ruby blinked at her startled unsure whether it was by the question itself or by the fact that she didnt know the answer i dont know if youve heard rita leaned over the table and lowered her voice confidentially but there are more alternatives for people our age than the cone or the rabbit yeah but my idea of sex doesnt involve typing ruby looked at her sidelong keeps the fingers nimble rita laughed no i wasnt referring to chat room sex im talking about going out and meeting people dating sites ruby made a pained face please rita mirrored her expression social groups meetups for people with similar interests hobbies film festivals shit like that you know ive got a boyfriend pause and a girlfriend sounds exciting ruby told her but i dont know if thats really for me i didnt know either rita said i sure didnt go looking for it it just happened thats how it is when you have a lifethings happen you ought to try it yeah well what i really want to know is how come i havent gotten to meet these people youve been seeing ruby folded her arms and pretended to be stern well for one thingand ive got to be perfectly honest here rita put down her knife and fork i wasnt sure how youd react rubys eyebrows went up what all this time weve worked together and you dont know im not a homophobe i was referring to the guy rita said deadpan damn and i thought i hid it so well said ruby equally deadpan rita gave a laugh and picked up her knife and fork again so pull the pin with me you wont have to hide anything you dont want to ill give it some thought ruby lied im asking you againwhatre you waiting for rita paused regarding her expectantly when she didnt answer she went on theyre not gonna promote you you know you do know that dont you ruby dipped her head noncommittally i sure knew they werent gonna promote me i knew that for a goddam fact rita took a healthy swig of wine and dragged her napkin across her mouth again so is that why you decided to retire rita wagged her head emphatically i told you it was my plan all alongget in my twenty and get the hell out theyd have had to come up with a pretty hefty promotion to make me want to stay yeah like whatchief commissioner supreme dictator for life and im not so sure i would have said yes rita sighed what are you holding out forlieutenant i passed the exam so did i so did umptyhundred other cops ahead of us both and they aint moving up either ritas expression abruptly turned sad i never figured you for a lifer or maybe you hoped i wasnt ruby said personally i never thought about it i just get up and go to work every day think about it now rita said urgently think about it like youve never thought about anything else get seriousyoure topped out whatever youre waiting for it isnt coming all you can do is mark time i work on solving murders and putting away the guilty parties ruby said an edge creeping into her voice i wouldnt call that marking time for you personally it is rita insisted unapologetic and in case you forgot you count for something im a good cop that counts for a lot thats not all you are though do you even know that any more ruby shifted in her seat more than a little irritated retiring young isnt for everybody even if you think it is when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail oh for chrissakes already rita blew out a short breath thats what ive been trying to tell you they sat looking at each other for some unmeasured time and ruby realized that her soontobeexpartner was just as irritated with her possibly more she tried to come up with something to say to defuse the situation before a serious quarrel developed but the dread sitting large and uncomfortable in the middle of her body was eating her brain the dread was actually all she ever thought about now like a pain that never went away she realized and there was barely room for anything else any more then rita had sat back in her chair dismay in her plump round face shit what the hell am i doing im sorry rube ruby stared at her baffled im telling you you dont have a life and im browbeating you like im trying to get a confession she shook her head as if trying to clear it i think im getting out just in time well i was gonna lawyer up ruby said laughing a little forget it its a touchy thing when a partner leaves we both know that things can get a little weird blown out of proportion they had finished their dinneror rather rita had finished hers while ruby got a doggybagand called it a night early smiles all round although the smiles were slightly sad that was how things still stood between them smoothed over but not actually resolved if she went to rita now and told her about the dread growing a little bit bulkier a little heavier and a little more uncomfortable every day with no end in sight rita would only take that as further proof that she was right about retirement and she really did not want to have that conversation with rita because she had no intention of retiring because she knew deep in her core and in her bones that even if she did take ritas advice to pack it all in even if she took it a step further sold everything she owned and went off to a luxury beach condo in the caribbean to laze around in the sun all day indulge in fancy food and drink and get thoroughly perfectly laid every night by a series of gorgeous men and women separately and togetherdespite all of that and a billion dollars besides she knew with no uncertainty at all that she would still wake up every morning with the dread that much larger and heavier and unrelenting than it had been the day before if she went to rita she would have to tell her that and she didnt want to because she really didnt think rita would understand and if she didnt tell her then rita would only start harping again on the question of what she was waiting for probably accuse her of waiting for the dread to go away then she would have to confess no im waiting to find out im waiting for whatever it is ive been dreading to show up which was something she hadnt quite admitted to herself yet coffee the voice cut through the combination of rubys usual morning haze and the constant overriding pressure of the dread startling her and making her jump a little she looked up from the open folder she had been staring at unseeingly to find a young guy standing next to her desk holding out a large cup that definitely had not come from any of the precinct machines i didnt know you guys delivered she said smiling as she took the cup from him dont let it get around the guy said or ill have to do it for everybody he was about thirty just a little too dark to be called oliveskinned with a sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose and a head full of honeycoloured dreadlocks that had the potential to become unruly he was only a couple of inches taller than ruby herselffiveeight fivenine at the mostand slightly husky itll be our secret she assured him taking the lid off the cup a dark roast aroma wafted up with the steam not her favourite but she wasnt inclined to find fault am i supposed to know you when the lieutenant comes in hell introduce me as your new partner i see ruby studied him transfer from vice he shook his head narcotics ah he smiled with half his mouth must be the dreads ruby barely managed not to flinch at the word it took a quarter of a second before she realized what he was referring to well it was some kind of undercover work though right fraud and cybercrime rafe pasco he held out his hand and ruby took it it was strong and square but as smooth and soft as a womans portuguese she guessed filipino actually on my fathers side he grinned and halfsat on the edge of her desk though as you can see thats only part of the story even on my fathers side his grin widened a bit like you maybe ruby shrugged everybody had a story in my family and none of them could ever keep them straight my father claimed they almost named me kim toy otoole and i didnt even have freckles then you grew up deprived he tilted his head to look at the file on her desk what are you working on she had to glance down to remind herself ah suspicious drowning wife reported her husband missing three days later he turns up on the rocks under the soldiers road bridge coroner says hes pretty sure the guy didnt just happen to wash up there that someone must have pulled him out and then just left him anonymous call tipping you off where to find him ruby shook her head couple of kids found him and told their parents cant figure why someone would pull a corpse out of the river and then just leave him the killer then why pull him out at all well the wife couldnt collect on any insurance without a body for instance could be ruby made a face but i dont think she killed him i think hes a suicide and shes trying to make it seem like a murder so she doesnt lose the insurance the payout isnt much not enough to inspire murder but not a sum youd want to have to give up either pasco nodded looking thoughtful is she a hardship case why ruby asked frowning maybe she really needs it she gave a short laugh hey man who doesnt need especially if its on the verge of dropping right into your lap yeah but if shes got kids or shes gonna get evicted or something itd be too bad to take it away from her ruby leaned back in her chair and gave him a searching look are you kidding im just saying thats a whole lot of just saying about a case i only just now told you about you always get so deeply invested on such short notice he looked slightly embarrassed im not invested this is just something we do in fraudthink about all the angles try to get into the mindset of the people were investigating try to figure out where theyre coming fromare they desperate or do they feel entitled for some reason stuff like that ruby had to bite her tongue to keep from making an acid remark concerning the mass media image of criminal profiling and other extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds it wouldnt do any good pasco would only get defensive and then expend a lot of effort trying to prove she was wrong instead of just working the cases in the end hed flounder trying to adapt the job to his methods rather than the other way around abruptly she realized that she had been staring at him in silence for more than just a moment or two before she could think of some neutral comment lieutenant ostertag came in and waved them into his office i know i knowhes a geek ostertag said to ruby after he had waved pasco out of his office again hes got i dunno two three degrees maybe four hes been in fraud and cybercrime since he joined the department about five years ago ruby nodded and somebody thinks hed make a good homicide detective apparently he already is in the course of his last two cases he cleared up two murders one of which nobody even knew about at the time good for him said ruby has anyone told him that he left all the criminal masterminds back in cybercrime hes working another case right now ill let him tell you about it he got up and opened the door for her by way of declaring the meeting over then caught her arm before she could leave you ok ruby drew back slightly giving him a surprised look sure im ok why wouldnt i be ostertags mouth twitched you ok with getting this guy as a partner so soon after rita leaving she laughed a little rita retired she didnt die im not in mourning the lieutenant nodded a bit impatiently this guys pretty different than what youre used to ruby tilted her head and frowned are you asking me if id rather work with someone else ostertags face turned expressionless no what i thought ruby said goodnaturedly and went back to her desk she decided to give pasco a little while to organize his desk maybe meet a few of the other detectives and then go over to ask him about his case instead of taking over ritas old spot he had opted for the vacant desk by the blocky pillar that served as an unofficial bulletin board for lessthanofficial notices and items usually cartoons which were usually obscene it was a strange choice ruby had never seen anyone actually opt for that particular desk if there was anything else available and there were two others empty at the moment it was badly positionedyou had to sit either facing the pillar or with your back to it turn the desk sideways and it would obstruct the aisle the previous lieutenant had tried switching the desk with a set of filing cabinets but that had been no solution at all and theyd switched things back before the day was up moving the desk out altogether would have made more sense but there were no city employees anywhere who would have been so foolish as to voluntarily give up anything someone at city hall could get the wrong idea start thinking that if there was no room for a desk in your area there were probably other things you could do without as well rafe pasco obviously had no idea he had picked the lousiest spot in the room ruby thought maybe hed had a similar spot in cybercrime wherever that was headquartered spending all his time on a computer he might not have noticed or cared where he sat so you get the new guy tommy dicenzo sat down in the chair beside her desk a bottle of coke zero in one big paw he tilted it toward her offering her a sip she waved it away rafe pasco from cybercrime i heard tommy glanced over his shoulder whatd you do tell him to keep his distance didnt get a chance to she said he picked it out himself from where she was sitting she could actually see him quite well she watched as he took a shiny black laptop out of a bag and set it on the desk i see he brought his own hardware maybe he figures hell have more privacy over there no onell be able to see when hes playing solitaire tommy followed her gaze guys a geek no offence he added quickly how is jake anyway ruby laughed fine and hed take offence if you didnt call him a geek as would he i imagine she jerked her chin in pascos general direction its a different world tommy said affecting a heavy sigh then his face grew suddenly serious you ok damn ruby gave a short laugh you know youre the second person to ask me that today tommys steelygrey eyebrows arched oh must be something going around his gazed at her thoughtfully so are you ok anything bothering you the dread seemed to reawaken then it shifted inside of her by way of reasserting itself reminding her that it was there and it was in charge like what she said hoping the casually offhand tone in her voice didnt sound as forced as it felt well like rita pulling the pin she let out a long breath itll take some getting used to i keep looking around for her which is only normal i guess you werent prepared for her leaving were you it wasnt really a question no she admitted but im ok with it im sure you are tommys smile was knowing but it still took you by surprise you never thought about her retiring i was busy she said and then winced inwardly had she ever said anything lamer but you know things uh change now she had they do that tommy pushed himself to his feet its not a steadystate universe no i guess not ruby stared after him as he ambled over to introduce himself to rafe pasco wondering why his words seemed to hang in the air and echo in her brain maybe it was just having him and ostertag ask her if she were ok within a few minutes of each other that had put a whole new level of odd over the day the call came in about twenty minutes before ruby had tentatively planned to go to lunch which figured she thought as she and pasco drove to the east midtown address it had been a quiet morning any time you had a quiet morning you could just about count on having to skip lunch of course since the dread had moved in on her it hadnt left much room in her stomach not a whole lot of room in her mind eithershe missed the turn onto the right street and thanks to the alternating oneways had to drive around in a threeblock circle if pasco noticed he didnt say anything maybe she would let him drive back to the station she was a bit surprised to see that patrol cars had almost half the street blocked off even though there were very few curious onlookers and not much in the way of traffic the address in question was a sixstorey tenement that ruby had visited with rita a few times in the past is this an actual residence or a squat pasco asked her as they went up the chipped concrete steps to the front door both ruby told him she wasnt actually sure any more herself the uniform standing at the entrance was a young guy named fraley ruby thought he looked about twelve years old despite the thick moustache he was sporting he opened the door for them as if that were really what he did for a living the smell of urine in the vestibule was practically a physical blow she heard a sharp intake of breath from pasco behind her straight from the perfume counter in hell she said wryly ever wonder why its always the front of the building why they dont take a few extra seconds to run to the back marking their territory pasco suggested good answer ruby glanced over her shoulder at him impressed there was another uniformed officer in the hallway by the stairs a tall black woman named desjean whom ruby recognized as a friend of ritas sorry to tell you this she told them but your crime scenes on the roof and theres no elevator ruby nodded resigned do we know who it is desjeans dark features turned sad girl about twelve or thirteen no id ruby winced feeling acid bubbling up in her chest great sex crime dont know yet the uniform replied but well up on the roof local kid ruby asked desjean shook her head definitely not ruby looked at the stairs and then at pasco you can go first if you think you might go faster pasco blew out a short breath im a geek not a track star he frowned ostertag did tell you that didnt he uh yeah ruby said unsure as to whether he was kidding around or not before we go up one thing dont talk to you on the way he nodded the feelings mutual she felt a brief moment of warmth toward him then the dread overwhelmed it crushing it out of existence and she started up the stairs a uniformed sergeant named papoojian met them just outside the door on the roof kid with a telescope spotted the body and called it in she told them as they stood catching their breath i sent a couple of officers over to get a preliminary statement from him and his very freakedout parents kid with a telescope ruby sighed i dont know if thats an argument for closedcircuit tv surveillance or against it the sergeant looked up at the sky worriedly i wish the lab guys would hurry up and get here with a tent or were gonna have regular tv surveillance to deal with im surprised the news helicopters arent buzzing us already as if on cue there was the faint sound of a chopper in the distance immediately one of the other three uniformed cops on the roof produced a blanket and threw it over the body then turned to look a question at papoojian papoojian nodded an ok at him and turned back to ruby if the lab has a problem with that tell them to get in my face about it ruby waved a hand you got nothing to worry about no id on the body the sergeant shook her curly head except for a charm on her bracelet with the name betty engraved on it she spelled it for them theres a name you dont hear much these days ruby looked over at the blanketcovered form she was no longer panting from the long climb but for some reason she couldnt make herself walk the twenty feet over to where the body lay on the dusty gravel hey you caught that other case with the kid papoojian said suddenly the dumpster boy ruby winced inwardly at the term yeah they dumping all the murdered kid cases on you now she shrugged taking an uncomfortable breath against the dread which now seemed to be all but vibrating in her midsection was this what she had been dreading she wondered suddenlymurdered children it almost felt as if she were tearing each foot loose from slowhardening cement as she urged herself to go over and look at the victim pasco at her elbow with an attitude that seemed oddly dutiful ever see a dead kid she asked him in a low voice not like this pasco replied his tone neutral well its gruesome even when its not gruesome she said so brace yourself she crouched down next to the body and lifted the blanket the girl was lying face up her eyes halfclosed and her lips slightly parted giving her a sort of preoccupied expression she might have been in the middle of a daydream except for the pallor well i see why desjean was so sure the girl wasnt local ruby said because shes japanese he guessed well there are a few japanese in east midtown not many but i was referring to her clothes ruby shifted position trying to relieve the pressure from the way the dread was pushing on her diaphragm it crossed her mind briefly that perhaps what she thought of as the dread might actually be a physical problem thats quality stuff shes got on not designer but definitely boutique you get it in the more upscale suburban malls i have grandchildren she added in response to pascos mildly curious expression she let the blanket drop and pushed herself upright her knees cracking and popping in protest pasco gazed down at the covered body his smooth deepgold face troubled you ok ruby asked him he took a deep breath and let it out like i said kids are gruesome even when theyre not i think this is related to this case ive been working on really she hid her surprise well have to compare notes then soon he didnt answer right away looking from the blanket to her with a strange expression she wasnt sure how to read there was something defensive about it with more than a little suspicion as well sure he said finally with all the enthusiasm of someone agreeing to a root canal ruby felt a mix of irritation and curiosity which was quickly overridden by the dread she couldnt decide whether to say something reassuring or simply assert her authority and reassure him later after she knew she had his cooperation then the crime lab arrived saving her from having to think about anything from the immediate situation and the dread at the end of the day pasco managed to get away without talking about his case it was possible of course that he had not been purposely trying to elude her after spending most of the day talking to or trying to talk to the people in the building checking on the results of the doortodoor in the neighbourhood looking over the coroners shoulder and through it all pushing the dread ahead of her like a giant boulder uphill she was too tired to care she made a note about pasco in her memo book and then dragged herself home to her apartment where she glanced at an unopened can of vegetable soup before stripping off and falling into bed leaving her clothes in a heap on the floor the numbers glowing dangerred swam out of the darkness and into focus it was a moment or two before she realized that she was staring at the clockradio on the nightstand odd she never woke in the middle of the night even with the dread pressing relentlessly harder on her every day she slept too heavily to wake easily or quickly therefore something must have happened something big or close or both she held very still not even breathing listening for the sound of an intruder in the apartment in the bedroom a minute passed then another nothing maybe something had happened in the apartment next door or upstairs she thought still listening barely breathing nothing nothing and more nothing and perhaps that was all it was a whole lot of nothing it could have been a car alarm out on the street an ambulance passing close with its siren on or someones bassedout thumpmobile with the volume set on stun just because she didnt usually wake up didnt mean that she couldnt she took a long deep breath and let it out rolling onto her back there was something strange about the feel of the mattress under her and she realized that she wasnt alone in the bed automatically she rolled onto her right side rafe pascos head was resting on the other pillow he was gazing at her with an expression of deep regret shock hit her like an electric jolt she jumped back started to scream in the next moment she was staring at the empty place next to her in the bed her own strangled cry dying in her ears as daylight streamed in through the window she jumped again and scrambled out of bed looking around there was no one in the room except her no sign that anyone else had been lying in bed with her she looked at the clock still feeling shaky she knelt on the bed and reached over to touch the pillow pascos head had been resting on she could still see him vividly in her minds eye that regretful expression or maybe apologetic was more like it sorry that he had showed up in her bed uninvited hope youll forgive the intrusionit was too late to call and there wasnt time to get a warrant the pillow was cool to her touch of course because she had been dreaming she sat down on the edge of the bed one hand unconsciously pressed to her chest that had been some crazy dream her heart was only now starting to slow down from doubletime she stole a glance over her shoulder at the other side of the bed nope still nobody there not nobody not no how and most especially not rafe pasco what the hell had that been all about anyway seeing her new partner in bed with her why him of all the goddam people just because he was new not to mention young and goodlooking she hadnt thought shed been attracted to him but apparently there was a dirty old woman in her subconscious who begged to differ which now that she thought about it was kind of pathetic god or whoever please save me from that ruby muttered and stood up to stretch immediately a fresh wave of the dread washed over her almost knocking her off balance she clenched her teeth afraid for a moment that she was going to throw up then she steadied herself and stumped off to the bathroom to stand under the shower pasco was already at his desk when ruby dragged herself in she found it hard to look at him and she was glad to see that he was apparently too wrapped up in something on something on his notebook to pay attention to anything else probably the mysterious case he was working on and didnt seem to want to tell her about shouldnt have slipped and told me you thought it might be related to the one we caught yesterday she admonished him silently still not looking at him now ill have to pry it out of you later she busied herself with phone calls setting up some witness interviews putting in a call to the medical examiner about getting a preliminary report on the japanese girl and requesting information from missing persons on anyone fitting the girls description it wasnt until nearly noon that it occurred to her that he was working just as hard to avoid catching her eye as vice versa she drew in an uneasy breath and the dread seemed to breathe with her maybe he had the same dream you did suggested a tiny voice in her mind as if he had sensed something he looked up from his notebook at her she gave him a nod intending to turn away and find something else that had to be done before she could talk to him instead she surprised herself by grabbing her memo book and walking over to his desk so tell me about this case of yours she said pulling over an empty chair and plumping down in it and why you think it might have something to do with the dead girl from yesterday do we know who she is yet he asked ruby shook her head im still waiting to hear from missing persons ive also put a call into the company that makes the charm bracelet to find out who sells it in this area pasco frowned she could have bought it on the internet thanks for that she said sourly you can start with the auction sites if i come up empty he nodded a bit absently and then turned his notebook around to show her the screen the dead girl smiled out from what seemed to be a formal school photo her eyes twinkled in the bright studio lights and her lips were parted just enough to show the thin gold line of a retainer wire around her front teeth whered you get that ruby demanded incredulous its not the same girl he told her then who is ither twin cant say at this point he smiled a little this girl is alice nakamura i was investigating a case of identity theft involving her parents perps or victims to be honest im still not clear on that they could be either or even both ruby shook her head slightly i dont get it identity theft is a complex thing and its getting more complex all the time if thats supposed to be an explanation it sucks pasco dipped his head slightly in acknowledgment thats putting it mildly the nakamuras first showed up entering the country from the cayman islands actually you might say thats where they popped into existence as i couldnt find any record of them prior to that maybe they came from japan via the caymans ruby suggested the parents havehadus passports ruby gave a short laugh if theyve got passports then theyve got social security cards and birth certificates and we looked those up we this task force i was on he said a bit sheepishly it was a statelevel operation with a federal gateway here comes the jargon ruby thought willing her eyes not to film over anyway we looked up the numbers they were issued in new york as were their birth certificates there was no activity of any kind on the numbersno salary no withholding no income no benefits according to the records these people have never worked and never paid taxes call the irs tell them youve got a lead on some people whove never paid taxes thatll take care of it tried that pasco said his halfsmile faint the irs records show that everything is in order for the nakamuras unfortunately they cant seem to find any copies of their tax returns that doesnt sound like the irs i know ruby said sceptically pasco shrugged theyre looking at least thats what they tell me whenever i call i have a feeling that its not a priority for them but what about the rest of it the birth certificates you said they were issued in new york theyre not actually the original birth certificates pasco said theyre notarised copies replacing documents which have been lost some of the information is missinglike where exactly each of them was born the hospital the attending physician and except for alice the parents names ruby glanced heavenward for a moment what are they in witness protection ill let you know if i ever get a straight answer one way or another on that one pasco said chuckling a little but id bet money that they arent yeah me too ruby sat for a few moments trying to get her mind around everything he had told her none of it sounded right incomplete birth certificates even if she bought the stuff about the irs she found that completely implausible but i still dont understand everythings computerized these days which means everythings recorded nobody just pops into existence let alone a whole family its not against the law to live off the grid pasco said some people do youd be surprised at how many whatyou mean living off the land generating your own electricity shit like that ruby gave a short harsh laugh look at that photo thats not a picture of a girl whose family has been living off the grid shes got an orthodontist for chrissakes im not so sure pasco said we had the nakamuras on our radar so to speak when they entered the state however they had been covering themselves before they left the caymans whatever theyd been doing to stay invisible they werent doing it any more they left an easy trail to follow i found them in a northland hotel near the airport they were there for a week at the same time the task force was investigating some fraudulent activity elsewhere in the same area it seemed that the nakamura case was going to converge with it what was it this other activity ruby asked pasco made a face more identity theft i can run you through the long version later if you want but the short version is be careful what you do with your utility bills after you pay them and if you insist on paying them over the phone dont use a cordless phone or a mobile he paused when she nodded he went on anyway we had enough evidence for a warrant but when the police got there the house was abandoned the only thing they found was the body of alice nakamura in one of the bedrooms her birth certificate school photo library card and passport were lying next to her on the floor how did she die natural causes heart failure i forget what the conditions called but the coroner said that a lot of kids on the transplant lists have it alice nakamura wasnt on any of those there are no medical records for her anywhere in fact and it turned out that her passport was a forgery ruby blinked so much for homeland security it was an excellent forgery but a forgery nonetheless as there was no record of her ever applying for a passport let alone receiving one unlike her parents if this is some kind of conspiracy its the most random and disorganized one ive ever heard of ruby said frowning not to mention that it doesnt make any sense unless youve actually been speaking a language that only sounds like english but all the words mean something entirely different and i havent really understood a single thing youve said her words hung in the air between them for a long moment pascos face was deeply thoughtful not deeply regretful she stamped down on the memory again practically contemplative as if she had set out a significant issue that had to be addressed with care inside her the dread pushed sharply into the area just under her breastbone im sure thats how everything probably looks when you see it from the outside he said finally if you dont know a system if you dont understand how things work or what the rules are it wont make any sense the way a foreign language will sound like gibberish ruby grimaced at him but nothings that strange if you listen to a foreign language for even just a minute you start picking up some sense of the patterns in it you recognize its a system even if its one youre not familiar with oh pascos halfsmile was back ever listened to hungarian she waved a hand at him no but ive listened to cantonese and mandarin simultaneously at full volume when my grandparents argued you know what i mean for a systemor anythingto be completely incomprehensible it would have to be something totally she floundered groping for a word it would have to be something totally alien outside human experience altogether her words replayed themselves in her mind christ she said massaging her forehead what the hell are we talking about and why pasco pressed his lips together briefly you were saying that there are a lot of things about my case that dont make any sense you got that right my man she said feelingly and then let out a long sigh i suppose thats the human element at work pardon now he looked bewildered people are infinitely screwy she said human beings can make a mess out of chaos he surprised her by bursting into loud hearty laughter she twisted around in her seat to see that the whole room was staring at them curiously thanks ill be here all week she said a bit selfconsciously and turned back to pasco trying to will him to wind down fast her gaze fell on the notebook screen again hey what about her retainer she asked talking over his guffaws her what pasco said slightly breathless and still chuckling a little on her teeth ruby tapped the screen with her little finger it felt spongy were you able to trace it to a particular orthodontist she wasnt wearing a retainer and they didnt find one in the house pasco said sobering and what about her parents the nakamuras have dropped out of sight again popped out of existence i thought so at first he said either oblivious to or ignoring her tone of voice but then that girl turned up on the roof yesterday which leads me to believe they were still around up to that point anyway they might be gone by now though why you think they had something to do with the girls death not intentionally ruby shook her head intentionally unintentionallyeither way why who is she to themthe longlost twin of the girl who died of heart failure abruptly the dread gave her stomach a halftwist she swallowed hard and kept talking how long ago was that anyway when you found alice nakamura pasco hesitated his face suddenly very serious i didnt find her i mean i only pinpointed the address i wasnt there when the police entered the house the geek squad never goes along on things like that i think the other cops are afraid of geeks with guns but youre cops too exactly anyway he swivelled the notebook around and tapped the keyboard a few times that was about five and a half weeks ago almost six he looked up again does that suggest anything special to you ruby shook her head you just that the nakamuras have managed to lay pretty low for quite a while i wonder how and where ruby wanted to ask him something about that but couldnt quite figure out how to word the question and youre absolutely sure that girlalice nakamura i meandied of natural causes none whatsoever also she wasnt abused or neglected in any way before she died either she was well taken care of she just happened to be very sick uhhuh ruby nodded absently then why would they just go off and leave her if they didnt want to be foundand judging from their behaviour they didntthen they couldnt carry her dead body along with them all right that makes sense ruby said but it still leaves the question of why they dont want to be found because theyre in on this identity theft thing conspiracy whatever it is or because theyre victims of identity theft who have had to steal a new identity themselves ruby closed her eyes briefly ok now were back to not making sense again no its been known to happen pasco insisted for some people when their identity gets stolen the thief does so much damage that they find its virtually impossible to clear their name they have to start over but why steal someone elses identity to do that ruby asked why not just create an entirely new identity because the created identity would eventually trace back to the old one better to get one with completely different connections ruby shook her head obstinately you could still do that with a brand new identity pasco was shaking his own head just as obstinately the idea isnt just to steal someones identityits to steal their past too if i create a new identity i really do have to start over in every way thats pretty hard its easier if i can say build on your alreadyexcellent credit rating obviously youve never tried to steal my identity ruby said with a short humourless laugh or youd know better than to say something like that i was just giving an example ruby let out a long breath i think ill pay the coroner a visit see if theres anything he can tell me about how alice nakamuras twin died maybe itll tell us something aboutoh i dont know anything in a way that will make sense she stood up to go back to her desk hey pasco caught her wrist the contact startled her and he let go immediately what if she died of natural causes jesus you really can dream things up cant you ruby planted her fists on her hips and gave him a hard look that would be entirely too much of a coincidence natural causes said the coroners assistant reading from a clipboard her id gave her name as sheila st pierre there was a tiny hello kitty sticker under the st she was a plump woman in her midtwenties with short spiky blonde hair and bright red catseye glasses and while she wasnt chewing gum ruby kept expecting to hear it pop every time she opened her mouth aneurysm tragic in one so young you know youre sure you have the right chart ruby asked tensely unidentified oriental adolescent female brought in yesterday from a rooftop in east midtown right sheila st pierre offered ruby the clipboard see for yourself ruby scanned the form quickly several times before she was able to force herself to slow down and check each detail how can a thirteenyearold girl have a fucking aneurysm she said finally handing the clipboard back to the other woman the coroner must have screwed up where is he i want to make him do it again theres no doovers in postmortems sheila st pierre said making a face what do you think were working with here legos she shifted her weight to her right side and folded her arms hugging the clipboard to her front how about a second opinion great ruby said where can i get one right here i assisted dr levitt on this one and i saw it myself firsthand it was an aneurysm case closed you know an aneurysm is one of those things anybody can have without even knowing it you could have one or i could we just go along living our lives day in day out everythings swell and suddenlyboom your head blows up and youre history or i am or we both are most people have no idea how thin that membrane between life and death can be but then isnt it really better that way better living though denial whod want to go around in a constant state of dread ruby glared at her but she was turning away to put the clipboard down on a metal table nearby at least it isnt all bad news she said holding up a small plastic bag between two fingers there was a retainer in it we did manage to identify the girl from her dental records i didnt see that on that report ruby snapped why wasnt it on there who is she when were you going to fucking tell me sheila st pierre tossed the bag with the retainer in it back on the table which question would like me to fucking answer first ruby hesitated and then looked at the retainer where did that come from anyway i didnt see one at the scene well it was there nobody looked close enough till we got her on the table her name is betty mura whats her address ruby demanded and why didnt you call me i did call you sheila st pierre said with exaggerated patience you werent at your desk so i left a message ruby had to force herself not to lunge forward and shake the woman when was that as near as i can tell it was while you were on your way over here give me that information now ruby ordered her but she was already picking up the clipboard she slid a piece of paper out from under the form on top and handed it over thank you she prompted politely as ruby snatched it from her youre welcome ruby growled over her shoulder already out of the room there was a ticket on her windshield another skirmish in the struggle to keep the area in front of the municipal complex a strict noparking zone this means you no exceptions especially cops ruby crumpled it up and tossed it in the backseat as she slid behind the wheel she clipped betty muras home address to her visor a west side address no surprise there considering the girls clothes but what had she been doing on a roof in east midtown what had she been doing anywhere in east midtown and how had she gotten there she might have died of natural causes but there had definitely been something unusual going on in the last hours of her life she went to start the car and then paused first she should call rafe pasco tell him she had the girls name and address and she would pick him up the image of his head resting on the pillow beside her flashed in her mind irritation surged and was immediately overwhelmed by the dread in a renewed assault she had a sudden strong urge to close her eyes and let her head fall forward on the steering wheel and stay that way until the next ice age or the heat death of the universe which ever came second she took a steadying breath popped her cell phone into the cradle on the dashboard put it on speaker and dialled the squad room tommy dicenzo answered she asked him to put her through to pasco cant ruby hes not here he left whered he go she asked but as soon as the words were out of her mouth she knew the answer coroners office calledthey identified your rooftop girl from her dental records he took the name and address and left did he say anything about coming to get me first knowing that he hadnt tommy hesitated not to me but i got the impression he thought you already knew since you were on your way over to the coroners anyway shit she muttered and started the car hey you wouldnt happen to know pascos cell phone number would you i dont have it with me hang on tommy but he had already put the phone down she could hear the tanky background noise of the squad room footsteps a phone ringing and tommys voice distant and indistinct asking a question a few seconds later he picked up the phone again ok ready wait she found a pen looked around hurriedly and then held the point over the back of her other hand go he dictated the number to her carefully saying it twice thanks tommy she said disconnecting before he could say anything else she dialled the number hed given her then pulled away from the curb as it began to ring to her immense frustration it kept on ringing for what seemed like a hundred times before she finally heard the click of someone picking up rafe pasco speaking goddamit rafe why didnt you call me before im in the bahamas for two weeks his voice went on cheerfully cutting into her tirade and as you can see i didnt pack my cell phone sorry about that but you can phone my housesitter and talk to her if you want its your call there was another click followed by a mechanical female voice inviting her to leave a message after the beep ruby stabbed the disconnect button and redialled the same thing happened and she disconnected again furious was pasco playing some kind of mindgame or had he really just forgotten to change his voicemail message after his last vacation either way she was going to have a hard time not punching him weaving in and out of the traffic she headed for the freeway she was merging into traffic from the entrance ramp when all at once she found herself wondering what she was so frantic about pasco had been inconsiderate even rude but he must have figured shed get the same information from the coroner possibly he had assumed she would head over to the mura house directly from the coroner he was her partner after allwhy should she be concerned about him going to the girls house without her the dread clutched her stomach like a fist and she swerved halfway into the breakdown lane behind her a horn blared long and hard she slowed down pulling all the way into the breakdown lane to let the car pass it whizzed by a fraction of a second later the dread maintained its grip on her flooding her system and leaving no room for even a flash of fear at her close call she slowed down intending to stop but the dread wouldnt let her step on the brake what the fuck she whispered as the car rumbled along the dread seemed to have come to life in her with an intensity beyond anything she had felt in the past the maddening horrible thing about it however was that it had not tipped over into terror or panic which she realized finally was what she had been waiting for it to do she had been expecting that as a logical progressionapprehension turned to dread dread became fear but it hadnt she had never suspected it was possible to feel so much dreaddreadwithout end it shouldnt have been because it wasnt a steadystate universe so what kind of universe was it then this was it she thought suddenly this was the crackup and it was happening in fastmotion just like she had wanted the thing to do now was stop the car call tommy dicenzo and tell him she needed help then she pressed the accelerator put on her turn signal and checked the rearview mirror as she moved back into the travel lane the wellgroomed west side houses slid through the frame of the car windows as ruby navigated the wide clean streets she didnt know the west side quite as well as the rest of the city and the layout was looser than the strict organized northland grid or the logical progressions of midtown and the south side developers and contractors had staked out patches of the former meadowlands and put up subdivisions with names like saddle hills and wildflower dale and filled them with splitlevel ranches for the young middleclass and cookiecutter mansions for the newly affluent ruby had taken small notice of any of it during the years jake had been growing up there was no appeal to the idea of moving to the west side from downtownit would have meant two hours of sheer commuting every day time she preferred to spend with her son the downtown school district had not been cutting edge but it hadnt been anywhere near disastrous either she gave her head a quick shake to clear it get a grip she ordered herself and tightened her hands on the steering wheel as if that would help she checked the address clipped to her visor again then paused at the end of the street craning her neck to read the road sign it would solve a lot of problems she thought if the cheapass city would just put gps navigation in all the goddam cars she turned right onto the cross street and then wondered if she had made a mistake had she already driven along this street the houses looked familiar well of course they looked familiar she realized irritatedthey were all alike she kept going watching the street signs carefully christ it wasnt only the houses themselves that were all alikeit was also the cars in the driveways the front lawns even the toys scattered on the grass the same but not the same like alice nakamura and betty mura she came to another intersection and paused again almost driving on before she realized that the street on her left was the one she wanted the dread renewed its intensity as she made the turn barely noticing the woman pushing a double stroller with two toddlers in it both the woman and her children watched her pass with alert curiosity on their unremarkable faces they were the only people ruby had seen out walking but the dread left no room for her to register as much the mura house was not a cookiecutter mansionmore like a cookiecutter update of the kind of big old victorian jake and lita lived in with the kids ruby pulled up at the curb instead of parking in the driveway where a shiny black suv was blocked in by a notsoshiny car that she knew had to belong to rafe pasco ruby sat staring at the front of the house it felt as if the dread were writhing inside her now the last thing she wanted to do was go inside or rather it should have been the last thing she wanted to do the dread alive everywhere in her all the way to her fingertips to the soles of her feet threatened to become even worse if she didnt moving slowly and carefully she got out of the car and walked up the driveway pausing at pascos car to look in the open drivers side window the interior was impossibly clean for a cop or a geekno papers no old sandwich wrappers or empty drink cups hell even the floormats were clean as if they had just been vacuumed nothing in the backseat either except more clean she glanced over at the glove box then her gaze fell on the trunk release if she popped it what would she find in there she wondereda portable carcleaning kit with a hand vac a carton of secret geek files or just more clean nothing there would be nothing in the trunk all the secret geek files would be on pascos notebook and he probably had that with him she considered popping the trunk anyway and then moved away from the car stopping again to look inside the suv the windows were open and the doors were unlockedapparently the muras trusted their neighbours and the people who came to visit them even the alarm was off there was a hardshell cd case sitting on the passenger seat and a thin crescent of disk protruding from the slot of the player in the dash a small string of tiny pink and yellow beads dangled from the rearview mirror along with a miniature pair of fuzzy hotpink dice ruby wondered if betty mura had put them there she turned toward the front door and then thought better of it instead she made her way around the side of the garage and into the unfenced back yard again she stopped the yard was empty except for a swingset and a brightly painted jungle gym behind the swings was a cement patio with a couple of loungers under one of them was an empty plastic glass lying on its side forgotten and probably considered lost the sliding glass patio doors were open ruby realized suddenly although the screen door was closed and the curtains were drawn she edged her way along the rear of the garage and sidled up next to the open door less pleading your case with me she heard pasco saying both girls are dead it ends here but the other girls a man started there are no other girls pasco told him firmly not for you they arent your daughters ruby frowned daughters so the girls really had been twins but they are protested a woman you cant think that way pasco said once theres been a divergence those livesyour own your childrens everyonesare lost to you to act as if it were otherwise is the same as if you went next door to your neighbours house and took over everything they owned including their children i told you we didnt come here to kidnap betty the man said patiently i saw her recordsthe man showed me he told us about her aneurysm he said it was almost a sure thing that it would kill her before alices heart gave out then we could get her heart for transplant knowing that it would be a perfect match for alice you heartless bastard said a second male voice identical to the one that had been speaking how many people were in that room ruby wondered she was going to die anyway said the first man there was nothing anyone could do about it the hell there wasnt if we had known we could have taken her to a hospital for emergency surgery a woman said angrily they can fix those things now you know or arent they as advanced where you come from it doesnt matter any more pasco said raising his voice to talk over them because alice died first after all yes said the woman bitterly speaking through tears it sounded like the same woman who had been talking so angrily a few moments before but ruby had a feeling it wasnt and do you know why that is pasco asked in a stern almost paternal tone of voice the man was wrong said the tearful woman or he lied said the angry one no it was because you came here and you brought alice with you pasco said once you did that all bets as they say here were off the moment you came in it threw everything out of kilter because you dont belong here youre extrasurplus one too many times three it interrupted the normal flow of progress things scattered with such force that there were even naturallaw anomalies this morning a very interesting woman said to me human beings can make a mess out of chaos i couldnt tell her how extraordinarily right she was of course so i couldnt stop laughing she must have thought i was crazy ruby pressed her lips together thinking that he couldnt be any crazier than she was herself right now it was just that she was a lot more confused abruptly she heard the sound of the front door opening followed by new voices as a few more people entered the house this was turning into quite a party too bad pasco had left her off the guest list finally she heard him saying i was about to call you again find out what happened to you these west side streets are confusing a woman answered this was a completely new voice but ruby found it strangely familiar its not a nice neat grid like northland you know complain all you want later pasco said i want to wrap this up as soon as possible i dont know about that said another man have you looked out front pasco groaned what now theres a car parked at the curb right in front of the house the man said i dont think thats a coincidence oh hell pasco said she heard his footsteps thumping hurriedly away from the patio doorprobably going to look out the window at the carand then coming back again she straightened her shoulders and refusing to give herself time to think about it she yanked open the screen door and stepped into the house flinging aside the curtain im right h her voice died in her throat and she could only stand frozen in place one hand still clutching the edge of the curtain while she stared at rafe pasco and a man who seemed to be his older much taller brother and two identical japanese couples sitting side by side on a long sofa with their hands cuffed in front of them and standing behind the couch her newly retired expartner rita castillo now dont panic pasco said after what might have been ten minutes or ten months im not panicking ruby managed in a hoarse voice she drew a long shaky breath inside her the dread was no longer vibrating or writing or swelling it had finally reached full power this was what she had been dreading all this time day after day except now that she was finally face to face with it she had no idea what it actually was i can assure you that youre not in any danger pasco added i know she said faintly no you dont ok ruby said obviously he was in charge so she would defer willingly without protest the sensation youre feeling right now has nothing to do with your actual safety pasco went on speaking carefully and distinctly as if he were trying to talk her down from a high ledge or maybe a bad acid trip was more like it she thought glancing at the japanese couples the muras and the nakamuras apparently she wondered which was which what it actually is is a kind of allergic reaction oh she looked around the room everyone else seemed to understand what he was talking about including the japanese couples what am i allergic to its something in the nature of a disturbance oh god no she thought now hes going to say something about the force ill find out theyre all actually a lunatic cult and pascos the leader and im trapped in a house with them her gaze drifted over to rita no rita would never have let herself get sucked into anything like that would she rita shifted becoming slightly uncomfortable under rubys gaze do i know you she asked finally rubys jaw dropped she felt as if rita had slapped her no you dont pasco said over his shoulder she knows someone like you where you come from the two of you never met here you were partners wow rita said shaking her head it never ceases to amaze me all that whatmighthavebeen stuff she smiled at ruby giving an apologetic shrug and where does she come from ruby wanted to know her voice was a little stronger now that doesnt matter pasco told her besides the less you know the better youll feel really she made a sceptical face no he said resigned actually youll feel not quite so bad not quite so much dread it may not be much but any relief is welcome isnt it he took a small step toward her and youve been feeling very bad for a while now havent you though it wasnt quite so awful in the beginning ruby didnt say anything only youre not sure exactly when it started pasco continued moving a little closer ruby wondered why he was being so cautious with her was he afraid of what she might do i can tell you it started when the nakamuras arrived here ostensibly from the cayman islands when they stepped out of their own world and into this one into yours ruby took a deep breath and let it out willing herself to be less tense she looked around spotted an easy chair opposite the couch and leaned on the back of it all right she said to pasco who are you and what the hell are you talking about pasco hesitated im a cop no ruby said with exaggerated patience im a cop try again its the truth pasco insisted i really am a cop of sorts what sort ruby asked geek squad not homicide he hesitated again crimes against persons and property this includes identity theft which is not a geek squad job in my line of law enforcement ruby wanted to sit down more than anything in the world now but she forced herself to stay on her feet to make pasco look at her on the same level as an equal go on its my job to make sure that people who regret what mightve been dont get so carried away that they try to do something unlawful to try to rectify it even if that means preventing a young girl from getting the heart transplant that will save her life ruby looked over at the people sitting handcuffed on the sofa they all looked miserable and angry an unscrupulous provider of illegal goods and services convinced a couple of vulnerable parents that they could save their daughters life if they went to a place where two other parents very similar to themselves were living a life in which things had gone a bit differently where their daughter who was named betty instead of alice had an undetected aneurysm instead of a heart condition light began to dawn for ruby her mind returned to the idea of being trapped in a house with a bunch of lunatic cultists then she looked at rita where you come from the two of you never met many of my cases are much simpler pasco went on people who want to win instead of losea hand of cards a race the lottery who think theyd have been better off if theyd turned left instead of right said yes instead of no he spread his hands but we cant let them do that of course we cant let them take something from its rightful owner and by we you mean ruby waited he didnt answer all right then lets try this you cant possibly be the same kind of cop i am im local equally subject to the laws that i enforce but youre not are you i wouldnt say that exactly pasco replied i have to obey those laws but in order to enforce them i have to live outside the system they apply to she looked at rita again or rather the woman she had thought was rita and whats your story he said youre from a place where we never met does your being here with him mean you dont live there any more notrita nodded someone stole my identity and i couldnt get it back things didnt end well and all you could do was become a sort of a cop ruby asked we have to go said pascos taller brother before the woman could answer he could have been an alternative version of pasco ruby thought from a place where she hadnt met him either would that be the same place that notrita came from she decided she didnt want to know and hoped none of them would feel compelled to tell her weve still got time pasco said looking at his watch which seemed to be a very complicated device but theres no good in pushing things right down to the wire take them out through the garage and put them in the suv where are you taking them ruby asked as taller pasco and notrita got the japanese couples on their feet pasco looked surprised by the question it was a moment or two before he could answer to court a kind of court ah ruby said would that be for an arraignment a sort of arraignment he nodded and ruby knew he was lying she had no idea how she knew but she did just as she knew it was the first time he had ever lied to her she let it go watching as the other two herded the japanese couples toward the kitchen wait she said suddenly everyone stopped turning to look at her which ones are the nakamuras judging from the group reaction she had definitely asked the wrong question even the couples looked dismayed as if she had threatened them in some fashion does it matter pasco said after a long moment no i guess not and it didnt not to her or anyone else she realized not now not ever again when you got caught in this kind of identity theft you probably had to give identity up completely exactly what that meant she had no idea but she knew it couldnt have been very pleasant pasco nodded and the other two escorted the couples out of the room a few moments later ruby heard the kitchen door leading to the garage open and close how did you know the nakamuras would come here ruby asked pasco i didnt just dumb luckthey were here when i arrived so i took them all into custody and they didnt resist or try to get away theres nowhere for them to go the nakamuras cant survive indefinitely here unless they could somehow replace the muras then why did you arrest the muras they were going to let the nakamuras supplant them while they moved on to a place where their daughter hadnt died the permutations began to pile up in rubys brain she squeezed her eyes shut for a moment cutting off the train of thought before it made her dizzy all right she said but what about this master criminal who convinced the nakamuras to do all this in the first place how could heshewhatever know about betty muras aneurysm pascos face became thoughtful again and she could practically see his mind working at choosing the right words outside the system there is access to certain kinds of information about the elements within it features are visible outside that cant be discerned inside unfortunately making that information available inside never goes well its like poison things begin to malfunction is that really why alice nakamura died before the other girl ruby asked it was an extra contributing factor but it also had to do with the nakamuras being in a world where they didnt belong as i said pasco crossed the room to close the patio door and lock it what i was referring to were certain anomalies of time and space ruby shook her head not understanding its how betty mura ended up on a rooftop in midtown he clarified she just went there from wherever she had been at the time undoubtedly the shock blew out the weakness in her brain and killed her jesus ruby muttered under her breath dont think ill be including that in my report abruptly the memory of rafe pasco lying in bed with her his head resting on the pillow and looking at her with profound regret lit up in her mind so sorry to have dropped in from nowhere without calling first not a dream he might tell her if she asked him but she wasnt sure that was an answer she really wanted thats all right pasco said i will slightly different case of course and the report will go elsewhere of course rubys knees were aching she finally gave up and sat down on the edge of the chair should i assume that all the information you showed me about the nakamuraspassports the irs all thatwas fabricated i adapted it from their existing records alices passport worried me though its not exactly a forgerythey brought it with them and i have no idea why they left it or any other identifying materials behind you dont have kids do you ruby said amused in spite of everything no i dont he said mildly surprised if you did youd know why they couldnt just leave her to go nameless into an unmarked grave pasco nodded the human factor outside a horn honked its time to go or do you want to stay here ruby stood up looking around whats going to happen to this place and all the other things in the muras lives we have ways of papering over the cracks and stains so to speak he told her their daughter was just found dead if they dont come back here for a while and then decide not to come back at all i dont think anyone will find that terribly strange but their families theres a lot to take care of pasco said talking over her even if i had the time to cover every detail for you i would not it comes dangerously close to providing information that doesnt belong here i could harm the system im sure ive told you too much as it is what are you going to do she asked take me to court too only if you do something you shouldnt he ushered her through the house to the front door ok but just tell me this then she put her hand on the doorknob before he could what are you going to do when the real rafe pasco comes back from the bahamas he stared at her in utter bewilderment what that is what you did isnt it waited for him to go on vacation and then borrowed his identity so you could work on this case when he still looked blank she told him about listening to the message on his cell phone ah that he said laughing a little no i am the real rafe pasco i forgot to change my voicemail message after i came back from vacation then i decided to leave it that way just as a joke it confuses the nuisance callers it figured ruby thought she opened the door and stepped outside pasco following behind his car was a small white van the print on the side claimed that it belonged to fivestar electrical services rewiring specialists which ruby thought also figured notrita was sitting in the drivers seat drumming her fingers on the steering wheel the tall guy was sitting in the suv so thats it ruby said watching pasco lock the front door you close down your case and i just go home now knowing everything that i know and thats all right with you shouldnt i trust you he asked her should i trust you she countered how do i know im not going to get a service call from an electrician and end up with all new wiring too i told you he said patiently only if you use any of what you know to engage in something illegal and you wont what makes you so goddam sure about that she demanded forehead creasing with concern pasco looked into her face she was about to say something else when something happened all at once her mind opened up and she found that she was looking at an enormous panoramaall the lost possibilities the missed opportunities the bad calls a lifetime of uncorrected mistakes missteps and fumbles all those things were a single big pictureperhaps the proverbial big picture the proverbial forest you sometimes couldnt see for the proverbial trees but she was seeing it now and seeing it all at once it was too much she would never be able to recall it as an image to look at it again in the future concentrating she struggled to focus on portions of it instead jakes father going back to his wife unaware that she was pregnantshe had always been sure that had been no mistake but now she knew there was a world where he had known and stayed with her and one where he had known and left anyway jake growing up interested in music not computers getting mixed up with drugs with ricky carstairs helping ricky carstairs straighten out coming out to her at sixteen and introducing his boyfriend marrying his college sweetheart instead of lita adopting children with his husband dennis getting the rhodes scholarship instead of someone else moving to california instead of boston the mammogram and the biopsy results the tests left too late wounding the suspect in the martinez case instead of killing him missing her shot and taking a bullet instead while someone else killed him having the decision by the shooting board go against her retiring after twenty years instead of staying on getting fed up and quitting after ten going to night school to finish her degree jury verdicts convictions instead of acquittals and vice versa catching darren hightower after the first victim instead of after the seventh or going into a different line of work altogether or finding out about all of this before now long before now when she was still young and full of energy looking for an edge and glad to find it convincing herself that she was using it not for her own personal gain but as a force for good something that would save lives literally and figuratively expose the corrupt and reward the good and the worthy one person could make a differencewasnt that what everyone always said the possibilities could stretch so far beyond herself government with a conscience instead of agendas schools and hospitals instead of wars no riots no assassinations no terror no lee harvey oswald no james earl ray no sirhan sirhan no and maybe even no nineyearold boy found naked and dead in a dumpster abruptly she found herself leaning heavily against the side of the mura house straining to keep from falling down while the dread tried to turn her inside out rafe pasco cleared his throat how do you feel she looked at him miserable thats what makes me so certain he went on your uh allergic reaction if theres any sort of disruption here no matter how large or small youll feel it and it wont feel good and if you tried to do something yourself he made a small gesture at her well you see what happened when you only thought about it great she said shakily what do i do now spend the rest of my life trying not to think impure thoughts pascos expression turned sheepish thats not what i meant you feel this way because of the current circumstances once the alien elements have been removed from your world he glanced at the suv youll start to feel better the bad feeling will fade away and how long is that going to take she asked him youll be all right thats no answer i think ive given you enough answers already he started for his car and she caught his arm just one more thing she said really just one pasco looked as if he were deciding whether to shake her off or not what he said finally this socalled allergic reaction of mine is there any reason for it or is it just one of those things like hayfever or some kind of weakness some kind of weakness pasco chuckled without humour sometimes when theres been a divergence in ones own line theres a certainsensitivity ruby nodded with resignation is that another way of saying that youve given me enough answers already pasco hesitated all those couldhavebeens those mighthavedones and ifiknewthens you were thinking the words were out of her mouth before she even knew what she was going to say they all happened i know you wont do anything he said lowering his voice and leaning toward her slightly because you have and the conscience that bothers you still bothers you even at long distance even in the hypothetical ruby made a face my guilty conscience is that really what it is i dont know how else to put it well she took a breath feeling a little bit steadier i guess thatll teach me to screw around with the way things should be pasco frowned impatiently its not should or shouldnt its just what is with no second chances with second chances third chances hundredth chances millionth chances pasco corrected her all the chances you want but not a second chance to have a first chance ruby didnt say anything this is what poisons the system and makes everything go wrong you live within the system within the mechanism its not meant to be used or manipulated by an individual to be taken personally its a system a process its nothing personal hey i thought it was time to go the man in the suv called impatiently pasco waved at him and then turned to ruby again ill see you tomorrow you will she said surprised but he was already getting into his car and she had no idea whether he had heard her or not and he had given her enough answers already anyway she thought watching all three vehicles drive away he had given her enough answers already and he would see her tomorrow and how would that go she wondered now that she knew what she knew how would it be working with him would the dread really fade away if she saw him every day knowing and remembering would she be living the rest of her life or was she just stuck with it pasco had given her enough answers already and there was no one else to ask ruby walked across the muras front lawn to her car thinking that it felt as if the dread had already begun to lift a little that was something at least her guilty conscience she gave a small humourless laugh now that was something she had never suspected would creep up on her time marched on and one day you woke up to find you were a somewhat dumpy greying middleaged homicide detective with twentyfive years on the job and a hefty lump of guilty conscience and regret and if you wanted to know why to understand well that was just too bad because you had already been given too many answers already nothing personal she started the car and drove away from the empty house through the meandering streets and did no better finding her way out of the west side than she had finding her way in the rose wall joyce carol oates is the author of a number of works of fiction including most recently the novel mudwoman eccoharpercollins and the story collection the corn maiden and other stories grove atlantic she is a recipient of the presidents medal for the humanities and is a member of the american academy of arts and letters throughout the protracted summers of my childhood and well into autumn frequently as late as november the wall at the base of our garden bloomed with climber roses the bushes were luxuriantthey were carefully tendedand grew to a height of nine or ten feet there were clusters of red roses bright as drops of blood there were small rather anemic pink roses that grew across the archway over the garden gate there were rich yellow rosesmy favoritethat glowed with light on even overcast or mistshrouded days the rose wall i called itthat section of the wall the rose wall which was so beautiful the wall itself the real wall was made of granite it surrounded our house and grounds on all sidesan enormous rectanglesturdy and functional and rather ugly except at the base of the garden where the roses bloomed most days i never noticed the wall none of the children noticed the wall you couldnt see it because it was always there there was nothing to see or think about everything was in its place and never changed at the foot of the long gravel drive there was an enormous gate made of oak and iron which was kept bolted most of the time so that the gate too was part of the wall and invisible one day i asked our nursemaid why there were sharp thingsspikesgrowing out of the top of the wall without troubling to look toward the wall she told me that they had always been there yes but whyi asked she did not reply why i asked annoyed with herour female servants were usually sullen and slow and not very brighti pulled at her arm and made her look at the wall at the spikes why are they there i asked but her gaze was stubbornly averted her reply was so low i could not hear ask them yourself i seemed to have heard ask someone else she must have said when my mother came to kiss me goodnight that night after my bath i asked her about the sharp things and she looked startled sharp things she said what sharp things what do you mean in all our city my father said only a halfdozen houses were so grand as ours and all were in our hilly district behind high walls of stone or brick or granite from our playroom on the third floor we could see the city sloping away belowchimneys orangetiled roofs church spires the tower and cross of the great cathedral and the blueglittering surface of the aussenalster how lovely on exceptionally clear days when the mist burned off by midmorning we could even see the highest towers of the old castle many miles to the north sometimes it looked like an ordinary stone building faint and nearcolorless with distance at other times it looked glowering and iridescent like a reflection quivering in water how lovely visitors to the playroom would exclaim leaning on the windowsill and breathing deeply the fragrant air that arose from the garden below oh yes my mother or grandmother or one of my aunts would say laughing oh yes certainlyfrom here in my childhood there were many servants no one could keep their names straight it didnt matterthey came and went speaking their strange dialects nursemaids and cooks and handymen and gardeners and drivers and maids and washerwomen some lived inside the wall with us in the servants wing others came by way of a rear gate and entered the house by way of the kitchen what a gabble we children heard if we eavesdropped most of the servants were peasants difficult to trainand difficult to trust they lied they stole they sabotaged things they disappeared and my father was forced to send the police after them to have them arrested where do they come from we children asked and the reply was always the same from out there one of the adults would make a careless gesture of the hand indicating the city or the countryside in the distancethe world beyond the wall where do they come from oh from out there where elseout there why are they so stupid we asked why do they talk funny they cant help it its the way they are we were told out there its the way people are tutors came as well more refined men and women a piano instructor who played the piano so beautifully that tears flooded my eyes a riding master with long curly moustaches though we were driven to mass at the cathedral two or three times a week the priest frequently came to visit us and the archbishop who had been a friend of my grandfathers and messengers and special deliverymen bringing pastries and great baskets of fruit and wonderful chocolates of all kinds from my parents favorite shops in town you must never forget how fortunate you are everyone said you must never forget how god has blessed you kneeling at prayer in the drafty cathedral or at the side of my bed dear god thank you for the blessings you have bestowed upon me dear god thank you thank you but my mind slipped away grew bored and slipped away tiresome old god he was another of the adults older than grandmother spying at us from doorways god loves you god has blessed you an old servantwoman told me one day with a queer peevish smile she was looking directly at me as if she were seeing mewhich was not the way anyone in our house looked at us children i made an impatient gesture or murmured something in embarrassment i would have slipped away but she showed me a heartshaped locket she wore around her scrawny neck which contained the photograph of a young girl with dark braided hair thick straight dark eyebrows and a defiant upper lip god has blessed you the old woman said what did i care about an ugly girl in a locket around an old womans neck i held my breath when servants stood too close another time one of the laundresses a large soft woman with carrotred hair and teeth missing in her lower jaw began to talk with me in a queer harsh dialect i was prowling the house i had wandered into the kitchen hallway in order to eavesdrop but i did not want to talk with anyone they have hurt little girls like you the woman said little girls prettier than you she said giving off a yeasty beery odor actually touching my arm to detain me your people soldiers young soldiers from this town i should have pushed rudely away and escaped but for some reason i stood there unable to move the womans cheeks and forehead were flushed as if windburnt there were two teeth missing in her lower jaw and the rest of her teeth were badly stained her hands too were reddenedthe skin stretched across the oversized knuckles was scraped raw sniffing halfsobbing she told me an angry incoherent story of an elevenyearold girl her family lying dead amid rubble soldiers marching by on a road in the mud her dialect was so throaty and harsh i could not understand most of the words stop i dont want to hear i hate you you stink i wanted to say but i stood paralyzed while she continued repeating herself mumbling wiping her nose on the back of her clumsy hand soldiers discovered the girl soldiers were laughing and excited they did things to her and afterward pushed her back down in the rubble in what had been the cellar she was bleeding some of her teeth had been knocked out i wasnt afraid but i started to cry i hated the woman and didnt believe her and couldnt understand most of her words but i started to cry so she was frightened and let me go and i ran and ran and hid in my mothers bedroom and i never saw that woman againshe must have been dismissed a tall softbodied woman with red hair a watery gaze a mouth that looked as if it were lewdly smiling my father was a very tall broadshouldered man with sandy whiskers and clear pale eyes my mother was a pretty nervous woman who wore her hairbut what color was her hairin heavy coils around her head my father wore dark colors and dazzling white shirts my mother wore dresses of all colors and all materials the dressmaker was always at our house often she and her two assistants stayed for a week at a time my father seemed vaguely embarrassed and impatient in my mothers presence but then they were not together often though of course they shared the same bedroom but during the day in daytime they were not often together it was my father who told me that i was forbidden to go outside the wall except of course when i was in the company of others driven in one of our cars the entire family went out to church naturally and we often went visiting in the homes of families nearby but there was no need for any of us children to leave the grounds because we had everything we wanted thereponies pets a beautiful dark pond in which carp lived a pretty wooden swing freshly painted white my mother said nothing about the wall my mother did not see it and anyway the garden gatethe gate at the rear of the gardenwas always kept locked exceptnot always whenever i played in the garden whenever i could slip away from the others i would try the doorknob of the gate because the climber roses grew so profusely here i had to be careful of thorns sometimes thin tendrils brushed against my face as if caressing me the gate was locked the gate was always locked except one afternoon when i turned the handle hardso hard my fingers hurtthe gate came open i could not believe it but it was true the gate had not been locked after all or perhaps the lock had broken under the strain the iron fixtures on the gate were rusted and moss grew so thickly underfoot i had to wrench the gate open with all my strength but it did come open it did stand open and i slipped through and was no one watching neither of my sisters or my grandmother or the freckled silent girl from the country who was supposed to watch closely over me i did not worry that my mother would see she had better things to do than spy on her children so i slipped through the gate and found myself on a cobblestone street of course it was familiarit was the street that bordered our property on one sidei had been driven along it hundreds of timesbut for some reason it looked unfamiliar the slanted lighting perhaps it was late afternoon the startling noise of the traffic new odors i could not define it looked unfamiliar but i wasnt in the least afraid did i hear a voice behind mescolding and alarmed i pulled the gate shut giggling and ran out into the street and ran and ran i had never been on foot before outside our wall but i wasnt in the least afraid the traffic was heavy automobiles delivery vans even several horsedrawn carriages what a rumble of wheels what a commotion i tasted grit my eyes smarted beside me the wall was high and blank nothing grew on it on this side or was it our wall nowi had been running downhilli might have left our wall behindbut it didnt matter because i would have no difficulty making my way back thoughto be truthfuli did not really think about it then in those first elated minutes making my way back i ran breathless and giggling glancing back over my shoulder to see if they were following and it seemed to me that i had never really run before in my life with such gaiety with such surprising strength in my legs and feet no one could catch menot even my father or one of my brothers i was running downhill the cobblestone street on my right the high rough featureless wall on my left and my beating heart and even the noisy turbulence of the street and its odors delighted me to run and run and runwhat a prank what an adventure several times i heard voices behind me shouts pleas but i never stopped running and when i paused out of breath panting at a busy intersection where five streets ran togetherwhere the wall at last had disappearedthere was no one behind me i wiped my sweaty face and peered up the hill which was a very steep hill and saw no one my heart leapt with mischievous delighti had slipped through the rose wall and escaped my pursuers and now i would explore the city on foot i would do exactly as i wanted for the rest of the day no one followed no one appeared suddenly beside me to seize my arm and give me a good scolding and take me immediately back home for some time i walked wherever my fancy led me still in high spirits if passersby noticed me and remarked upon mefor i was very small to be unaccompaniedi ignored them and hurried past i began to tire but the elation of my escape stayed with me how large and noisy the city was and how fascinatingwhat a clamor beefyfaced men and women of a kind i had never seen before speaking in a strange guttural accent shabby carriages and vans driven recklessly by men not in uniform a narrow makeshift bridge over a canal where i stood leaning against the railing for a halfhour resting and watching the boatsmainly bargesthat passed beneath rocking on the oily waves the afternoon began to darken i glanced around thinking that someone from the house might be approaching but i saw only traffic which passed by in a continual stream and strangers who gave me no notice i headed in the direction of our house but found myself in a park i had never seen before at the edge of a refuselittered lagoon a few people stood tossing chunks of bread at a lazy group of geese and swans the birds feathers particularly their breast feathers were soiled with what looked like grease but they were large handsome birds i stood staring at them for a while my eyelids grew heavy a pair of geese paddled my way curiously then saw that i had nothing for them and turned indifferently aside my mouth watered at the sight of bread in the water bobbing on the surface dipping and rising a black swan snaked its head down to jab at a piece of bread with his salmonpink bill and i felt an absurd pang of hunger i left the park and began to climb the long cobblestone hill which was much steeper than i remembered my mouth was dry with dust my eyes stung it was nearly sundown lurid orange clouds like torn fabric lay across the sun and gave an eerie dreamlike cast to the cobblestones and the facades of buildings i had never seen this district before but an instinct led me dully on a bad girl a naughty girl very bad very wicked you will have to be punished all day tomorrowyou will have to stay in your room nono teacakes no chocolates no you will have to stay in your room my pale tearyeyed mother stammering at me my tall unsmiling father not condescending even to touch me but perhaps grandmother would relent and take me in her arms in the doorway the freckled girl in her white uniform her eyes smudged with tears for surely she would be dismissedshe pushed me out of the garden and shut the gate on me i would cry she did it it was her fault the wind rose from the aussenalster as it often did at dusk and tiny goosebumps prickled on my bare arms and legs the cobblestone hill had no end carriages rattled past horses hooves rang on the street now and then a face in a window peered at me but without recognition or interest i was walking alongside a wall now but i could not determine if it was our wall it might have been ten or fifteen feet highi could not judgeand it was so roughtextured so blankno roses showednot even a stray branch or tendril overhead where is our wall where is our housewhere is the gate that leads into the garden i began to sob with weariness and fear running my hand along the wall was the wall made of graniteor another kind of stone i could not see a gate or a door of any kind not even the enormous gate at the end of the driveway i was very hungry my pulses throbbed with fear you are a very very naughty girl weve been watching you your punishment will be to go without supperto spend the night alone outside the wall i climbed the hill sobbing running my fingers along the wall until they began to bleed where were they hiding why didnt they call out my name just at dusk i came upon an entranceway of some kinda door made of solid wood painted black and now slightly peeling set into the wall as if into a hill it did not look familiar but i began to knock at it and then to pound fist over fist sobbing let me in let me in i hate you i wont be bad again let me in i pounded at the door until my fists were numb with pain i kicked at it sobbing and screaming but of course no one answeredno one heard let me in i want my supper i want to go to bed i hate you i hate you i hope you die let me in let me in so i screamed and screamed until i was exhausted and sank down on the pavement and must have fallen asleep because when i came to my senses again it was dark and quite chilly i got to my feet shakily nothing had changed the high black door was before me the wall on either side blank and featureless and faint with light reflected light from the sky i saw now that this doorit was a garage or stable doordid not belong to my family and in any case it was pointless for me to hammer on it it was pointless for me to stay here i would have to go somewhere else i would have to explain that i was lost and ask someone to take me home all this came to me with a peculiar chilling clarity and i did not cry because i had exhausted my tears many years have passed since that night i might almost saymany lifetimes i have cried a great deal though never with anger or passion for such emotion one soon learns outside the rose wall is quite pointless my childhood is now distant and cannot hurt i see that child that wretched little girl as if through a distorting glass or the wrong end of a telescope please can you help me please can you take me home she begs of passersby please im lost i cant find my house they draw away annoyed there are so many beggars in the square in the streets near the cathedral and the great hotels even children very small children unaccompanied by adults please can you help me can you take me home sometimes a man or a woman or a strolling couple would stop to listen but for some reason they could not understand me they stooped to hear they peered frowning into my face but they could not understand what i was saying im sorry im sorry for being bad i cried i wont do it again i want my supper and my bath i want my momma i wont do it again they queried me they shook their heads impatiently what on earth was i saying their own dialects were strange harsh and guttural or high sharp and sibilant i could recognize only a few words tumbling over one another like pebbles in a stream in the end they shook their heads impatiently or pityingly sometimes with an amused smile glancing behind me to see ifin a doorway or around a corneran older beggar was hiding i walked on jostled by the crowd i had lost track of all time hours might have passed or an entire day or several days i ate by snatching bread away from the mourning doves and pigeons who were fed quite generously in the cathedral square i drank from the magnificent roman fountain in the royal park ladies took pity on me and tossed tinselwrapped chocolates in my direction soldiers in uniform some of them hardly older than my brother tossed pennies at me and chuckled as i scrambled after them across the cobblestones what a quick frisky little thing is it a little girl eh a little girl so bold i wandered along the canals at the heart of the city where the costly shops are located beneath stone arcades to protect shoppers from the rain clothing shops gold shops shops selling jewelry antiques china linen stationery ladies hats ladies shoes the very best pastries and chocolates and fruit the season must have changed overnight for now everyone wore coats and carried umbrellas against the chill slanting rain a gentleman resembling my father was walking some distance ahead of me carrying his ebonytopped cane he was with one of my uncles a whitehaired uncle with a sly teasing wink whom all the children loved both strode along the damp pavement and did not hesitate for a moment when i called after them pappa pappa wait pappa i ran close behind them but they did not slacken their pace i was certain they heard me but they gave no sign pappa please waitpappaim sorry my tall broadshouldered impatient father in a dark topcoat soft gray gloves gleaming leather boots his imperial profile his sandy full moustache and beard my uncle who adored whipped cream in his coffee and teased us in the playroom by poking his head through the doorway and clapping his hands loudly pappa uncle wait at last my father turned toward me and i saw that it was indeed my father but he showed no recognition his eyebrows arched quizzically his thinlipped mouth stretched in a grimace yes what who is it i pulled at the sleeve of his topcoat tried to take hold of his cane i want to go home now pappa i said whining im sorry for what i did it wasnt my fault the gate locked behind mei want momma my father drew back staring his nostrils were pinched as if he were in the presence of an abominable odor pappa please i screamed clutching at his knees he pushed me aside stepped adroitly away and with a brisk gesture tossed a coin in my direction it struck my chest lightly and rolled across the cobblestones instinctively i scrambled after it if the coin should drop into a drain or be snatched up by another beggar but i got it my fingers closed greedily over it and when i looked up my father and uncle were just getting into a horsedrawn cab pappa i cried angrily on my hands and knees pappa i screamed dont you know who i amdont you love me anymore wait but they did not hear they climbed into the cab closed the door behind themselves and the cab rolled smartly away dont you love me anymoredont you love me but i got the coin the gold coin for it was a gold coin and not a mere penny and with it i went into the closest chocolate shop and sat at one of the pretty little wroughtiron tables and ordered a plate of small cherrytopped cakes and a cup of hot chocolate in a voice nearly as composed as that of my mother or grandmother i was faint with hunger saliva flooded my mouth my heart still beat painfully with the anger of my fathers betrayal but when the waitress brought my order i was not even ashamed of my filthy trembling hands nor did i blush when she stared in unsmiling astonishment at me isnt it a sight that poor little thingladies at a nearby table whispered a child my own age in a pink woolen coat stared rudely at me isnt it shameful the ladies whispered i ignored them i ate greedily for i was hungry i was very hungry but then i have never lacked appetite the thirteen texts of arthyria john r fultz lives in napa california his epic fantasy novel seven princes was released by orbit books earlier this year as the first volume in the books of the shaper trilogy the second book seven kings follows in january johns fiction has appeared in weird tales black gate space time lightspeed and the anthologies the way of the wizard and cthulhus reign the first book called to him from a row of shelves smothered in gray dust alone and friendless he stumbled upon the little bookstore among a row of claustrophobic backalley shops it had been a month since his move and he was still discovering the citys secrets the obscure treasures it could offer quaint restaurants serving local fare tiny theatres showing brilliant old films and cluttered shops like this one filled with antiques and baroque artifacts the bearded sage read the sign above the door in old english script he smiled at the signs artwork a skull and quill lying atop a pile of moldering books there is something in here for me he thought as he turned the brass doorknob a little bell rang when he stepped across the threshold it was beginning to rain in the street behind him inside were books and more books stacked on tables lining rows of shelves heaped in piles on the floor the pleasant odor of old paper filled his nostrils a whiff of dust made him cough a bit as he entered an old lady sat behind the counter chinese or filipino she wore hornrimmed glasses and slept with her head reclined against the wall a stick of incense burned across the back of a tiny stone dragon near the cash register emitting the sweet aroma of jasmine to mix with the perfume of ancient books he walked the cluttered aisles staring at the spines of wrinkled paperbacks vertical lines of text in his peripheral visioncalled onward by the book he knew it was here somewhere among these thousands of realities bound by ink and paper his eyes drank the contents of the shelves his breathing slow and even this was the way he moved through any bookstore corporate chains or obscure nooks of basement treasures how do you always find so many great books his wife had asked him back when they were still married you always give me something good to read i dont find them he had told her they find me she didnt believe that as she discounted so many things he told her but it was true his hand reached toward a shelf of heavy volumes near the back of the store they were all leatherbound editions a disorganized blend of fiction and nonfiction encyclopedia and anatomical treatises first editions and bound runs of forgotten periodicals books in many languagessome of which he could not recognize running along the shelfs edge his fingers stopped at a black spine engraved with cracked golden letters he grabbed it gently and pulled it from its tight niche accounting for its heaviness with both hands he brought it down to eye level blowing the dust off the cover allowed him to read the title the one true world volume i transcending the illusions of modernity and reason there was no author listed and no cover illustrationonly faded black leather and its gold leaf inscription on the spine was a roman numeral i but he saw no accompanying volumes just the singular tome it was the reason he was drawn to this place he opened it to the first page his acid test for books if he read the first few paragraphs and the author impressed him with style content imagery or any combination of these he would buy it there was no use struggling through a dull text waiting for it to improveif an author failed to show some excellence on the very first page he would likely never show it at all after reading the first three sentences he closed the book marched to the counter and woke the old lady by tapping on a little bell ill take this one he said his hands trembled as he drew thirtyfour dollars out of his wallet and paid her his gut churned the way it had when hed first met joannethe thrill of discovery the sense of standing on the edge of something wonderful and strange loveor something close to it great shop how long have you been in business he asked the lady been here forevah said the old lady she smiled at him with crooked teeth he laughed im jeremy march he told her though he had no idea why she nodded as if confirming his statement and waved goodbye please come again mr march the tiny bell rang again as he left the shop he tucked the book under his coat and walked into the pouring rain somehow he walked directly back to his parking spot without even thinking about it by the time he reached his apartment and laid the book on his bedside table thunder and lightning had conquered the night perfect night to read a good book alone in his bedroom his feet tucked beneath the warm covers he began to read about the one true world the first thing you must understand is that the one true world is not a figment of your imagination and it does not lie in some faraway dimension to help you understand the relationship between the true world and the false you must envision the true world lying beneath the false as a man can lay hidden beneath a blanket or a womans true face can be hidden by an exquisite mask the illusion that hides the true world from the eyes of living men is called the modern world it is a dense weave of illusory strands called facts together composing the grand veil of reason the true philosopher through dedication and study comes to realize that reason is a lie because it is passion that fuels the universe that modernity is a falsehood because the ancient world has never gone away it only transforms and evolves and is never any less ancient by meditating on the nature of the one true world one may cause it to manifest as truth always overcomes illusion even if buried for eons in order to master these principles to tear aside the dense fabric of illusion and completely understand the one true world you must not only read this text in its entirety but also its succeeding volumes of which there are twelve he woke the next day to emerald sunlight shining through the bedroom window blinking he recalled a dream where the sun was not green but orange or an intense yellowwhite or was it a dream the sun was greenof courseit always had been he shook the dream from his mind and headed for the bathroom hed stayed up most of the night reading the book finishing it just before dawn hed never read a book that fast before visions of the one true world danced through the steam in his bathroom mirror as he shavedforest kingdoms and cloud citiesmountains full of roaming giantswinged ships soaring like eagles knights in silver mail stalking the battlements of jade castlesgriffins and manticores and herds of pegasi bearing maidens across an alien sea he shook himself free of this trance stumbled to the kitchen and grabbed a diet soda he dressed in a tshirt and jeans and walked outside staring up at the ball of emerald flame the day was warm but not too hot he pulled car keys from his pocket there was no time for breakfast the second book was calling out to him there was a used book shop in a city some ninety miles north there he would find what he needed his next glimpse of the one true world books candles was a corner shop in the citys most bohemian district the proprietors were an old hippie couple in their midsixties the husband gave a peace sign greeting from behind a pair of john lennon glasses jeremy nodded and walked toward the rows of bookshelves massed together on the left side of the store on the other side stood a massive collection of handmade candles in all shapes and sizes almost a shrine a temple of tiny dancing flames his eyes scanned the shelves moving up and down searching like walking toward a room where music was playing and as he came closer to the doorway the melody grew louder he moved aside a cardboard box of mildewed paperbacks to reveal a low shelf and he saw the book it was identical to the first volume bound in black leather with gold leaf etching on spine and cover he pulled it from the shelf with a symphony blaring between his ears and stood with its comfortable weight in his hands the one true world volume ii the kingdoms of arthyria and the greater cities despite their benign appearance the hippie couple could tell he wanted the book badly he had to pay over twohundred dollars luckily they accepted his credit card forgetting where his car was parked he walked along the street to a fleabag hotel used mainly by the homeless he couldnt wait he had to read the book now the day was warm and most of the usual boarders were out roaming the streets he paid for a cot and lay himself down to read hours later when the sun set the citys disaffected came wandering in to sip at their brownbagged bottles and play gin rummy on battered folding tables he never even noticed his attention was claimed by the book andjust like the first volumehe could not stop reading until he finished every page he devoured the words like a famished vagrant at a royal feast the rightful name of the one true world is arthyria twentyone kingdoms there are in total nine being the greater realms and twelve called the lesser three mighty oceans gird the one true world each taking its color from the emerald flames of the sun and each with its own mysteries island cultures and hidden depths among the nine greater realms thirtythree great cities thrive each dating back to the age of walking gods some of them have been destroyed many times over yet always were rebuilt by faithful progeny the mightiest and most ancient of the great cities are seven in number these are vandrylla city of the sword zorung city of stargazers aurealis city of wine and song oorg city of the questing mind ashingol city of the godborn zellim kah city of sorcerers and yongaya city of the squirming toad among all the great cities there is only one where no living man may tread even to speak the name of that dreaded place is punishable by death in all kingdoms greater and lesser therefore the name of the shunned city will not be set down on these pages in his dreams he was still married he dreamed of joanne the way she used to be smiling full of energy her hair long and black as jet the picnic at albatross lake was the usual setting for these kinds of dreams a weird yellow sun blazed in an azure sky and the wind danced in her hair they drank a bottle of wine and watched the ducks play across the water before storm clouds rolled in to hide the sun they lay under a big tree and made love while the rain poured down and leaves sighed over their heads ive never been more happy he told her that day he was only twentyfive she was a year younger and they were living proof that opposites attract he never knew why someone like her had fallen for an eternal dreamer he was more concerned with writing the perfect song than making a living she worked at a bank for the entire three years they were married he worked at a used record store and taught guitar lessons the first year was bliss the second a struggle and the third a constant battle youre such a dreamer she used to say as if there was something wrong with that a few months into the marriage he realized that as long as she made more money than him he would be a failure in her eyes that started his suitandtie phase when he hung up his guitar for a mindnumbing corporate job he did it all for her she cut her hair short and seemed happy again for a whilebut he became more and more miserable sterilized rows of cubicles comprised his prisonand prison was a place without hope youre such a dreamer she told him this again in the dream unaware of the irony and her wedding dress turned to ashes when he kissed her she stood on a strand of cold gray beach and he watched her recede as some kind of watercraft carried him away eventually she was just a little dollsized thing surrounded by other dolls on the beach he turned to look at the boat but it was empty he stood alone on the deck and a terrible wind caught the sail and drove him farther from shore looking back he called her name but hed drifted too far out on the lonesome tide he dove into the icy water determined to get back to shore to get back to her to get their love back it was his only hope there was nobody but her there never had been never would be but when the cold waters closed over his head he remembered that he couldnt swim he sank like a stone salty brine rushing into his lungs he woke up gasping for breath among tall stalks of lavender grass the sun burned high in the limecolored sky there was no sign of the cheap boarding house or the homeless men whose refuge he shared he lay in a field alone he stood and saw the soaring black walls of aurealis ramparts of basalt encircled the city they curved several miles to the west toward the bay where a thousand ships sat at anchor this was the great portcity famed far and wide for its excellent wines and superb singers he walked toward the shore where the proud galleons lingered he dreaded the open water but he knew the next book lay beyond the limegreen sea it called to him as surely as spring calls forth a sleeping blossom by meditating on the nature of the one true world one may cause it to manifest following a road to the southern gate he made his way through a crowd of robed pilgrims armored watchmen cartpulling farmers and simple peasants clusters of jade domes and towers gleamed in the distance surrounded by a vast network of wooden buildings where the common folk worked and lived the sounds of aurealis were music and commerce bards and poets performed on street corners the smells of the city were horse sweat woodsmoke and a plethora of spices palanquin chairs borne by servants carried the wealthy through the streets the rich of aurealis dressed themselves for spectacle their robes were satin and silk studded with patterned jewels to signify the emblems of their houses their heads were towering ovals of pastel hair sculpted with strands of pearls and golden wire rings sparkled on the fingers of male and female both sexes painted their faces in shades of amber ochre and crimson squads of guards in silver ringmail flanked the palanquins curved broadswords across their backs the crests of their iron helms were serpents falcons or tigers as he moved aside to let a noblemans entourage pass jeremy noticed his own clothing it was like none worn by the folk of aurealis a black woolen tunic covered his chest and arms tied with a thin belt of silver links his breeches were some dark purple fabric supple yet thick as leather and his tall boots were the same material a crimson cloak was secured at his neck by a rams head amulet forged of silver or white gold his clothes smelled of horseflesh and dirt instinctively he reached for his wallet and found instead a woolen purse hanging from his belt he poured the clanking contents into his hand eight silver coins with the rams head on one side and a shining tower on the other somehow he knew these coins were drins also called rams and they were minted in some distant city he could not recall its name he smelled saltwater above the swirling odors of aurealis it was a long walk to the quays where the galleons were taking on cargo their sails were all the colors of the rainbow but he recognized none of the emblems flying there he looked past the crowded bay and the swarm of trading vessels toward the distant horizon the sun hung low in the sky now and the ocean gleamed like a vast emerald shield tarros the name surfaced in his mind as if rising from the green sea it was the name of the island kingdom where he would find the next book after much inquiry he discovered a bluesailed galleon bearing a white seashell the standard of the island queen brownskinned sailors loaded bales of fabric and casks of aurealan wine and it was easy to find the captain and inquire about passage have you money philosopher asked the sweaty captain he was round of body and face with thick lips and dark curly hair a necklace of oyster shells hung round his neck i have eight silver rams said jeremy the tarrosian smiled teeth gleaming like pearls aye thatll serve he dumped the coins into the captains palm and stared out at the waves we sail by moonlight when the sea is calm and cool said the captain stars blinked to life in the fading sky the moon rose over the horizon a jade disc reflected in the dark waves he followed the captainwho introduced himself as zomrah the seasonedup the gangplank suddenly he remembered the second volume and the flophouse where hed fallen asleep after reading it he had no idea where the book wasdid he leave it in the field was it somewhere in the city or had it disappeared completely he wanted to run back across the city back into the open field and see if it lay there among the violet grass no he told himself ive read it his path lay forward across the green waves the closer to the island kingdom he came the more he remembered of himself by the time the wooded shores of tarros came in sight he knew why the captain had called him philosopher and why he wore the silver rams head on his breast he recalled his boyhood in the white towers of oorg city of the questing mind the endless libraries that were the citys temples and a thousand days spent in contemplation much of it still lay under a fog of nonmemory obscured by lingering visions of high school college and other lies yet after five days on the open ocean he was certain that he was a trained philosopher from the white city and that he always had been on the sixth day out he remembered his true name i am jeremach of oorg i am jeremach of oorg he shouted across the green waves the tarrosian sailors largely ignored his outburst but their narrow eyes glanced his way when they thought he wasnt looking most likely they expected eccentric behavior from a man who spent his life pondering the meaning of existence but thats not all of it he knew theres moremuch more oorg feels like a memory of what i used to benot what i am he knew that he was more than a simple child of oorg versed in the eighthundred avenues of thought savant of the fiftynine philosophies perhaps the answer lay in the next volume of the one true world the rest of his memory lay somewhere within those pages after fourteen days of calm seas and healthy winds the galley dropped anchor in myroa the port city of tarros it was a pale imitation of aurealis a humble collection of mudwalled dwellings domed temples and atop its tallest hill the modest palace of the tarrosian queen a single tower rose between four spiked domes the entire affair built of rosecolored marble veined with purple the city was full of colorful birds and the people were simple laborers for the most part dressed in white shifts and pantaloons most of the men and women went barechested though all wore the seashell necklaces that were the sign of their country and queen the breath of the salty wind was sweetened by the tang of ripe fruit trees zomrah the seasoned was a trader captain in service to the queens viceroy so he had access to the palace the viceroy was an old leathery man with silvery robes and a ridiculous shellshaped hat on his gray head or perhaps it was an actual shell he examined zomrahs bill of lading in a plush anteroom and gave the captain a bag of gold when zomrah introduced jeremach the viceroy looked him over as if examining a new piece of freight eventually the old man nodded and motioned for the philosopher to follow him jeremach followed him through winding corridors some were openair walkways hemmed with rows of trellises thick with red and white orchids tapestries along the palace walls showed scenes of underwater peril with tridentbearing heroes battling krakens sharks and leviathans somewhere a high voice sang a lovely song that brought the ocean depths to mind the queen of tarros received jeremach on the high balcony of her rosy tower a tall chair had been placed in the sunlight where she could observe the island spreading to the west and north and leagues of open sea to the east and south three brawny tarrosians stood at attention her personal guard armed with trident and sword naked but for white loincloths and seashell amulets the queen rose from her chair and he gasped her loveliness was stunning the narrow chin and sapphire eyes were familiar and her hair was dyed to the hue of fresh seaweed it fell below her slim waist shells of a dozen colors woven among its braids her dress was a diaphanous gown almost colorless and her brown body was perfect as a jewel she greeted him with a warm hug you look well philosopher much younger than when last you visited she smiled jeremach bowed remembering the proper etiquette for such a situation ive been here before she knows me great queen your realm is the soul of beauty and you are its heart he said ever the flatterer she said she raised a tiny hand to his cheek and cupped it staring at him as if amazed by his features youve come for your books she said taking him by the hand her touch was delicate yet simmering ive kept them safe for you yes there is more than one volume here jeremach nodded your majesty is wise please she said leading him into the tower call me by my name as you used to do you have not forgotten it he searched the murky depths of his memory celestia he said sweet celestia she led him up spiral stairs into a library twenty arched windows looked out upon the sea and hundreds of books lined a shelved wall he walked without direction to a specific shelf and his hands reached as they had done twice before directly for the third book two more volumes sat beside it he lay all three of them on a marble table and examined their golden inscriptions volume iii the people and their faiths volume iv the lineages of the great kings and the bloodlines of the great houses volume v the societies of the pseudomen and the cloud kingdoms you see the queen said they are safe and whole i have kept your faith he nodded aching to open the third volume and read but first he had to know thank you he said but how did you come to possess these texts she looked at him quizzically amused by the question you gave them to me when i was only a little girl i always knew you would return for them as you promised i wish youd have come while father was still alive he was very fond of you we lost him four years ago he recalled a broadchested man with a thick green beard and a crown of golden shells in his mind the king of tarros laughed and a little girl sat on his knee king celestior my friend she is his daughter once my student and now the queen of tarros how many years has it been he kissed the queens cheek and she left him to his books hours later her servants brought him seafood stew aurealan wine in pearly cups and a box of fresh candles he read throughout the long night while the warm salt air swept in from the sea and the jade moon crept from window to window for days he sat in the chamber and read finally they found him collapsed over the books snoring a white beard growing from his chin they carried him to a proper bed and he slept dreaming of a distant world that was a lie and yet also true in so many ways youre walking out on me she said eyes brimming with tears you walked out on me he told her she said nothing joanne sweetheart you know ill always love you but this isnt working wedont belong together how can you be so sure she cried because if we did you would have never climbed into bed with alan her sadness turned to anger as it often did i told you i never meant for it to happen yeah you told me he said but you did it you did it right three timesthat i know of she grabbed him wrapped her arms around his neck squeezed you cant just leave me behind she said now he was crying too im done with this he said no she whimpered we can still fix it how she stood back from him brushing a dark strand of hair from her forehead her eyes were dark too black pearls well get counseling she pleaded well figure out what went wrong and well make sure it never happens again he turned away lay his forehead against the mantle you cheated too she said almost a whisper after you did he didnt say it out loud maybe she was right maybe there still was hope he had never loved anyone but her never they stood with their arms wrapped around each other for a little while ill always love you he said no matter what happens the people of arthyria differ greatly in custom dress and culture and wars are not unknown each kingdom has its share of inhuman denizens humanoid races who live in proximity or complete integration with the human populace these are the pseudomen and they have played a great role in many a war as mercenary troops adding to the ranks of whatever citystate they call home there is generally little prejudice against the pseudomen although the yellow priests of naravhen call them impure and have banned them from the yellow temples there are five great religions in practice across the triple continents of arthyria faiths that have survived the upheaval of ages and come down to us through the fractured corridors of time intact the cults and sects of lesser deities are without number but all of the five faiths worship some variation of the one thousand gods some faiths such as the order of the loyal heart are inclusive claiming that all gods be revered others are singular belief systems focused on only one god drawn from the ranks of the one thousand through these commonalities of faith we see the development of the tongue a lingua franca that unites most of arthyria with its thirtyseven dialects here mention must be made of the cloud kingdoms whose gods are unknown whose language is incomprehensible to arthyrians and whose true nature and purpose has remained a mystery throughout the ages when he woke he was closer to being himself and the people of tarros were restored he walked through the palace in search of celestia marveling at the beauty of those he had forgotten their glistening skins were shades of turquoise their long fingers and toes webbed tipped with motherofpearl talons they wore very little clothing only the same white loincloths hed seen yesterday webbed spiny crests ran up their backs across the tops of narrow skulls terminating on their tall foreheads their eyes were black orbs their lips far thicker than any humans and only the females grew any hair long emerald tresses woven with pearls and shells they were amphibious pseudomen a marine race that had evolved to live on land the island kingdom was a small portion of their vast empire most of which lay deep beneath the waves some claimed they ruled the entire ocean but jeremach knew better there were other less civilized societies below the sea now that he had read three more volumes arthyria was one step closer to being whole so was he vastly important things lay just on the edge of his awareness he must know themeverything depended on it he found celestia in her gardens surrounded by a coterie of amphibious subjects they lounged around a great pool of seawater fed by undersea caverns jeremach you look more like yourself today said the queen beckoning him with a webbed hand i should say the same to you majesty he replied he saw himself now in the surface of the pool his garb had changed little but he looked older at least forty he guessed but his hair and thick beard were as white as a codgers how old am i really he wondered will i continue aging as the world keeps reverting to its true state i trust you found what you were looking for in those dreadful books she asked she offered him a padded bench beside her own high seat tiny tarrosian children splashed in the pool playing subaquatic games and surfacing in bubbles of laughter i did he said i found the truth or more of it at least it is good to see you again old tutor she said smiling with her marine lips her eyes gleamed at him onyx orbs brimming with affection you were always my favorite pupil he told her honestly how long will you stay with us not long i fear i hear a call that cannot be denied tell me did your father sign a treaty with the kingdom of aelda when you were still a child yes celestia raised her twin orbs to the sky the treaty of sea and sky signed in year of the ray it was you who taught me that date and your father received a gift from the sovereign of aeldado you still have it clouds of jade cotton moved across the heavens the next book called to him from somewhere high above the world she led him below the palace into a maze of caverns created by seawater in some elder age and three guards accompanied them bearing torches when they found the great door of obsidian that sealed the treasure vault she opened it with a coral key inside lay a massive pile of gold and silver coins centuries of tribute from the realms of arthyria fantastic suits of armor carved from coral and bone spears and shields of gold and iron jewels in all the colors of the prism and objects of painful beauty to which he could not even put a name celestia walked about the gleaming hoard until she found a horn of brass gold and jet it might have been the horn of some mighty antelope the way it twisted and curved yet jeremach knew that it was forged somewhere no land animal could reach she presented it to him with an air of satisfaction she was still the student eager to please her tutor he kissed her cheek and tucked the horn into his belt something else she said wrapping her hand about a golden hilt she drew forth from the piled riches a long straight sword the blade gleamed like silver and the hilt was set with a blue jewel carved to the likeness of a shell jeremach remembered this blade hanging on the broad belt of king celestior even a peaceloving king had to fight a few wars in his time take this said the queen jeremach shook his head no majesty he protested this was my fathers sword she said but he is dead and he would have wanted you to have it she drew close to him and whispered in his ear her voice was the sound of the ocean in the depths of a seashell i know something of what you are trying to do as do others you may need this jeremach sighed and bowed to reject her gift would be to insult her he took the blade and kissed the hilt she smiled at him the tiny gills on her neck pulsing she found a jeweled scabbard to sheathe the weapon and he buckled it about his waist alongside the silver belt of the philosopher a philosopher who carries a sword he thought how absurd yet was he a philosopher still what further changes lay in store for him when the last of the one true world was revealed he feasted with the queen and her court that night getting rather drunk on aurealan wine and stuffed full of clams crabs and oysters by the time he stumbled up to his bed in the high tower he was nearly senseless he took off his belts propped the sword in its scabbard against the bed post and passed out it wasnt pain that woke him but rather the terrible lack of air he saw a greenblue haze and wondered if tarros had sank beneath the waves and he was drowning the pain at his throat was his second sensation dulled as it was by the great quantities of wine in his belly a shadow crouched above him the toes of leather boots on either side of his face and a thin strand of wire was cutting through the flesh under his chin pulling terribly on his beard it was the beards thickness that prevented a quick death giving him a few seconds to wake and realize he was being strangled he gasped for air his fingers clawing at nothing his legs wracked by spasms any second now the wire would cut through his throatprobably before he suffocated the strangler tightened its iron grip on the wire and jeremachs body flailed he could not even scream for help they would find him here dead in the queens guest chamber with no idea who killed him what will happen when im gone he wondered then he knew of a certainty some bit of memory racing back into his head his face turned purple and his lungs seized up if he did not finish reading the thirteen volumes the one true world would fade back into the world of modernity and illusion if he died arthyria died with him his grasping fingers found the hilt of celestiors sword he wrapped them about the grip and yanked the sheathed blade up to crack against the stranglers skull the stranglehold lessened but he could not remove the sword from its scabbard so it was no killing blow twice more he bludgeoned the strangler with the sword wielding it like a metal club wrapped in leather on the third blow the strangler toppled off the bed and jeremach sucked in air like a dying fish he scrambled onto the floor and tried to unsheathe the sword a dark figure rose across the mattress hooded and cloaked in shades of midnight it stepped toward him face hidden in the shadows of the hood an iron dagger appeared in its gloved fist the blade corroded by rust a single cut from that decayed iron would bring a poisonous death he scrambled for air and found his back against the wall a froglike croaking came from his throat he fumbled at the scabbard why wouldnt the damn sword come clear the assassin placed the rusted blade against his throat you cheated too said a cold voice from inside the hood no thats not thats not what i heard three golden blade heads burst from the assassins stomach a tarrosian guard stood behind the attacker his trident impaling it jeremach finally tore the sword free of the scabbard he rolled onto his side as the skewered assassin drove its dagger into the stone wall ignoring the trident jutting from its back the guard pulled his trident free for another jab but jeremach was on his feet now both hands wrapped about the swords hilt swinging it in a silver arc the hooded head flew from the assassins body and rolled across the floor to lie at the foot of the bed the headless body stood for a moment holding the rusted dagger then it collapsed with a sound like snapping wood and became only a mound of bones and mildewed black cloth he stared at the face on the severed head a woman with long hair dark as her robes he blinked coughed and he would have screamed in terror but could not joanne he said her name through purple lips his voice a rasping moan she stared up at him weeping bleeding bodiless you cant do this she said and black blood trickled from her lips you cant throw it all away youre destroying our world youre destroying the past how do you know this is the true world and not the false he had no words he fell to his knees and stared at her face his heart ached more terribly than his throat you said youd always love me she wept but youre throwing it all away how can you be sure her tongue and then the rest of her face withered into dust he stared into the blank sockets of a grinning skull before the sun kissed the ocean he left the palace and went alone to the island shore as the first green light seeped into the sky he blew on the horn of brass gold and jet one long loud note that rang across the waves and into the clouds of morning the island kingdom came to life behind him and he stared across the waves soon he saw a speck of gold gleaming between the clouds it grew larger sinking toward the ocean until it came clearly into view a slim sky galleon bearing cloudwhite sails it floated toward the island like a great soaring bird some distance from the shore it touched keel to water soundlessly by the time it reached the sandy embankment it looked no stranger than any other seagoing vessel the figurehead on its pointed bow was a beautiful winged woman someone let down a rope ladder and jeremach climbed it dropping himself onto the deck the sky galleons crew were stone men living statues of pale marble they said nothing but nodded politely when he showed them the horn of brass gold and jet then the stone captain took it from him crushed it in his massive fist and dropped its remains into the sea the sails caught a gust of wind and the ship rose from the sea toward the clouds the island of tarros was a tiny expanse of forest surrounded by endless green waves now it was a mote now completely gone continents of cloud passed by on either side of the galleon higher and higher it rose until all of arthyria was lost below a layer of cumulus the green sun blazed brightly in the upper realm now the city of aelda came into view a sparkling crystal metropolis perched upon an island of white cloud the spiral towers and needlelike pinnacles were like nothing in the world below but a sense of vague familiarity flavored jeremachs awe the rest of the books are here he remembered all but one the winged folk had no voices and their bodies were translucent they moved with all the grace of swans gliding through the sky on feathery appendages grown from their lean backs their beauty was incredible so much that none could be classified as singly male or female their bodies were the sexless perfection of inhumanity the highest order of all the pseudomen the people of the cloud kingdoms were also the most mysterious a flock of them glided by as the sky galleon docked alongside a crystal tower they stared at the visitor with eyes of liquid gold they neither waved nor questioned his presence he had sounded the horn otherwise he would not be here the galleons crew of marble men followed him into a corridor of diamond and took their places in carved niches along the walls now they were only statues again someday someone in arthyria would blow another horn of brass gold and jet and the statues would live again to man the golden ship jeremach left the stone men to their silent niches the scent of the cloud realms made his head swim as he walked toward the books up here lingered the aromas of unborn rain naked sunlight and the fragrance of unsoiled clouds the diamond walls rang with musical tones sweet enough to mesmerize the untutored into immobility but jeremach heard only the call of his books he found them right where he had left them so long ago in a domed chamber supported by seven pillars of glassy quartz the tomes lay upon a round table of crystalline substance and they looked as incongruous here as the tall philosophers chair he had placed before the table he sat in the chair sighed and ran his fingers over the faces of the seven books volume vi the knights of arthyria and the secret orders of starlight volume vii wizards of the first age volume viii wizards of the second age and the forces unleashed volume ix wizards of the third and fourth ages and the death of othaa volume x the doom of the fortytwo gods volume xi the great beasts of arthyria and the things from beyond volume xii the fifth cataclysm and the preservation of ancient knowledge dont think about joanne he told himself but her words haunted him youre throwing it all away how do you know this is the true world he opened the sixth volume breathing in the smell of ancient papyrus and ink its my choice i choose arthyria he read in the year the wizard jeremach returned to the shunned city legions of the living dead rose from its ruined halls to assail him but he dismissed them with a wave of his hand turning them all to pale dust he walked among the crumbled stones of the first empire frigid winds tearing at his long white beard as he neared the palace of the dead king a horde of blackwinged devils descended screeching from the broken towers these he smote with a flashing silver blade bearing the sign of tarros as the last of the fiends died at his feet the wizard sheathed his weapon he walked on toward the shattered palace before the dead kings gates a band of ghosts questioned jeremach but he gave them riddles that would haunt them well into the afterworld he spoke a single word and the gates of blackened iron collapsed inward he entered the utter darkness of the castle and walked until he found the dead king sitting on a pile of gilded skulls the heads of all those he had conquered in battle over the course of seven thousand years a red flame glowed in a pit before the dead kings mailed feet and he looked upon jeremach similar flames glowed in the hollow pits of his eyes his flesh had rotted away millennia ago but his bones refused to die or to give up his hardwon empire in the last five thousand years none but jeremach had entered these gates and lived to speak of it the dead king took up his great black sword but jeremach laughed at him you know that ive not come to battle you said the wizard the dead king sighed grave dust spilling from between his teeth with fleshless fingers he lifted an ancient book from the floor of his hall he offered it to jeremach the wizard wiped away a coating of dust and saw the books title the one true world volume xiii the curse of the dead king and the undying empire jeremach did not need to read it for he knew its contents with a touch the dead king spoke in a voice of grinding bones you have won he said yes said jeremach though you cheated sending an assassin after me how desperate i might claim you cheated with these books of yours said the skullking but in war all sins are forgiven still i did win said the wizard i proved that truth will always overcome illusion that a false realityno matter how temptingcannot stand against that which is real i escaped your trap the dead king nodded and a crown of rusted iron tumbled from his skull for the first time in history i have been defeated he growled was that relief in his ancient voice nowwill you keep your promise stubborn king asked jeremach will you quit the world of the living and let this long curse come to an end will you let men reclaim these lands that you have held for millennia the dead king nodded again and now his skull tumbled from his shoulders his bones fell to dust and a cold wind blew his remains across the hall the moaning of a million ghosts filled the sky in the distant cities of oorg aurealis vandrylla and zorung the living woke from nightmares and covered their ears jeremach left the ruins of the shunned city as they crumbled behind him he carried the black book under his arm as he walked the moldering slabs of the city turned to dust following their king into oblivion and the frozen earth of that realm began to thaw in the sunlight after long ages spring had finally come by the time jeremach crossed the horizon there was no trace of the haunted kingdom left anywhere beneath the emerald sky ruminations in an alien tongue vandana singh is an indian science fiction writer living in the us where she is a physics professor at a state university she has published short stories in various anthologies and magazines including strange horizons trsf and most recently lightspeed many of her stories have been reprinted in years best volumes her novella distances aqueduct press won the carl brandon parallax award most recently she has been a columnist for strange horizons where her reflections on science and the environment can be found birha on the doorstep sitting on the sunwarmed step at the end of her workday birha laid her hand on the dogs neck and let her mind drift like a gyremoth finding the center of its desire her mind inevitably spiraled inward to the defining moment of her life it must be something to do with growing old she thought irritably that all she did was revisit what had happened all those years ago yet her irritation subsided before the memory she could still see it with the shocking clarity of yesterday the great closed eyelid set in the enormous alien stronghold opening in response to her trick the thick air of the valley her breath caught in her throat the orangeandyellow uniforms of the waiting soldiers she had gone up the ladder stepped through the round opening darkness her footsteps echoing in the enormous space the light she carried casting a small bobbing pool of illumination this was the alien stronghold considered invincible by the human conquerors to which the last denizens of a dying race had crawled in a war she had forgotten when she was young she had expected to find their broken decayed bodies but instead there was a silence like the inside of a temple up in the mountains silence a faint smell of dust and a picture forever burned into her mind in the light of her lamp the missing soldier thunderstruck before the great mass of machinery in the center that was the moment when everything changed for her and eventually for humankind she had been young then hah she said a short sharp soundan old woman laughing at her foolishness it felt good to sit here on the doorstep although now it was turning a little cold on this world the sun didnt set for seven years as counted on the planet where she had been born she knew she would not live to see another sunset her bones told her that and the faint smell in her urine and her mind which was falling backward into a void of its own making but the clouds could not be ignored nor the yellow dog at her knee who wanted to go inside there would be rain and the trees would open their veined translucent cups to the sky there would be gyremoths emerging from holes in the ground flying in smooth eversmaller circles at the center of which was a cup of perfumed rainand there would be furred worms slithering up the branches to find the sweet mothmeat in the rain under the trees the air would quiver with blood and desire and the human companion animalsthe dogs and cats and ferretswould run to their homes lest the sleehawks or a feral arboril catch them for their next meal yes rain was a time of beauty and bloodshed here at the edge of the great cloud forest among the ruins of the university that had been her home for most of her life she got up noting with a grim satisfaction that in this universe old knees creaked she went in with the dog and shut the door and the windows against the sirenlike calls of the foghorn trees and put some water on to boil rain drummed on the stone walls of her retreat and she saw through the big window the familiar ruined curve of the university ramparts through a wall of falling water sometimes the sight still took her breath away that high walk with the sheer misty drop below was where she had first walked with thirru a very short rumination when i was born my mother named me birha which means separated or parted in an ancient human language this was because my mother was about to die difficult loves thirru was difficult and strange he seemed eager to make birha happy but was like a big foolish child unable to do so a large plump man with hair that stood up on end he liked to clap his hands loudly when he solved a difficult problem startling everyone his breath smelled of bitter herbs from the tea he drank all day even at their pairing ceremony he couldnt stop talking and clapping his hands which she had then thought only vaguely annoying and perhaps endearing later her irritation at his strangeness his genius his imbecility provoked her into doing some of her best work it was almost as though in the discomfort of his presence she could be more herself one time when she was annoyed with thirru she was tempted by another man this man worked with her his fingers were long and shapely over the simulator controls and he leaned toward her when he spoke always with a warmth that made her feel as though she was a creature of the sunlight unfurling in the rays of morning he made her feel younger than she was she didnt like him very much she distrusted people with charm as a matter of principle but he was more than charm he was lean and wore his dark hair long and loose and every posture of his was insouciant inviting relaxed as a predatory animal when he leaned toward her she felt the yearning the current pulling her toward him at these moments she was always stiff and polite with him in privacy she cursed herself for her weakness she avoided him sought him out avoided him going on like this for days until quite suddenly she broke through the barrier she was no longer fascinated by him it wasnt that his charm had faded it was only she congratulated herself the fact that she had practiced the art of resisting temptation until she had achieved some mastery you practice and it becomes easier just like the alien mathematics on which she was working at the time just like anything else this freedom from desiring this man was heady it was also relaxing not to feel drawn to him all the time to be able to joke and laugh with him to converse without that terrible adolescent selfconsciousness she could even let herself like him after that in this manner she carried herself through other temptations successfully even after thirrus own betrayal she wasnt tempted into another relationship after the reconciliation they stayed together for an entire cycle some of which was marked by an easy contentment that she had never known before a deep wellspring of happiness when they parted it was as friends but what he left behind what all old loves left behind were the ghostly imprints of their presence for her thirru came back whenever she looked up at the high walk where she had first walked with him thirru was the feel of damp stone the vivid green of the moss between the rocks the wet verdant aroma of the mist she didnt have to go there anymore just looking up at the stone arch against the clouds would bring back the feel of his hands after thirru she had had her share of companions long and short term but nobody had inspired her to love and when the man happened along who came closest she was unprepared for him his name was rudrak and he was young what she loved about him was his earnestness his delight in beautiful things like the poeticas she had set up on the long table he was an engineer and his passion was experimental craft designed to explore stars she loved his beautiful androgynous face how it was animated by thought and emotion how quick his eyes were to smile the way his brow furrowed in concentration that crisp black curling hair the brown arm flung out as he declaimed dramatically a line from a classic play shed never heard of when he came always infrequently unexpectedly always on a quest for the woman ubbiri it was as though the sun had come out in the sky of her mind conversation with him could be a battle of wits or the slow easy unhurried exchange of longtime lovers she never asked him to stay for good as though it were possible never told him she loved him now she was pottering about in her kitchen listening to the rain wondering if he would come one more time before she died the last time he had come was a halfcycle ago three and a half years on her birth planet her mind translated out of habit there was not much more than a halfcycle left to her would he come pouring her tea she realized that despite the certainty with which she loved this man there was something different about this love she felt no need for him to reciprocate sometimes she would look at her arms their brown lean strength the hands showing the signs of age and remember what it was like to be touched lovingly and wonder what it would be like to caress rudraks arm to touch his face his lips but it was an abstract sort of wondering even if she could make him forget ubbiri and there was no reason for her to do that she did not really want him too close to her her life was the way she liked it the rising into early mornings the work with the poeticaswhich was a meditation in sunlight and soundthen the long trek up the hill to the nowabandoned laboratory returning in the early evening before the old bells rang sunset although the sun wouldnt set for half a cycle yet into the tranquility of her little stone house where the village girl entrusted with the task would have left her meal warming on the stove just the way she liked it the peace of eating and reading by herself watching the firelings outside her window in the temporary watery dark created by the frequent gathering of clouds in those moments the universe seemed to open to her as much as it seemed shut to her during the long day she would stare out at the silhouettes of trees and wonder if the answers she was seeking through her theories and equations werent instead waiting for her out there in the forest amidst the ululations of the frenetbird and the complex script of the firelings dance in those moments it would seem to her as though all she had to do was to walk out into the verdure and pluck the answer from the air like fruit from trees that it was in these moments of complete receptivity that the universe would be revealed to her not in the hours at the simulators in the laboratory that the equations would be like childish chatter compared to what was out there to know in its fullness she took her tea to her favorite chair to drink on the way she let her fingers brush lightly over the wires of the poeticas that stood on wood frames on the long table the musical notes sounded above the crash of the rain speaking aloud her ruminations in the lost alien tongue rudrak had left his ghost behind here the remembrance of his body leaning over the instruments brushing them as he might in some other universe be brushing the hair from her face asking how this sequence of notes implied those words since she had walked into the alien stronghold so many years ago since the time that everything had changed rudrak had visited her nine times each time he remembered nothing of his previous visits not even who she was each time she had to explain to him that ubbiri was dead and that he should come in and wouldnt he like some tea she went through the repetition as though it was the first time every time which in a way it was a sacred ritual rudrak would he come a rambling rumination simply by virtue of being we create ripples in the evergiving cosmic tree the kalpavriksh every branch is an entire universe even stars as they are born and die leave permanent marks in the shadow universe of their memory perhaps we are ghosts of our other selves in other universes it was not right for ubbiri to die there is a lack of symmetry there a lack even of a proper symmetry breaking somewhere somehow ubbiris metaworldline and mine should connect in a shape that is pleasing to the mathematical eye sometimes i want to be ubbiri to know that a part of me did wander into another universe after all and that separated the two parts were joined together at last there is something inelegant about ubbiris return and subsequent death ubbiri should have shared consciousness with me then when rudrak asks i am looking for ubbiri is she here for the umpteenth time i birha will say yes shes here instead this is what i say im sorry ubbiri passed away a long time ago she told me about you when she died wont you come in what is the probability that i am ubbiri if so am i dead or alive or both ubbiri is dead i am birha and birha is alone the discovery when birha was neither young nor old when thirru had already moved offplanet a young soldier volunteered to testfly an alien flyer one of two intact specimens the flight went well until upon an impulse he decided to swoop by the alien ruins in the valley below the university during the dive he lost control of the flyer which seemed to be heading straight for a round indentation like an eye in the side of an ancient dome the indentation revealed itself to be a door by opening and then closing behind the flyer when birha was consulted about the problem she suspected that the door worked on an acoustical switch calculating the frequency of sound emitted by the alien flyer at a certain speed in the close thick air of the valley took some time but when a sound wave of the requisite frequency was aimed at the door it opened almost immediately with a sigh as though of relief she volunteered to go alone into the chamber they argued but she had always been stubborn and at the end they let her she was the expert on the aliens after all the interior was vast shrouded in darkness and her footsteps echoed musically she saw the flyer in some kind of docking bay along with a dozen others there were no decaying alien bodies only silence the young man stood in front of the great mass of machinery at the center of the room in the light from her lamp which flickered strangely she saw a complexity of fine fluted vanes crystalline pipes as thin as her finger running in and out of lacy metalwork the whole mass was covered in a translucent dome that gleamed red and blue yellow and green in the light from her lamp there was a door in the side of the dome which was ringed by pillars my hand the soldier was staring at his hand he looked at birha at last my hand just went through that pillar birha felt a loosening of her body as though her joints and tendons were coming apart without pain if she breathed out too hard she might fling herself all over the cosmos her heart was beating in an unfamiliar rhythm she put her hand in her pocket and took some coins out carefully she tossed each one in the air thirteen coins came down on the floor all heads theres nothing wrong with you she told the aviator its the machine its an alien artifact that changes the probabilities of things were standing in the leakage field look just come with me youll be all right she led him into the light the round door was propped open by a steel rod and there were crowds of people waiting at the foot of the ladder the young man was still dazed it tickled he said my hand when it went through the pillar a rumination on the aliens what do we know about them we know now they are not dead they went through the great probability machine the actualizer to another place a place well never find the old pictures show that they had pale brown segmented bodies with a skeletal frame that allowed them to stand upright they were larger than us but not by much and they had feelers on their heads and lightsensitive regions beneath the feelers and several limbs they knew time and space and as their culture was centered around sound so was their mathematics centered around probability their ancient cities are filled with ruined acoustical devices enormous poeticas windchimes and aeolian harps as large as a building their music is strange but pleasant to humans although its frequency range goes beyond what we can hear when i was just an acolyte at the university i chose to study what scripts were left after the war they were acoustical scripts corresponding to the notes in a row of poeticas on the main streets of their cities i was drunk with discovery in love with the aliens overcome with sorrow that they were as we thought then all dead for the first time since i had come to this planet i felt at home to understand the aliens i became a mathematician and a musician after that those three things are one thing in my mind the aliens the mathematics the music rudraks story a bristleship rudrak told birha is like no other craft it burrows into the heart of a star enduring temperatures beyond imagination and comes out on the other side whole and full of data the current model was improved by rudrak in his universe a branch of the cosmic tree not unlike this one he did it for his partner ubbiri who was writing a thesis on white dwarf stars ubbiri had loved white dwarf stars since a cousin taught her a nursery rhyme about them when ubbiri was small why are you a star so dim in the night beyond the rim dont you want someone to love in the starry skies above ubbiri had to write a thesis on white dwarf stars as dictated by academic custom in that culture her thesis had to connect the six points of the wheel of knowing metanetworking undulant theory finejump mathematics timebundles poetry and love to enable her to achieve deepknowing and to therefore truly love the star she took a ride on the new bristleship with rudrak they discovered that when the ship went through the starry core it entered another reality this was later called the shadow universe of stars where their existence and life history is recorded in patterns that no human has completely understood some poets call this reality the stars memoryspace or its consciousness but ubbiri thought that was extending metaphor beyond sense the data from the bristleship told her that this star this love had been a golden star in its youth and middle age harboring six planets two of which had hosted life and much space debris in the late season of its existence it had soared in largeness dimming and reddening swallowing its planetary children now it was content to bank its fires until death after this discovery rudrak said the two of them lived quiet lives that were rich and full but one day before he was due to take off for another test flight ubbiri noticed there was a crack on the heatshielded viewscreen of the bristleship rudrak tested it and repaired it but ubbiri was haunted by the possibility of the tiny crack spreading like a web across the viewscreen and breaking up just as rudrak was in the stars heart perhaps that was what she thought when rudrak disappeared rudrak only knew that instead of passing through the shadow universe before coming out the bristleship took him somewhere else to a universe so close to his own that he did not know the difference until he had crashlanded on a planet this planet and been directed to people who knew the truth they led him to birha who sheltered him for fifteen days allowed him to mourn and to come slowly to life again each time she sent him back to his universe as protocol demanded by way of the alien probability machine the actualizer somehow he was caught in a timeloop that took him back to the day before the illfated expedition he had returned to her in exactly the same way nine times his return visits were not predictable being apparently randomly spaced and her current and last calculation was an attempt to predict when he would come next each visit was the same and not the same surely he had had less gray hair the last time and that healed cut on his handhadnt that been from his last trip when he was trying to help her cut fruit and the knife had slipped and hadnt his accent improved just a little bit since last time theyd had to teach him the language each visit as though it was new but perhaps it became just a hairs breadth easier each time she tried to make each experience subtly different for him she was afraid that too drastic a change might upset whatever delicate process was at work in the timeloop he was like a leaf caught in an eddypush too hard and the time stream might take him over a precipice but a little tug here a tug there and perhaps hed land safely on a shore of this universe or that one so far nothing had worked his bewilderment was the same each time he appeared on her doorstep and so was his grief it was only these small insignificant things that were different one time he wore an embroidered collar another time a plain one or the color of his shirt was different birha worked on her calculations but the kalpavriksh gave senseless contradictory answers a rumination on timmars rock i remember when i first came to the university i used to pass a flattopped boulder on the way to class there was a depression on the flat surface of the rock in the exact shape of the bottom of a water bowl when i met thirru he told me that the great timmar rayan who had founded the school of wind and water had sat there in daily meditation for three entire cycles placing his water bowl in the same spot every time over the years the depression had developed i have always marveled that something as unyielding as rock can give way before sheer habit or regularity or persistence whatever you might call it practice whether in mathematics or in love changes things sometimes ubbiris arrival it was one thing to realize that the alien device in the center of the chamber was some kind of probabilityaltering machine that it was the fabled actualizer hinted at in alien manuscripts which she had always thought of as myth was quite another thing this knowledge she owed to ubbiri who was discovered lying on the floor of the chamber not three days after birha had first opened the round door ubbiri was immediately incarcerated for questioning and only after several tendays when her language had been deciphered and encrypted into a translation device had birha been allowed to speak to her they said the old woman was mad babbling about shadow universes and tearing at her silver hair but birha found her remarkably sane ubbiri told her that she had tired of waiting for her partner who had disappeared during a flight through a certain whitedwarf star and when he didnt return she had taken an oldmodel bristleship and dived into the heart of the star when the ship passed through the core she defied its protestations and stepped out of it seeking either him or death in the shadowy depths of the other reality instead she found herself lying on the floor of the chamber aged beyond her years over the course of four tendays of conversation birha determined that the constants of nature were a hairs breadth different where ubbiri came from so it was very likely another universe entirely she realized then that the machine at the center of the room did not merely change probabilities it was an actualizer a probability wave interference machine and the portal inside it led to whatever branch of the kalpavriksh you created by changing the parameters but the portal only opened if youd satisfied consistency checks and if as far as the machine could tell the universe was stable somehow the pathways to other universes intersected within the cores of stars hence ubbiris surprising arrival not long after ubbiri died she left a note stating that there were three things she was grateful for her white dwarf star rudrak and spending her last days with birha a quartercycle after ubbiris death rudrak came for the first time into birhas life a rumination on thirru or rudrak there is a rift valley between us a boundary that might separate two people or two universes ive been exploring there marveling at the tortured geometries of its sheer walls the pits and chasms on its floor through them ive sometimes seen stars so far ive avoided falling in but who knows one day maybe ill hurtle through the layer between this universe and that and find myself a meteor a shooting star falling into the gravity well of a far planet what if a meteor changed its mind about falling would the universe allow it only if the rock fell under the sway of another imperative that lifted it beyond gravitys grasp but where in that endless sky would it find the rift from which it had emerged it would have to wander searching until the journey became an end in itself and then one day when the journey had changed it beyond recognition it would find the rift and it would stand on the lip of it wondering should i return but i am not a rock i am a person slowly ripening in the sun of this world like a pear on a tree i am not hard i am not protected by rocky layers still i cannot soar through your sky without burning theories of probability what the actualizer did was change probabilities so sometimes things that were highly improbable like walking through a wall or tossing five thousand coins so that heads came up every timeall those things could become much more likely birha thought that in some sense people had always known about the other branches of the kalpavriksh so many of humankinds fantasies about the magical and the impossible were simply imaginative leaps into different regions of the cosmic tree but to go to the place of your imagining in the fleshthat wasnt possible before the actualizers discovery if you adjusted the parameters the actualizer would tweak the probability amplitudes to make your fairytale universe or perhaps it only opened a portal to an already existing one whats the difference so much for you entropy for heat death for death make it more likely that you live from fatal cancer than an ant bite but you couldnt always predict how the amplitudes would work for complex systems like universes and whether programming in coarse features you desired would give too much creative freedom to subsystems resulting in surprises beyond imagining and not always pleasant ones thus a mythology had already grown around the actualizer detailing the possible and impossible other universes and their dangers one madeup story related how they put in the parameters the universal physical constants and the wavefunction behavior in space and time and there came to be an instability in the matter of that universe that made people explode like supernovas when they touched each other with love it was a fanciful lie but it made a great opera in her idle moments birha wondered whether there was a curtain through which she could slip to find the place that always stays still amid the shifting cosmi like the eye of a storm but the foghorn trees were calling in the rain and she was nodding over a bowl of soup like the old woman she was she looked at the veins standing out on the backs of her hands and the thickjointed fingers and thought of the body her universe which was not a closed system at all was there any system that was completely closed not in this universe at least where the most insulated of systems must interact with its environment if only very slowly so was our universe completely disconnected from the others or did they bleed into each other exchange something not energy in any form we recognized perhaps but something more subtle like dreams she wanted to know what connected the universes she wanted to step back from it all and see the kalpavriksh in its entirety but she was caught in it as surely as anyone else a participantobserver who must deduce the grand structure of the cosmic tree from within it who must work at it while being caught in it a worm in a twig a fly in amber to feel the knowing the learning like a new intimacy a love all matter is wavelike in some sense she told the dog the actualizer generates waves and through interference changes the probability amplitudes the tiny bubble universe so formed then resonates with an existing universe with the same properties and a doorway opens between them the dog sighed as though this was pass√© which in a way it was and wagged his tail a rumination dozing in the sun one day i dreamed i was the light falling off the edge of a leaf nice and straight but for the lacy diffraction at the edge at night i flew into the clouds to the well of stars and became a piece of the void a bit of dark velvet stitched on to the sky in the afternoon i am just an old woman dozing in the sun with a yellow dog sitting beside her wondering about stars worried about the universes if i could be the tap of your shoe the glance out of the corner of your eye when you see that man or this woman if i could be the curled lip of the snarling arboril or a mote in the eye of a dog what would i be if i were to be any of this i am myself and yet not so i contain multitudes and am a part of something larger i am a cell the size of a planet swimming in the void of the night when they left after the actualizers discovery it became a subject of study a thing to explore and ultimately an industry dealing in dreams streams of adventurers dreamers and wouldbe suicides people dissatisfied with their lives went through the actualizer to find the universe that suited them better the actualizer became a wishfulfillment machine opening a path to a universe just like this one but with your personal parameters adjusted ever so slightly the complexity matrices shifted just so this was actually not possible manipulating individual metaworldlines was technically an unsolved problem but tell that to the dreamers among the last to go were the people who had worked with birha her colleagues and students they claimed not to be deceived by the dreammerchants their excuse was academic but they went like so many other people into the void the exodus left certain towns and regions thinly populated some planets abandoned imagine being dissatisfied enough to want to change not towns or planets but entire universes it was all birha could do in the early days to stand there and watch the insanity until finally her dear companions were sundered from her by space time and whatever boundary kept one universe from another some people came back but they were strangers probably from other planets in her universe she had discovered the infinite branches of the cosmic tree but it was not hers to claim in any way she was the only one who wouldnt travel its endless ways who knew how long her erstwhile companions would be gone or in what shape theyd return if they returned she was too old to travel and she liked the pleasures of small things like tinkering with the tuning on the poeticas designing and constructing new ones and sipping the pale tea in the morning she liked watching the yellow dog chase firelings but also she was a prickly old woman conservative as they come about universes and parameters and she liked this one just fine thank you she liked the world on which she lived with the sevenyear daycycle no she wouldnt go she was too obstinate and she disapproved of this meddling with the natural unfolding of things besides there was the elegance of death the neatness of it the way nothings wasted after it seemed as though only in this universe was death real she liked to sit on the sunny doorstep and talk to the dog about it all dogs she thought dont need other universes they are already perfect for the one in which they exist she wondered if humans were refugees from some lost other branch of the tree which is why we were so restless always dissatisfied going from planet to planet galaxy to galaxy branch to branch of the cosmic tree and maybe rewriting our own lifehistories of whathasbeen but we are not all like that there have always been people who are like the dog like birha perfectly belonging in the worlds of this universe a rumination on poeticas a poetica consists of a series of suspended rods or wires under tension mounted vertically on a frame a sounding stick run by an ingenious mechanism of gears and a winding mechanism not unlike an oldfashioned clock brushes over the rods at a varying speed forward and backward a series of levers controls which rod or wire is struck while this instrument can be designed to be played by an adept it can also be fully automated by the mechanism which is built to last the enormous ones on public display recount the histories and great epic poems of the people and are made of wood and stone and metal some kinds are designed to be played by the wind but in these instruments the sounds and therefore the meanings are always new and ambiguous it took me years to learn the musical language of the aliens and more years to learn to build miniature poeticas to sound these ruminations i have had to interpolate and invent new syllables new chords and phrases in order to tell my story there are no words in their language for some of what i feel and think and similarly there are sounds in their tongue ill never understand we call them aliens but this is their world we took it from them we are the strangers the interlopers the aliens birhas loves so birha waits watching the clouds gather over the university ramparts walking every day to the abandoned laboratory where her calculations give her both frustration and pleasure following the probability distribution of a single metaworldline is tremendously difficult through the skeins and threads of possibility that arc across the simulators threedimensional resultspace she can discern several answers that fit the constraints a problem with a multiplicity of answers as scattered as stars rudrak will be back in or or cycles or in or or cycles she is out of temper with herself and the metauniverse at large as she goes down the slope in the clouddarkness that passes for evening tripping a little bit because she wants to be in the stone house before the rain starts it occurs to her that her irritation signifies love for thirru for the man who temporarily attracted her for the lesser loves of all the years after for rudrak for all her longgone colleagues and students for the yellow dog who lives with her for the village girl who brings the evening meal and cleans up in silence for timmars rock for the aliens and their gift to her for the cloud forest for that evergiving tree the cosmic kalpavriksh and especially her branch of it and for death who waits for her as she waits for rudrak as she thinks this her impatience at rudraks nonarrival dissipates the way the mist does when the sun comes out in the stone house she is out of breath her chest hurts there is an aroma of warm food and the yellow dog looks up from where he is lying and wags his tail lazily she sits down to eat dropping bits for the dog sipping the pale tea she thinks how it might be good for her to go out when the time comes into the deep forest and let her life be taken by a stinging deathvine as is the custom among some of the natives the vine brings a swift painless death wrapping the body in a shell of silken threads until all the juices are absorbed the rest is released to become part of the rich humus of the forest floor she feels like giving herself back to the world that gave her so much even though she was not born here it is comforting to think of dying in this way the yellow dog will be happy enough with the village girl and the old stone house will eventually be overcome by the forest the wind will have to learn to play the poeticas and then it will interpolate its own story with hers only closed systems are lonely and there is no such thing as a closed system three days later as the bell for morning tolls there is a knock on the door there is a man standing there a stranger noit takes her a moment to recognize rudrak with his customary attitude of bewilderment and anxiety the change is just enough to render him not quite familiar more silver hairs a shirt of a different fashion in blue with an embroidered sash hes taller stoops a little and the face is different too in a way that she cant quite explain in that long moment of recognition the kalpavriksh speaks to her the mistake she had made in her calculations was to assume that through all the changes between universes through space and through time rudrak would be rudrak and birha birha and ubbiri would always remain ubbiri but finally shes seen it identity is neither invariant nor closed no wonder the answers had so much scatter in them the truth as always is more subtle and more beautiful birha takes a deep breath of gratitude feels her death only a few tendays away im looking for ubbiri says this almoststranger this new rudrak his accent is almost perfect she ushers him in and he looks around at the pale sunlight falling on the long table with the poeticas which are sounding softly his look of anxiety fades for a moment to be replaced by wonder this looks familiar he says have i been here before ten sigmas paul melkos fiction has appeared in various magazines and anthologies singularitys ring his first novel was released from tor in and that same year a science fiction collection ten sigmas and other unlikelihoods was released from fairwood press his work was nominated for the sturgeon nebula and hugo awards in his second novela parallel worlds storywas the walls of the universe and the sequel the broken universe came out in june at first we do not recognize the face as such one eye is swollen shut the flesh around it livid the nose is crusted with blood above the lip flecked with blackred and the mouth taped with duct tape that does not contrast enough with her pale skin it does not register at first as a human face no face should be peeking from behind the drivers seat no face should look like that so at first we do not recognize it until one of us realizes and we all look for some the truck isnt even there and we stand frozen at the sight we have seen the street outside the bookstore is empty of anything but a pedestrian or two there is no tractor trailer rumbling down sandusky street no diesel gas engine to disturb the languid spring day in some worlds the truck is there past us or there coming down the road in some it is red in some it is blue and in others it is black in the one where the girl is looking out the window at us it is metallic maroon with white script on the door that says earl there is just one world where the girl lifts her broken gagged face and locks her one good eye on me there is just one where earl reaches behind him and pulls the girl from sight in that world earl looks at me his thick face and brown eyes expressionless the truck begins to slow and that me disappears from our consciousness sundered by circumstance no i did not use my tremendous power for the good of mankind i used it to steal the intellectual property of a person who exists in one world and pass it off as my own in another i used my incredible ability to steal songs and stories and publish them as my own in a million different worlds i did not warn police about terrorist attacks or fires or earthquakes i dont even read the papers i lived in a house in a town that is sometimes called delaware sometimes follett sometimes mingo always in a house on the corner of williams and ripley i lived there modestly in my twobedroom house sometimes with a pine in front sometimes with a dogwood writing down songs that i hear on the radio in other worlds telling stories that ive read somewhere else in the worlds where the truck has passed us we look at the license plate on the truck framed in silver naked women and wonder what to do there is a pay phone nearby perhaps on this corner perhaps on that we can call the police and say we saw the girl once and that self is already gone to us how do we know that there is a girl gagged and bound in any of these trucks we just saw the one a part of us recognizes this rationalization for the cowardice it is we have played this game before we know that an infinite number of possibilities exist but that our combined existence hovers around a huge multidimensional probability distribution if we saw the girl in one universe then probably she was there in an infinite number of other universes and safe in as many other worlds i think for those of us where the truck has passed us the majority of us step into the street to go to the bagel shop across the way some fraction of us turn to look for a phone and they are broken from us their choice shaking them loose from our collective i amwe areomniscient at least a bit i can do a parlor trick for any friend let another of me open the envelope and see whats inside so we can amaze those around us usually we will be right one of me can flip over the first card and the rest of me will pronounce it for what it is ace of hearts four of clubs ten of clubs probably we are right for all fiftytwo at least fifty of them we can avoid accidents angry people cars or at least most of us can perhaps one of us takes the hit for the rest one of us is hit first or sees the punch being thrown so that the rest of us can ride the probability wave for some of us the truck shifts gears shuddering as it passes us earl bill tony irma look down at us or not and the cab is past us the trailer is metallic aluminum always i feel our apprehension more of us have fallen away today than ever before the choice to make a phone call has reduced us by a sixth the rest of us wonder what we should do more of us memorize the license plate of earls truck turn to find a phone and disappear when we were a child we had a kitten named cocoa in every universe it had the same name it liked to climb trees and sometimes it couldnt get back down again once it crawled to the very top of the maple tree out front and we only knew it was up there by its hysterical mewing dad wouldnt climb up hell figure it out or we waited down there until dusk we knew that if we climbed the tree we would be hurt some of us had tried it and failed disappearing after breaking arms legs wrists even necks we waited not even going in to dinner we waited with some neighborhood kids some there because they liked cocoa and some there because they wanted to see a spectacle finally the wind picked up we saw one cocoa fall through the dark green leaves a few feet away breaking its neck on the sidewalk we felt a shock of sorrow but the rest of us were dodging our arms outstretched and we caught the kitten as it plummets cushioning howd you do that someone asked in a million universes i realized then that i was different we step back on the sidewalk waiting for the truck to pass waiting to get the license plate so we can call the police anonymously the police might be able to stop earl with a road block they could stop him up us a few miles if they believed us if earl didnt kill the girl first if she wasnt already dead my stomach lurched we couldnt help thinking of the horror that the girl must have faced must be facing giving the license plate to the police wouldnt be enough we step into the street and wave our hands flagging earl down we once dated a woman a beautiful woman with chestnut hair that fell to the middle of her back we dated for several years and finally became engaged in one of the worlds just one she started to change grew angry then elated then just empty the rest of us watched in horror as she took a knife to us just once in one universe while in a million others she compassionately helped our retching self to the kitchen sink she didnt understand why i broke off the engagement but then she didnt know the things i did earls cab shudders as he slams on the brakes his cb mic slips loose and knocks the windshield he grabs his steering wheel his shoulders massive with exertion we stand there our shopping bag dropped by the side of road slowly waving our hands back and forth in a handful of worlds the tractor trailer slams through us and we are rattled by my death but we know he will be caught there for vehicular manslaughter perhaps and then they will find the girl in almost all the worlds though earls semi comes to a halt a few inches from us a few feet we look up over the chrome grill past the hood ornament a womans head like on a seagoing vessel of old and into earls eyes he reaches up and lets loose with his horn we clap our hands over our ears and in some universes we stumble to the sidewalk allowing earl to grind his truck into first and rumble away but mostly we stand there not moving it didnt matter who was president or who won the world series in sum it was the same world for each of us and so we existed together on top of each other like a stack of us all living together within a deck of cards each decision that created a subtly different universe created another of us another of a nearly infinite number of mes who added just a fraction more to our intellect and understanding we were not a god one of us once thought he was and soon he was no longer with us he couldnt have shared our secret we werent scared of that who would have believed him and now that he was alonefor there could only be a handful of us who might have such delusionsthere could be no harm to the rest of us we were worlds away finally the horn stops and we look up our ears benumbed to see earl yelling at us we cant hear what he says but we recognize on his lips mother fucker and son of a bitch thats fine we need him angry to incite him we give him the bird he bends down reaching under his seat he slaps a metal wrench against his open palm his door opens and he steps down we wait where we are earl is a large man sixfour and weighing at least three hundred pounds he has a belly but his chest and neck are massive black sideburns adorn his face or it is clearly shaven or he has a mustache in all worlds his dead eyes watch us as if we are a cow and he is the butcher i am slight just fivenine one hundred and sixty pounds but as he swings the wrench we dodge inside it as if we know where it is going to be we do of course for it has shattered our skull in a hundred worlds enough for the rest of us to anticipate the move he swings and we dodge again twice more and each time a few of us are sacrificed we are suddenly uncomfortable at the losses we are the consciousness of millions of mes but every one of us that dies is a real instance gone forever every death diminishes us we can not wait for the police now we must save as much of ourself as we can we dodge again spinning past him sacrificing selves to dance around him as if he is a dance partner we have worked with for a thousand years we climb the steps to the cab slide inside slam the door and lock it i am a composite of all versions of myself i can think in a million ways at once problems become picking the best choice of all choices i could ever have picked i can not see the future or the past but i can see the present with a billion eyes and decide the safest course the one that keeps the most of me together i am a massively parallel human in the worlds where the sleeper is empty we sit quietly for the police to arrive weaving a story that they might believe while earl glares at us from the street these selves fade away from those where the girl is trussed in the back tied with wire that cuts her wrists and gagged with duct tape she is dead in some her face livid with bruises and burns in others she is alive and conscious and watches us with blue bloodshot eyes the cab smells of people living there too long of sex of blood in the universes where earl has abducted and raped this young woman he does not stand idly on the sidewalk but rather smashes his window open with the wrench the second blow catches my forehead as i have no place to dodge and i think as my mind shudders that i am one of the sacrificed ones one of those who has failed so that the rest of us might survive but then i realize that it is most of us who have been hit only a small percentage have managed to dodge the blow the rest of us roll to our back and kick at earls hand as it reaches in to unlock the cab door his wrist rakes the broken safety glass and he cries out though still manages to pop the lock i crab backwards across the seat flailing my legs at him there are no options here all of my selves are fighting for our lives or dying a single blow takes half of us another takes a third of those that are left soon my mind is a cloud i am perhaps ten thousand slowwitted no longer omniscient a blow lands and i collapse against the door of the cab i am just me there is just one empty my body refuses to move as earl loops a wire around my wrists and ankles he does it perfunctorilyhe wants to move to get out of the middle of sandusky streetbut it is enough to leave me helpless on the passenger side floor i can see a halfeaten big mac and a can of diet coke my face grinds against small stones and dirt i am alone there is just me and i am befuddled my mind works like cold honey ive failed we all did and now we will die like the poor girl in the back alone my vision shifts and i see the cab from behind earls head from the sleeping cab i realize that i am seeing it from a self who has been beaten and tossed into the back this self is dying but i can see through his eyes as the blood seeps out of him for a moment our worlds are in sync his eyes lower and i spot the knife a hunting knife with a serrated edge brown with blood it has fallen under the passengers chair in his universe under the chair i have my back against my hands are bound behind me but i reach as far as i can under the seat its not far enough in my awkward position my selfs eyes lock on the knife not far from where my fingers should be but i have no guarantee that its even in my own universe at all we are no longer at the center of the curve my choices have brought me far away from the selves now drinking coffee and eating bagels across the street from the bookstore earl looks down at me curses he kicks me and pushes me farther against the passenger seat something nicks my finger i reach gently around it it is the knife i take moments to maneuver it so that i hold it in my palm outstretched like the spine of a stegosaurus i cut myself and i feel the hilt get slippery i palm my hand against the gritty carpet and position the knife again i wait for earl to begin a right turn then i pull my knees in roll onto my chest and launch myself back first with knife extended at earl in the only universe that i exist in the knife enters his thigh the truck caroms off something in the street and i am jerked harder against earl he is screaming yelling pawing at his thigh his fist slams against me and i fall to the floor as he turns his anger on me the truck slams hard into something and earl is flung against the steering wheel he remains that way unconscious until the woman in the back struggles forward and leans heavily on the knife hilt in his leg and slices until she finds a vein or artery i lie in earls blood until the police arrive i am alone again the self who had spotted the knife gone the young woman came to see me while i mended in a hospital bed there was an air of notoriety about me and nurses and doctors were extremely pleasant it was not just the events which had unfolded on the streets of their small town but that i was the noted author of such famous songs as love as a star and romance ho and muskrat love the uncovering of earls exploits including a grim laboratory in his home town of pittsburgh added fuel to the fire she seemed to have mended a bit better than i her face now a face her body and spirit whole again she was stronger than i i felt when i saw her smile my body was healing the cuts around my wrist and ankle the shattered bone in my arm but the sundering of my consciousness had left me dull broken i listened to songs on the radio other peoples songs and could not help wondering in how many worlds there had been no knife there had been no escape perhaps i was the only one of us who reached the cab to survive perhaps i was the only one who had saved the woman thanks she said thanks for what you did i reached for something to say something witty urbane nonchalant from my mind but there was nothing there but me uh youre welcome she smiled you could have been killed she said i looked away she didnt realize that i had been well sorry for bothering you she said quickly listen i said drawing her back im sorry i didnt i wanted to apologize for not saving more of her for not ending the lives of more earls im sorry i didnt save you sooner it didnt make any sense and i felt myself flush she smiled and said it was enough she leaned in to kiss me i am disoriented as i feel her lips brush my right cheek and also my left and a third kiss lightly on my lips i am looking at her in three views a triptych slightly askew and i manage a smile then three smiles and then a laugh three laughs we have saved her at least once that is enough in one of the three universes we inhabit a woman is singing a catchy tune on the radio i start to write the lyrics down with my good hand then stop enough of that we three decide there are other things to do now other choices magic for beginners kelly link is the author of three collections pretty monsters magic for beginners and stranger things happen her short stories have won three nebula awards a hugo a locus and a world fantasy award she was born in miami florida and once won a free trip around the world by answering the question why do you want to go around the world because you cant go through it link lives in northampton massachusetts where she and her husband gavin j grant run small beer press and play pingpong in they started the occasional zine lady churchills rosebud wristlet fox is a television character and she isnt dead yet but she will be soon shes a character on a television show called the library youve never seen the library on tv but i bet you wish you had in one episode of the library a boy named jeremy mars fifteen years old sits on the roof of his house in plantagenet vermont its eight oclock at night a school night and he and his friend elizabeth should be studying for the math quiz that their teacher mr cliff has been hinting at all week long instead theyve sneaked out onto the roof its cold they dont know everything they should know about x when x is the square root of y they dont even know y they ought to go in but theres nothing good on tv and the sky is very beautiful they have jackets on and up in the corners where the sky begins are patches of white in the darkness still where theres snow up on the mountains down in the trees around the house some animal is making a small anxious sound why cry why cry whats that one elizabeth says pointing at a squarish configuration of stars thats the parking structure jeremy says and right next to that is the big shopping mall and the lesser shopping mall and thats orion right orion the bargain hunter jeremy squints up no orion is over there thats the austrian bodybuilder that thing thats sort of wrapped around his lower leg is the amorous cephalopod the hungry hungry octopus it cant make up its mind whether it should eat him or make crazy eightlegged love to him you know that myth right of course elizabeth says is karl going to be pissed off that we didnt invite him over to study karls always pissed off about something jeremy says jeremy is resolutely resisting a notion about elizabeth why are they sitting up here was it his idea or was it hers are they friends are they just two friends sitting on the roof and talking or is jeremy supposed to try to kiss her he thinks maybe hes supposed to kiss her if he kisses her will they still be friends he cant ask karl about this karl doesnt believe in being helpful karl believes in mocking jeremy doesnt even know if he wants to kiss elizabeth hes never thought about it until right now i should go home elizabeth says there could be a new episode on right now and we wouldnt even know someone would call and tell us jeremy says my mom would come up and yell for us his mother is something else jeremy doesnt want to worry about but he does he does jeremy mars knows a lot about the planet mars although hes never been there he knows some girls and yet he doesnt know much about them he wishes there were books about girls the way there are books about mars that you could observe the orbits and brightness of girls through telescopes without appearing to be perverted once jeremy read a book about mars out loud to karl except he kept replacing the word mars with the word girls karl cracked up every time jeremys mother is a librarian his father writes books jeremy reads biographies he plays trombone in a marching band he jumps hurdles while wearing a school tracksuit jeremy is also passionately addicted to a television show in which a renegade librarian and magician named fox is trying to save her world from thieves murderers cabalists and pirates jeremy is a geek although hes a telegenic geek somebody should make a tv show about him jeremys friends call him germ although he would rather be called mars his parents havent spoken to each other in a week jeremy doesnt kiss elizabeth the stars dont fall out of the sky and jeremy and elizabeth dont fall off the roof either they go inside and finish their homework someone who jeremy has never met never even heard ofa woman named cleo baldrickhas died lots of people so far have managed to live and die without making the acquaintance of jeremy mars but cleo baldrick has left jeremy mars and his mother something strange in her will a phone booth on a state highway some forty miles outside of las vegas and a las vegas wedding chapel the wedding chapel is called hells bells jeremy isnt sure what kind of people get married there bikers maybe supervillains freaks and satanists jeremys mother wants to tell him something its probably something about las vegas and about cleo baldrick whoit turns outwas his mothers greataunt jeremy never knew his mother had a greataunt his mother is a mysterious person but it may be on the other hand something concerning jeremys father for a week and a half now jeremy has managed to avoid finding out what his mother is worrying about its easy not to find out things if you try hard enough theres band practice he has overslept on weekdays in order to rule out conversations at breakfast and at night he climbs up on the roof with his telescope to look at stars to look at mars his mother is afraid of heights she grew up in la its clear that whatever it is she has to tell jeremy is not something she wants to tell him as long as he avoids being alone with her hes safe but its hard to keep your guard up at all times jeremy comes home from school feeling as if he has passed the math test after all jeremy is an optimist maybe theres something good on tv he settles down with the remote control on one of his fathers pet couches oversized and reupholstered in an orangejuicecolored corduroy that makes it appear as if the couch has just escaped from a maximum security prison for criminally insane furniture this couch looks as if its hobby is devouring interior decorators jeremys father is a horror writer so no one should be surprised if some of the couches he reupholsters are hideous and eldritch jeremys mother comes into the room and stands above the couch looking down at him germ she says she looks absolutely miserable which is more or less how she has looked all week the phone rings and jeremy jumps up as soon as he hears elizabeths voice he knows she says germ its on channel fortytwo im taping it she hangs up its on jeremy says channel fortytwo now his mother has the television on by the time he sits down being a librarian she has a particular fondness for the library i should go tell your dad she says but instead she sits down beside jeremy and of course its now all the more clear something is wrong between jeremys parents but the library is on and fox is about to rescue prince wing when the episode ends he can tell without looking over that his mother is crying dont mind me she says and wipes her nose on her sleeve do you think shes really dead but jeremy cant stay around and talk jeremy has wondered about what kind of television shows the characters in television shows watch television characters almost always have better haircuts funnier friends simpler attitudes toward sex they marry magicians win lotteries have affairs with women who carry guns in their purses curious things happen to them on an hourly basis jeremy and i can forgive their haircuts we just want to ask them about their television shows just like always its elizabeth who worked out in the nick of time that the new episode was on everyone will show up at elizabeths house afterward for the postmortem this time it really is a postmortem why did prince wing kill fox how could fox let him do it fox is ten times stronger jeremy runs all the way slapping his old track shoes against the sidewalk for the pleasure of the jar for the sweetness of the sting he likes the rough cottony ache in his lungs his coach says you have to be partmasochist to enjoy something like running its nothing to be ashamed of its something to exploit talis opens the door she grins at him although he can tell that shes been crying too shes wearing a tshirt that says im so goth i shit tiny vampires hey jeremy says talis nods talis isnt so goth at least not as far as jeremy or anyone else knows talis just has a lot of tshirts shes an enigma wrapped in a mysterious tshirt a woman once said to calvin coolidge mr president i bet my husband that i could get you to say more than two words coolidge said you lose jeremy can imagine talis as calvin coolidge in a former life or maybe she was one of those dogs that dont bark a basenji or a rock a dolmen there was an episode of the library once with some sinister dancing dolmens in it elizabeth comes up behind talis if talis is ungoth then elizabeth is ballerina goth she likes hearts and skulls and black penink tattoos pink tulle and hello kitty when the woman who invented hello kitty was asked why hello kitty was so popular she said because she has no mouth elizabeths mouth is small her lips are chapped that was the most horrible episode ever i cried and cried she says hey germ so i was telling talis about how you inherited a gas station a phone booth jeremy says in las vegas this greatgreataunt died and theres a wedding chapel too hey germ karl says yelling from the living room shut up and get in here the commercial with the talking cats is on shut it karl jeremy says he goes in and sits on karls head you have to show karl whos boss once in a while amy turns up last she was in the next town over buying comics she hasnt seen the new episode and so they all shut it except for talis who has not been saying anything at all and elizabeth puts on the tape in the previous episode of the library masked piratemagicians said they would sell prince wing a cure for the spell that infested faithful margarets hair with miniature wicked firebreathing golems faithful margarets hair keeps catching fire but she refuses to shave it off her hair is the source of all her magic the piratemagicians lured prince wing into a trap so obvious that it seemed impossible it could really be a trap on the onehundredandfortieth floor of the free peoples worldtree library the piratemagicians used finger magic to turn prince wing into a porcelain teapot put two earl grey tea bags into the teapot and poured in boiling water toasted the eternally postponed and overdue reign of the forbidden books drained their tea in one gulp belched hurled their souvenir pirate mugs to the ground and then shattered the teapot which had been prince wing into hundreds of pieces then the wicked piratemagicians swept the pieces of both prince wing and collectable mugs carelessly into a wooden cigar box buried the box in the angela carter memorial park on the seventeenth floor of the worldtree library and erected a statue of george washington above it so then fox had to go looking for prince wing when she finally discovered the park on the seventeenth floor of the library the george washington statue stepped down off his plinth and fought her tooth and nail literally tooth and nail and theyd all agreed that there was something especially nightmarish about a biting scratching lifesized statue of george washington with long pointed metal fangs that threw off sparks when he gnashed them the statue of george washington bit foxs pinky finger right off just like gollum biting frodos finger off on the top of mount doom but of course once the statue tasted foxs magical blood it fell in love with fox it would be her ally from now on in the new episode the actor playing fox is a young latina actress whom jeremy mars thinks he recognizes she has been a snotty but wellintentioned fourthfloor librarian in an episode about an epidemic of food poisoning that triggered bouts of invisibility andor levitation and she was also a lovelorn suicidal bear cult priestess in the episode where prince wing discovered his mother was one of the forbidden books this is one of the best things about the library the way the cast swaps parts all except for faithful margaret and prince wing who are only ever themselves faithful margaret and prince wing are the love interests and the main characters and therefore inevitably the most boring characters although amy has a crush on prince wing fox and the dashingbuttreacherous piratemagician two devils are never played by the same actor twice although in the twentythird episode of the library the same woman played them both jeremy supposes that the casting could be perpetually confusing but instead it makes your brain catch on fire its magical you always know fox by her costume the toosmall green tshirt the long full skirts she wears to hide her tail by her dramatic hand gestures and body language by the soft breathysqueaky voice the actors use when they are fox fox is funny dangerous badtempered flirtatious greedy untidy accidentprone graceful and has a mysterious past in some episodes fox is played by male actors but she always sounds like fox and shes always beautiful every episode you think that this fox surely is the most beautiful fox there could ever be and yet the fox of the next episode will be even more heartbreakingly beautiful on television its night in the free peoples worldtree library all the librarians are asleep tucked into their coffins their scabbards priestholes buttonholes pockets hidden cupboards between the pages of their enchanted novels moonlight pours through the high arched windows of the library and between the aisles of shelves into the park fox is on her knees clawing at the muddy ground with her bare hands the statue of george washington kneels beside her helping so thats fox right amy says nobody tells her to shut up it would be pointless amy has a large heart and an even larger mouth when it rains amy rescues worms off the sidewalk when you get tired of having a secret you tell amy understand amy isnt that much stupider than anyone else in this story its just that she thinks out loud elizabeths mother comes into the living room hey guys she says hi jeremy did i hear something about your mother inheriting a wedding chapel yes maam jeremy says in las vegas las vegas elizabeths mom says i won three hundred bucks once in las vegas spent it on a helicopter ride over the grand canyon so how many times can you guys watch the same episode in one day but she sits down to watch too do you think shes really dead whos dead amy says nobody says anything jeremy isnt sure hes ready to see this episode again so soon anyway especially not with amy he goes upstairs and takes a shower elizabeths family have a large and distracting selection of shampoos they dont mind when jeremy uses their bathroom jeremy and karl and elizabeth have known each other since the first day of kindergarten amy and talis are a year younger the five have not always been friends except for jeremy and karl who have talis is famously a loner she doesnt listen to music as far as anyone knows she doesnt wear significant amounts of black she isnt particularly good or bad at math or english and she doesnt drink debate knit or refuse to eat meat if she keeps a blog shes never admitted it to anyone the library made jeremy and karl and talis and elizabeth and amy friends no one else in school is as passionately devoted besides they are all the children of former hippies and the town is small they all live within a few blocks of each other in rundown victorians with high ceilings and ranch houses with sunken living rooms and although they have not always been friends growing up theyve gone skinnydipping in lakes on summer nights and broken bones on each others trampolines once during an argument about dog names elizabeth who is hottempered tried to run jeremy over with her tenspeed bicycle and once a year ago karl got drunk on greenapple schnapps at a party and tried to kiss talis and once for five months in the seventh grade karl and jeremy communicated only through angry emails written in all caps im not allowed to tell you what they fought about now the five are inseparable invincible they imagine that life will always be like thislike a television show in eternal syndicationthat they will always have each other they use the same vocabulary they borrow each others books and music they share lunches and they never say anything when jeremy comes over and takes a shower they all know jeremys father is eccentric hes supposed to be eccentric hes a novelist when jeremy comes back downstairs amy is saying ive always thought there was something wicked about prince wing hes a dork and he looks like he has bad breath i never really liked him karl says we dont know the whole story yet maybe he found out something about fox while he was a teapot elizabeths mom says hes under a spell i bet you anything theyll be talking about it all week talis is in the kitchen making a velveetaandpickle sandwich so what did you think jeremy says its like having a hobby only more pointless trying to get talis to talk is fox really dead dont know talis says then she says i had a dream jeremy waits talis seems to be waiting too she says about you then shes silent again there is something dreamlike about the way that she makes a sandwich as if she is really making something that isnt a sandwich at all as if shes making something far more meaningful and mysterious or as if soon he will wake up and realize that there are no such things as sandwiches you and fox talis says the dream was about the two of you she told me to tell you to call her she gave me a phone number she was in trouble she said you were in trouble she said to keep in touch weird jeremy says mulling this over hes never had a dream about the library he wonders who was playing fox in taliss dream he had a dream about talis once but it isnt the kind of dream that youd ever tell anybody about they were just sitting together not saying anything even taliss tshirt hadnt said anything talis was holding his hand it didnt feel like a dream talis says so what was the phone number jeremy says i forgot talis says when i woke up i forgot kurts mother works in a bank taliss father has a karaoke machine in his basement and he knows all the lyrics to like a virgin and holiday as well as the lyrics to all the songs from godspell and cabaret taliss mother is a licensed therapist who composes multiplechoice personality tests for womens magazines discover which television character you resemble most etc amys parents met in a commune in ithaca her name was galadriel moon shuyler before her parents came to their senses and had it changed legally everyone is sworn to secrecy about this which is ironic considering that this is amy but jeremys father is gordon strangle mars he writes novels about giant spiders giant leeches giant moths and once notably a giant carnivorous rosebush who lives in a mansion in upstate new york and falls in love with a plucky teenaged girl with a heart murmur saint bernardsized spiders chase his characters cars down dark bumpy country roads they fight the spiders off with badminton rackets lawn tools and fireworks the novels with spiders are all bestsellers once a gordon strangle mars fan broke into the marsess house the fan stole several german first editions of gordon strangles novels a hairbrush and a used mug in which there were two ancient dehydrated tea bags the fan left behind a betrayed and abusive letter on a series of postit notes and the manuscript of his own novel told from the point of view of the iceberg that sank the titanic jeremy and his mother read the manuscript out loud to each other it begins the iceberg knew it had a destiny jeremys favorite bit happens when the iceberg sees the doomed ship drawing nearer and remarks plaintively oh my does not the captain know about my large and impenetrable bottom jeremy discovered later that the novelwriting fan had put gordon strangle marss used tea bags and hairbrush up for sale on ebay where someone paid fortytwo dollars and sixtyeight cents which was not only deeply creepy but jeremy still feels somewhat cheap but of course this is appropriate as jeremys father is famously stingy and just plain weird about money gordon strangle mars once spent eight thousand dollars on a japanese singing toilet jeremys friends love that toilet jeremys mother has a painting of a woman wearing a red dress by some artist jeremy can never remember who jeremys father gave her that painting the woman is beautiful and she looks right at you as if youre the painting not her as if youre beautiful the woman has an apple in one hand and a knife in the other when jeremy was little he used to dream about eating that apple apparently the painting is worth more than the whole house and everything else in the house including the singing toilet but art and toilets aside the marses buy most of their clothes at thrift stores jeremys father clips coupons on the other hand when jeremy was twelve and begged his parents to send him to baseball camp in florida his father ponied up and on jeremys last birthday his father gave him a couch reupholstered in several dozen yards of heavyduty star warsthemed fabric that was a good birthday when his writing is going well gordon strangle mars likes to wake up at am and go out driving he works out new plot lines about giant spiders and keeps an eye out for abandoned couches which he wrestles into the back of his pickup truck then he writes for the rest of the day on weekends he reupholsters the thrownaway couches in remaindered discount fabrics a few years ago jeremy went through his house counting up fourteen couches eight love seats and one rickety chaise lounge that was a few years ago once jeremy had a dream that his father combined his two careers and began reupholstering giant spiders all lights in all rooms of the mars house are on fifteenminute timers in case jeremy or his mother leave a room and forget to turn off a lamp this has caused confusionand sometimes panicon the rare occasions that the marses throw dinner parties everyone thinks that writers are rich but it seems to jeremy that his family is only rich some of the time some of the time they arent whenever gordon mars gets stuck in a gordon strangle mars novel he worries about money he worries that he wont in fact manage to finish the current novel he worries that it will be terrible he worries that no one will buy it and no one will read it and that the readers who do read it will demand to be refunded the cost of the book hes told jeremy that he imagines these angry readers marching on the mars house carrying torches and crowbars it would be easier on jeremy and his mother if gordon mars did not work at home its difficult to shower when you know your father is timing you and thinking dark thoughts about the water bill instead of concentrating on the scene in the current gordon strangle mars novel in which the giant spiders have returned to their old haunts in the trees surrounding the ninth hole of the accursed golf course where they sullenly feast on the pulped entrailjuices of a brace of unlucky poodles and their owner during these periods jeremy showers at school after gym or at his friends houses even though it makes his mother unhappy she says that sometimes you just need to ignore jeremys father she takes especially long showers lots of baths she claims that baths are even nicer when you know that jeremys father is worried about the water bill jeremys mother has a cruel streak what jeremy likes about showers is the way you can stand there surrounded by water and yet in absolutely no danger of drowning and not think about things like whether you screwed up on the spanish assignment or why your mother is looking so worried instead you can think about things like if theres water on mars and whether or not karl is shaving and if so who is he trying to fool and what the statue of george washington meant when it said to fox during their desperate bloody fight you have a long journey ahead of you and everything depends on this and is fox really dead after she dug up the cigar box and after george washington helped her carefully separate out the pieces of tea mug from the pieces of teapot after they glued back together the hundreds of pieces of porcelain when fox turned the ramshackle teapot back into prince wing prince wing looked about a hundred years old and as if maybe there were still a few pieces missing he looked pale when he saw fox he turned even paler as if he hadnt expected her to be standing there in front of him he picked up his leviathan sword which fox had been keeping safe for himthe one which faithful viewers know was carved out of the tooth of a giant ancient sea creature that lived happily and peacefully before prince wing was tricked into killing it in the enchanted underground sea on the third floorand skewered the statue of george washington like a kebab pinning it to a tree he kicked fox in the head knocked her down and tied her to a card catalog he stuffed a handful of moss and dirt into her mouth so she couldnt say anything and then he accused her of plotting to murder faithful margaret by magic he said fox was more deceitful than a forbidden book he cut off foxs tail and her ears and he ran her through with the poisonedged dogheaded knife that he and fox had stolen from his mothers secret house then he left fox there tied to the card catalog limp and bloody her beautiful head hanging down he sneezed prince wing is allergic to swordplay and walked off into the stacks the librarians crept out of their hiding places they untied fox and cleaned off her face they held a mirror to her mouth but the mirror stayed clear and unclouded when the librarians pulled prince wings leviathan sword out of the tree the statue of george washington staggered over and picked up fox in his arms he tucked her ears and tail into the capacious pockets of his birdshitstained verdigris riding coat he carried fox down seventeen flights of stairs past the enchantedanddisagreeable sphinx on the eighth floor past the enchantedandstormy underground sea on the third floor past the evenmoreenchanted checkout desk on the first floor and through the hammeredbrass doors of the free peoples world tree library nobody in the library not in one single episode has ever gone outside the library is full of all the sorts of things that one usually has to go outside to enjoy trees and lakes and grottoes and fields and mountains and precipices and full of indoor things as well like books of course outside the library everything is dusty and red and alien as if george washington has carried fox out of the library and onto the surface of mars i could really go for a nice cold euphoria right now jeremy says he and karl are walking home euphoria is the librarians tonicwhen watchfulness is not enough there are frequently commercials for euphoria on the library although no one is exactly sure what euphoria is for whether it is alcoholic or caffeinated what it tastes like if it is poisonous or delightful or even whether or not its carbonated everyone including jeremy pines for a glass of euphoria once in a while can i ask you a question karl says why do you always say that jeremy says what am i going to say no you cant ask me a question whats up with you and talis karl says what were you talking about in the kitchen jeremy sees that karl has been watchful she had this dream about me he says uneasily so do you like her karl says his chin looks raw jeremy is sure now that karl has tried to shave because remember how i liked her first we were just talking jeremy says so did you shave because i didnt know you had facial hair the idea of you shaving is pathetic karl its like voting republican if we were old enough to vote or farting in music appreciation dont try to change the subject karl says when have you and talis ever had a conversation before one time we talked about a diana wynne jones book that shed checked out from the library she dropped it in the bath accidentally she wanted to know if i could tell my mother jeremy says once we talked about recycling shut up germ karl says besides what about elizabeth i thought you liked elizabeth who said that jeremy says karl is glaring at him amy told me karl says i never told amy i liked elizabeth jeremy says so now amy is a mind reader as well as a blabbermouth what a terrible deadly combination no karl says grudgingly elizabeth told amy that she likes you so i just figured you liked her back elizabeth likes me jeremy says apparently everybody likes you karl says he sounds sorry for himself what is it about you its not like youre all that special your nose is funny looking and you have stupid hair thanks karl jeremy changes the subject do you think fox is really dead he says for good he walks faster so that karl has to almostjog to keep up presently jeremy is much taller than karl and he intends to enjoy this as long as it lasts knowing karl hell either get tall too or else chop jeremy off at the knees theyll use magic karl says or maybe it was all a dream theyll make her alive again ill never forgive them if theyve killed fox and if you like talis ill never forgive you either and i know what youre thinking youre thinking that i think i mean what i say but if push came to shove eventually id forgive you and wed be friends again like in seventh grade but i wouldnt and youre wrong and we wouldnt be we wouldnt ever be friends again jeremy doesnt say anything of course he likes talis he just hasnt realized how much he likes her until recently until today until karl opened his mouth jeremy likes elizabeth too but how can you compare elizabeth and talis you cant elizabeth is elizabeth and talis is talis when you tried to kiss talis she hit you with a boa constrictor he says it had been amys boa constrictor it had probably been an accident karl shouldnt have tried to kiss someone while they were holding a boa constrictor just try to remember what i just said karl says youre free to like anyone you want to anyone except for talis the library has been on television for two years now it isnt a regularly scheduled program sometimes its on two times in the same week and then not on again for another couple of weeks often new episodes debut in the middle of the night there is a large online community who spend hours scanning channels sending out alarms and false alarms fans swap theories tapes files write fanfic elizabeth has rigged up her computer to shout wake up elizabeth the television is on fire when reliable library watchsites discover a new episode the library is a pirate tv show its shown up once or twice on most network channels but usually its on the kind of channels that jeremy thinks of as ghost channels the ones that are just static unless youre paying for several hundred channels of cable there are commercial breaks but the products being advertised are like euphoria they never seem to be real brands or things that you can actually buy often the commercials arent even in english or in any other identifiable language although the jingles are catchy nonsense or not they get stuck in your head episodes of the library have no regular schedule no credits and sometimes not even dialogue one episode of the library takes place inside the top drawer of a card catalog in pitch dark and its all in morse code with subtitles nothing else no one has ever claimed responsibility for inventing the library no one has ever interviewed one of the actors or stumbled across a set film crew or script although in one documentarystyle episode the actors filmed the crew who all wore paper bags on their heads when jeremy gets home his father is making upsidedown pizza in a casserole dish for dinner meeting writers is usually disappointing at best writers who write sexy thrillers arent necessarily sexy or thrilling in person childrens book writers might look more like accountants or axe murderers for that matter horror writers are very rarely scary looking although they are frequently good cooks though gordon strangle mars is scary looking he has long thin fingerscurrently slimy with pizza saucewhich are why he chose strangle for his fake middle name he has whiteblond hair that he tugs on while he writes until it stands straight up he has a bad habit of suddenly appearing beside you when you havent even realized he was in the same part of the house his eyes are deepset and he doesnt blink very often karl says that when you meet jeremys father he looks at you as if he were imagining you bundled up and stuck away in some giant spiders larder which is probably true people who read books probably never bother to wonder if their favorite writers are also good parents why would they gordon strangle mars is a recreational shoplifter he has a special complicated and unspoken arrangement with the local bookstore where in exchange for autographing as many gordon strangle mars novels as they can possibly sell the store allows jeremys father to shoplift books without comment jeremys mother shows up sooner or later and writes a check jeremys feelings about his father are complicated his father is a cheapskate and a petty thief and yet jeremy likes his father his father hardly ever loses his temper with jeremy he is always interested in jeremys life and he gives interesting if confusing advice when jeremy asks for it for example if jeremy asked his father about kissing elizabeth his father might suggest that jeremy not worry about giant spiders when he kisses elizabeth jeremys fathers advice usually has something to do with giant spiders when jeremy and karl werent speaking to each other it was jeremys father who straightened them out he lured karl over and then locked them both into his study he didnt let them out again until they were on speaking terms i thought of a great idea for your book jeremy says what if one of the spiders builds a web on a soccer field across a goal and what if the goalie doesnt notice until the middle of the game could somebody kill one of the spiders with a soccer ball if they kicked it hard enough would it explode or even better the spider could puncture the soccer ball with its massive fangs that would be cool too your mothers out in the garage gordon strangle mars says to jeremy she wants to talk to you oh jeremy says all of a sudden he thinks of fox in taliss dream trying to phone him trying to warn him unreasonably he feels that its his parents fault that fox is dead now as if they have killed her is it about you are you getting divorced i dont know his father says he hunches his shoulders he makes a face its a face that jeremys father makes frequently and yet this face is even more pitiful and guilty than usual what did you do jeremy says did you get caught shoplifting at walmart no his father says did you have an affair no his father says again now he looks disgusted either with himself or with jeremy for asking such a horrible question i screwed up lets leave it at that hows the book coming jeremy says there is something in his fathers voice that makes him feel like kicking something but there are never giant spiders around when you need them i dont want to talk about that either his father says looking if possible even more ashamed go tell your mother dinner will be ready in five minutes maybe you and i can watch the new episode of the library after dinner if you havent already seen it a thousand times do you know the end did mom tell you that fox is oh jeez his father interrupts they killed fox thats the problem with being a writer jeremy knows even the biggest and most startling twists are rarely twists for you you know how every story goes jeremys mother is an orphan jeremys father claims that she was raised by feral silentfilm stars and its true she looks like a heroine out of a harold lloyd movie she has an appealingly disheveled look to her as if someone has either just tied or untied her from a set of train tracks she met gordon mars before he added the strangle and sold his first novel in the food court of a mall in new jersey and fell in love with him before realizing that he was a writer and a recreational shoplifter she didnt read anything hed written until after they were married which was a typically cunning move on jeremys fathers part jeremys mother doesnt read horror novels she doesnt like ghost stories or unexplained phenomena or even the kind of phenomena that require excessively technical explanations for example microwaves airplanes she doesnt like halloween not even halloween candy jeremys father gives her special editions of his novels where the scary pages have been glued together jeremys mother is quiet more often than not her name is alice and sometimes jeremy thinks about how the two quietest people he knows are named alice and talis but his mother and talis are quiet in different ways jeremys mother is the kind of person who seems to be keeping something hidden something secret whereas talis just is a secret jeremys mother could easily turn out to be a secret agent but talis is the death ray or the key to immortality or whatever it is that secret agents have to keep secret hanging out with talis is like hanging out with a teenage black hole jeremys mother is sitting on the floor of the garage beside a large cardboard box she has a photo album in her hands jeremy sits down beside her there are photographs of a cat on a wall and something blurry that looks like a whale or a zeppelin or a loaf of bread theres a photograph of a small girl sitting beside a woman the woman wears a fur collar with a sharp little muzzle four legs a tail and jeremy feels a sudden pang fox is the first dead person that hes ever cared about but shes not real the little girl in the photograph looks utterly blank as if someone has just hit her with a hammer like the person behind the camera has just said smile your parents are dead cleo jeremys mother says pointing to the woman thats cleo she was my mothers aunt she lived in los angeles i went to live with her when my parents died i was four i know ive never talked about her ive never really known what to say about her jeremy says was she nice his mother says she tried to be nice she didnt expect to be saddled with a little girl what an odd word saddled as if she were a horse as if somebody put me on her back and i never got off again she liked to buy clothes for me she liked clothes she hadnt had a happy life she drank a lot she liked to go to movies in the afternoon and to s√©ances in the evenings she had boyfriends some of them were jerks the love of her life was a smalltime gangster he died and she never married she always said marriage was a joke and that life was a bigger joke and it was just her bad luck that she didnt have a sense of humor so its strange to think that all these years she was running a wedding chapel jeremy looks at his mother shes halfsmiling halfgrimacing as if her stomach hurts i ran away when i was sixteen and i never saw her again once she sent me a letter care of your fathers publishers she said shed read all his books and that was how she found me i guess because he kept dedicating them to me she said she hoped i was happy and that she thought about me i wrote back i sent a photograph of you but she never wrote again sounds like an episode of the library doesnt it jeremy says is that what you wanted to tell me dad said you wanted to tell me something thats part of it his mother says i have to go out to las vegas to find out some things about this wedding chapel hells bells i want you to come with me is that what you wanted to ask me jeremy says although he knows theres something else his mother still has that sad halfsmile on her face germ his mother says you know i love your father right why jeremy says what did he do his mother flips through the photo album look she says this was when you were born in the picture his father holds jeremy as if someone has just handed him an enchanted porcelain teapot jeremys father grins but he looks terrified too he looks like a kid a scary scared kid he wouldnt tell me either jeremy says so it has to be pretty bad if youre getting divorced i think you should go ahead and tell me were not getting divorced his mother says but it might be a good thing if you and i went out to las vegas we could stay there for a few months while i sort out this inheritance take care of cleos estate im going to talk to your teachers ive given notice at the library think of it as an adventure she sees the look on jeremys face no im sorry that was a stupid stupid thing to say i know this isnt an adventure i dont want to go jeremy says all my friends are here i cant just go away and leave them that would be terrible all this time hes been preparing himself for the most terrible thing he can imagine hes imagined a conversation with his mother in which his mother reveals her terrible secret and in his imagination hes been calm and reasonable his imaginary parents have wept and asked for his understanding the imaginary jeremy has understood he has imagined himself understanding everything but now as his mother talks jeremys heartbeat speeds up and his lungs fill with air as if he is running he starts to sweat although the floor of the garage is cold he wishes he were sitting up on top of the roof with his telescope there could be meteors invisible to the naked eye careening through the sky hurtling toward earth fox is dead everyone he knows is doomed even as he thinks this he knows hes overreacting but it doesnt help to know this i know its terrible his mother says his mother knows something about terrible so why cant i stay here jeremy says you go sort things out in las vegas and ill stay here with dad why cant i stay here because he put you in a book his mother says she spits the words out he has never heard her sound so angry his mother never gets angry he put you in one of his books i was in his office and the manuscript was on his desk i saw your name and so i picked it up and started reading so what jeremy says hes put me in his books before like stuff ive said like when i was eight and i was running a fever and told him the trees were full of dead people wearing party hats like when i accidentally set fire to his office it isnt like that his mother says its you its you he hasnt even changed your name the boy in the book he jumps hurdles and he wants to be a rocket scientist and go to mars and hes cute and funny and sweet and his best friend elizabeth is in love with him and he talks like you and he looks like you and then he dies jeremy he has a brain tumor and he dies he dies there arent any giant spiders theres just you and you die jeremy is silent he imagines his father writing the scene in his book where the kid named jeremy dies and crying just a little he imagines this jeremy kid jeremy the character who dies poor messedup kid now jeremy and fox have something in common theyre both madeup people theyre both dead elizabeth is in love with me he says just on principle he never believes anything that karl says but if its in a book maybe its true oh whoops his mother says i really didnt want to say that im just so angry at him weve been married for seventeen years i was just four years older than you when i met him jeremy i was nineteen he was only twenty we were babies can you imagine that i can put up with the singing toilet and the shoplifting and the couches and i can put up with him being so weird about money but he killed you jeremy he wrote you into a book and he killed you off and he knows it was wrong too hes ashamed of himself he didnt want me to tell you i didnt mean to tell you jeremy sits and thinks i still dont want to go to las vegas he says to his mother maybe we could send dad there instead his mother says not a bad idea but he can tell shes already planning their itinerary in one episode of the library everyone was invisible you couldnt see the actors you could only see the books and the bookshelves and the study carrels on the fifth floor where the coinoperated wizards come to flirt and practice their spells invisible forbidden books were fighting invisible piratemagicians and the piratemagicians were fighting fox and her friends who were also invisible the fight was clumsy and full of deadly accidents you could hear them fighting shelves were overturned books were thrown invisible people tripped over invisible dead bodies but you didnt find out whod died until the next episode several of the charactersthe accidental sword hairy pete and ptolemy krill who much like the vogons in douglas adamss the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy wrote poetry so bad it killed anyone who read itdisappeared for good and nobody is sure whether theyre dead or not in another episode fox stole a magical drug from the norns a prophetic girl band who headline at a cabaret on the mezzanine of the free peoples worldtree library she accidentally injected it became pregnant and gave birth to a bunch of snakes who led her to the exact shelf where renegade librarians had misshelved an ancient and terrible book of magic which had never been translated until fox asked the snakes for help the snakes writhed and curled on the ground spelling out words letter by letter with their bodies as they translated the book for fox they hissed and steamed they became fiery lines on the ground and then they burnt away entirely fox cried thats the only time anyone has ever seen fox cry ever she isnt like prince wing prince wing is a crybaby the thing about the library is that characters dont come back when they die its as if death is for real so maybe fox really is dead and she really isnt coming back there are a couple of ghosts who hang around the library looking for blood libations but theyve always been ghosts all the way back to the beginning of the show there arent any evil twins or vampires either although someday hopefully there will be evil twins who doesnt love evil twins mom told me about how you wrote about me jeremy says his mother is still in the garage he feels like a tennis ball in a game where the tennis players love him very very much even while they lob and smash and send him back and forth back and forth his father says she said she wasnt going to tell you but i guess im glad she did im sorry germ are you hungry shes going out to las vegas next week she wants me to go with her jeremy says i know his father says still holding out a bowl of upsidedown pizza try not to worry about all of this if you can think of it as an adventure mom says thats a stupid thing to say are you going to let me read the book with me in it jeremy says no his father says looking straight at jeremy i burned it really jeremy says did you set fire to your computer too well no his father says but you cant read it it wasnt any good anyway want to watch the library with me and will you eat some damn pizza please i may be a lousy father but im a good cook and if you love me youll eat the damn pizza and be grateful so they go sit on the orange couch and jeremy eats pizza and watches the library for the secondandahalf time with his father the lights on the timer in the living room go off and prince wing kills fox again and then jeremy goes to bed his father goes away to write or to burn stuff whatever his mother is still out in the garage on jeremys desk is a scrap of paper with a phone number on it if he wanted to he could call his phone booth when he dials the number it rings for a long time jeremy sits on his bed in the dark and listens to it ringing and ringing when someone picks it up he almost hangs up someone doesnt say anything so jeremy says hello hello someone breathes into the phone on the other end of the line someone says in a soft musical squeaky voice cant talk now kid call back later then someone hangs up jeremy dreams that hes sitting beside fox on a sofa that his father has reupholstered in spider silk his father has been stealing spider webs from the giantspider superstores from his own books is that shoplifting or is it selfplagiarism the sofa is soft and gray and a little bit sticky fox sits on either side of him the righthandside fox is being played by talis elizabeth plays the fox on his left both foxes look at him with enormous compassion are you dead jeremy says are you the fox who is being played by elizabeth says in that unmistakable fox voice which jeremys father once said sounds like a sexy and demented helium balloon it makes jeremys brain hurt to hear foxs voice coming out of elizabeths mouth the fox who looks like talis doesnt say anything at all the writing on her tshirt is so small and so foreign that jeremy cant read it without feeling as if hes staring at foxtaliss breasts its probably something he needs to know but hell never be able to read it hes too polite and besides hes terrible at foreign languages hey look jeremy says were on tv there he is on television sitting between two foxes on a sticky gray couch in a field of red poppies are we in las vegas were not in kansas foxelizabeth says theres something i need you to do for me whats that jeremy says if i tell you in the dream foxelizabeth says you wont remember you have to remember to call me when youre awake keep on calling until you get me how will i remember to call you jeremy says if i dont remember what you tell me in this dream why do you need me to help you why is talis here what does her tshirt say why are you both fox is this mars foxtalis goes on watching tv foxelizabeth opens her kind and beautiful unhellokittylike mouth again she tells jeremy the whole story she explains everything she translates foxtaliss tshirt which turns out to explain everything about talis that jeremy has ever wondered about it answers every single question that jeremy has ever had about girls and then jeremy wakes up its dark jeremy flips on the light the dream is moving away from him there was something about mars elizabeth was asking who he thought was prettier talis or elizabeth they were laughing they both had pointy fox ears they wanted him to do something there was a telephone number he was supposed to call there was something he was supposed to do in two weeks on the fifteenth of april jeremy and his mother will get in her van and start driving out to las vegas every morning before school jeremy takes long showers and his father doesnt say anything at all one day its as if nothing is wrong between his parents the next day they wont even look at each other jeremys father wont come out of his study and then the day after that jeremy comes home and finds his mother sitting on his fathers lap theyre smiling as if they know something stupid and secret they dont even notice jeremy when he walks through the room even this is preferable though to the way they behave when they do notice him they act guilty and strange and as if they are about to ruin his life gordon mars makes pancakes every morning and jeremys favorite dinner macaroni and cheese every night jeremys mother plans out an itinerary for their trip they will be stopping at libraries across the country because his mother loves libraries but shes also bought a new twoman tent and two sleeping bags and a portable stove so that they can camp if jeremy wants to camp even though jeremys mother hates the outdoors right after she does this gordon mars spends all weekend in the garage he wont let either of them see what hes doing and when he does let them in it turns out that hes removed the seating in the back of the van and bolted down two of his couches one on each side both upholstered in electricblue fake fur they have to climb in through the cargo door at the back because one of the couches is blocking the sliding door jeremys father says looking very pleased with himself so now you dont have to camp outside unless you want to you can sleep inside theres space underneath for suitcases the sofas even have seat belts over the sofas jeremys father has rigged up small wooden shelves that fold down on chains from the walls of the van and become table tops theres a travelsized disco ball dangling from the ceiling and a wooden panelwith velcro straps and a black quilted padbehind the drivers seat where jeremys father explains they can hang up the painting of the woman with the apple and the knife the van looks like something out of an episode of the library jeremys mother bursts into tears she runs back inside the house jeremys father says helplessly i just wanted to make her laugh jeremy wants to say i hate both of you but he doesnt say it and he doesnt it would be easier if he did when jeremy told karl about las vegas karl punched him in the stomach then he said have you told talis jeremy said youre supposed to be nice to me youre supposed to tell me not to go and that this sucks and youre not supposed to punch me why did you punch me is talis all you ever think about kind of karl said most of the time sorry germ of course i wish you werent going and yeah it also pisses me off were supposed to be best friends but you do stuff all the time and i never get to ive never driven across the country or been to las vegas even though id really really like to i cant feel sorry for you when i bet you anything that while youre there youll sneak into some casino and play slot machines and win like a million bucks you should feel sorry for me im the one that has to stay here can i borrow your dirt bike while youre gone sure jeremy said how about your telescope karl said im taking it with me jeremy said fine you have to call me every day karl said you have to email you have to tell me about las vegas show girls i want to know how tall they really are whose phone number is this karl was holding the scrap of paper with the number of jeremys phone booth mine jeremy said thats my phone booth the one i inherited have you called it karl said no jeremy said hed called the phone booth a few times but it wasnt a game karl would think it was a game cool karl said and he went ahead and dialed the number hello karl said id like to speak to the person in charge of jeremys life this is jeremys best friend karl not funny jeremy said my life is boring karl said into the phone ive never inherited anything this girl i like wont talk to me so is someone there does anybody want to talk to me does anyone want to talk to my friend the lord of the phone booth jeremy theyre demanding that you liberate the phone booth from yourself still not funny jeremy said and karl hung up the phone jeremy told elizabeth they were up on the roof of jeremys house and he told her the whole thing not just the part about las vegas but also the part about his father and how he put jeremy in a book with no giant spiders in it have you read it elizabeth said no jeremy said he wont let me dont tell karl all i told him is that my mom and i have to go out for a few months to check out the wedding chapel i wont tell karl elizabeth said she leaned forward and kissed jeremy and then she wasnt kissing him it was all very fast and surprising but they didnt fall off the roof nobody falls off the roof in this story talis likes you elizabeth said thats what amy says maybe you like her back i dont know but i thought i should go ahead and kiss you now just in case i dont get to kiss you again you can kiss me again jeremy said talis probably doesnt like me no elizabeth said i mean lets not i want to stay friends and its hard enough to be friends germ look at you and karl i would never kiss karl jeremy said funny germ we should have a surprise party for you before you go elizabeth said it wont be a surprise party now jeremy said maybe kissing him once was enough well once i tell amy it cant really be a surprise party elizabeth said she would explode into a million pieces and all the little pieces would start yelling guess what guess what were having a surprise party for you jeremy but just because im letting you in on the surprise doesnt mean there wont be surprises i dont actually like surprises jeremy said who does elizabeth said only the people who do the surprising can we have the party at your house i think it should be like halloween and it always feels like halloween here we could all show up in costumes and watch lots of old episodes of the library and eat ice cream sure jeremy said and then this is terrible what if theres a new episode of the library while im gone who am i going to watch it with and hed said the perfect thing elizabeth felt so bad about jeremy having to watch the library all by himself that she kissed him again there has never been a giant spider in any episode of the library although once fox got really small and ptolemy krill carried her around in his pocket she had to rip up one of krills handkerchiefs and blindfold herself just in case she accidentally read a draft of krills terrible poetry and then it turned out that as well as the poetry krill had also stashed a rare horned anubis earwig in his pocket which hadnt been properly preserved ptolemy krill it turned out was careless with his kill jar the earwig almost ate fox but instead it became her friend it still sends her christmas cards these are the two most important things that jeremy and his friends have in common a geographical location and love of a television show about a library jeremy turns on the television as soon as he comes home from school he flips through the channels watching reruns of star trek and law order if theres a new episode of the library before he and his mother leave for las vegas then everything will be fine everything will work out his mother says you watch too much television jeremy but he goes on flipping through channels then he goes up to his room and makes phone calls the new episode needs to be soon because were getting ready to leave tonight would be good youd tell me if there was going to be a new episode tonight right silence can i take that as a yes it would be easier if i had a brother jeremy tells his telephone booth hello are you there or a sister im tired of being good all the time if i had a sibling then we could take turns being good if i had an older brother i might be better at being bad better at being angry karl is really good at being angry he learned how from his brothers i wouldnt want brothers like karls brothers of course but it sucks having to figure out everything all by myself and the more normal i try to be the more my parents think that im acting out they think its a phase that ill grow out of they think it isnt normal to be normal because theres no such thing as normal and this whole book thing the whole shoplifting thing how my dad steals things it figures that he went and stole my life it isnt just me being melodramatic to say that thats exactly what he did did i tell you that once he stole a ferret from a pet store because he felt bad for it and then he let it loose in our house and it turned out that it was pregnant there was this woman who came to interview dad and she sat down on one of the someone knocks on his bedroom door jeremy his mother says is karl here am i interrupting no jeremy says and hangs up the phone hes gotten into the habit of calling his phone booth every day when he calls it rings and rings and then it stops ringing as if someone has picked up theres just silence on the other end no squeaky pretendfox voice but its a peaceful interested silence jeremy complains about all the things there are to complain about and the silent person on the other end listens and listens maybe it is fox standing there in his phone booth and listening patiently he wonders what incarnation of fox is listening one thing about fox shes never sorry for herself shes always too busy if it were really fox shed hang up on him jeremy opens his door i was on the phone he says his mother comes in and sits down on his bed shes wearing one of his fathers old flannel shirts so have you packed jeremy shrugs i guess he says why did you cry when you saw what dad did to the van dont you like it its that damn painting his mother says it was the first nice thing he ever gave me we should have spent the money on health insurance and a new roof and groceries and instead he bought a painting so i got angry i left him i took the painting and i moved into a hotel and i stayed there for a few days i was going to sell the painting but instead i fell in love with it so i came home and apologized for running away i got pregnant with you and i used to get hungry and dream that someone was going to give me a beautiful apple like the one shes holding when i told your father he said he didnt trust her that she was holding out the apple like that as a trick and if you went to take it from her shed stab you with the peeling knife he says that shes a tough old broad and shell take care of us while were on the road do we really have to go jeremy says if we go to las vegas i might get into trouble i might start using drugs or gambling or something oh germ you try so hard to be a good kid his mother says you try so hard to be normal sometimes id like to be normal too maybe vegas will be good for us are these the books that youre bringing jeremy shrugs not all of them i cant decide which ones i should take and which ones i can leave it feels like whatever i leave behind im leaving behind for good thats silly his mother says were coming back i promise your father and i will work things out if you leave something behind that you need he can mail it to you do you think there are slot machines in the libraries in las vegas i talked to a woman at the hells bells chapel and theres something called the arts and lovecraft library where they keep cleos special collection of horror novels and gothic romances and fake copies of the necronomicon you go in and out through a secret swingingbookcase door people get married in it theres a dr frankensteins lovelab the masque of the red death ballroom and also something just called the crypt oh yeah and theres also the vampires patio and the black lagoon grotto where you can get married by moonlight you hate all this stuff jeremy says its not my cup of tea his mother says when does everyone show up tonight around eight jeremy says are you going to get dressed up i dont have to dress up his mother says im a librarian remember jeremys fathers office is above the garage in theory no one is meant to interrupt him while hes working but in practice jeremys father loves nothing better than to be interrupted as long as the person who interrupts brings him something to eat when jeremy and his mother are gone who will bring jeremys father food jeremy hardens his heart the floor is covered with books and bolts and samples of upholstering fabrics jeremys father is lying facedown on the floor with his feet propped up on a bolt of fabric which means that he is thinking and also that his back hurts he claims to think best when he is on the verge of falling asleep i brought you a bowl of froot loops jeremy says his father rolls over and looks up thanks he says what time is it is everyone here is that your costume is that my tuxedo jacket its fiveish nobodys here yet do you like it jeremy says hes dressed as a forbidden book his fathers jacket is too big but he still feels very elegant very sinister his mother lent him the lipstick and the feathers and the platform heels its interesting his father allows and a little frightening jeremy feels obscurely pleased even though he knows that his father is more amused than frightened everyone else will probably come as fox or prince wing except for karl hes coming as ptolemy krill he even wrote some really bad poetry i wanted to ask you something before we leave tomorrow shoot his father says did you really get rid of the novel with me in it no his father says it felt unlucky unlucky to keep it unlucky not to keep it i dont know what to do with it jeremy says im glad you didnt get rid of it its not any good you know his father says which makes all this even worse at first it was because i was bored with giant spiders it was going to be something funny to show you but then i wrote that you had a brain tumor and it wasnt funny anymore i figured i could save youim the author after allbut you got sicker and sicker you were going through a rebellious phase you were sneaking out of the house a lot and you hit your mother you were a real jerk but it turned out you had a brain tumor and that was making you behave strangely can i ask another question jeremy says you know how you like to steal things you know how youre really really good at it yeah says his father could you not steal things for a while if i asked you to jeremy says mom isnt going to be around to pay for the books and stuff that you steal i dont want you to end up in jail because we went to las vegas his father closes his eyes as if he hopes jeremy will forget that he asked a question and go away jeremy says nothing all right his father says finally i wont shoplift anything until you get home again jeremys mother runs around taking photos of everyone talis and elizabeth have both showed up as fox although talis is dead fox she carries her fake fur ears and tail around in a little seethrough plastic purse and she also has a sword which she leaves in the umbrella stand in the kitchen jeremy and talis havent talked much since she had a dream about him and since he told her that hes going to las vegas she didnt say anything about that which is perfectly normal for talis karl makes an excellent ptolemy krill jeremys forbidden book disguise is admired amys faithful margaret costume is almost as good as anything faithful margaret wears on tv there are even special effects amy has rigged up her hair with red ribbons and wire and spray color and egg whites so that it looks as if its on fire and there are tiny papierm√¢ch√© golems in it making horrible faces she dances a polka with jeremys father faithful margaret is mad for polka dancing no one has dressed up as prince wing they watch the episode with the possessed chicken and they watch the episode with the salt wife and they watch the episode where prince wing and faithful margaret fall under a spell and swap bodies and have sex for the first time they watch the episode where fox saves prince wings life for the first time jeremys father makes chocolatemangoespresso milk shakes for everyone none of jeremys friends except for elizabeth know about the novel everyone thinks jeremy and his mother are just having an adventure everyone thinks jeremy will be back at the end of the summer i wonder how they find the actors elizabeth says they arent real actors they must be regular people but youd think that somewhere there would be someone who knows them that somebody online would say hey thats my sister or thats the kid i went to school with who threw up in pe you know sometimes someone says something like that or sometimes someone pretends that they know something about the library but it always turns out to be a hoax just somebody wanting to be somebody what about the guy whos writing it karl says talis says who says its a guy and amy says yeah karl why do you always assume its a guy writing it maybe nobodys writing it elizabeth says maybe its magic or its broadcast from outer space maybe its real wouldnt that be cool no jeremy says because then fox would really be dead that would suck i dont care elizabeth says i wish it were real anyway maybe it all really happened somewhere like king arthur or robin hood and this is just one version of how it happened like a magical after school special even if it isnt real amy says parts of it could be real like maybe the worldtree library is real or maybe the library is made up but fox is based on somebody that the writer knew writers do that all the time right jeremy i think your dad should write a book about me i could be eaten by giant spiders or have sex with giant spiders and have spider babies i think that would be so great so amy does have psychic abilities after all although hopefully she will never know this when jeremy tests his own potential psychic abilities he can almost sense his father hovering somewhere just outside the living room listening to this conversation and maybe even taking notes which is what writers do but jeremy isnt really psychic its just that lurking and hovering and appearing suddenly when you werent expecting him are what his father does just like shoplifting and cooking jeremy prays to all the dark gods that he never receives the gift of knowing what people are thinking its a dark road and it ends up with you trapped on late night television in front of an invisible audience of depressed insomniacs wearing hats made out of tinfoil and they all want to pay you nineninetynine per minute to hear you describe in minute terrible detail what their deceased cat is thinking about right now what kind of future is that he wants to go to mars and when will elizabeth kiss him again you cant just kiss someone twice and then never kiss them again he tries not to think about elizabeth and kissing just in case amy reads his mind he realizes that hes been staring at taliss breasts glares instead at elizabeth who is watching tv meanwhile karl is glaring at him on television fox is dancing in the invisible nightclub with faithful margaret whose hair is about to catch fire again the norns are playing their screechy cover of come on eileen the norns only know two songs come on eileen and everybody wants to rule the world they dont play real instruments they play squeaky dog toys and also a bathtub which is enchanted although nobody knows who by or why or what it was enchanted for if you had to chose one jeremy says invisibility or the ability to fly which would you choose everybody looks at him only perverts would want to be invisible elizabeth says youd have to be naked if you were invisible karl says because otherwise people would see your clothes if you could fly youd have to wear thermal underwear because its cold up there so it just depends on whether you like to wear long underwear or no underwear at all amy says its the kind of conversation that they have all the time it makes jeremy feel homesick even though he hasnt left yet maybe ill go make brownies jeremy says elizabeth do you want to help me make brownies shhh elizabeth says this is a good part on television fox and faithful margaret are making out the faithful part is kind of a joke jeremys parents go to bed at one by three amy and elizabeth are passed out on the couch and karl has gone upstairs to check his email on jeremys ibook on tv wolves are roaming the tundra of the free peoples worldtree librarys fortieth floor snow is falling heavily and librarians are burning books to keep warm but only the most dull and improving works of literature jeremy isnt sure where talis has gone so he goes to look for her she hasnt gone far shes on the landing looking at the space on the wall where alice marss painting should be hanging talis is carrying her sword with her and her little plastic purse in the bathroom off the landing the singing toilet is still singing away in german were taking the painting with us jeremy says my dad insisted just in case he accidentally burns down the house while were gone do you want to go see it i was going to show everybody but everybodys asleep right now sure talis says so jeremy gets a flashlight and takes her out to the garage and shows her the van she climbs right inside and sits down on one of the bluefur couches she looks around and he wonders what shes thinking he wonders if the toilet song is stuck in her head my dad did all of this jeremy says he turns on the flashlight and shines it on the disco ball light spatters off in anxious slippery orbits jeremy shows talis how his father has hung up the painting it looks truly wrong in the van as if someone demented put it there especially with the light reflecting off the disco ball the woman in the painting looks confused and embarrassed as if jeremys father has accidentally canceled out her protective powers maybe the disco ball is her kryptonite so remember how you had a dream about me jeremy says talis nods i think i had a dream about you that you were fox talis opens up her arms encompassing her costume her sword her plastic purse with poor foxs ears and tail inside there was something you wanted me to do jeremy says i was supposed to save you somehow talis just looks at him how come you never talk jeremy says all of this is irritating how he used to feel normal around elizabeth like friends and now everything is peculiar and uncomfortable how he used to enjoy feeling uncomfortable around talis and now suddenly he doesnt this must be what sex is about stop thinking about sex he thinks talis opens her mouth and closes it again then she says i dont know amy talks so much you all talk a lot somebody has to be the person who doesnt the person who listens oh jeremy says i thought maybe you had a tragic secret like maybe you used to stutter except secrets cant have secrets they just are nope talis says its like being invisible you know not talking i like it but youre not invisible jeremy says not to me not to karl karl really likes you did you hit him with a boa constrictor on purpose but talis says i wish you werent leaving the disco ball spins and spins it makes jeremy feel kind of carsick and also as if he has sparkly disco leprosy he doesnt say anything back to talis just to see how it feels except maybe thats rude or maybe its rude the way everybody always talks and doesnt leave any space for talis to say anything at least you get to miss school talis says at last yeah he says he leaves another space but talis doesnt say anything this time were going to stop at all these museums and things on the way across the country im supposed to keep a blog for school and describe stuff in it im going to make a lot of stuff up so it will be like creative writing and not so much like homework you should make a list of all the towns with weird names you drive through talis says town of horseheads thats a real place plantagenet jeremy says thats a real place too i had something really weird to tell you talis waits like she always does jeremy says i called my phone booth the one that i inherited and someone answered she sounded just like fox when she talked they told me to call back later so ive called a few more times but i dont ever get her fox isnt a real person talis says the library is just tv but she sounds uncertain thats the thing about the library nobody knows for sure everyone who watches it wishes and hopes that its not just acting that its magic real magic i know jeremy says i wish fox was real foxtalis says theyve been sitting in the van for a long time if karl looks for them and cant find them hes going to think that theyve been making out hell kill jeremy once karl tried to strangle another kid for accidentally peeing on his shoes jeremy might as well kiss talis so he does even though shes still holding her sword she doesnt hit him with it its dark and he has his eyes closed and he can almost imagine that hes kissing elizabeth karl has fallen asleep on jeremys bed talis is downstairs fastforwarding through the episode where some librarians drink too much euphoria and decide to abolish story hour not just the practice of having a story hour but the whole hour amy and elizabeth are still sacked out on the couch its weird to watch amy sleep she doesnt talk in her sleep karl is snoring jeremy could go up on the roof and look at stars except hes already packed up his telescope he could try to wake up elizabeth and they could go up on the roof but talis is down there he and talis could go sit on the roof but he doesnt want to kiss talis on the roof he makes a solemn oath to only ever kiss elizabeth on the roof he picks up his phone maybe he can call his phone booth and complain just a little and not wake karl up his dad is going to freak out about the phone bill all these calls to nevada its am jeremys plan is not to go to sleep at all his friends are lame the phone rings and rings and rings and then someone picks up jeremy recognizes the silence on the other end everybody came over and fell asleep he whispers thats why im whispering i dont even think they care that im leaving and my feet hurt remember how i was going to dress up as a forbidden book platform shoes arent comfortable karl thinks i did it on purpose to be even taller than him than usual and i forgot that i was wearing lipstick and i kissed talis and got lipstick all over her face so its a good thing everyone was asleep because otherwise someone would have seen and my dad says that he wont shoplift at all while mom and i are gone but you cant trust him and that fakefur upholstery sheds like jeremy that strangely familiar sweetandrusty doorhinge voice says softly shut up jeremy i need your help wow jeremy says not in a whisper wow wow wow is this fox are you really fox is this a joke are you real are you dead what are you doing in my phone booth you know who i am fox says and jeremy knows with all his heart that its really fox i need you to do something for me what jeremy says karl on the bed laughs in his sleep as if the idea of jeremy doing something is funny to him what could i do i need you to steal three books fox says from a library in a place called iowa i know iowa jeremy says i mean ive never been there but its a real place i could go there im going to tell you the books you need to steal fox says author title and the jewelly festival number dewey decimal jeremy says its actually called the dewey decimal number in real libraries real fox says sounding amused you need to write this all down and also how to get to the library you need to steal the three books and bring them to me its very important is it dangerous jeremy says are the forbidden books up to something are the forbidden books real too what if i get caught stealing its not dangerous to you fox says just dont get caught remember the episode of the library when i was the little old lady with the beehive and i stole the bishop of tweedles false teeth while he was reading the banns for the wedding of faithful margaret and sir petronella the younger remember how he didnt even notice ive never seen that episode jeremy says although as far as he knows hes never missed a single episode of the library hes never even heard of sir petronella oh fox says maybe thats a flashback in a later episode or something thats a great episode were depending on you jeremy you have got to steal these books they contain dreadful secrets i cant say the titles out loud im going to spell them instead so jeremy gets a pad of paper and fox spells out the titles of each book twice they arent titles that can be written down here its safer not to even think about some books can i ask you something jeremy says can i tell anybody about this not amy but could i tell karl or elizabeth or talis can i tell my mom if i woke up karl right now would you talk to him for a minute i dont have a lot of time fox says i have to go now please dont tell anyone jeremy im sorry is it the forbidden books jeremy says again what would fox think if she saw the costume hes still wearing all except for the platform heels do you think i shouldnt trust my friends but ive known them my whole life fox makes a noise a kind of pained whuff what is it jeremy says are you okay i have to go fox says nobody can know about this dont give anybody this number dont tell anyone about your phone booth or me promise germ only if you promise you wont call me germ jeremy says feeling really stupid i hate when people call me that call me mars instead mars fox says and it sounds exotic and strange and brave as if jeremy has just become a new person a person named after a whole planet a person who kisses girls and talks to foxes ive never stolen anything jeremy says but fox has hung up maybe out there somewhere is someone who enjoys having to say goodbye but it isnt anyone that jeremy knows all of his friends are grumpy and redeyed although not from crying from lack of sleep from too much television there are still faint red stains around taliss mouth and if everyone werent so tired they would realize its jeremys lipstick karl gives jeremy a handful of quarters dimes nickels and pennies for the slot machines karl says if you win anything you can keep a third of what you win half jeremy says automatically fine karl says its all from your dads sofas anyway just one more thing stop getting taller dont get taller while youre gone okay he hugs jeremy hard so hard that its almost like getting punched again no wonder talis threw the boa constrictor at karl talis and elizabeth both hug jeremy goodbye talis looks even more mysterious now that hes sat with her under a disco ball and made out later on jeremy will discover that talis has left her sword under the blue fur couch and hell wonder if she left it on purpose talis doesnt say anything and amy of course doesnt shut up not even when she kisses him it feels weird to be kissed by someone who goes right on talking while they kiss you and yet it shouldnt be a surprise that amy kisses him he imagines that later amy and talis and elizabeth will all compare notes elizabeth says i promise ill tape every episode of the library while youre gone so we can all watch them together when you get back i promise ill call you in vegas no matter what time it is there when theres a new episode her hair is a mess and her breath is faintly sour jeremy wishes he could tell her how beautiful she looks ill write bad poetry and send it to you he says jeremys mother is looking hideously cheerful as she goes in and out of the house making sure that she hasnt left anything behind she loves long car trips it doesnt bother her one bit that she and her son are abandoning their entire lives she passes jeremy a folder full of maps youre in charge of not getting lost she says put these somewhere safe jeremy says i found a library online that i want to go visit out in iowa they have a corn mosaic on the fa√ßade of the building with a lot of naked goddesses and gods dancing around in a field of corn someone wants to take it down can we go see it first sure his mother says jeremys father has filled a whole grocery bag with sandwiches his hair is drooping and he looks even more like an axe murderer than usual if this were a movie youd think that jeremy and his mother were escaping in the nick of time you take care of your mother he says to jeremy sure jeremy says you take care of yourself his dad sags you take care of yourself too so its settled theyre all supposed to take care of themselves why cant they stay home and take care of each other until jeremy is good and ready to go off to college ive got another bag of sandwiches in the kitchen his dad says i should go get them wait jeremy says i have to ask you something before we take off suppose i had to steal something i mean i dont have to steal anything of course and i know stealing is wrong even when you do it and i would never steal anything but what if i did how do you do it how do you do it and not get caught his father shrugs hes probably wondering if jeremy is really his son gordon mars inherited his mutant longfingered ambidextrous hands from a long line of shoplifters and money launderers and petty criminals theyre all deeply ashamed of jeremys father gordon mars had a gift and he threw it away to become a writer i dont know he says he picks up jeremys hand and looks at it as if hes never noticed before that jeremy had something hanging off the end of his wrist you just do it you do it like youre not really doing anything at all you do it while youre thinking about something else and you forget that youre doing it oh jeremy says taking his hand back im not planning on stealing anything i was just curious his father looks at him take care of yourself he says again as if he really means it and hugs jeremy hard then he goes and gets the sandwiches so many sandwiches that jeremy and his mother will eat sandwiches for the first three days and still have to throw half of them away everyone waves jeremy and his mother climb in the van jeremys mother turns on the cd player bob dylan is singing about monkeys his mother loves bob dylan they drive away do you know how sometimes during a commercial break in your favorite television shows your best friend calls and wants to talk about one of her boyfriends and when you try to hang up she starts crying and you try to cheer her up and end up missing about half of the episode and so when you go to work the next day you have to get the guy who sits next to you to explain what happened thats the good thing about a book you can mark your place in a book but this isnt really a book its a television show in one episode of the library an adolescent boy drives across the country with his mother they have to change a tire the boy practices taking things out of his mothers purse and putting them back again he steals a sixteenounce bottle of coke from one convenience market and leaves it at another convenience market the boy and his mother stop at a lot of libraries and the boy keeps a blog but he skips the bit about the library in iowa he writes in his blog about what hes reading but he doesnt read the books he stole in iowa because fox told him not to and because he has to hide them from his mother well he reads just a few pages skims really he hides them under the bluefur sofa they go camping in utah and the boy sets up his telescope he sees three shooting stars and a coyote he never sees anyone who looks like a forbidden book although he sees a transvestite go into the womans rest room at a rest stop in indiana he calls a phone booth just outside las vegas twice but no one ever answers he has short conversations with his father he wonders what his father is up to he wishes he could tell his father about fox and the books once the boys mother finds a giant spider the size of an oreo in their tent she starts laughing hysterically she takes a picture of it with her digital camera and the boy puts the picture on his blog sometimes the boy asks questions and his mother talks about her parents once she cries the boy doesnt know what to say they talk about their favorite episodes of the library and the episodes that they really hated and the mother asks if the boy thinks fox is really dead he says he doesnt think so once a man tries to break into the van while they are sleeping in it but then he goes away maybe the painting of the woman with the peeling knife is protecting them but youve seen this episode before its cinco de mayo its almost seven oclock at night and the sun is beginning to go down jeremy and his mother are in the desert and las vegas is somewhere in front of them every time they pass a driver coming the other way jeremy tries to figure out if that person has just won or lost a lot of money everything is flat and sort of tilted here except off in the distance where the land goes up abruptly as if someone has started to fold up a map somewhere around here is the grand canyon which must have been a surprise when people first saw it jeremys mother says are you sure we have to do this first couldnt we go find your phone booth later can we do it now jeremy says i said i was going to do it on my blog its like a quest that i have to complete okay his mother says it should be around here somewhere its supposed to be four point five miles after the turnoff and heres the turnoff it isnt hard to find the phone booth there isnt much else around jeremy should feel excited when he sees it but its a disappointment really hes seen phone booths before he was expecting something to be different mostly he just feels tired of road trips and tired of roads and just tired tired tired he looks around to see if fox is somewhere nearby but theres just a hiker off in the distance some kid okay germ his mother says make this quick i need to get my backpack out of the back jeremy says do you want me to come too his mother says no jeremy says this is kind of personal his mother looks like shes trying not to laugh just hurry up i have to pee when jeremy gets to the phone booth he turns around his mother has the light on in the van it looks like shes singing along to the radio his mother has a terrible voice when he steps inside the phone booth it isnt magical the phone booth smells rank as if an animal has been living in it the windows are smudgy he takes the stolen books out of his backpack and puts them in the little shelf where someone has stolen a phone book then he waits maybe fox is going to call him maybe hes supposed to wait until she calls but she doesnt call he feels lonely theres no one he can tell about this he feels like an idiot and he also feels kind of proud because he did it he drove crosscountry with his mother and saved an imaginary person so hows your phone booth his mother says great he says and theyre both silent again las vegas is in front of them and then all around them and everything is lit up like theyre inside a pinball game all of the trees look fake like someone read too much dr seuss and got ideas people are walking up and down the sidewalks some of them look normal others look like they just escaped from a fancydress ball at a lunatic asylum jeremy hopes theyve just won lots of money and thats why they look so startled so strange or maybe theyre all vampires left he tells his mother go left here look out for the vampires on the crosswalk and then its an immediate right four times his mother let him drive the van once in utah twice in south dakota once in pennsylvania the van smells like old burger wrappers and fake fur and it doesnt help that jeremys gotten used to the smell the woman in the painting has had a pained expression on her face for the last few nights and the disco ball has lost some of its pieces of mirror because jeremy kept knocking his head on it in the morning jeremy and his mother havent showered in three days here is the wedding chapel in front of them at the end of a long driveway electric purple light shines on a sign that spells out hells bells theres a wroughtiron fence and a yard full of trees dripping spanish moss under the trees tombstones and miniature mausoleums do you think those are real his mother says she sounds slightly worried harry east recently deceased jeremy says no i dont theres a hearse in the driveway with a little plaque on the back recently buried married the chapel is a victorian house with a bell tower perhaps its full of bats or giant spiders jeremys father would love this place his mother is going to hate it someone stands at the threshold of the chapel door open looking out at them but as jeremy and his mother get out of the van he turns and goes inside and shuts the door look out his mother says theyve probably gone to put the boiling oil in the microwave she rings the doorbell determinedly instead of ringing theres a recording of a crow caw caw caw all the lights in the victorian house go out then they turn on again the door swings open and jeremy tightens his grip on his backpack just in case good evening madam young man a man says and jeremy looks up and up and up the man at the door has to lower his head to look out his hands are large as toaster ovens he looks like hes wearing chihuahua coffins on his feet two realisticlooking bolts stick out on either side of his head he wears green pancake makeup glittery green eye shadow and his lashes are as long and thick and green as astroturf we werent expecting you so soon we should have called ahead jeremys mother says im real sorry great costume jeremy says the frankenstein curls his lip in a somber way thank you he says call me miss thing please im jeremy jeremy says this is my mother oh please miss thing says even his wink is somber you tease me she isnt old enough to be your mother oh please yourself jeremys mother says quick the two of you someone yells from somewhere inside hells bells while you zthtand there gabbing the devil ithz prowling around like a lion looking for a way to get in are you juthzt going to zthtand there and hold the door wide open for him so they all step inside is that jeremy marthz at lathzt the voice says earth to marthz earth to marthz marthzzz jeremy marthzzz therethz zthomeone on the phone for jeremy marthz shethz called three timethz in the lathzt ten minutethz jeremy marthzzzz its fox jeremy knows of course its fox shes in the phone booth shes got the books and shes going to tell me that i saved whatever it is that i was saving he walks toward the buzzing voice while miss thing and his mother go back out to the van he walks past a room full of artfully draped spider webs and candelabras drooping with drippy candles someone is playing the organ behind a wooden screen he goes down the hall and up a long staircase the banisters are carved with little faces owls and foxes and ugly children the voice goes on talking yoohoo jeremy up the stairthz thatthz right now come along come right in not in there in here in here dont mind the dark we like the dark just watch your step jeremy puts his hand out he touches something and theres a click and the bookcase in front of him slowly slides back now the room is three times as large and there are more bookshelves and theres a young woman wearing dark sunglasses sitting on a couch she has a megaphone in one hand and a phone in the other for you jeremy marth she says shes the palest person jeremy has ever seen and her two canine teeth are so pointed that she lisps a little when she talks on the megaphone the lisp was sinister but now it just makes her sound irritable she hands him the phone hello he says he keeps an eye on the vampire jeremy elizabeth says its on its on its on its just started were all just sitting here everybodys here what happened to your cell phone we kept calling mom left it in the visitors center at zion jeremy says well youre there we figured out from your blog that you must be near vegas amy says she had a feeling that you were going to get there in time she made us keep calling stay on the phone jeremy we can all watch it together okay hold on karl grabs the phone hey germ i didnt get any postcards he says you forget how to write or something wait a minute somebody wants to say something to you then he laughs and laughs and passes the phone on to someone else who doesnt say anything at all talis jeremy says maybe it isnt talis maybe its elizabeth again he thinks about how his mouth is right next to elizabeths ear or maybe its taliss ear the vampire on the couch is already flipping through the channels jeremy would like to grab the remote away from her but its not a good idea to try to take things away from a vampire his mother and miss thing come up the stairs and into the room and suddenly the room seems absolutely full of people as if karl and amy and elizabeth and talis have come into the room too his hand is getting sweaty around the phone miss thing is holding jeremys mothers painting firmly as if it might try to escape jeremys mother looks tired for the past three days her hair has been braided into two long fat pigtails she looks younger to jeremy as if theyve been traveling backward in time instead of just across the country she smiles at jeremy a giddy exhausted smile jeremy smiles back is it the library miss thing says is a new episode on jeremy sits down on the couch beside the vampire still holding the phone to his ear his arm is getting tired im here he says to talis or elizabeth or whoever it is on the other end of the phone im here and then he sits and doesnt say anything and waits with everyone else for the vampire to find the right channel so they can all find out if hes saved fox if fox is alive if fox is still alive a ghost samba ian mcdonald is the author of the hugo

when seu alejandro played men kissed each other and women ovulated brasil is the land of the boy from nowhere the footballer from the favela the musician from the mines the sugarcane cutter from the sert√£o milton nascimento was a minas gerais boy the late great chico science father of mangue was from olinda its part of our national mythology in this great nation anyone can rise to anything from anywhere cane cutters can become presidents its also part of our national mythology that like chico science like seu alejandro they should die young theres a pure beauty in imagining what they never achieved the ghost samba can never disappoint you he went back for the tapes he should never have gone back for the tapes but he was a musician it would have been like leaving a child in that burning studio they were the masters for his new collection the longawaited second album that would crown the achievement of boy on the corner all second albums are difficultthats musicbut some are more difficult than others seu alejandro threw out a batch of songs because he wasnt happy with them he was going to use paulistano punk band then he wasnt he was going to duet with lovefoxxx then he wasnt it was going to be him alone with his guitar and a drummer the way i first heard him in that club in lapa then it wasnt his record company put out press releases that it was coming out in two weeks time that would slip months a season a year four years that would be the end of a career for anyone less angelically gifted than seu alejandro it merely served to increase the appetite then word came that he was going back into the studio the songs were right the musicians were right the arrangements were right the soul was right and the ideas were running through him like lightning wed heard it before but of course the producer wasnt right and the studio wasnt right so he was going home back up into vila canoas to the little bedroom studio where he produced the first collection of three songs for the myspace site and that was where on april wilson severino de araujo known as seu alejandro died in a stupid studio fire trying to save the masters of his second album pretty petty thieves joined the list of legendary albumsthatneverwere its five years since seu alejandro died and in that time he has grown from cult to myth to legend five years its taken me to track down those masters from legend back through myth to a scorched hard drive im at a bar in laranjeiras you wouldnt know it youve never even heard of it if you were to come here you would think it dazingly trendy but the moment has already moved on from it its my job to know such things the people who know all know me as centor√©is hundredr√©al man the joke goes that thats the amount of money ill spend in one session on music youd know me better as rubem de castro columnist reviewer commentator blogger pundit radiowit and professional idler the last of the real cariocas all those little things a man must do not to be seen to be trying too hard if you met me youd hate me im the guy on the music forums with so much cooler recommendations than yours at a party ill sneer at the hosts unforgivably populist playlist and tell you who you should be listening to now and where to find them i might even slip on my own podcast and youll say who are these guys while youre jabbering away on your social networking sites about have you heard tita maria and duane duarte and bonde do role ive already moved on to the next thing after the next thing i could take you to the clubs and the bars and the sound systems but once id taken you that would be the end of it you know for four decades ive surfed the sea of music that breaks around the rocks of this most lovely of cities its tiring and relentless and its no way for a middleaged man to live but the moment you lose the wave you go under because im a middleaged man still living on teenage overhang when i hear the word masters i expect tape i expect digibeta dat the romantic part of me hopes for reels the masters for pretty petty thieves are on a hard drive the size of a cigarette packet they sit on the table next to guinles real packet of hollywood blues some brighteyed singersongwriter is picking out her heartfluff to the fourths and fifths on the little stage ive heard a thousand heartbreaks just like hers i move my beer away from the drive its been through fire and deep lost time but im terrified of spilling antarctica over it can i hear some its a hard drive when guinle left the police like most of the cops who paid enough to be safe up in the favelas he set up a private detective agency his specialism was kidnappings footballers mothers and pets now he runs a successful stable of gumshoes so he no longer has to hack security cameras or go through anyones garbage with chopsticks and only tackles those cases that interest him i know him from the days when the new bossa swept through the city theres an old musicians gaydar we recognised each immediately at our tables on opposing sides of the dark noisy club its the set of the body the sit and slight lean the tilt of the head that says that whatever else you are hearing you are always listening to the music i say i could be buying someones collection of boyporn guinle holds out his phone a set of white earbuds is plugged into it do you want to listen to it have you listened to it panic snatches sudden and cold at my heart i cant bear it that guinle could have listened to the masters before me it makes it dirty used its almost a sex thing like someone elses girlfriend after an indecently short interval not a note what do you take me for i just copied it because i knew youd ask me that promise me you wont the need in my voice is ridiculous have some dignity man ill give you until tomorrow morning once youve remembered that other little matter i slide the envelope of cash across the table its a big envelope a too full to seal down the flap theres a pheromone of notes of ink and hands and trade guinle scoops it into his briefcase hes too much a carioca to count the notes and too much a pro to query his clients cash calls i make no representations about the state of the contents you asked me to get the masters i got them i must ask you how you did that sometime i say but i can hear my voice go off the moment the way you hear it when a singer loses a cover of a song he doesnt really understand or believe in just words because i have it i have the lost pretty petty thieves in that slightly blackened titanium box is the last musical testament of seu alejandro the world thought it was lost but i found it and now it sits in the palm of my hand i see that hand shake yes you really must says guinle i have a ritual everyone has a ritual i know a great great singer who can only face an audience if hes masturbated youd know him too hes a household name there are footballers who have to put on one boot first or never wear two the same colour or carry a picture of the pope or our lady next to their hearts truckers bless their rigs coders bless their keyboards policemen bless their guns and then there is sex there is always sex some have times and places and positions some have foreplay thats scripted and rehearsed as a high mass some cannot achieve anything with the lights on for some its clothing something they have to wear or have the other wear without which they cannot be remotely aroused i practice my ritual in the best room in the apartment its not the biggest or the best aired or the quietest but it has a breathtaking view out over botafogo and guanabara to the hills of niteroi beyond out of the righthand window are leme morro and the sugarloaf in the evening in the sudden lilac twilight when the lights come like a necklace around the shoulders of the moros it is heartbreakingly beautiful heres what i keep in this room a chair of course an old deep leather armchair with the springs going so i can sag into it a beer fridge a small side table for the beer and the remote the sound system in the holy corner where the two views meet this is my listening room this is my church i take my place in the chair ive had it positioned scientifically to get the best surround sound separation my cleaner is under orders never to move it on pain of instant dismissal i settle my fat ass deep into the seat its important to get comfortable im going to be there for a while i take one antarctica from the fridge and pop the can rio spreads like wings on either side of me i love her so hard it hurts then i lift the remote control and start seu alejandros pretty petty thieves on the first listen through i never do anything i need to get the whole recording the whole concept entire the song order the big idea marcelo from the tuesday afternoon boys calls it the gestalt hes some kind of therapist in it call that first pass the hearing this second pass is the listening its then you notice the details of the arrangements the engineering how the lyrics work with the melody is that a horn section there hes pulled the bass up here pushed it back there why has he used a cello line for gods sake the third time is the savouring you know how the songs work what they are trying to achieve and the way the music is constructed and how it works on your heart now you can appreciate the details the way drum and bass syncopate against each other the complex time signaturethat always eludes your foursquare tapping toe that evershifting harmony line that disguises a very simple almost folk melody and gives it a dress of carioca sophistication the twists the false starts and surprise endings the games you can play with middle eights joys you can only appreciate after a lifetime of immersion in mpb but there are holes there are hideous holes transamazonianhighway holes that can swallow an entire truck the main vocals are unmixed on some of the songs seu alejandro sounds like he is bellowing like an old and angry beach bum others like he is humming to himself trying to find his car in a supermarket car park arrangements are fragmentary there are suggestions of s funk horn sections or his signature triphop rhythms which he lifted from another age another culture and made unmistakably tropicalismo back vocals are either nonexistent or too far to the front and the bass is painfully low in the mix there is a screamingly frustrating twenty three second gap in the middle of immaculate conception and track bottle club just ends full stop whether by fire or intention i cant tell the title track doesnt exist beyond an opening carnaval blast of drums brass and what sounds like sampled traffic noise astonishing but a shard again this could be a seu alejandro joke or the effects of the fire the last two tracks are sketches breakfast news is an acoustic guitar piecefew ever tugged the heart so with his strings than seu alejandro with suggestions of lyrics muttered into the mike scraps and lines and euphonies the final track provisionally titled a ghost samba is his joyfully melancholy guitar with a severely simple cello line but it is seu alejandro unmistakably gloriously seu alejandro i crack a fresh antarctica and start the third listen my hand is shaking as i listen with the ear of savouring the shake becomes worse until i can hardly hold my beer my whole body is tight every muscle like a drumskin i am quivering as if trying to keep back tears not just tears but the kind of uncontrollable onthefloor howling and quaking that leaves phlegm pouring from your nose and mouth the kind men must never be seen doing the kind men do when love walks away from them and they realise their lives have been lies its the holes those amazonian holes they join together into a void how dare seu alejandro die and leave it incomplete and damaged how dare seu alejandro leave me with just this it is as abandonment as complete as any of my brief wives and girlfriends i am bereft i am furious with him its full dark now the lights draw the curves of the bays and the breasts of the hills pretty petty thieves comes to its third ending and i am all right im all right im already starting to think of how i might put it all together and complete what the seu left broken we are the tuesday afternoon boys and every tuesday afternoon we play at the lagoa futsal court weve been playing every tuesday for seven years ever since the first of us turned forty in the afternoon the only other teams are skinny kids in basketball vests and baggy shorts we dont play them they can dribble the ball around us like garrincha tying a leftback in knots we play each other we play futsal to show were still alive we play in the afternoon to show were masters of our own time im on the subs bench when the average team age is in the low forties you spend most of the game on the subs bench but everyone gets a turn on court thats the point of turning up on a tuesday afternoon but the real work gets done on that bench the ball goes out and carlinhos our manager for this week calls captain spooky off he looks like hes dying face so red it could explode chest heaving the sweat lashing off him he crashes down on the bench beside me and its a full two minutes before he can get a word between the deathgasps jesus and mary i tell him you should listen to your doctor sometime he said this is going to be the death of you he shakes his head smiling through the panting the person most likely to kill you is your own doctor captain spooky claims he is a real doctor mds are not real doctors its all hand waving and wizardry mding is about instinct and opinion and subjective thought theres no science no objectivity nothing empirical or evidencebased about medicine its a package of received knowledge opinion and statusplays physicians from the word physic that makes it sound like a science proper science has hypotheses experiments statistical analysis proof and margins of certainty and error physics now that is science and thats what captain spooky is a real true proper physicist with angina his real science is theoretical physics its a young mans game hell tell youlike futsalbut hes kept his tenure no lean feat for a man pushing fifty five more years he says five more years and hell take the retirement package his field is so complex and abstruse it makes my head swim even thinking about it it sounds like esoteric nonsense to me but he swears that theoretical quantum computing has millions of everyday applications and implications that will change our lives beyond recognition i bow to his experiencehes beaten off a lot of young dogs snapping from below all i know is that hes tried to explain it to me in the rodrigo de freitas bar and grill over the postmatch caipiroskas with which we replace lost bodyfluids and i still dont get it when things get really really small and really really short in duration they behave in ways that seem impossible to us that seems to be the gist of it and because of that there isnt one me there are billion trillion mes and there isnt one world there are a billion trillion worlds all different every possible world and me that can exist exists somewhere if you thought about that too much youd fry your head and thats why we call him captain spooky so the words are easier now your limited edition how many times have you listened to her now for captain spooky everything to do with computers was feminine our lady of the digits enough for it to be exciting like a lover not so much that its become a wife jesus man you need to get over that how long ago was it eight years five months weve all been through it its a life stage well all except john the idiot and hed welcome the chance for an agonising divorce the circles of sweat on the front and back of his tshirt are expanding to meet the ones under his arms it is not a good look captain spooky squirts water from the action bottle over his face he says i mean have you thought about doing anything with it what you mean copy it distribute it release it i think i keep the sudden crackle of rage out of my voice but i feel my muscles clench and tense do you know what i call those blasphemy records once they have you those companies will release every halfbaked idea or whistle you ever recorded every coffeebar twang if they could make money theyd put out seu alejandro singing in the shower bastards the entire reason i tracked down and bought that disk was to keep it out of the hands of those vultures i feel my face is now the red one and captain spookys pale at my anger he holds up his hands in supplication okay okay okay man its your music what i meant was you say its full of holes and drops out and incomplete tracks he leans forward its not a good smell what if you could fill in those holes and finish those part songs i shake my head itd be guesswork itd be someone else either fitting their own ideas in or which is worse doing a bad seu alejandro impersonation no no no keep it the way it is ill always be imagining what it would have been like thats okay thats the price captain spooky purses thumb and forefinger a scientist of the very smalls gesture of precision what if we could take imagination out of it what if we could finish the collection exactly as seu alejandro intended with his own music short of a medium i cant see how anyone could do that i could just give me a copy i dont want your masters you hold on to them just give a decent omfs a disk would do or email them over to me i want to ask him what spooky macumba he intends to work but the ball has gone out and carlinhos the other real captain is sending bastard max off and signing for me to come on my muscles have gone tight as a virgin i will play like a drain but with the tuesday afternoon boys everyone gets a turn on pitch i can suffer for it later the room the chair the beer the sunset my hand on the remote but my finger wavers over the play button three weeks and three days after i sent him the files of pretty petty thieves they came back to me captain spooky hadnt been at the lagoa since the day we talked about the good music the pure music the chest pains and the overheating had got worse so hed been to see his doctor and the man had gone berserk running around kicking a ball at his age at his weight in this heat of course the doctor still knew nothing but hed take his advicepurely precautionaryuntil the pain went away sorry it took so long he said in the email the quantum mainframe gets booked pretty solid i could see alone from the attachment details that they were changed fatter fresher frightening i dithered i hovered over the files i didnt want to open them i didnt want to hear them i wanted to rip them on to my system then and there i wanted to hear them like my daughters voice on the phone the sky is lilac but wont hold it much longer indigos coming theres a high jet nightbound up out over the atlantic its gold in the caught twilight the streets and the cars are twinkling and i watch the glow of the cable cars slide like pearls between the pendant lights of the stations rio has always irreducibly been she i hit play there is a ritual so i give it the three listens though from the very opening bar i can hear the difference the first time is still the whole thing i listen to pretty petty thieves straight through its some time before i hit the play button for the second listen im floored im on the ceiling my heart is racing and at the same time i shine like a child at a first communion its all there entire and full and rich and more ambitious more playful more daring than i could ever have imagined no holes this is a smooth highway of sound and its seu alejandro unmistakably seu alejandro though everything is new and strange and wonderful like falling in love it sounds like the greatest thing you ever heard i must listen again i must dive in and swim down deep between the tracks and the layers and the individual notes the second time i deeplisten thats a senegalese guitar with a deliberately primitive noreste fourpart harmony its mother africa but with seu alejandros signature english triphop beat but theres invention musique concrete from rio traffic noises fluttering as delicate as bird song over miracle of the fishes and a dazzling hilarious twostep of dub bass with nac√£o zumbi deathguitar thrashes on angela and angela kicking is so totally different i almost did not recognise the song on first pass now on second listen the changes are so radical i feel them as a physical shock it had been faux fun now its a shimmering shadowy dubstep dark and melancholic and then there is a ghost samba it is still the same simple cello line and heartbreak acoustic guitar but it has words now seu alejandros unearthly but diamondclear diamondsharp falsetto and a twitter of fouram electronics so ethereal it might come through a radio telescope the breath catches in my chest i can hear my heart its some time before i touch the play button again and now i listen to taste to eat the music and make it part of me this time i break my rule im impatient to get to the final track i want to hear seu alejandros words from whatever place captain spooky summoned him thats a tuesday afternoon question now i need it to be just me and seu alejandro high over the circling city lights its a song about a moment of wonder and the sweetness of loss like many of the best brasilian songs take her face out of the mornings ive seen that face imagined glimpses in a car across the highway a figure passing on the street that might just be a wish if our lives were like songs we would hear the harmonies we would live a chorus on the street we are older but no wiser and in a flicker well be gone full dark ive forgotten the hour my chest is heaving my face wet with tears i drove away the women who loved me i let my children go im not a bad man i just loved the music with all of my heart i always knew that the radio played just for me the songs never let you down they would always rhyme with your heart the cleaner finds me the next morning still in the chair in the yellow morning light your macumba is strong i say to captain spooky and slide the caipiroska across the table to him im one down already and its hit hard like a bailiffs knock i wield the power cosmic he says he takes a big draw from the drink he winces as the vodka goes down a grimace of pain jesus he thumps his fist against his breastbone gasps twice the laws of the multiverse bow down to me he looks like shit the kind of pale and pasty shit you get if you feed a dog too much dried food no but really what did you do in words a man can understand there is not one world there are many worlds there is not one me there are many mes yeah yeah including ones where my social universe doesnt consist solely of fortysomething males and there are universes where seu alejandro didnt go back into the studio since when have you become an expert on seu alejandro research is my business right and universes where that studio never caught fire so what exactly did you do the quantum computational equivalent of being a dj in your own bedroom i quantumised your master on the uni quantum core and then set her to rerender that spooky quantum computer of yours that spooky quantum computer of mine can perform calculations no other computer can in less than the lifetime of the universe because she exports the problem to her sisters in parallel universes somewhere in the region of ten to the power of eight hundred universes in a sense there is only ever one universal quantum computer spread through the whole multiverse its the one true universal constant when captain spooky talks like his name it makes my head spin and my balls contract the world around me goes pale and washedout like those old lastcentury postcards of rio bleached by the light of other suns millions upon billions of other universes numbers so huge that even if there were as many leblon beaches as there were grains of sand on leblon beach they still would not be one sandgrain of those other rios other lives other mes because i cant help but think about those other mes and the oblivious lives they lead on the balance of probabilities i cannot live the best of all those probable lives its equally unlikely that i live the worst i can easily imagine the worst ive seen it the terrible news from the multiverse is that i am grey and average im not a football hero or a samba star and i didnt marry an underwear model im not a wrecked man throwing bottles at the wall every lilac sunset or dead in some policeandmalandros firefight this is the best i can reasonably hope for this isendurable how can a man face such grand indifference i am not the centre of the universe after all so is basically the multiversal equivalent of clicking seu alejandro on quantum itunes and downloading pretty petty thieves captain spooky throws up his hands in grand offence theres some work in this you know mixing and stuff you mix my nephew works in radio hes got this software on his laptop the question is never mind my nephew or whatever quantum spookiness i pulled how does it sound i duck my head in a small acquiescence it sounds like seu alejandro well there you go now im going up to get something to eat do you want anything the grill part of the rodrigo de freitas bar and grill is a small perkilo restaurant fine for lining the stomach against a postmatch evening of drinking see we dont even have to worry about wednesday hangover captain spooky floats and dithers over the buffet eating by weight is a fine art to him hes shown me his trick of slipping a little finger under the scales to take a coupe of r√©is off the price but im hearing ghost sambas what the captain pulled in from across the universes is seu alejandro there is no doubt that its him from the moment i first heard that hunted melancholy street guitar and the incredible falsetto soar above it like christ the redeemer on his high hill from that evening he took the chatter and the cynicism of the cambuc√°s club and turned it all to him and held every soul in the place until he chose to release it ive learned every grace note seu alejandros played its him but of all the many many pretty petty thieves that exist across that headfrying multiverse how can i trust that this is the one that the seu alejandro who died in that studio fire intended the ghost in the scorched hard drive its a pretty petty thieves but can i ever know its the pretty petty thieves the crash is tremendous a clatter of plates and metal trays and cutlery hitting the harsh white tiles all at once captain spooky is on his side he is covered in cold starters his right leg is bent under him in an ugly terrifying way hes not moving hes not making any sound the tuesday afternoon boys are on their feet and the rodrigo de freitas bar and grill is filled with a dull bellowing rio is not a city for funerals suits dont suit us wed rather do our business in bermudas and havaianas s√£o paolo wedged between those eerie towers perhaps in one of those alltoocommon grey drizzles thats a city that does funerals well the crumbling pastel colonial facades of salvador and olinda there the slow rot and return to the earth is written into every housefront and baroque mission jesus that is a landscape of death rio is sex and life that life is cheapevery day i hear the gunfire and the sirensbut cariocas understand that that is how death is done here what rio will not forgive is a heart that just grew tired of her and stopped dead at the serving counter in a kilometric restaurant you get no kiss from bitch city so im too hot and too tight in my goingtofunerals suitim at that life stage where i need oneand the collar is chafing my neck for a time the priests were getting younger now theyre all getting older the seminaries cant get the young men its no life really the tuesday afternoon boys have all turned out in our suits and shades we look like a convention of dons our floral tribute is in the shape of a futsal ball the old captain would have appreciated the black joke but the family doesnt seem to appreciate the humour his daughters look good in their black miniskirts and hats the youngest has fantastic legs and that sullen pout thing i love in a girl his students are hot too they keep back acquaintances like us one of them is visibly upset the guy with his arms around her shoulder must be the boyfriend i wonder if he knows theyll fuck afterwards people always fuck after funerals its not just rios way its everyones way death and sex i talk with those faces you only see at funerals those partial conversations that like christmas or carnaval chat continue from calendar to date to calendar stitched through time then marcelo offers me a lift home did the cap ever give you his theory for why he was going to live forever was this another one of his quantumtheoryexplainseverythingintheuniverse theories that no one understood i always thought you understood marcelo punches the horn as a yellow honda full of teenagers cuts him up dont you have jobs to go to why arent you working parasites me god no i was just impressed with his theory for everything then you know what to blame when it goes wrong no he had this theory that he was going to live forever not just him everyone there was a price though and he was very drunk when he told me this he told it like an experiment like this youre a very old and very distinguished physics professor with a very hot young pa well she doesnt have to be young and hot she just needs to be an observer there always had to be observers in caps theories the reason that youre very old is that youre about to put down the big stake on a bet your life theres a gun with some quantum doohickey attached i dont know how it works but all it needs is to be a random russian roulette device you stand in front of the gun and then you say all right miss hottie start the process and record what you see the quantum device spins the gun at random and fires click nothing happens and again click nothing happens and a third time click youre still alive miss hottie notes it down round four the quantum device spins the chamber and fires oh my god screams miss hottie as you take one right smack between the eyes and go down dead as dead can be correct me if my quantum theory is flawed my friend but this sounds more like a quantum suicide device than an immortality theory not so fast round four other point of view the quantum thingie spins the barrel and fires and where miss hottie sees the back of your head come off all you hear is another click empty chamber at the lights a lad skinny as want waves his windshield squeegee at us i wave him away explain well i dont understand it but captain spooky did and according to him it was this now he was very drunk at the time but every time the quantum thingie spins the barrel it divides the multiverse into two sets of universes one in which you live and one in which you die im keeping up so far and the next time it spins that set of universes where you live on takes another hit a subset where you live another where you die this is basic probability anyone whos ever put a bet on will get this the odds get shorter all the time whether its dice or captain spookys parallel universes absolutely but no matter how many times the gun fires there will always be a universe where you live i consider that as we pass a group of pentecostals dressed in respectable whites holding some evangelical praiseservice in a bus shelter but in the one that really matters youre dead i say now here comes the spooky bit those universes where the gun fires youve no awareness of them youre dead the only realities which exist for you are the ones in which the gun hits the empty chamber and you live you cant perceive your own death so the quantum trigger runs on and the gun barrel spins and goes click click click and it will keep going click click how ever long you stand there because you must always survive to perceive those realities were at a light again a crente waves a badly printed tract at us i wave him away too im getting that coldness in my balls the clench of the alien but what about miss hottie she saw you die in front of the gun ah but thats her perception isnt it from your perception youre immortal no matter what happens a miracle will always save you youll never be in that fatal car crash or get into that mugging if you get cancer theyll find a cure if you get alzheimers theyll work something out when youre so old they have to feed you soup and hold your dick to pee theyll find some way to make you twentyfive again and hung like a horse because only you can perceive those universes where you exist youll be there at the fucking end of time itll be you and god i shiver again but its not quantum chill its the deeper darker cold of mortality and the futility of any hope against it captain spookys insane theories or the promise of a street corner evangelical tract i say i can see how this chimes with your gestalt theory mate but it didnt work for him did it hed say that were seeing from our own point of view were the miss hotties from his pointofview it was just a little twinge a little trapped wind a quick burp and hes fine theres a big difference between a quantum russian roulette machine and a dicky ticker yeah but he reckoned everything was quantum all the way up the only reason we couldnt see it was because our minds were all just aspects of that universal quantum computer he used to play with weve arrived at my apartment the beach is two blocks down lines of gold and blue like the design on a s cigarette packet i hate the beach i dont do beaches but today in my goingtofunerals suit and tootight tie it looks like heaven the captain surely did have a theory for everything i say that i think was the idea marcelo says you got your checkup booked i ask stepping out of the car the earliest i could get was friday marcelo says you next monday it does kind of make you sit and look after yourself i close the car door and i go to the beach i slop along the hot hot white sand in my sober suit grit filling my shoes there are gorgeous people here playing beach volleyball futvolley rollerblading along the sidewalk there are boats in the marina and stalls for beer and caipis and men fishing and old men just staring out across the bay their leather skins knuckled with melanomas im listening to pretty petty thieves sun and shade alegria and saudade joy and melancholy that has always been our music the final track plays a ghost samba those ghost worlds are real the guitar and cello the whispered vocals say we come from there among those parallel universes the captain is in a tutorial with his goodlooking students reading at his desk with his trademark small coffee exploring those other worlds and other lives on that magical computer hell never know about those worlds where his heart stops dead and drops him to the floor of his favourite perkilo restaurant theres a dark truth buried in captain spookys vision of himself stepping forward to the end of the universe one that makes this bright day and its people look as false and insubstantial as carnaval costumes around us others die by age or disease or accident but we live on little by little we lose everything and everyone every one of us is alone in our own little universe of ourselves i stop dead a mad man in a dark suit on a blazing beach and watch a tam shuttle lift off from santos dumont the compulsion formed in an instant possesses me i must know if the captains pretty petty thieves is the one my seu alejandro intended certainty is impossiblethats as true in pop music as quantum theorybut i can find hints and intimations there is still room for faith i trudge up between the brown volleyboys on to the sidewalk i sit on a bench and empty the sand out of my laceups if in another lifeanother universei had to be a favelado i think it would be in vila canoas its small and green and folded in on itself so that streets and alleys can cross each other several times theres an underground river police and taxi drivers eat in the diner on the corner they always know where the good food is theres even a neat little backpacker hostel ive never got that sense of perpetual tension i feel in big sister rocinha around the mountain as if the whole city on a hill might break lose and slide into the sea like an avalanche sweeping the rich of barra de tijuca before it so im a cosy middleclass music hack who doesnt know any speak of the street or the signs and ways you need to know to live as a vila canoista and not a tourist and i wouldnt last more than two nights in this place without killing or being killed but i like the circle of forested mountains and the lap of sea i like the way the clouds catch around s√£o conrado mountain hanggliders circle through the mist up there like hawks on the intersection at the caf√© a youth painstakingly welds an old toyota pickup his gun wired into the streetlight i turn off into the shadowed alleys between the leaning buildings overhung by ramshackle balconies and washing there is the studio rebuilt and now a dj school i remembered it burned i remember the yellow walls smokestained and the green paint peeled away the windows and doors empty and eyeless vila canoas was a pilgrimage site for a time i was one of many who laid flowers and set candles and plastic virgins flamengo shirts and thongs to the seu i feel the hard drive in the breast pocket of my jacket grown heavy and warm theres a second pretty petty thief in it the ghost captain spooky found on the shores of the multiverse the bar across the alley is changeless a brick counter built into the underhang beneath an apartment house a bench seat set into the opposite wall the television blares some canal quatro reality shit the usual malandros loll around with antarcticas one in green with an attempted moustache one in yellow with a smart light in his eye one in white who thinks he rules they nod when i greet them i wonder if you could help me does the dona severino de araujo still live round here the barman steps back to better regard me his bar is the width of a street i dont know who you mean i introduce myself the music journalist i have a column in copa news looks headshakes shrugs i do a radio programme on saturday afternoons the history of mpb kid in yellow throws his head back just before football focus i know you now so youre looking for the dona ive something i want to show her something the seu left behind i think i remember you now says the barman you did some interviews with her and his sisters i saw them they were good they all look at the emperor in white he stubs out a cigarette youll find her where you found her last time he says its easy to get lost here says kid green ill show you he casts off from the bar and leads by two steps behind through the labyrinth of alleys and tunnels im sure i didnt go this way before im sure it was straighter less shadowed but the house are built and rebuilt and the streets change so often up here its as if they move themselves in the night we drill down into the roots of vila canoas through a doorway skewed into a parallelogram and along a short concrete tunnel lined with televisionlit windows the sound of running water rushes around the corridor we cross the buried stream that races down from s√£o conrado on a concrete culvert and climb a flight of steps towards the sun its there that i hear the onceheard nevermistaken sound and turn to face the gun in green boys hand look im just a journalist i offer him my wallet my cellular my cards he knows will be biometriced usable only to my touch but i give them to him anyway i pray he wont kidnap and march me to an atm every day until ive emptied out my own account move slowly withhold nothing and let them know they are in total control ive been held up before i know the drill whats in the pocket green waves his gun barrel i think of denying i think of lying but the square bulge of the drive betrays me i take out the master disk carefully between thumb and forefinger its only music an ipod no its a hard drive an ipod an mp player its for dona de araujo seu alejandros mother its a present for her an ipod green boy says again hes chewing his lip repeatedly now thats never good no its not an ipod im getting agitated give it to him give him whatever he wants get down on your knees and blow him if you need to but its pretty petty thieves give me the fucking ipod green screams its not a fucking ipod i scream back over the gurgle of buried water i pull my hand back he stabs forward with the gun i see his finger close on the trigger and i hear a click a deadgun

lady churchills rosebud wristlet she is an active member of sfwa and senior editor at shimmer magazine when they found my uncle wandering incoherent in the foggy morning streets he wasnt wearing his own clothes a man unknown to me brought word of my uncles illness presenting me with a small folded letter on fine ivory paper the paper shushed between our bare fingers a moment before he turned away he traced his way through the general store with its many occupants back into the bustle of the street sir clutching the letter at which id only glanced i followed him through the double doors grabbing his jacket sleeve before he could be overcome by a claret and gold fourinhand the black horses blew past us and onward down the cobblestones with the loud ring of their silvershod feet overtaking my words the man glared down at me as if i had upset his day rather than he mine there was something in his eyes half familiar and frightening he was not an older man he seemed of a marrying age but i knew he was not married how i knew this i could not say he disliked my consideration of him and twisted his arm free from my hold youd best go now he hasnt much time are you a friend to my uncle he refused me even that much information and hurried down the street after the fourinhand octobers breeze lifting the tails of his coat behind him i blinked once and he was fully gone if anyone else upon the street noticed something odd about that they didnt look sideways i expected someone to gasp and say but here he walked here a moment ago and now has vanished like a candles flame under a breath no one said a word the people were too wrapped in their own business carefully i smoothed the letter i had crumpled the ink had smudged upon the page written in a hand i did not know my uncle had been found this morning he now rested at the college hospital and as the mysterious man had the letter urged me to hurry to his side before he passed into the next world there were things in that next world that my uncle would welcome i thought as i left off shopping and followed the fingerboards to the hospital i had never been there in my twenty years my mother and father died there so my uncle told me leaving me in his capable care ever after he seemed capable no longer doctors led me to my uncles side and he did not know me he clutched at my skirts and muttered reynolds fonderous reynolds i untangled his hand and saw that he indeed wore someone elses clothes the trousers were butternut the coat an earthy brown my uncle always even on sundays wore black even his boiled shirts would have been black but this one was whiter than id ever seen with a smudge of blood against the collar were blood to be mostly ochre uncle he startled and reached blindly out i grabbed his clammy hand and lowered myself to his bedside to breathe in the scent of him there was no alcohol on his breath as id feared he groaned and tried to roll away from me this motion pulled his shirt cuff back exposing the pink abraded skin of his wrist what happened to you i whispered i couldnt fathom it edgar poe was my only kin the man who taught me geography and history the man who could scare a rationalminded young woman like me under my bed with his stories of vengeful madmen the man who preferred spending rainy days writing poetry or walking baltimores streets in search of such fonderous rreynolds he asked the sseam above the floor oh vast sky he closed his eyes and turned his head against the pillow but held firm to my hand miss franks dr griffin an older man with soft hands and hard eyes had been known to me for years the first time my uncle was found publicly drunk it was dr griffin who brought him to the hospital to sober up i saw pity on his face now but i shook my head and stood to meet him hes sober i said the doctor scrubbed a hand over his unshaven cheeks your assessment agrees with my own your uncle is suffering from a malady unknown to me did he recognize you no i looked down at my uncle i saw him just yesterday and he was well have you seen his wrist reynolds my uncle cried endless lands vilest fire he shoved the sheets off his body scrambling backward in an attempt to get out of the bed when he hit the headboard he turned to his left rolled onto the checkerboard floor and crawled away dr griffin called for his colleagues i could not get near my uncle without him shrieking anew i backed away only realizing i was crying when nurse templeton shoved a handkerchief into my hand go home miss franks dr griffin said over his struggles with my uncle the seam my uncle screamed these words over and over until i covered my ears to block itbut still i heard it like a heartbeat the seam the seam dr griffin and three other men carried my uncle back to the bed and firmly strapped him down by hand and foot they bound him and when this made his screams worse they also bound his mouth he screamed even beyond the gag muffled and strained you cant nurse templeton led me out of the room and closed the door behind us i was shaking as she guided me to a chair and pushed me into it i stared at her heavily lined mouth unable to understand a word that came from it she gave me a hard shake and then i heard come again tomorrow perhaps he will be well i knew as i walked back to our townhouse in the mist that one evening would not solve my uncles problems what had happened to haunt his eyes so what part did the stranger from this morning play my uncle had employed a housekeeper these last two years to tidy what he messed while i spent my days as a tailors assistant though mrs wine would have made me a warm dinner i sent her home i wanted only to be alone i locked the door behind her discarded my coat and bag and went to my uncles office it was the one room mrs wine was asked not to touch but nothing struck me as unusual as i entered papers and books were spread over the sofa and chairs over desktop and floor i lifted a pile from one chair and sat bringing the sheets into my lap he was working on a new poem i fell asleep reading of a city by the sea where mortals bought fruit from angels carrying baskets i didnt dream of this place i didnt dream of anything when i woke i felt rested and wondered if morning had come but the thought left my mind when i saw the man who gave me the note perched in a far corner watching me think of it you believe yourself alone in your own home are comfortable enough to sleep wherever you lay down and when you wake your mind still fuzzy from its rest you discover yourself not alone but watched your mind races but it cant catch your heart how long has he watched you was he there when i came in who is he and how did he gain entry i pictured broken windows and doors but felt it was worse than that this man had come inside another way a way unknown to me that frightened me most of all please do not scream he said i screamed i flung my uncles poetry and fled the office feeling this man close on my heels he yanked the door open when i meant to slam it he snatched my skirts slowing my escape his fingers seemed to catch my hair and pull me backward through his fingertips i felt shackles around my uncles wrists those hands had placed them there but not in this world in another reynolds i asked his touch vanished i swung around in the darkness of the hallway and felt a presence though i could not see him he called me that his crumpled velvet voice brushed against my cheek go to your uncle the voice came from all around me now disembodied as i turned round i would have sworn to the stroke of fingers against my skirts shush shush my heart pounded in my throat what did you do to my uncle this man admitted nothing round and round he circled me i felt his eyes upon me half familiar and frightening but still i could see nothing of him maddening his coldkissed fingers brushed over my cheeks and then i was horribly alone i did not sleep that night i checked the doors and windows but decided it would not matter how securely they were locked that man had come into our house another way taking no chance i retrieved my uncles small pistol from the locked box beneath his bed and sat with my back to the wall the entire night through rain drummed upon the roof in its rhythm i found words the seam the seam come morning i went to the hospital the pistol concealed in my brocade reticule i would not be caught unawares another time by reynolds whatever name he took my uncle was less coherent that morning dr griffin reluctant to allow me into his room i have bled him twice to no effect griffin said to me outside my uncles door the doctor paced slapping the back of one hand into the palm of the other i begin to fear miss franks that he has a blackness within him and if i cannot find and remove it he shall perish reynolds first words echoed back at me youd best go now he hasnt much time would he perish at the doctors hands or was my uncle already near death from whatever had befallen him i gripped my reticule feeling through the fabric the line of the pistol was it the solidity of the gun that calmed me or the idea of pressing it against reynolds chin i want to speak with my uncle i said and made to move past the doctor to open my uncles door griffin grabbed me by the arm to forestall me then dropped it when a nurse passed us he bowed his head to look at me through narrowed eyes absolutely not i dont believe you grasp the seriousness of the situation miss franks being accosted by a strange man in ones own home was quite serious enough for me griffin continued his tone was low and calm as though he were trying to calm a spooked horse when i remove his gag he speaks of terrible things i do not understand the blackness within him i need to find it cut it out we loosened him for a bit this morning as a test and he nearly cut out his own eye i grabbed dr griffin by the arm as he had me in an effort to make him understand that on this matter i would not be budged i will speak with my uncle i said no matter the terrible things he says i will the doctor let me step into the room and did not follow i closed the door to blot out his disapproving expression however now in the gray room with its scent of antiseptic and rapidly aging old man i hesitated i looked across the room at the figure in the bed and did not recognize it for my uncle this man was thin and dark lashed to a bed with a thin mattress a hard rubber gag covered his mouth and now even his eyes were masked coarse hair covered his sunken cheeks uncle he did not move and i wondered if he was sleeping or dead i held my breath as i waited for the rise of his chest only when i saw that feeble movement did i step toward the bed i set my reticule on the bedside table and reached for the mask which covered edgars eyes the tie was lost in the birds nest of his hair it took some time to find the end when at last i loosened the ties i found myself looking into unfamiliar eyes or let me say that upon longer examination the eyes themselves were painfully familiarit was the deep wrinkles around them it was the pale white scar above the left eye it was the freshly stitched wound below the rightthese were the things i could not equate with my uncle with some difficulty i loosened and removed the gag from his mouth edgar closed his mouth licked his lips and swallowed do you know me i asked him his eyes rolled back into his head and he turned his cheek against the pillow vilest fire his voice cracked the words apart like they were nutshells in his throat hunters stab never sleeping skythe seam above the floor the seam he spoke of phenomenon and contraptions i could not understand while his hands moved against his bonds fingers straining to reach the unseen his eyes seemed to watch an invisible dance in the air between the bed and ceiling flit flit glide i had hoped to make some sense of the terrible things dr griffin mentioned but as my uncle spoke on and on until his voice dried to a whisper i could find no reason in the words there was only one word that made sense to me and when he said it at last his eyes moved to the far corner of the room reynolds i turned in time to see the man called reynolds slink out of the room the tail of his brown coat how like the coat my uncle had been found in slithered out the door a second before it closed how long has he watched you how did he get in my heart stammered in my chest i grabbed my bag and followed reynolds from the hall only in time to see his coattails once again slide around a distant corner i fled past dr griffin and into the blowing rain of the day reynolds was a tall man with a long stride and there was no keeping pace with him by the time i reached the store where i had first met reynolds i could see no sign of him then coming down the cobblestones appeared the same gold and claret fourinhand i had seen the day before reynolds now perched beside the driver the horses hooves didnt seem to touch the ground even though i heard them clearly ring against the street stone i lunged into the street for the driver would have to stop for fear that he might hit me but he didnt the hot breath of one horse curled over my cheek before the world went black i woke if one can awaken when one does not remember sleeping atop the auburn horse harness and tack cutting into my left hand while my right still clung to my bag with its pistol the ground sped away beneath me at a dreadful haste and for a moment i buried my face in the horses mane my cheek lay against hot horsehide silky redgold mane blinding me every part of my body jostled as the carriage continued onward i chanced a backwards glance at the driver and reynolds and squeezed my eyes shut a second after they were not men another look proved this true the driver sat tall in the seat a black coat dripping from its narrow body a tattered blue scarf gave the illusion of a neck but i feared he truly had none the octangular head was small and gray with bulging black eyes that must have taken everything in at once surely he saw me staring at his four spindly legs and two arms all of which seemed employed in driving the carriage his arms bore spines and hooks over which he had draped a couple reins but i felt certain this wasnt their main usage miss franks it was reynolds who spoke but a reynolds i did not recognize reynolds possessed a squat body colored brown with slim yellow stripes and he now spoke through mandibles his brown coat had pooled around him why his thin arms would never support the fabric hold fast he said we cannot stop in the endless lands i turned my head around so that i might see these endless lands for myself lifted myself on elbows enough to see around the whipping horse mane every bit of baltimore had vanished and all around us spread a seemingly endless blur of gold shot through with ruby stars whirlpools twisted in the sky churning nausea within me as i watched them i watched until i felt i would be ill then bowed and buried my head again i prayed the ride would soon be over but perhaps there was no one to answer that prayer for the ride went on and on the motion of the horse beneath me soon became familiar enjoyable i had never known such a sensation its warm hide was also a comfort as the air grew colder around us there seemed to be no sun yet all around us were slanting shafts of light colored golden and ivory they fell from above and the more i watched them the more my eyes began to adjust and see what truly lay around us the land was no longer barren perhaps it never had been my eyes became accustomed to the light and the way it changed the landscape around us from one angle the land was empty from another i could glimpse strange constructs in the distance there seemed to be little near the horizon everything i was able to see hovered in that sunless sky if i saw other people it was only briefly i saw what seemed a woman but the wind was tearing her apart she shredded arms and legs peeling apart like fabric and then even her clothing lifted up and away this didnt seem to bother her she smiled and went on her way into the vast sky oh that vast skymy uncles sky had he seen this place and breathed this air this air that smelled vaguely of apricots and roasting meat washed over us in abrupt gusts forcing my eyes shut i savored the darkness i couldnt understand this place what was it and how could it exist the more i wondered the more ill i felt i remembered my baltimore with its rainwashed streets hints of sky caught between close buildings people rushing to and from work there seemed no such things here the carriage never slowed my nausea deepened i became aware of hands on my shoulders an arm under my legs reynolds lifted me from the horse and carried me back into the carriage itself i lay on the padded bench and stared at him sitting opposite me in this light he looked like a man and had a beautiful mouth the thought should have shocked me but it didnt you shouldnt be here he said that much is plain i had to fight to say the words and my voice didnt sound right when i finally forced them out i fought also to sit up to focus my attention on reynolds even though i knew he wasnt a man he appeared as such and it gradually began to calm my mind youve placed me in quite a predicament he added i could hardly believe he was serious but i recalled the look on his face the day wed met when id pulled him back from this very carriage i now understood i had kept him from returning what had drawn him out in the first place what else tied us together my uncle i thought as my eyes settled on reynolds vest youyoure wearing my uncles vest i said i sewed it for him a gift last christmas reynolds said his dark velvet voice was rough again how can you know that my hands sought the bag at my side but i no longer carried it my pistol was lost edgar told me all about you his mouth bent into a smile and i realized this man knew things about me he shouldnt know he knew about my first pet a kitten named croak and my first formal dance how id stumbled down the last two stairs and fallen to reveal entirely too much to those gathered he knew my uncles stories could frighten me and he knew that deep down i loved the fear i dont understand i blinked back tears and looked out the carriage window the angle of light allowed me to see to the horizon this time against its waterwashed color i saw a wrecked whale bone ship closer to the carriage wheels i saw pallid bloated creatures upon the shifting ground one of them held a golden key in its mouth how long have you known my uncle i asked i looked back at reynolds who watched me and not the world beyond the windows how long was he your prisoner i did not imprison your uncle though others of my kind did i felt you put those shackles on him reynolds said nothing to that maybe it was an action he couldnt argue maybe he had been forced whichever he kept his silence watching me with keen eyes that seemed to see all of me at once he knew my parents were dead and he knew he knew edgar was my only family stop watching me i whispered i will not reynolds said i spent far too many years dreaming of you to look away now i curled my hands into my skirts what the devil do you mean by that if i thought i could have survived it i would have jumped from the carriage i think reynolds must have known this for he grasped my hands and held me firm your uncle should never have come here i tried to fix that and have failed the least i could do was see that he didnt die alone this time hes gone now all youve known is gone you shouldnt be here but i cant help but be happy you are i jumped from the carriage then reynolds words scared me worse than the idea of death i wrenched my hands out of his pushed him backwards and kicked the door open i flung myself into the speeding landscape and landed in sandy loose ground there was no sign of the carriage nor any sound from it its wheels had left no tracks wherever i was i needed to get out but there was nothing to guide me no sun no landmarks nothing on the horizon here i wiped the grit from my eyes and strained to see through the beams of light reynolds found me first i caught him from the corner of my eye running at me as fast as the carriage horses had flown i turned to run but the ground seemed to suck me down reynolds was on me before i could escape he dragged me down and pinned my hands slapping a shackle around one wrist beast i cried unable to wrench myself free literally that is true reynolds said his nice mouth curled in a sneer edgar called me fonderous i slapped him with my free hand he felt of flesh and bone and his skin reddened as would any mans under a strike but he only laughed and secured the other shackle to my other wrist come on reynolds kept hold of the shackles pulling me alongside him the ground beneath our feet became increasingly more solid less sandy and i walked with a little more assurance even if i didnt have the first notion where we were going we were certainly making a good pace i want you to understand reynolds said as we crested a slight rise in the land i could see beasts in the distance moving high in the sky even so they were still tethered to the ground by long spindly legs then speak plainly i am your captive audience a look of pain crossed reynolds face i had seen the same thing in my uncle at the hospital just that morning we must reach the city miss franks he said will you come back into the carriage we cannot reach it on foot i now saw the carriage awaiting us a claretcolored shimmer in the strange air there was no choice was there go with reynolds to his city or stay here where i knew no direction and might wander forever i lifted my hands unbind me and i will come with you i said reynolds did not argue he unlocked my shackles with a key he kept in his sleeve we climbed back into the carriage and without word to the driver were off reynolds watched me the entire ride and i told myself i didnt care i didnt care i never witnessed stranger things than i did in the city itself the light continued to play tricks upon my mind and the buildings seemed half open to the sky the people of the city were paper thin on edge they could not be seen though when they turned a certain way in the light their monstrous faces became dreadfully apparent some looked as our carriage driver did others i could barely comprehend i quickly learned how to look in order to see only the slimmest slice of them when i learned this manner of looking i discovered something else this city was not anchored to the ground indeed the entire place was on the move buildings and artworks balanced on the backs of immense creatures a great distance below us i could see their small feet moving legs made of thin spirewire upward to their fabulous bodiesbearing these incredible weights so too i realized the carriage had come to rest upon its four horses they carried us without effort through the buildings the creatures the people balanced upon a road of memory between this place makes no sense i said and reynolds laughed darkly he pressed behind me at the carriage window his hand beneath my ribcage did he fear i would jump again or did he just find pleasure in touching me your uncle wanted to understand it do you remember his stories his poems i had forgotten them and indeed baltimore my uncle the rain the everything until reynolds brought them back to me i had trouble breathing when i remembered it all all i had now lost he wrote of this place i said once the idea was voiced i saw my uncle everywhere i looked there he had written of that strange creature with its shrieking hair and there he had written of that building ever in flame my uncles mind sparked in every shadow of this place as the creatures made their roads of memory so too my uncle made the roads circling ever on one begetting the beginning of the other he helped create this place reynolds said the horses carried us to an enormous throne so large it took three of the creatures to support it how they managed ill never know reynolds bid me to hold his hand for id never walked a street such as this it was alive beneath my feet guiding us from the carriage up to the throne where a woman awaited us her boundless hyacinth hair spilled down her body like water to her feet and beyond where gardenias and sand dollars scattered silver stars gleamed around her head she wore a comet for a bracelet endlessly circling sparking with vilest fire near her throne sat dark handwoven baskets filled with fruit she reached down plucked a green pear and offered it to me i did not take it i had read my uncles stories and knew well enough what happened to young women who ate the fruit of strange lands the queen if she were such took no offense she smiled down at me then looked at reynolds you failed she said i did he bowed before her he has died alone yet again speak plain the both of you granted my uncle had also written stories of outspoken young women their end was little better than that of those who ate the fruit i didnt care i was somewhere beyond care neither spoke rather they showed me the queen twisted the pear in half and within its gritty flesh i saw my uncle writing he wrote of this place of a city near a sea he slept each night and thought he dreamed but his dreams were not that at all he came here snatched away by these people fairy he named them but they were not it was the only word he knew to apply they stole him away every night him and more of his kind artists all for these creatures loved their minds i felt this love equal to my own for edgar poe but this love had a dark side for as they loved these artists they consumed them when my uncle made to escape and leave this place behind they chained him they held him naked and dirty in an unlit cell how many cells stretched in the darkness i could not count them all this placed smelled of your worst imaginingsdarker fouler there was a seam of light that came through the door to hover above the floor the seam within this light dust sparked dreams flicked in this place my uncle wrote stories in his head despite their cruelty to him some part of my uncle still loved the magic of these people the impossibility he loved that they made him create better stories stories that helped create their fantastic reality only one person visited my uncle edgar came to name him reynolds reynolds came daily to take stories for his people to bring edgar a measure of food and clean water eventually edgars stories turned from madmen to a sorrowful young woman who did not even know she was sorrowful the thing that pleased her most were the stories so my uncle kept on spinning them reynolds fell in love with this young woman with me my uncle escaped themi laughed through my tears at the sight of him slipping his bonds like a magician he stole clothesno see there it is a hand a hand offering edgar clothing that was not his own reynolds hand death has little meaning here the queen said as she squashed half of the pear and tossed it away though it means much in your world please speak plain i whispered the scent of pear and despair sharp in the air between us i glanced at reynolds please i helped your uncle escape reynolds said the first time he died alone unknown i undid that memory as one undoes a knot i thought i had looked into his eyes before i had kissed that mouth once i remembered these things though through a wash of water they were blurred and indistinct reynolds had tried once before i had not listened and tried again i brought him to baltimore got you the note you reached him and yet now youve come here and he will die alone has died alone you can only return to death the queen said and threw away the rest of the nowrotted pear your uncle is dead reynolds said the moment he returned the years he had been here caught up to him but he wasnt gone years i said surely there was a mistake i felt desperate to make these creatures understand that only overnight i feared him drunk and sleeping it off overnight to you reynolds said and his voice skipped he was taken almost every night and every day returned to his world to my world to live years over the course of a night to wake each morning in his bed thinking it all a dream how i had once laughed at my uncle and his small circle of friends all of them old bent men how young might they have honestly been miss franks he clasped my hands within his own agnes i never intended for you to come here you are dead to your world time has gone on without you and made what it will of baltimore though i wished to believe that all of this was some terrible dream i knew within my heart that it was not edgars stories of this place should have prepared me he had seen this place its people had loved him and in the end destroyed him only overnight i said i can go back i had to know what had become of my world was my uncle truly gone had the thing i feared most come to pass it could not be what if he still lived what are you not telling me reynolds grabbed my arm is isnt just overnightnot for you it was then that reynolds trespass became clear to me i had misunderstood what the queen showed me every day my uncle woke in my world it was reynolds who brought him to that moment reynolds unstitched the decades that had passed within this strange world to bring my uncle back into my time so that i might have a living relation at my side how many times should my uncle have died it was no wonder he tried to cut out his own eyes when at last he seemed firmly rooted here it remains her choice the queen said to reynolds you asked us to allow that to never take another of her kind without their permission this is no different because you love her i looked beyond the queens starwreathed head to the vast sky where golden birds stretched their wings no not birds angels when i looked the right direction i saw their slim bodies but where was the sea my uncle wrote of i wondered and watched the slow ebb and flow of the entire city itself and realized the city is the sea and wanted to weep with the joy of it you would live a full life here reynolds said my eyes met reynolds when i looked at him a certain way i saw the truth of him his true body and if i looked deeper i saw to the heart of him darker fouler a seam of brightness he could take me back as he did my uncle i thought but he doesnt want to he wanted to keep me i want to go back i had to go to lookto see whatever had become of whatever i loved the queen seized my chin in her pearwet hand and my world went black when light returned it fell in hazy curtains around me the air was ashen bits of burnt paper falling as snow would walls like skeletal fingers rose around me scattered bricks the stench of burnt wood i saw hunched figures in the street and ran for them but as i neared they became only heaps of more debris i saw no people though my legs were tired and ached with each step and my lungs burned i walked on i walked up streets once familiar to me dead burnt things crunched underfoot i searched for anything i might recognize and while there were ruined shops aplenty i knew none of them i walked through all the wreckage of this city until the sun touched and began to fall below the horizon exhaustion dragged me to sit on a curb and i couldnt find the energy to mind the rubbish i settled in how many years had passed baltimore by how long had the city lain in ruin was it god who decided to destroy this place or man did it matter at all in the remains at my feet i found a scrap of poetry about a woman with hyacinth hair it could not be my uncles handwritingthough perhaps it was for as i stood to continue my journey i could not remember his handwriting i could barely remember his face it was his voice i remembered best of all and the beat of those words in my head the seam it rested inside of me unable to escape hed wept for it in the end shouting for reynolds to snatch him back to that world i folded the page into my hand and walked on as far as i walked the whole city through there was only gray ruin i yelled but no one answered perhaps there was no one to answer anyone i cried as loud as i could from the middle of the street i looked to the sky the veiled sun now set in the gray west my world was dead i had nothing i looked at my filthy hands and saw them old and wrinkled i was but twenty and felt the universe retreating from me reynolds fonderous reynolds the ring of hooves on cobblestones answered me sharp and distinct down the ruined street they came pulling a claret and gold fourinhand there was one thing left to me hope in the brightness in the seam above the floor hope that there existed in that place a life worth living with beings i might one day love my uncle was dead in both worlds but i was only dead in one i stepped in the path of the carriage and my world went black but only for a moment signal to noise alastair reynolds was born in

chasm city won the british science fiction award and he has been shortlisted for the arthur c clarke award three times in he left scientific research to write full time he married in and returned to wales in where he lives in rhondda cynon taff friday mick leighton was in the basement with the machines when the police came for him hed been trying to reach joe liversedge all morning to cancel a prearranged squash match it was the busiest week before exams and mick had gloomily concluded that he had too much tutorial work to grade to justify sparing even an hour for the game the trouble was that joe had either turned off his phone or left it in his office where it wouldnt interfere with the machines mick had sent an email but when that had gone unanswered he decided there was nothing for it but to stroll over to joes half of the building and inform him in person by now mick was a sufficiently wellknown face in joes department that he was able to come and go more or less as he pleased hello matey joe said glancing over his shoulder with a halfeaten sandwich in one hand there was a bandage on the back of his neck just below the hairline he was hunched over a desk covered in laptops cables and reams of hardcopy ready for a thrashing are you thats why im here mick said got to cancel sorry too much on my plate today naughty ted evans can fill in for me hes got his kit you know ted dont you vaguely joe set down his sandwich to put the lid back on a felttipped pen he was an amiable yorkshireman whod come down to cardiff for his postgraduate work and decided to stay he was married to an archaeologist named rachel who spent a lot of her time poking around in the roman ruins under the walls of cardiff castle sure i cant twist your arm itll do you good you know bit of a workout i know but there just isnt time your call how are things anyway mick shrugged philosophically been better did you phone andrea like you said you were going to no you should you know im not very good on the phone anyway i thought she probably needed a bit of space its been three weeks mate i know do you want the wife to call her it might help no but thanks for suggesting it anyway call her let her know youre missing her ill think about it yeah sure you should stick around you know its all go here this morning we got a lock just after seven this morning joe tapped one of the laptop screens which was scrolling rows of blackonwhite numbers its a good one too really come and have a look at the machine i cant i need to get back to my office youll regret it later just like youll regret canceling our match or not calling andrea i know you mick youre one of lifes born regretters five minutes then in truth mick always enjoyed having a nose around joes basement as solid as micks own earlyuniverse work was joe had really struck gold there were hundreds of researchers around the world who would have killed for a guided tour of the liversedge laboratory in the basement were ten hulking machines each as large as a steam turbine you couldnt go near them if you were wearing a pacemaker or any other kind of implant but mick knew that and hed been careful to remove all metallic items before he came down the stairs and through the security doors each machine contained a ten tonne bar of ultrahighpurity iron encased in vacuum and suspended in a magnetic cradle joe liked to wax lyrical about the hardness of the vacuum about the dynamic stability of the magnetic field generators cardiff could be hit by a richter six earthquake and the bars wouldnt feel the slightest tremor joe called it the call center the machines were called correlators at any one time eight were online while two were down for repairs and upgrades what the eight functional machines were doing was coldcalling dialing random numbers across the gap between quantum realities waiting for someone to answer on the other end in each machine a laser repeatedly pumped the iron into an excited quantum state by monitoring vibrational harmonics in the excited ironwhat joe called the backchirpthe same laser could determine if the bar had achieved a lock onto another strand of quantum realityanother worldline in effect the bar would be resonating with its counterpart in another version of the same basement in another version of cardiff once that lock was establishedonce the coldcalling machine had achieved a hitthen those two previously indistinguishable worldlines were linked together by an information conduit if the laser tapped the bar with lowenergy pulses enough to influence it but not upset the lock then the counterpart in the other lab would also register those taps it meant that it was possible to send signals from one lab to the other in both directions this is the boy joe said patting one of the active machines looks like a solid lock too should be good for a full ten or twelve days i think this might be the one that does it for us mick glanced again at the bandage on the back of joes neck youve had a nervelink inserted havent you straight to the medical center as soon as i got the alert on the lock i was nervousfirst time and all that but it turned out to be dead easy no pain at all i was up and out within half an hour they even gave me a rich tea biscuit ooh a rich tea biscuit it doesnt get any better than that does it youll be going through today i take it joe reached up and tore off the bandage revealing only a small spot of blood like a shaving nick tomorrow probably maybe sunday the nervelink isnt active yet and thatll take some getting used to weve got bags of time though even if we dont switch on the nervelink until sunday ill still have five or six days of bandwidth before we become noiselimited you must be excited right now i just dont want to cock up anything the helsinki boys are nipping at our heels as it is i reckon theyre within a few months of beating us mick knew how important this latest project was for joe sending information between different realities was one thing and impressive enough in its own right but now that technology had escaped from the labs out into the real world there were hundreds of correlators in other labs and institutes around the world in five years it had gone from being a spooky barely believable phenomenon to an accepted part of the modern world but joewhose team had always been at the forefront of the technologyhadnt stood still theyd been the first to work out how to send voice and video comms across the gap with another reality and within the last year theyd been able to operate a cameraequipped robot the same batterydriven kind that all the tourists had been using before nervelinking became the new thing joe had even let mick have a go on it with his hands operating the robots manipulators via forcefeedback gloves and his eyes seeing the world via the stereoscopic projectors in a virtualreality helmet mick had been able to feel himself almost physically present in the other lab hed been able to move around and pick things up just as if he were actually walking in that alternate reality oddest of all had been meeting the other version of joe liversedge the one who worked in the counterpart lab both joes seemed cheerily indifferent to the weirdness of the setup as if collaborating with a duplicate of yourself was the most normal thing in the world mick had been impressed by the robot but for joe it was a stepping stone to something even better think about it hed said a few years ago tourists started switching over to nervelinks instead of robots who wants to drive a clunky machine around some smelly foreign city when you can drive a warm human body instead robots can see stuff they can move around and pick stuff up but they cant give you the smells the taste of food the heat the contact with other people mm mick had said noncommittally he didnt really approve of nervelinking even though it essentially paid andreas wages so were going to do the same weve got the kit getting it installed is a piece of piss all we need now is a solid link and now joe had what hed been waiting for mick could practically see the nature coverarticle in his friends eyes perhaps he was even thinking about taking that long train ride to stockholm i hope it works out for you mick said joe patted the correlator again ive got a good feeling about this one that was when one of joes undergraduates came up to them to micks surprise it wasnt joe she wanted to speak to doctor leighton thats me theres somebody to see you sir i think its quite important someone to see me they said you left a note in your office i did mick said absentmindedly but i also said i wouldnt be gone long nothings that important is it but the person who had come to find mick was a policewoman when mick met her at the top of the stairs her expression told him it wasnt good news somethings happened he said she looked worried and very very young is there somewhere we can talk mister leighton use my office joe said showing the two of them to his room just down the corridor joe left the two of them alone saying he was going down to the coffee machine in the hall ive got some bad news the policewoman said when joe had closed the door i think you should sit down mister leighton mick pulled out joes chair from under the desk which was covered in papers coursework joe must have been in the process of grading mick sat down then didnt know where to put his hands its about andrea isnt it im afraid your wife was in an accident this morning the policewoman said what kind of accident what happened your wife was hit by a car when she was crossing the road a mean little thought flashed through micks mind bloody andrea shed always been one for dashing across a road without looking hed been warning her for years she was going to regret it one day how is she where did they take her im really sorry sir the policewoman hesitated your wife died on the way to hospital i understand that the paramedics did all they could but mick was hearing it and not hearing it it couldnt be right people still got knocked down by cars but they didnt die from it not anymore cars couldnt go fast enough in towns to kill anyone being knocked down and killed by a car was something that happened to people in soap operas not real life feeling numb not really present in the room mick said where is she now as if by visiting her he might prove that theyd got it wrong that she wasnt dead at all they took her to the heath sir thats where she is now i can drive you there andrea isnt dead mick said she cant be not now im really sorry the policewoman said saturday for the last three weeks ever since they had separated mick had been sleeping in a spare room at his brothers house in newport the company had been good but now bill was away for the weekend on some ridiculous teambuilding exercise in snowdonia for tedious reasons micks brother had had to take the house keys with him leaving mick with nowhere to sleep on friday night when joe had asked him where he was going to stay mick said hed go back to his own house the one hed left at the beginning of the month joe was having none of it and insisted that mick sleep at his house instead mick spent the night going through the usual cycle of emotions that came with any sudden bad news hed had nothing to compare with losing his wife but the texture of the shock was familiar enough albeit magnified from anything in his previous experience he resented the fact that the world seemed to be continuing crassly oblivious to andreas death the news wasnt dominated by his tragedy it was all about some polish miners trapped underground when he finally managed to get to sleep mick was tormented by dreams that his wife was still alive that it had all been a mistake but he knew it was all true hed been to the hospital hed seen her body he even knew why shed been hit by the car andrea had been crossing the road to her favorite hair salon shed had an appointment to get her hair done knowing andrea she had probably been so focused on the salon that she was oblivious to all that was going on around her it hadnt even been the car that had killed her in the end when the slowmoving vehicle knocked her down andrea had struck her head against the side of the curb by midmorning on saturday micks brother had returned from snowdonia bill came around to joes house and hugged mick silently saying nothing for many minutes then bill went into the next room and spoke quietly to joe and rachel their low voices made mick feel like a child in a house of adults i think you and i need to get out of cardiff bill told mick when he returned to the living room no ifs no buts mick started to protest theres too much that needs to be done i still need to get back to the funeral home it can wait until this afternoon no ones going to hate you for not returning a few calls cmon lets drive up to the gower and get some fresh air ive already reserved a car go with him rachel said itll do you good mick acquiesced his guilt and relief in conflict at being able to put aside thoughts of the funeral plans he was glad bill had come down but he couldnt quite judge how his brotheror his friends for that matterviewed his bereavement hed lost his wife they all knew that but they also knew that mick and andrea had been separated theyd been having problems for most of the year it would only be human for his friends to assume that mick wasnt quite as affected by andreas death as he would have been had they still been living together listen he told bill when they were safely under way theres something ive got to tell you im listening andrea and i had problems but it wasnt the end of our marriage we were going to get through this i was going to call her this weekend see if we couldnt meet bill looked at him sadly mick couldnt tell if that meant that bill just didnt believe him or that his brother pitied him for the opportunity hed allowed to slip between his fingers when they got back to cardiff in the early evening after a warm and blustery day out on the gower joe practically pounced on mick as soon as they came through the door i need to talk to you joe said now i need to call some of andreas friends mick said can it wait until later no it cant its about you and andrea they went into the kitchen joe poured him a glass of whisky rachel and bill watched from the end of the table saying nothing ive been to the lab joe said i know its saturday but i wanted to make sure that lock was still holding well it is we could start the experiment tomorrow if we wanted to but somethings come up and you need to know about it mick sipped from his glass go on ive been in contact with my counterpart in the other lab the other joe the other joe yes we were finessing the equipment making sure everything was optimal and we talked of course needless to say i mentioned what had happened and the other me was surprised shocked even he said andrea hadnt died in his reality joe held up a hand signaling that mick should let him finish before speaking you know how it works the two histories are identical before the lock takes effect so identical that there isnt even any point in thinking of them as being distinct realities the divergence only happens once the lock is in effect the lock was active by the time you came down to tell me about the squash match the other me also had a visit from you the difference was that no policewoman ever came to his lab you eventually drifted back to your office to carry on grading tutorials but andrea was already dead by then not in that reality the other me phoned you you were staying at the holiday inn you knew nothing of andrea having had any accident so my other wife joe allowed himself a quick smile the other version of rachel called andrea and they spoke turned out andrea had been hit by a car but shed barely been bruised they hadnt even called an ambulance mick absorbed what his friend had to say then said i cant deal with this joe i dont need to know it it isnt going to help i think it is we were set up to run the nervelink experiment as soon as we had a solid lock one that we could trust to hold for the full million seconds this is it the only difference is it doesnt have to be me who goes through i dont understand i can put you through mick we can get you nervelinked tomorrow morning allowing for a day of bedding in and practice once you arrive in the other realitywell you could be walking in andreas world by monday afternoon tuesday morning at the latest but youre the one who is supposed to be going through mick said youve already had the nervelink put in weve got a spare joe said micks mind raced through the implications then id be controlling the body of the other you right no that wont work unfortunately weve had to make some changes to these nervelinks to get them to work properly through the correlator with the limited signal throughput we had to ditch some of the channels that handle proprioceptive mapping theyll only work properly if the body on the other end of the link is virtually identical to the one on this side then it wont work youre nothing like me youre forgetting your counterpart on the other side joe said he glanced past mick at bill and rachel raising his eyebrows as he did so the way it would work is you come into the lab and we install the link in you just the same way it happened for me yesterday morning at the same time your counterpart in andreas world comes into his version of the lab and gets the other version of the nervelink put into him mick shivered hed become used to thinking about the other version of joe he could even begin to accept that there was a version of andrea walking around somewhere who was still alive but as soon as joe brought the other mick into the argument he felt his head begin to unravel wouldnt hethe other meneed to agree to this he already has joe said solemnly ive been in touch with him the other joe called him into the lab we had a chat over the videolink he didnt go for it at firstyou know how you both feel about nervelinking and he hasnt lost his version of andrea but i explained how big a deal this was this is your only chance to see andrea again once this window closeswere talking about no more than eleven or twelve days from the start of the lock by the waywell never make contact with another reality where shes alive mick blinked and placed his hands on the table he felt dizzy with the implications as if the kitchen was swaying youre certain of that youll never open another window into andreas world statistically we were incredibly lucky to get this one chance by the time the window closes andreas reality will have diverged so far from ours that theres essentially no chance of ever getting another lock okay mick said ready to take joes word for it but even if i agree to thiseven if the other me agrees to itwhat about andrea we werent seeing each other but you wanted to see her again bill said quietly mick rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands and exhaled loudly maybe ive spoken to andrea rachel said i mean joe spoke to himself and the other version of him spoke to the other rachel shes been in touch with andrea mick hardly dared speak and she says its okay she understands how horrible this must be for you she says if you want to come through shell meet you you can spend some time together give you a chance to come to some kind of closure mick whispered itll help you joe said its got to help you sunday the medical center was normally closed on weekends but joe had pulled strings to get some of the staff to come in on sunday morning mick had to sit around a long time while they ran physiological tests and prepared the surgical equipment it was much easier and quicker for tourists for they didnt have to use the modified nervelink units joes team had developed by the early afternoon they were satisfied that mick was ready for the implantation they made him lie down on a couch with his head encased in a padded plastic assembly with a hole under the back of the neck he was given a mild local anesthetic rubberized clamps whirred in to hold his head in position with micromillimeter accuracy then he felt a vague impression of pressure being applied to the skin on the back of his neck and then an odd and not entirely pleasant sensation of sudden pins and needles in every part of his body but the unpleasantness was over almost as soon as hed registered it the support clamps whirred away from his head the couch tilted up and he was able to get off and stand on his feet mick touched the back of his neck came away with a tiny smear of blood on his thumb thats it i told you there was nothing to it joe said putting down a motorcycling magazine i dont know what you were so worried about its not the nervelink operation itself i dont approve of i dont have a problem with the technology its the whole system the way it encourages the exploitation of the poor joe tuttutted bloody guardian readers it was you lot who got the bloody moratorium against air travel enacted in the first place next youll be telling us we cant even walk anywhere the nurse swabbed micks wound and applied a bandage he was shunted into an adjoining room and asked to wait again more tests followed as the system interrogated the newly embedded nervelink he experienced mild electrical tingles and strange fleeting feelings of dislocation nothing he reported gave the staff any cause for alarm after micks discharge from the medical center joe took him straight down to the laboratory an electromagnetically shielded annex contained the couch joe intended to use for the experiment it was a modified version of the kind tourists used for longterm nervelinking with facilities for administering nutrition and collecting bodily waste no one liked to dwell too much on those details but there was no way around it if you wanted to stay nervelinked for more than a few hours gamers had been putting up with similar indignities for decades once mick was plumbed in joe settled a pair of specially designed immersion glasses over his eyes after first applying a salve to micks skin to protect against pressure sores the glasses fit very tightly blocking out micks view of the lab all he could see was a bluegray void with a few meaningless red digits to the right side of his visual field comfortable joe asked i cant see anything yet you will joe went back into the main part of the basement to check on the correlation it seemed that he was gone a long time when he heard joe return mick halfexpected bad newsthat the link had collapsed or some necessary piece of technology had broken down privately he would not have been too sorry were that the case in his shocked state of mind in the hours after andreas death he would have given anything to be able to see her again but now that the possibility had arisen he found himself prone to doubts given time he knew hed get over andreas death that wasnt being cold it was just being realistic he knew more than a few people whod lost their partners and while they might have gone through some dark times afterward almost all of them now seemed settled and relatively content it didnt mean theyd stopped feeling anything for the loved one who had died but it did mean theyd found some way to move on there was no reason to assume he wouldnt make the same emotional recovery the question was would visiting andrea hasten or hamper that process perhaps they should just have talked over the videolink or even the phone but then hed never been very good on either he knew it had to be face to face all or nothing is there a problem he asked joe innocently enough nope everythings fine i was just waiting to hear that the other version of you is ready he is good to go someone from the medical center just put him under we can make the switch any time youre ready where is he here joe said i mean in the counterpart to this room hes lying on the same couch its easier that way theres less of a jolt when you switch over hes unconscious already full coma just like any nervelinked mule except mick thought unlike the mules his counterpart hadnt signed up to go into a chemically induced coma while his body was taken over by a distant tourist that was what mick disapproved of more than anything the mules did it for money and the mules were always the poorest people in any given tourist hotspot whether it was some affluent european city or some nauseatingly authentic third world shithole no one ever aspired to become a mule it was what you did when all other options had dried up in some cases it hadnt just supplanted prostitution it had become an entirely new form of prostitution in its own right but enough of that they were all consenting adults here no oneleast of all the other version of himselfwas being exploited the other mick was just being kind no kinder mick supposed than he would have been had the tables been reversed but he couldnt help feeling a perverse sense of gratitude and as for andreawell shed always been kind no one ever had a bad word to say for andrea on that score kind and considerate to a fault so what was he waiting for you can make the switch mick said there was less to it than hed been expecting it was no worse than the involuntary muscular jolt he sometimes experienced in bed just before dozing off to sleep but suddenly he was in a different body hi joe said howre you feeling matey except it was the other joe speaking to him now the joe who belonged to the world where andrea hadnt died the original joe was on the other side of the reality gap i feel but when mick tried speaking it came out hopelessly slurred give it time joe said everyone has trouble speaking to start with thatll come quickly cant shee cant see thats because we havent switched on your glasses hold on a tick the graygreen void vanished to be replaced by a view of the interior of the lab the quality of the image was excellent the room looked superficially the same but as mick looked aroundsending the muscle signals through the nervelink to move the body of the other mickhe noticed the small details that told him this wasnt his world joe was wearing a different checked shirt smudged white trainers instead of converse sneakers in this version of the lab joe had forgotten to turn the calendar over to the new month mick tried speaking again the words came easier this time im really here arent i how does it feel to be making history it feelsbloody weird actually and no im not making history when you write up your experiment it wont be me who went through first itll be you the way it was always meant to be this is just a dry run you can mention me in a footnote if that joe looked unconvinced have it your way but i will mick moved to get off the couch this version of his body wasnt plumbed in like the other one but when he tried to move nothing happened for a moment he felt a crushing sense of paralysis he must have let out a frightened sound easy joe said putting a hand on his shoulder one step at a time the link still has to bed in its going to be hours before youll have complete fluidity of movement so dont run before you can walk and im afraid were going to have to keep you in the lab for rather longer than you might like as routine as nervelinking is this isnt simple nervelinking the shortcuts weve had to use to squeeze the data through the correlator link mean were exposing ourselves to more medical risks than youd get with the standard tourist kit nothing that you need worry about but i want to make sure we keep a close eye on all the parameters ill be running tests in the morning and evening sorry to be a drag about it but we do need numbers for our paper as well all i can promise is that youll still have a lot of time available to meet andrea if thats what you still want to do of course it is mick said now that im hereno going back right joe glanced at his watch lets start running some coordination exercises thatll keep us busy for an hour or two then well need to make sure you have full bladder control could get messy otherwise after thatwell see if you can feed yourself i want to see andrea not today joe said firmly not until weve got you housetrained tomorrow definitely tomorrow monday he paused in the shade of the old green boating shed at the edge of the lake it was a hot day approaching noon and the park was already busier than it had been at any time since the last gasp of the previous summer office workers were sitting around the lake making the most of their lunch break the men with their ties loosened and sleeves and trousers rolled up the women with their shoes off and blouses loosened children splashed in the ornamental fountains while their older siblings bounced meters into the air on servoassisted pogo sticks the seasons latest lethallooking craze students lolled around on the gently sloping grass sunbathing or catching up on neglected coursework in the last week before exams mick recognized some of them from his own department most wore cheap immersion glasses with their arms covered almost to the shoulder in tightfitting pink haptic feedback gloves the more animated students lay on their backs pointing and clutching at invisible objects suspended above them it looked like they were trying to snatch down the last few wisps of cloud from the scratchless blue sky above cardiff mick had already seen andrea standing a little further around the curve of the lake it was where they had agreed to meet and true to form andrea was exactly on time she stared pensively out across the water seemingly oblivious to the commotion going on around her she wore a white blouse a kneelength burgundy skirt sensible office shoes her hair was shorter than he remembered styled differently and barely reaching her collar for a momentuntil shed turned slightlyhe hadnt recognized her at all andrea held a starbucks coffee holder in one hand and every now and then shed take a sip or glance at her wristwatch mick was five minutes late now and he knew there was a risk andrea would give up waiting but in the shade of the boating shed all his certainties had evaporated andrea turned minutely she glanced at her watch again she sipped from the coffee holder tilting it back in a way that told mick shed finished the last drop he saw her looking around for a waste bin mick stepped from the shade he walked across the grass onto concrete acutely conscious of the slow awkwardness of his gait his walking had improved since his first efforts but it still felt as if he were trying to walk upright in a swimming pool filled with treacle joe had assured him that all his movements would become more normal as the nervelink bedded in but that process was obviously taking longer than anticipated andrea he said sounding slurred and drunk and too loud even to his own ears she turned and met his eyes there was a slight pause before she smiled and when she did the smile wasnt quite right as if shed been asked to hold it too long for a photograph hello mick i was beginning to think its okay he forced out each word with care making sure it came out right before moving to the next i just had some second thoughts i dont blame you how does it feel a bit odd itll get easier yes thats what they told me she took another sip from the coffee even though it must have been empty they were standing about two meters apart close enough to talk close enough to look like two friends or colleagues whod bumped into each other around the lake its really good of you mick began andrea shook her head urgently please its okay we talked it over we both agreed it was the right thing to do if the tables were turned you wouldnt have hesitated maybe not i know you mick maybe better than you know yourself youd have done all that you could and more i just want you to knowim not taking any of this lightly not you having to see me like thisnot what he has to go through while im around he said to tell you there are worse ways to spend a week mick tried to smile he felt the muscles of his face move but without a mirror there was no way to judge the outcome the moment stretched a football splashed into the lake and began to drift away from the edge he heard a little boy start crying your hair looks different mick said you dont like it no i do it really suits you did you have that done afteroh wait i see you were on your way to the salon he could see the scratch on her face where shed grazed it on the curb when the car knocked her down she hadnt even needed stitches in a week it would hardly show at all i cant begin to imagine what its been like for you andrea said i cant imagine what this is like for you it helps you dont sound convinced i want it to help i think its going to its just that right now it feels like ive made the worst mistake of my life andrea held up the coffee holder do you fancy one its my treat andrea was a solicitor she worked for a small legal firm located in modern offices near the park there was a starbucks near her office building they dont know me there do they not unless youve been moonlighting come on i hate to say it but you could use some practice walking as long as you wont laugh i wouldnt dream of it hold my hand mick itll make it easier before he could step back andrea closed the distance between them and took his hand in hers it was good of her to do that mick thought hed been wondering how he would initiate that first touch and andrea had spared him the fumbling awkwardness that would almost certainly have ensued that was andrea to a tee always thinking of others and trying to make life a little easier for them no matter how small the difference it was why people liked her so much why her friends were so fiercely loyal its going to be okay mick andrea said gently everything thats happened between usit doesnt matter now ive said bad things to you and youve said bad things to me but lets forget about all that lets just make the most of what time we have im scared of losing you youre a good man youve more friends than you realize he was sweating in the heat so much so that the glasses began to slip down his nose the view tilted toward his shoes he raised his free hand in a stiff salutelike gesture and pushed the glasses back into place andreas hand tightened on his i cant go through with this mick said i should go back you started it andrea said sternly but without rancor now you finish it all the way mick leighton tuesday things were much better by the morning of the second day when he woke in joe liversedges lab there was a fluency in his movements that simply hadnt been there the evening before when hed said goodbye to andrea he now felt as if he was inhabiting the host body rather than simply shuffling it around like a puppet he still needed the glasses to be able to see anything but the nervelink was conveying sensation much more effectively now so that when he touched something it came through without any of the fuzziness or lag hed been experiencing the day before most tourists were able to achieve reasonable accuracy of touch differentiation within twentyfour hours within two days their degree of proprioceptive immersion was generally good enough to allow complex motor tasks such as cycling swimming or skiing repeatvisit tourists especially those that went back into the same body got over the transition period even faster to them it was like moving back into a house after a short absence joes team gave mick a thorough checkup in the annex it was all routine stuff amy flint joes senior graduate student insisted on adding some more numbers to the tactile test database that she was building for the study that meant mick sitting at a table without the glasses being asked to hold various objects and decide what shape they were and what they were made of he scored excellently only failing to distinguish between wood and plastic balls of similar weight and texture flint was cheerfully casual around him without any of the affectedness or oversensitivity mick had quickly detected in his friends or colleagues clearly she didnt know what had happened she just thought joe had opted to go for a different test subject than himself joe was upbeat about micks progress everything from the host body to the hardware was holding up well the bandwidth was stable at nearly two megabytes per second more than enough spare capacity to permit mick the use of a second video feed to peer back into the version of the lab on the other side the other version of joe held the cam up so that mick could see his own body reclining on the heavyduty immersion couch mick had expected to be disturbed by that but the whole experience turned out to be oddly banal like replaying a home movie when they were done with the tests joe walked mick over to the university canteen where he ate a liquid breakfast slurping down three containers of fruit yoghurt while he atewhich was tricky but another of the things that was supposed to get easier with practicehe gazed distractedly at the television in the canteen the wallsized screen was running through the morning news with the sound turned down at the moment the screen was showing grainy footage of the polish miners caught on surveillance camera as they trudged into the low concrete pithead building on their way to work the cavein had happened three days ago the miners were still trapped underground in all the worldlines that were in contact with this one including micks own poor fuckers joe said looking up from a draft paper he was penciling remarks over maybe theyll get them out aye maybe wouldnt fancy my chances down there though the picture changed to a summary of football scores again most of the games had ended in identical results across the contacted worldlines but two or threehighlighted in sidebars with analysis text ticking below themhad ended differently with one team even being dropped from the rankings afterward mick walked on his own to the tram stop and caught the next service into the city center already he could feel that he was attracting less attention than the day before he still moved a little stiffly he could tell that just by looking at his reflection in the glass as he boarded the tram but there was no longer anything comical or robotic about it he just looked like someone with a touch of arthritis or someone whod been overdoing it in the gym and was now paying with a dose of sore muscles as the tram whisked its way through traffic he thought back to the evening before the meeting with andrea and the subsequent day had gone as well as he could have expected things had been strained at first but by the time theyd been to starbucks he had detected an easing in her manner and that had made him feel more at ease as well theyd made small talk skirting around the main thing neither of them wanted to discuss andrea had taken most of the day off she didnt have to be at the law offices until late afternoon just to check that no problems had arisen in her absence theyd talked about what to do with the rest of their day together maybe we could drive up into the beacons mick had said itll be nice up in the hills with a bit of a breeze we always used to enjoy those days out been a while though andrea had said im not sure my legs are up to it anymore you always used to hustle up those hills emphasis on the used to unfortunately now i get out of breath just walking up st marys street with a bag full of shopping mick looked at her skeptically but he couldnt deny that andrea had a point neither of them was the keen outdoors type they had been when they met fifteen years earlier through the universitys hillwalking club back then theyd spent long weekends exploring the hills of the brecon beacons and the black mountains or driving to snowdonia or the lake district theyd had some hairraising moments together when the weather turned against them or when they suddenly realized they were on completely the wrong ridge but what mick remembered more than anything was not being cold and wet but the feeling of relief when they arrived at some cozy warm pub at the end of the day both of them ravenous and thirsty and high on what theyd achieved good memories all of them why hadnt they kept it up instead of letting their jobs rule their weekends look maybe we might drive up to the beacons in a day or two andrea said but i think its a bit ambitious for today dont you youre probably right mick said after some debate theyd agreed to visit the castle and then take a boat ride around the bay to see the huge and impressive sea defenses up close both were things theyd always meant to do together but had kept putting off for another weekend the castle was heaving with tourists even on this midweek day because a lot of them were nervelinked though they afforded mick a welcome measure of inconspicuousness no one gave him a second glance as he bumbled along with the other shadewearing bodysnatchers even though he must have looked considerably more affluent and wellfed than the average mule afterward they went to look at the roman ruins where rachel liversedge was busy talking to a group of bored primary school children from the valleys mick enjoyed the boat ride more than the trip to the castle there were still enough nervelinked tourists on the boat for him not to feel completely out of place and being out in the bay offered some respite from the cloying heat of the city center mick had even felt the breeze on the back of his hand evidence that the nervelink was really bedding in it was andrea who nudged the conversation toward the reason for micks presence shed just returned from the counter with two paper cups brimming with murky coffee nearly spilling them as the boat swayed unexpectedly she sat down on the boats hard wooden bench i forgot to ask how it went in the lab this morning she asked brightly everything working out okay very well mick said joe says we were getting two megs this morning thats as good as he was hoping for youll have to explain that to me i know its to do with the amount of data youre able to send through the link but i dont know how it compares with what wed be using for a typical tourist setup mick remembered what joe had told him its not as good tourists can use as much bandwidth as they can afford but joes correlators never get above five megabytes per second thats at the start of the twelveday window too it only gets worse by day five or six is two enough its what joes got to work with mick reached up and tapped the glasses it shouldnt be enough for full color vision at normal resolution according to joe but theres an awful lot of clever software in the lab to take care of that its constantly guessing filling in gaps how does it look like im looking at the world through a pair of sunglasses he pulled them off his nose and tilted them toward andrea except its the glasses that are actually doing the seeing not myhiseyes most of the time its good enough that i dont notice anything weird if i wiggle my head around fastor if something streaks past too quicklythen the glasses have trouble keeping up with the changing view he jammed the glasses back on just in time for a seagull to flash past only a few meters from the boat he had a momentary sense of the seagull breaking up into blocky areas of confused pixels as if it had been painted by a cubist before the glasses smoothed things over and normality ensued what about all the rest of it hearing touch they dont take up anything like as much bandwidth as vision the way joe puts it postural information only needs a few basic parameters the angles of my limb joints that kind of thing hearings pretty straight forward and touch is the easiest of all as it happens really so joe says hold my hand andrea hesitated an instant then took micks hand now squeeze it mick said she tightened her hold are you getting that perfectly its much easier than sending sound if you were to say something to me the acoustic signal would have to be sampled digitized compressed and pushed across the link hundreds of bytes per second but all touch needs is a single parameter the system will still be able to keep sending touch even when everything else gets too difficult then its the last thing to go its the most fundamental sense we have thats the way it ought to be after a few moments andrea said how long four days mick said slowly maybe five if were lucky joe says well have a better handle on the decay curve by tomorrow im worried mick i dont know how im going to deal with losing you he closed his other hand on hers and squeezed in return youll get me back i know its justit wont be you itll be the other you theyre both me thats not how it feels right now it feels like im having an affair while my husbands away it shouldnt i am your husband were both your husband they said nothing after that sitting in silence as the boat bobbed its way back to shore it was not that they had said anything upsetting just that words were no longer adequate andrea kept holding his hand mick wanted this morning to continue forever the boat the breeze the perfect sky over the bay even then he chided himself for dwelling on the passage of time rather than making the most of the experience as it happened to him that had always been his problem ever since he was a kid school holidays had always been steeped in a melancholic sense of how few days were left but this wasnt a holiday after a while he noticed that some people had gathered at the bow of the boat pressing against the railings they were pointing up into the sky some of them had pulled out phones theres something going on mick said i can see it andrea answered she touched the side of his face steering his view until he was craning up as far as his neck would allow its an aeroplane mick waited until the glasses picked out the tiny moving speck of the plane etching a pale contrail in its wake he felt a twinge of resentment toward anyone still having the freedom to fly when the rest of humanity was denied that right it had been a nice dream when it lasted flying he had no idea what political or military purpose the plane was serving but it would be an easy matter to find out were he that interested the news would be in all the papers by the afternoon the plane wouldnt just be overflying this version of cardiff but his as well that had been one of the hardest things to take since andreas death the world at large steamrolled on its course undeflected by that single human tragedy andrea had died in the accident in his world shed survived unscathed in this one and that planes course wouldnt have changed in any measurable way in either reality i love seeing aeroplanes andrea said it reminds me of what things were like before the moratorium dont you actually mick said they make me a bit sad wednesday mick knew how busy andrea had been lately and he tried to persuade her against taking any time off from her work andrea had protested saying her colleagues could handle her workload for a few days mick knew better than thatandrea practically ran the firm singlehandedlybut in the end theyd come to a compromise andrea would take time off from the office but shed pop in first thing in the morning to put out any really serious fires mick agreed to meet her at the offices at ten after his round of tests everything still felt the way it had the day before if anything he was even more fluent in his body movements but when joe had finished the news was all that mick had been quietly dreading while knowing it could be no other way the quality of the link had continued to degrade according to joe they were down to one point eight megs now theyd seen enough decay curves to be able to extrapolate forward into the beginning of the following week the link would become noiseswamped around teatime on sunday give or take three hours either way if only theyd started sooner mick thought but joe had done all that he could todaydespite the foreboding message from the labhis sense of immersion in the counterpart world had become total as the sunlit city swept by outside the trams windows mick found it nearly impossible to believe that he was not physically present in this body rather than lying on the couch in the other version of the lab overnight his tactile immersion had improved markedly when he braced himself against the trams upright handrail as it swept around a curve he felt cold aluminum the faint greasiness where it had been touched by other hands at the offices andreas colleagues greeted him with an unforced casualness that left him dismayed hed been expecting awkward expressions of sympathy sly glances when they thought he wasnt looking instead he was plonked down in the waiting area and left to flick through glossy brochures while he waited for andrea to emerge from her office no one even offered him a drink he leafed through the brochures dispiritedly andreas job had always been a sore point in their relationship if mick didnt approve of nervelinking he had even less time for the legal vultures that made so much money out of personal injury claims related to the technology but now he found it difficult to summon his usual sense of moral superiority unpleasant things had happened to decent people because of negligence and cornercutting if nervelinking was to be a part of the world then someone had to make sure the victims got their due he wondered why this had never been clear to him before hiya andrea said leaning over him she gave him a businesslike kiss not quite meeting his mouth took a bit longer than i thought sorry can we go now mick asked putting down the brochure yep im done here outside when they were walking along the pavement in the shade of the tall commercial buildings mick said they didnt have a clue did they no one in that office knows whats happened to us i thought it was best andrea said i dont know how you can keep up that act that nothings wrong mick nothing is wrong you have to see it from my point of view i havent lost my husband nothings changed for me when youre gonewhen all this ends and i get the other you backmy life carries on as normal i know whats happened to you is a tragedy and believe me im as upset about it as anyone upset mick said quietly yes upset but id be lying if i said i was paralyzed with grief im human mick im not capable of feeling great emotional turmoil at the thought that some distant counterpart of myself got herself run over all because she was rushing to have her hair done silly cow thats what it makes me feel at most it makes me feel a bit odd a bit shivery but i dont think its something im going to have trouble getting over i lost my wife mick said i know and im sorry more than youll ever know but if you expect my life to come crashing to a halt he cut her off im already fading one point eight this morning you always knew it would happen its not like its any surprise youll notice a difference in me by the end of the day this isnt the end of the day so stop dwelling on it all right please mick youre in serious danger of ruining this for yourself i know and im trying not to he said but what i was saying about how things arent going to get any betteri think todays going to be my last chance andrea my last chance to be with you to be with you properly you mean us sleeping together andrea said keeping her voice low we havent talked about it yet thats okay i wasnt expecting it to happen without at least some discussion but theres no reason why mick i andrea began youre still my wife im still in love with you i know weve had our problems but i realize now how stupid all that was i should have called you sooner i was being an idiot and then this happenedand it made me realize what a wonderful lovely person you are and i should have seen that for myself but i didnti needed the accident to shake me up to make me see how lucky i was just to know you and now im going to lose you again and im not sure how im going to cope with that but at least if we can be together againproperly i mean mick youve already said you might get back together with the other mick maybe it took all this to get us talking again point is if youre going to get back together with him theres nothing to stop us getting back together now we were a couple before the accident we can still be a couple now mick it isnt the same youve lost your wife im not her im some weird thing there isnt a word for and you arent really my husband my husband is in a medically induced coma you know none of that really matters to you it shouldnt matter to you either and your husbandme incidentallyagreed to this he knew exactly what was supposed to happen and so did you i just thought things would be bettermore civilizedif we kept a kind of distance youre talking as if were divorced mick we were already separated we werent talking i cant just forget what happened before the accident as if none of that mattered i know it isnt easy for you they walked on in an uneasy silence through the city center streets theyd walked a thousand times before mick asked andrea if she wanted a coffee but she said shed had one in her office not long before he arrived maybe later they paused to cross the road near one of andreas favorite boutiques and mick asked if there was something he could buy for her andrea sounded taken aback at the suggestion you dont need to buy me anything mick it isnt my birthday or anything it would be nice to give you a gift something to remember me by i dont need anything to remember you mick youre always going to be there it doesnt have to be much just something youll use now and then and will make you think of me this me not the one whos going to be walking around in this body in a few days well if you really insist he could tell andrea was trying to sound keen on the idea but her heart still wasnt quite in it there was a handbag i saw last week you should have bought it when you saw it i was saving up for the hairdresser so mick bought her the handbag he made a mental note of the style and color intending to buy an identical copy next week since he hadnt bought the gift for his wife in his own worldline it was even possible that he might walk out of the shop with the exact counterpart of the handbag hed just given andrea they went to the park again then to look at the art in the national museum of wales then back into town for lunch there were a few more clouds in the sky compared to the last two days but their chrome whiteness only served to make the blue appear more deeply enameled and permanent there were no planes anywhere at all no contrail scratches it turned out the aircraftwhich had indeed been militarythat they had seen yesterday had been on its way to poland carrying a team of mine rescue specialists mick remembered his resentment at seeing the plane and felt bad about it now there had been brave men and women aboard it and they were probably going to be putting their own lives at risk to help save other brave men and women stuck miles underground well andrea said when theyd paid the bill moment of truth i suppose ive been thinking about what you were saying earlier and maybe she trailed off looking down at the remains of her salad before continuing we can go home if youd like if thats what you really want yes mick said its what i want they took the tram back to their house andrea used her key to let them inside it was still only the early afternoon and the house was pleasantly cool with the curtains and blinds still drawn mick knelt down and picked up the letters that were on the mat bills mostly he set them on the hallside table feeling a transitory sense of liberation more than likely hed be confronted with the same bills when he got home but for now these were someone elses problem he slipped off his shoes and walked into the living room for a moment he was thrown feeling as if he really was in a different house the wallscreen was on another wall the dining table had been shifted sideways into the other half of the room the sofa and easy chairs had all been altered and moved whats happened oh i forgot to tell you andrea said i felt like a change you came around and helped me move them thats new furniture no just different seat covers theyre not new its just that we havent had them out for a while you remember them now dont you i suppose so cmon mick it wasnt that long ago we got them off aunty janice remember she looked at him despairingly ill move things back it was a bit inconsiderate of me i suppose i never thought how strange it would be for you to see the place like this no its okay honestly its fine mick looked around trying to fix the arrangement of furniture and d√©cor in his minds eye as if he were going to duplicate everything when he got back into his own body into his own version of this house maybe he would too ive got something for you andrea said suddenly reaching onto the top of the bookcase found it this morning took ages searching for it what mick asked she held the thing out to him mick saw a rectangle of laminated pink card stained and dogeared it was only when he tried to hold it and the thing fell open and disgorged its folded paper innards that he realized it was a map bloody hell i wouldnt have had a clue where to look mick folded the map back into itself and studied the cover it was one of their old hillwalking maps covering that part of the brecon beacons where theyd done a lot of their walks i was just thinking seeing as you were so keen maybe it wouldnt kill us to get out of town nothing too adventurous mind tomorrow she looked at him concernedly thats what i was thinking youll still be okay wont you no probs ill get us a picnic then tescos does a nice luncheon basket i think weve still got two thermos flasks around here somewhere too never mind the thermos flasks what about the walking boots in the garage andrea said along with the rucksacks ill dig them out this evening im looking forward to it mick said really its kind of you to agree just as long you dont expect me to get up pen y fan without getting out of breath i bet youll surprise yourself a little later they went upstairs to their bedroom the blinds were open enough to throw pale stripes across the walls and bedsheets andrea undressed and then helped mick out his own clothes as good as his control over the body had now become fine motor taskslike undoing buttons and zipswould require a lot more practice than he was going to have time for youll have to help me get all this on afterward he said there you go worrying about the future again they lay together on the bed mick had already felt himself growing hard long before there was any corresponding change in the body he was now inhabiting he had an erection in the laboratory halfway across the city in another worldline he could even feel the sharp plastic of the urinary catheter would the other mick sunk deep into coma retain some vague impression of what was happening now there were occasional stories of people coming out of their coma with a memory of what their bodies had been up to while they were under but the agencies had said these were urban myths they made slow cautious love mick had become more aware of his own awkwardness and the selfconsciousness only served to exaggerate the stiffness of his movements andrea did what she could to help to bridge the gap between them but she could not work miracles she was patient and forgiving even when he came close to hurting her when he climaxed mick felt it happen to the body in the laboratory first then the body he was inhabiting responded too seconds later something of it reached him through the nervelinknot pleasure exactly but confirmation that pleasure had occurred afterward they lay still on the bed limbs entwined a breeze made the blinds move back and forth against the window the slow movement of light and shade the soft tick of vinyl on glass was as lulling as a becalmed boat mick found himself falling into a contented sleep he dreamed of standing on a summit in the brecon beacons looking down on the sunlit valleys of south wales with andrea next to him the two of them poised like a tableau in a travel brochure when he woke hours later he heard her moving around downstairs he reached for the glasseshed removed them earlierand made to leave the bed he felt it then somewhere in those languid hours hed lost a degree of control over the body he stood and moved to the door he could still walk but the easy facility hed gained on tuesday was now absent when he moved to the landing and looked down the stairs the glasses struggled to cope with the sudden change of scene the view fractured reassembled he moved to steady himself on the banister and his hand blurred into a long smear of flesh he began to descend the stairs like a man coming down a mountain thursday in the morning he was worse he stayed overnight at the house then caught the tram to the laboratory already he could feel a measurable lag between the sending of his intentions to move and the corresponding action in the body walking was still just about manageable but all other tasks had become more difficult hed made a mess trying to eat breakfast in andreas kitchen it was no surprise when joe told him that the link was now down to one point two megs and falling by the end of the day mick asked even though he could see the printout for himself point nine maybe point eight hed dared to think it might still be possible to do what they had planned but the day soon became a catalogue of declining functions at noon he met andrea at her office and they went to a car rental office where theyd booked a vehicle for the day andrea drove them out of cardiff up the valleys along the a from merthyr to brecon they had planned to walk all the way to the summit of pen y fan an ascent theyd done together dozens of times during their hillwalking days andrea had already collected the picnic basket from tescos and packed and prepared the two rucksacks shed helped mick get into his walking boots they left the car at the storey arms then followed the welltrodden trail that wound its way toward the mountain mick felt a little ashamed at first back in their hillwalking days theyd tended to look down with disdain on the hordes of people making the trudge up pen y fan especially those that took the route up from the pub the view from the top was worth the climb but theyd usually made a point of completing at least one or two other ascents on the same day and theyd always eschewed the easy paths now mick was paying for that earlier superiority what started out as pleasantly challenging soon became impossibly taxing although he didnt think andrea had begun to notice he was finding it much harder than hed expected to walk on the rough craggy surface of the path the effort was draining him preventing him from enjoying any of the scenery or the sheer bliss of being with andrea when he lost his footing the first time andrea didnt make much of itshed nearly tripped once already on the dried and cracked path but soon he was finding it hard to walk more than a hundred meters without losing his balance he knew with a heavy heart that it would be difficult enough just to get back to the car the mountain was still two miles away and he wouldnt have a hope as soon as they hit a real slope are you okay mick im fine dont worry about me its these bloody shoes i cant believe they ever fit me he soldiered on for as long as he could refusing to give in but the going got harder and his pace slower when he tripped again and this time grazed his shin through his trousers he knew hed pushed himself as far as he could go time was getting on the mountain might as well have been in the himalayas for all his chances of climbing it im sorry im useless go on without me its too nice a day not to finish it hey andrea took his hand dont be like that it was always going to be hard look how far weve come anyway mick turned and looked dispiritedly down the valley about three kilometers i can still see the pub well it felt longer and besides this is actually a very nice spot to have the picnic andrea made a show of rubbing her thigh im about ready to stop anyway pulled a muscle going over that sty youre just saying that shut up mick im happy okay if you want to turn this into some miserable painfilled trek go ahead me im staying here she spread the blanket next to a dry brook and unpacked the food the contents of the picnic basket looked very good indeed the taste came through the nervelink as a kind of thin diluted impression more like the memory of taste rather than the thing itself but he managed to eat without making too much of a mess and some of it actually bordered on the enjoyable they ate listening to the birds saying little now and then other walkers trudged past barely giving mick and andrea a glance as they continued toward the hills i guess i shouldnt have kidded myself i was ever going to get up that mountain mick said it was a bit ambitious andrea agreed it would have been hard enough without the nervelink given how flabby the two of us have become i think id have made a better job of it yesterday even this morningi honestly felt i could do this when we got into the car andrea touched his thigh how does it feel like im moving away yesterday i felt like i was in this body fully a part of it like a face filling a mask today its different i can still see through the mask but its getting further away andrea seemed distant for several moments he wondered if what hed said had upset her but when she spoke again there was something in her voicea kind of steely resolutionthat he hadnt been expecting but which was entirely andrea listen to me mick im listening im going to tell you something its the first of may today just past two in the afternoon we left cardiff at eleven this time next year this exact day im coming back here im going to pack a picnic basket and go all the way up to the top of pen y fan ill set off from cardiff at the same time and im going to do it the year after as well every first of may no matter what day of the week it is no matter how bloody horrible the weather is im going up this mountain and nothing on earth is going to stop me it took him a few seconds to realize what she was getting at with the other mick no im not saying we wont ever climb that hill together but when i go up it on the first of may ill be on my own she looked levelly at mick and youll do it alone as well youll find someone new im sure of it but whoever she is will have to give you that one day to yourself so that you and i can have it to ourselves we wont be able to communicate we wont even know the other ones stuck to the plan yes andrea said firmly we will because its going to be a promise all right the most important one either of us has ever made in our whole lives that way well know each of us will be in our own universe or worldline or whatever you call it but well both be standing on the same welsh mountain well both be looking at the same view and ill be thinking of you and youll be thinking of me mick ran a stiff hand through andreas hair he couldnt get his fingers to work very well now you really mean that dont you of course i mean it but im not promising anything unless you agree to your half of it would you promise mick yes he said i will i wish i could think of something better i could say wed always meet in the park but therell be people around it wont feel private i want the silence the isolation so i can feel your presence and one day they might tear down the park and put a shopping center there instead but the mountain will always be there at least as long as were around and when we get old shouldnt we agree to stop climbing the mountain when we get to a certain age there you go again andrea said decide for yourself im going to keep climbing this thing until they put me in a box i expect nothing less from you mick leighton he made the best smile he was capable of thenill just have to do my best wont i friday in the morning mick was paraplegic the nervelink still worked perfectly but the rate of data transmission from one worldline to the other had become too low to permit anything as complex and feedbackdependent as walking his control over the bodys fingers had become so clumsy that his hands might as well have been wearing boxing gloves he could hold something if it was presented to him but it was becoming increasingly difficult to manipulate simple objects even those that had presented no difficulty twentyfour hours earlier when he tried to grasp the breakfast yoghurt he succeeded only in tipping it over the table his hand had seemed to lurch toward the yoghurt crossing the distance too quickly according to joe he had lost depth perception overnight the glasses sensing the dwindling data rate were no longer sending stereoscopic images back to the lab he could still move around the team had anticipated this stage and made sure an electric wheelchair was ready for him its chunky controls were designed to be used by someone with only limited upper body coordination the chair was equipped with a panic button so that mick could summon help if he felt his control slipping faster than the predicted rate were he to fall into sudden and total paralysis the chair would call out to passersby to provide assistance in the event of an extreme medical emergency it would steer itself to the nearest designated care point andrea came out to the laboratory to meet him mick wanted one last trip into the city with her but although shed been enthusiastic when theyd talked about the plan on the phone andrea was now reluctant are you sure about this we had such a nice time on thursday it would be a shame to spoil the memory of that now im okay mick said im just saying we could always just stroll around the gardens here please mick said this is whati want his voice was slow his phrasing imprecise he sounded drunk and depressed if andrea noticedand he was sure she must haveshe made no observation they went into town it was difficult getting the wheelchair on the tram even with andreas assistance no one seemed to know how to lower the boarding ramp one of the benefits of nervelink technology was that you didnt see that many people in wheelchairs anymore the technology that enabled one person to control another persons body also enabled spinal injuries to be bypassed mick was aware that he was attracting more attention than on any previous day for most people wheelchairs were a medical horror from the past like iron lungs or leg braces on the trams video monitor he watched a news item about the polish miners it wasnt good the rescue team had had a number of options available to them involving at least three possible routes to the trapped men after carefully evaluating all the dataaware of how little time remained for the victimstheyd chosen what had promised to be the quickest and safest approach it had turned out to be a mistake one that would prove fatal for the miners the rescuers had hit a flooded section and had been forced to retreat with damage to their equipment and one of their team injured yet the miners had been saved in one of the other contacted worldlines in that reality one of the members of the rescue team had slipped on ice and fractured his hip while boarding the plane the loss of that one manwhod been a vocal proponent for taking the quickest routehad resulted in the team following the second course it had turned out to be the right decision theyd met their share of obstacles and difficulties but in the end theyd broken through to the trapped miners by the time this happened contact with that worldline had almost been lost even the best compression methods couldnt cope with moving images the pictures that came back of the men being liberated from the ground were grainy and monochrome like a blowup of newsprint from a hundred years earlier theyd been squeezed across the gap in the last minutes before noise drowned the signal but the information was useless even armed with the knowledge that there was a safe route through to the miners the team in this worldline didnt have time to act the news didnt help micks mood going into the city turned out to be exactly the bad move andrea had predicted by midday his motor control had deteriorated even further to the point where he was having difficulty steering the wheelchair his speech became increasingly slurred so that andrea had to keep asking him to repeat himself in defense he shut down into monosyllables even his hearing was beginning to fail as the auditory data was compressed to an even more savage degree he couldnt distinguish birds from traffic or traffic from the swish of the trees in the park when andrea spoke to him she sounded like her words had been fed through a synthesizer then chopped up and spliced back together in some tinny approximation to her normal voice at three his glasses could no longer support full color vision the software switched to a limited color palette the city looked like a handtinted photograph washed out and faded andreas face oscillated between white and sickly gray by four mick was fully quadriplegic by five the glasses had reverted back to black and white the frame rate was down to ten images per second and falling by early evening andrea was no longer able to understand what mick was saying mick realized that he could no longer reach the panic button he became agitated thrashing his head around hed had enough he wanted to be pulled out of the nervelink slammed back into his own waiting body he no longer felt as if he was in micks body but he didnt feel as if he was in his own one either he was strung out somewhere between them helpless and almost blind when the panic hit it was like a foaming irresistible tide alarmed andrea wheeled him back to the laboratory by the time she was ready to say goodbye to him the glasses had reduced his vision to five images per second each of which was composed of only six thousand pixels he was calmer then resigned to the inevitability of what tomorrow would bring he would not even recognize andrea in the morning saturday micks last day with andrea began in a world of sound and visionsenses that were already impoverished to a large degreeand ended in a realm of silence and darkness he was now completely paralyzed unable even to move his head the brain that belonged to the other comatose mick now had more control over this body than its wakeful counterpart the nervelink was still sending signals back to the lab but the requirements of sight and sound now consumed almost all available bandwidth in the morning vision was down to one thousand pixels updated three frames per second his sight had already turned monochrome but even yesterday there had been welcome gradations of gray enough to anchor him into the visual landscape now the pixels were only capable of registering on or off it cost too much bandwidth to send intermediate intensity values when andrea was near him her face was a flickering abstraction of black and white squares like a trick picture in a psychology textbook with effort he learned to distinguish her from the other faces in the laboratory but no sooner had he gained confidence in his ability than the quality of vision declined even further by midmorning the frame rate had dropped to eight hundred pixels at two per second which was less like vision than being shown a sequence of still images people didnt walk to him across the labthey jumped from spot to spot captured in frozen postures it was soon easy to stop thinking of them as people at all but simply as abstract structures in the data by noon he could not exactly say that he had any vision at all something was updating once every two seconds but the matrix of black and white pixels was hard to reconcile with his memories of the lab he could no longer distinguish people from furniture unless people moved between frames and then only occasionally at two he asked joe to disable the feed from the glasses so that the remaining bandwidth could be used for sound and touch mick was plunged into darkness sound had declined overnight as well if andreas voice had been tinny yesterday today it was barely human it was as if she were speaking to him through a voice distorter on the end of the worst telephone connection in the world the noise was beginning to win the software was struggling to compensate teasing sense out of the data it was a battle that could only be prolonged not won im still here andrea told him her voice a whisper fainter than the signal from the furthest quasar mick answered back it took some time his words in the lab had to be analyzed by voicerecognition software and converted into ascii characters the characters were compressed further and sent across the reality gap bit by bit in the other version of the labthe one where micks body waited in a wheelchair the one where andrea hadnt died in a car crashequivalent software decompressed the character string and reconstituted it in mechanically generated speech with an american accent thank you for letting me come back he said please stay until the end until im not here anymore im not going anywhere mick andrea squeezed his hand after all that he had lost since friday touch remained it really was the easiest thing to send easier than sight easier than sound when later even andreas voice had to be sent across the gap by character string and speech synthesizer touch endured he felt her holding him hugging his body to hers refusing to surrender him to the drowning roar of quantum noise were down to less than a thousand useable bits joe told him speaking quietly in his ear in the version of the lab where mick lay on the immersion couch thats a thousand bits total until we lose all contact its enough for a message enough for parting words send this mick said tell andrea that im glad she was there tell her that im glad she was my wife tell her im sorry we didnt make it up that hill together when joe had sent the message typing it in with his usual fluid speed mick felt the sense of andreas touch easing even the microscopic datatransfer burden of communicating unchanging pressure hand on hand body against body was now too much for the link it was like one swimmer letting a drowning partner go as the last bits fell he felt andrea slip away forever he lay on the couch unmoving he had lost his wife for the second time for the moment the weight of that realization pinned him into stillness he did not think he would ever be able to walk in his world let alone the one he had just vacated and yet it was saturday andreas funeral was in two days he would have to be ready for that were done joe said respectfully link is now noiseswamped did andrea send anything back mick asked after i sent my last words no im sorry mick caught the hesitation in joes answer nothing came through nothing intelligible i thought something was coming through but it was just joe offered an apologetic shrug the setup at their end must have gone noiselimited a few seconds before ours did happens sometimes i know mick said but i still want to see what andrea sent joe handed him a printout mick waited for his eyes to focus on the sheet beneath the lines of header information was a single line of text so like a phone number or a postal code except it was obviously neither thats all joe sighed heavily im sorry mate maybe she was just trying to get something throughbut the noise won the fucking noise always wins mick looked at the numbers again they began to talk to him he thought he knew what they meant always fucking wins joe repeated sunday andrea was there when they brought mick out of the medically induced coma he came up through layers of disorientation and halfdream adrift until something inside him clicked into place and he realized where he had been for the last week what had been happening to the body over which he was now regaining gradual control it was exactly as they had promised no dreams no anxiety no tangible sense of elapsed time in a way it was not an entirely unattractive way to spend a week like being in the womb hed heard people say and now he was being born again a process that was not without its own discomforts he tried moving an arm and when the limb did not obey him instantly he began to panic but joe was already smiling easy boyo its coming back the softwares rerouting things one spinal nerve at a time just hold on there and itll be fine mick tried mumbling something in reply but his jaw wasnt working properly either yet it would come as joe had promised on any given day thousands of recipients went through this exact procedure without blinking an eyelid many of them were people whod already done it hundreds of times before nervelinking was almost insanely safe far safer than any form of physical travel that was certain he tried moving his arm again this time it obeyed without hesitation how are you feeling andrea asked once more he tried speaking his jaw was stiff his tongue thick and uncooperative but he managed to make some sounds okay felt better they say its easier the second time much easier the third how long you went under on sunday of last week its sunday again now joe said a full week exactly the way theyd planned it im quite hungry mick said everyones always hungry when they come out of the coma joe said its hard to get enough nourishment into the host body well get you sorted out though mick turned his head to look at joe waiting for his eyes to find grudging focus joe he said everythings all right isnt it no complications nothing to worry about no problems at all joe said then would you mind giving andrea and me a moment alone joe held up his hand in hasty acknowledgement and left the room off on some plausible errand he shut the door quietly behind him well mick asked im guessing things must have gone okay or they wouldnt have kept me under for so long things went okay yes andrea said then you met the other mick he was here andrea nodded heavily he was here we spent time together what did you get up to all the usual stuff you or i wouldve done hit the town walked in the parks went into the hills that kind of thing how was it she looked at him guardedly really really sad i didnt really know how to behave to be honest part of me wanted to be all consoling and sympathetic because hed lost his wife but i dont think thats what mick wanted the other mick he corrected gently point is he didnt come back to see me being all weepy he wanted another week with his wife the way things used to be yes he wanted to say goodbye but he didnt want to spend the whole week with the two of us walking around feeling down in the dumps so how did you feel miserable not as miserable as if id lost my husband of course but some of his sadness started wearing off on me i didnt think it was going toim not the one whos been bereaved herebut youd have to be inhuman not to feel something wouldnt you whatever you felt dont blame yourself for it i think it was a wonderful thing you agreed to do you too i had the easy part mick said andrea stroked the side of his face he realized that he needed a good shave how do you feel she asked youre nearly him after all you know everything he knows except how it feels to lose a wife and i hope i dont ever find that out i dont think i can ever really understand what hes going through now he feels like someone else a friend a colleague someone youd feel sorry for but youre not cut up about what happened to him mick thought for a while before responding not wanting to give the glib automatic answer no matter how comforting it might have been no i wish it hadnt happenedbut youre still here we can still be together if we want well carry on with our lives and in a few months well hardly ever think of that accident the other mick isnt me he isnt even anyone well ever hear from again hes gone he might as well not exist but he does just because we cant communicate anymorehe is still out there thats what the theory says mick narrowed his eyes why what difference does it really make to us none at all i suppose again that guarded look but theres something i have to tell you something you have to understand there was a tone in her voice that troubled mick but he did his best not to show it go on andrea i made a promise to the other mick hes lost something no one can ever replace and i wanted to do something anything to make it easier for him because of that mick and i came to an arrangement once a year im going to go away for a day for that day and that day only im going somewhere private where im going to be thinking about the other mick about what hes been doing what kind of life hes had whether hes happy or sad and im going to be alone i dont want you to follow me mick you have to promise me that you could tell me he said there doesnt have to be secrets im telling you now dont you think i could have kept it from you if i wanted to but i still wont know where you dont need to this is a secret between me and the other mick me and the other you she must have read something in his expression something he had hoped wasnt there because her tone turned grave and you need to find a way to deal with that because it isnt negotiable i already made that promise and andrea leighton doesnt break promises no she said softening her look with a sweet halfsmile she doesnt especially not to mick leighton whichever one it happens to be they kissed later when andrea was out of the room while joe ran some more postimmersion tests mick peeled off a yellow postit note that had been left on one of the keyboards there was something written on the note in neat blue ink instantly he recognized andreas handwriting hed seen it often enough on the message board in their kitchen but the writing itselfsomeant nothing to him joe he asked casually is this something of yours joe glanced over from his desk his eyes freezing on the small rectangle of yellow paper no thats what andrea asked joe began then caught himself look its nothing i meant to bin it but its a message to the other mick right joe looked around as if andrea might still be hiding in the room or about to reappear we were down to the last few usable bits the other mick had just sent his last words through andrea asked me to send that response did she tell you what it meant joe looked defensive i just typed it i didnt ask thought it was between you and her i mean between the other mick and her its okay mick said you were right not to ask he looked at the message again and something fell solidly into place it had taken a few moments but he recognized the code for what it was now as some damp and windswept memory filtered up from the past the numbers formed a grid reference on an ordnance survey map it was the kind andrea and he had used when they went on their walking expeditions the reference even looked vaguely familiar he stared at the numbers feeling as if they were about to give up their secret wherever it was hed been there or somewhere near it wouldnt be hard to look it up he wouldnt even need the postit note hed always had a good memory for numbers footsteps approached echoing along the linoleumfloored hallway that led to the lab its andrea joe said mick folded the postit note until the message was no longer visible he flicked it in joes direction knowing that it was none of his business anymore bin it you sure from now on there was always going to be a part of his wifes life that didnt involve him even if it was only for one day a year he would just have to find a way to live with that things could have been worse after all im sure he said porridge on islac

newbery medal the national book award the penmalamud award and was named a living legend by the library of congress it must be admitted that the method invented by sita dulip is not entirely reliable you sometimes find yourself on a plane that isnt the one you meant to go to if whenever you travel you carry with you a copy of romans handy planary guide you can read up on wherever it is you get to when you get there though roman is not always reliable either but the encyclopedia planaria in fortyfour volumes is not portable and after all what is entirely reliable unless its dead i arrived on islac unintentionally when i was inexperienced before i had learned to tuck roman into my suitcase the interplanary hotel there did have a set of the encyclopedia but it was at the bindery because they said the bears had eaten the glue in the bindings and the books had all come to pieces i thought they must have rather odd bears on islac but did not like to ask about them i looked around the halls and my room carefully in case any bears were lurking it was a beautiful hotel and the hosts were pleasant so i decided to take my luck as it came and spend a day or two on islac i got to looking over the books in the bookcase in my room and trying out the builtin legemat and had quite forgotten about bears when something scuttled behind a bookend i moved the bookend and glimpsed the scuttler it was dark and furry but had a long thin tail of some kind almost like wire it was six or eight inches long not counting the tail i didnt much like sharing my room with it but i hate complaining to strangersyou can only complain satisfactorily to people you know really wellso i moved the heavy bookend over the hole in the wall the creature had disappeared into and went down to dinner the hotel served family style all the guests at one long table they were a friendly lot from several different planes we were able to converse in pairs using our translatomats though general conversation overloaded the circuits my lefthand neighbor a rosy lady from a plane she called ahyes said she and her husband came to islac quite often i asked her if she knew anything about the bears here yes she said smiling and nodding theyre quite harmless but what little pests they are spoiling books and licking envelopes and snuggling in the bed snuggling in the bed yes yes they were pets you see her husband leaned forward to talk to me around her he was a rosy gentleman teddy bears he said in english smiling yes teddy bears yes yes he said and then had to resort to his own languageteddy bears are little animal pets for children isnt that right but theyre not live animals he looked dismayed dead animals nostuffed animalstoys yes yes toys pets he said smiling and nodding he wanted to talk about his visit to my plane he had been to san francisco and liked it very much and we talked about earthquakes instead of teddy bears he had found a earthquake a very charming experience very enjoyable and he and his wife and i laughed a great deal as he told about it they were certainly a nice couple with a positive outlook when i went back to my room i shoved my suitcase up against the bookend that blocked the hole in the wall and lay in bed hoping that the teddy bears did not have a back door nothing snuggled into the bed with me that night i woke very early being jetlagged by flying from london to chicago where my westbound flight had been delayed allowing me this vacation it was a lovely warm morning the sun just rising i got up and went out to take the air and see the city of slas on the islac plane it might have been a big city on my plane nothing exotic to my eye except the buildings were more mixed in style and in size than ours that is we put the big imposing buildings at the center and on the nice streets and the small humble ones in the neighborhoods or barrios or slums or shantytowns in this residential quarter of slas big houses were all jumbled up together with tiny cottages some of them hardly bigger than hutches when i went the other direction downtown i found the same wild variation of scale in the office buildings a massive old fourstory granite block towered over a tenstory building ten feet wide with floors only five or six feet aparta dolls skyscraper by then however enough islai were out and about that the buildings didnt puzzle me as much as the people did they were amazingly various in size in color in shape a woman who must have been eight feet tall swept past me literally she was a street sweeper busily and gracefully clearing the sidewalk of dust she had what i took to be a spare broom or duster a great spray of feathers tucked into her waistband in back like an ostrichs tail next came a businessman striding along hooked up to the computer network via a plug in his ear a mouthpiece and the left frame of his spectacles talking away as he studied the market report he came up about to my waist four young men passed on the other side of the street there was nothing odd about them except that they all looked exactly alike then came a child trotting to school with his little backpack he trotted on all fours neatly his hands in leather mitts or boots that protected them from the pavement he was pale with small eyes and a snout but he was adorable a sidewalk caf√© had just opened up beside a park downtown though ignorant of what the islai ate for breakfast i was ravenous ready to dare anything edible i held out my translatomat to the waitress a wornlooking woman of forty or so with nothing unusual about her to my eye but the beauty of her thick yellow fancifully braided hair please tell me what a foreigner eats for breakfast i said she laughed then smiled a beautiful kind smile and said via the translatomat well you have to tell me that we eat cledif or fruit with cledif fruit with cledif please i said and presently she brought me a plate of deliciouslooking fruits and a large bowl of pale yellow gruel smooth about as thick as very heavy cream lukewarm it sounds ghastly but it was deliciousmild but subtle lightly filling and slightly stimulating like caf√© au lait she waited to see if i liked it im sorry i didnt think to ask if you were a carnivore she said carnivores have raw cullis for breakfast or cledif with offal this is fine i said nobody else was in the place and she had taken a liking to me as i had to her may i ask where you come from she asked and so we got to talking her name was ai li a le i soon realised she was not only an intelligent person but a highly educated one she had a degree in plant pathologybut was lucky she said to have a job as a waitress since the ban she said shrugging when she saw that i didnt know what the ban was she was about to tell me but several customers were sitting down now a great bull of a man at one table two mousy girls at another and she had to go wait on them i wish we could go on talking i said and she said with her kind smile well if you come back at sixteen i can sit and talk with you i will i said and i did after wandering around the park and the city i went back to the hotel for lunch and a nap then took the monorail back downtown i never saw such a variety of people as were in that carall shapes sizes colors degrees of hairiness furriness featheriness the street sweepers tail had indeed been a tail and i thought looking at one long greenish youth even leafiness surely those were fronds over his ears he was whispering to himself as the warm wind swept through the car from the open windows the only thing the islai seemed to have in common unfortunately was poverty the city certainly had been prosperous once not very long ago the monorail was a snazzy bit of engineering but it was showing wear and tear the surviving old buildingswhich were on a scale i found familiarwere grand but rundown and crowded by the more recent giants houses and dolls houses and buildings like stables or mews or rabbit hutchesa terrible hodgepodge all of it cheaply built ricketylooking shabby the islai themselves were shabby when they werent downright ragged some of the furrier and featherier ones were clothed only by their fur and feathers the green boy wore a modesty apron but his rough trunk and limbs were bare this was a country in deep hard economic trouble ai li a le was sitting at one of the outside tables at the caf√© the cledifac next door to the one where she waited tables she smiled and beckoned to me and i sat down with her she had a small bowl of chilled cledif with sweet spices and i ordered the same please tell me about the ban i asked her we used to look like you she said what happened well she said and hesitated we like science we like engineering we are good engineers but perhaps we are not very good scientists to summarise her story the islai had been strong on practical physics agriculture architecture urban development engineering invention but weak in the life sciences history and theory they had their edisons and fords but no darwin no mendel when their airports got to be just like ours if not worse they began to travel between planes and on some plane about a hundred years ago one of their scientists discovered applied genetics he brought it home it fascinated them they promptly mastered its principles or perhaps they had not quite mastered them before they started applying them to every lifeform within reach first she said to plants altering food plants to be more fruitful or to resist bacteria and viruses or to kill insects and so on i nodded were doing a good deal of that too i said really are you she seemed not to know how to ask the question she wanted to ask im corn myself she said at last shyly i checked the translatomat uslu corn maize i checked the dictionary and it said that uslu on islac and maize on my plane were the same plant i knew that the odd thing about corn is that it has no wild form only a distant wild ancestor that youd never recognise as corn its entirely a construct of longterm breeding by ancient gatherers and farmers an early genetic miracle but what did it have to do with ai li a le ai li a le with her wonderful thick goldcolored corncolored hair cascading in braids from a topknot only four percent of my genome she said theres about half a percent of parrot too but its recessive thank god i was still trying to absorb what she had told me i think she felt her question had been answered by my astonished silence they were utterly irresponsible she said severely with all their programs and policies and making everything better they were fools they let all kinds of things get loose and interbreed wiped out rice in one decade the improved breech went sterile the famines were terriblebutterflies we used to have butterflies do you have them some still i said and deletu a kind of singing firefly now extinct said my translatomat i shook my head wistfully she shook her head wistfully i never saw a butterfly or a deletu only picturesthe insecticidal clones got thembut the scientists learned nothingnothing they set about improving the animals improving us dogs that could talk cats that could play chess human beings who were going to be all geniuses and never get sick and live five hundred years they did all that oh yes they did all that there are talking dogs all over the place unbelievably boring they are on and on and on about sex and shit and smells and smells and shit and sex and do you love me do you love me do you love me i cant stand talking dogs my big poodle rover he never says a word the dear good soul and then the humans well never ever get rid of the premier hes a healthy a bloody gapa hes ninety now and looks thirty and hell go on looking thirty and being premier for four more centuries hes a pious hypocrite and a greedy petty stupid meanminded crook just the kind of man who ought to be siring children for five centuriesthe ban doesnt apply to himbut still im not saying the ban was wrong they had to do something things were really awful fifty years ago when they realised that genetic hackers had infiltrated all the laboratories and half the techs were bioist fanatics and the godsone church had all those secret factories in the eastern hemisphere deliberately turning out genetic meldsof course most of those products werent viable but a lot of them werethe hackers were so good at it the chicken people youve seen them as soon as she asked i realised that i had short squat people who ran around in intersections squawking so that all the traffic gridlocked in an effort not to run them over they just make me want to cry ai li a le said looking as if she wanted to cry so the ban forbade further experimentation i asked she nodded yes actually they blew up the laboratories and sent the bioists for reeducation in the gubi and jailed all the godsone fathers and most of the mothers too i guess and shot the geneticists and destroyed all the experiments in progress and the products if they wereshe shruggedtoo far from the norm the norm she scowled though her sunny face was not made for scowling we dont have a norm any more we dont have species any more were a genetic porridge when we plant maize it comes up weevilrepellent clover that smells like chlorine when we plant an oak it comes up poison oak fifty feet high with a tenfootthick trunk and when we make love we dont know if were going to have a baby or a foal or a cygnet or a sapling my daughter and she paused her face worked and she had to compress her lips before she could go on my daughter lives in the north sea on raw fish shes very beautiful dark and silky and beautiful buti had to take her to the seacoast when she was two years old i had to put her in that cold water those big waves i had to let her swim away let her go be what she is but she is human too she is she is human too she was crying and so was i after a while ai li a le went on to tell me how the genome collapse had led to profound economic depression only worsened by the purity clauses of the ban which restricted jobs in the professions and government to those who tested humanwith exceptions for healthies righteous ones and other gapas genetically altered products approved by the emergency government this was why she was working as a waitress she was four percent maize maize was once the holy plant of many people where i come from i said hardly knowing what i said it is such a beautiful plant i love everything made out of cornpolenta hoecake cornbread tortillas canned corn creamed corn hominy grits corn whiskey corn chowder on the cob tamalesits all good all good all kind all sacred i hope you dont mind if i talk about eating it heavens no said ai li a le smiling what did you think cledif was made from after a while i asked her about teddy bears that phrase of course meant nothing to her but when i described the creature in my bookcase she noddedoh yes bookbears early on when the genetic designers were making everything better you know they dwarfed bears way down for childrens pets like toys stuffed animals only they were alive programmed to be passive and affectionate but some of the genes they used for dwarfing came from insectsspringtails and earwigs and the bears began to eat the childrens books at night while they were supposed to be cuddling in bed with the children theyd go eat their books they like paper and glue and when they bred the offspring had long tails like wires and a sort of insect jaw so they werent much good for the children any more but by then theyd escaped into the woodwork between the wallssome people call them bearwigs i have been back to islac several times to see ai li a le it is not a happy plane or a reassuring one but i would go to worse places than islac to see so kind a smile such a topknot of gold and to drink maize with the woman who is maize mrs todds shortcut stephen king

collection of four allnew previously unpublished stories his other work includes classics such as the stand the dark tower salems lot among others there goes the todd woman i said homer buckland watched the little jaguar go by and nodded the woman raised her hand to homer homer nodded his big shaggy head to her but didnt raise his own hand in return the todd family had a big summer home on castle lake and homer had been their caretaker since time out of mind i had an idea that he disliked worth todds second wife every bit as much as hed liked phelia todd the first one this was just about two years ago and we were sitting on a bench in front of bells market me with an orange sodapop homer with a glass of mineral water it was october which is a peaceful time in castle rock lots of the lake places still get used on the weekends but the aggressive boozy summer socializing is over by then and the hunters with their big guns and their expensive nonresident permits pinned to their orange caps havent started to come into town yet crops have been mostly laid by nights are cool good for sleeping and old joints like mine havent yet started to complain in october the sky over the lake is passing fair with those big white clouds that move so slow i like how they seem so flat on the bottoms and how they are a little gray there like with a shadow of sundown foretold and i can watch the sun sparkle on the water and not be bored for some space of minutes its in october sitting on the bench in front of bells and watching the lake from afar off that i still wish i was a smoking man she dont drive as fast as phelia homer said i swan i used to think what an oldfashion name she had for a woman that could put a car through its paces like she could summer people like the todds are nowhere near as interesting to the yearround residents of small maine towns as they themselves believe yearround folk prefer their own love stories and hate stories and scandals and rumors of scandal when that textile fellow from amesbury shot himself estonia corbridge found that after a week or so she couldnt even get invited to lunch on her story of how she found him with the pistol still in one stiffening hand but folks are still not done talking about joe camber who got killed by his own dog well it dont matter its just that they are different racecourses we run on summer people are trotters us others that dont put on ties to do our weeks work are just pacers even so there was quite a lot of local interest when ophelia todd disappeared back in ophelia was a genuinely nice woman and she had done a lot of things in town she worked to raise money for the sloan library helped to refurbish the war memorial and that sort of thing but all the summer people like the idea of raising money you mention raising money and their eyes light up and commence to gleam you mention raising money and they can get a committee together and appoint a secretary and keep an agenda they like that but you mention time beyond that is one big long walloper of a combined cocktail party and committee meeting and youre out of luck time seems to be what summer people mostly set a store by they lay it by and if they could put it up in ball jars like preserves why they would but phelia todd seemed willing to spend timeto do desk duty in the library as well as to raise money for it when it got down to using scouring pads and elbow grease on the war memorial phelia was right out there with town women who had lost sons in three different wars wearing an overall with her hair done up in a kerchief and when kids needed ferrying to a summer swim program youd be as apt to see her as anyone headed down landing road with the back of worth todds big shiny pickup full of kids a good woman not a town woman but a good woman and when she disappeared there was concern not grieving exactly because a disappearance is not exactly like a death its not like chopping something off with a cleaver more like something running down the sink so slow you dont know its all gone until long after it is twas a mercedes she drove homer said answering the question i hadnt asked twoseater sportster todd got it for her in sixtyfour or sixtyfive i guess you remember her taking the kids to the lake all those years they had frogs and tadpoles ayuh shed drive em no more than forty mindful they was in the back but it chafed her that woman had lead in her foot and a ball bearing sommers in the back of her ankle it used to be that homer never talked about his summer people but then his wife died five years ago it was she was plowing a grade and the tractor tipped over on her and homer was taken bad off about it he grieved for two years or so and then seemed to feel better but he was not the same he seemed waiting for something to happen waiting for the next thing youd pass his neat little house sometimes at dusk and he would be on the porch smoking a pipe with a glass of mineral water on the porch rail and the sunset would be in his eyes and pipe smoke around his head and youd thinki did anywayhomer is waiting for the next thing this bothered me over a wider range of my mind than i liked to admit and at last i decided it was because if it had been me i wouldnt have been waiting for the next thing like a groom who has put on his morning coat and finally has his tie right and is only sitting there on a bed in the upstairs of his house and looking first at himself in the mirror and then at the clock on the mantel and waiting for it to be eleven oclock so he can get married if it had been me i would not have been waiting for the next thing i would have been waiting for the last thing but in that waiting periodwhich ended when homer went to vermont a year laterhe sometimes talked about those people to me to a few others she never even drove fast with her husband sfar as i know but when i drove with her she made that mercedes strut a fellow pulled in at the pumps and began to fill up his car the car had a massachusetts plate it wasnt one of these new sports cars that run on onleaded gasoline and hitch every time you step on it it was one of the old ones and the speedometer was calibrated all the way up to a hundred and sixty it was a funny color of brown and i ast her one time what you called that color and she said it was champagne aint that good i says and she laughs fit to split i like a woman who will laugh when you dont have to point her right at the joke you know the man at the pumps had finished getting his gas afternoon gentlemen he says as he comes up the steps a good day to you i says and he went inside phelia was always lookin for a shortcut homer went on as if we had never been interrupted that woman was mad for a shortcut i never saw the beat of it she said if you can save enough distance youll save time as well she said her father swore by that scripture he was a salesman always on the road and she went with him when she could and he was always lookin for the shortest way so she got in the habit i ast her one time if it wasnt kinda funnyhere she was on the one hand spendin her time rubbin up that old statue in the square and takin the little ones to their swimmin lessons instead of playing tennis and swimming and getting boozed up like normal summer people and on the other hand bein so damn set on savin fifteen minutes between here and fryeburg that thinkin about it probably kep her up nights it just seemed to me the two things went against each others grain if you see what i mean she just looks at me and says i like being helpful homer i like driving tooat least sometimes when its a challengebut i dont like the time it takes its like mending clothessometimes you take tucks and sometimes you let things out do you see what i mean i guess so missus i says kinda dubious if sitting behind the wheel of a car was my idea of a really good time all the time i would look for longcuts she says and that tickled me smuch i had to laugh the massachusetts fellow came out of the store with a sixpack in one hand and some lottery tickets in the other you enjoy your weekend homer says i always do the massachusetts fellow says i only wish i could afford to live here all year round well well keep it all in good order for when you can come homer says and the fellow laughs we watched him drive off toward someplace that massachusetts plate showing it was a green one my marcy says those are the ones the massachusetts motor registry gives to drivers who aint had a accident in that strange angry fuming state for two years if you have she says you got to have a red one so people know to watch out for you when they see you on the roll they was instate people you know the both of them homer said as if the massachusetts fellow had reminded him of the fact i guess i did know that i said the todds are just about the only birds we got that fly north in the winter the new one i dont think she likes flying north too much he sipped his mineral water and fell silent a moment thinking she didnt mind it though homer said at least i judge she didnt although she used to complain about it something fierce the complaining was just a way to explain why she was always lookin for a shortcut and you mean her husband didnt mind her traipsing down every woodroad in tarnation between here and bangor just so she could see if it was ninetenths of a mile shorter he didnt care pissall homer said shortly and got up and went in the store there now owens i told myself you know it aint safe to ast him questions when hes yarning and you went right ahead and ast one and you have buggered a story that was starting to shape up promising i sat there and turned my face up into the sun and after about ten minutes he come out with a boiled egg and sat down he ate her and i took care not to say nothing and the water on castle lake sparkled as blue as something as might be told of in a story about treasure when homer had finished his egg and had a sip of mineral water he went on i was surprised but still said nothing it wouldnt have been wise they had two or three different chunks of rolling iron he said there was the cadillac and his truck and her little mercedes godevil a couple of winters he left the truck case they wanted to come down and do some skiin mostly when the summer was over hed drive the caddy back up and shed take her godevil i nodded but didnt speak in truth i was afraid to risk another comment later i thought it would have taken a lot of comments to shut homer buckland up that day he had been wanting to tell the story of mrs todds shortcut for a long time her little godevil had a special odometer in it that told you how many miles was in a trip and every time she set off from castle lake to bangor shed set it to point and let her clock up to whatever she had made a game of it and she used to chafe me with it he paused thinking that back over no that aint right he paused more and faint lines showed up on his forehead like steps on a library ladder she made like she made a game of it but it was a serious business to her serious as anything else anyway he flapped a hand and i think he meant the husband the glovebox of the little godevil was filled with maps and there was a few more in the back where there would be a seat in a regular car some was gas station maps and some was pages that had been pulled from the randmcnally road atlas she had some maps from appalachian trail guidebooks and a whole mess of topographical surveysquares too it wasnt her having those maps that made me think it want a game it was how shed drawed lines on all of them showing routes shed taken or at least tried to take shed been stuck a few times too and had to get a pull from some farmer with a tractor and chain i was there one day laying tile in the bathroom sitting there with grout squittering out of every damn crack you could seei dreamed of nothing but squares and cracks that was bleeding grout that nightand she come stood in the doorway and talked to me about it for quite a while i used to chafe her about it but i was also sort of interested and not just because my brother franklin used to live downbangor and id traveled most of the roads she was telling me of i was interested just because a man like me is always oncommon interested in knowing the shortest way even if he dont always want to take it you that way too ayuh i said theres something powerful about knowing the shortest way even if you take the longer way because you know your motherinlaw is sitting home getting there quick is often for the birds although no one holding a massachusetts drivers license seems to know it but knowing how to get there quickor even knowing how to get there a way that the person sitting beside you dont know that has power well she had them roads like a boy scout has his knots homer said and smiled his large sunny grin she says wait a minute wait a minute like a little girl and i hear her through the wall rummaging through her desk and then she comes back with a little notebook that looked like shed had it a good long time cover was all rumpled dont you know and some of the pages had pulled loose from those little wire rings on one side the way worth goesthe way most people gois route to mechanic falls then route to lewiston and then the interstate to bangor miles i nodded if you want to skip the turnpikeand save some distanceyoud go to mechanic falls route to lewiston route to augusta then up route through china lake and unity and haven to bangor thats miles you wont save no time that way missus i says not going through lewiston and augusta although i will admit that drive up the old derry road to bangor is real pretty save enough miles and soon enough youll save time she says and i didnt say thats the way id go although i have a good many times im just running down the routes most people use do you want me to go on no i says just leave me in this cussed bathroom all by myself starin at all these cussed cracks until i start to rave there are four major routes in all she says the one by route is miles i only tried it once too long thats the one id hosey if my wife called and told me it was leftovers i says kinda low what was that she says nothin i says talkin to the grout oh well the fourthand there arent too many who know about it although they are all good roadspaved anywayis across speckled bird mountain on to beyond lewiston then if you take route you can get around augusta then you take the old derry road that way is just i didnt say nothing for a little while and praps she thought i was doubting her because she says a little pert i know its hard to believe but its so i said i guessed that was about right and i thoughtlooking backit probably was because thats the way id usually go when i went down to bangor to see franklin when he was still alive i hadnt been that way in years though do you think a man could justwellforget a road dave i allowed it was the turnpike is easy to think of after a while it almost fills a mans mind and you think not how could i get from here to there but how can i get from here to the turnpike ramp thats closest to there and that made me think that maybe there are lots of roads all over that are just going begging roads with rock walls beside them real roads with blackberry bushes growing alongside them but nobody to eat the berries but the birds and gravel pits with old rusted chains hanging down in low curves in front of their entryways the pits themselves as forgotten as a childs old toys with scrumgrass growing up their deserted unremembered sides roads that have just been forgot except by the people who live on them and think of the quickest way to get off them and onto the turnpike where you can pass on a hill and not fret over it we like to joke in maine that you cant get there from here but maybe the joke is on us the truth is theres about a damn thousand ways to do it and man doesnt bother homer continued i grouted tile all afternoon in that hot little bathroom and she stood there in the doorway all that time one foot crossed behind the other barelegged wearin loafers and a khakicolored skirt and a sweater that was some darker hair was drawed back in a hosstail she must have been thirtyfour or five then but her face was lit up with what she was tellin me and i swan she looked like a sorority girl home from school on vacation after a while she musta got an idea of how long shed been there cuttin the air around her mouth because she says i must be boring the hell out of you homer yesm i says you are i druther you went away and left me to talk to this damn grout dont be smaat homer she says no missus you aint borin me i says so she smiles and then goes back to it pagin through her little notebook like a salesman checkin his orders she had those four main wayswell really three because she gave up on route right awaybut she must have had forty different other ways that were playoffs on those roads with state numbers roads without roads with names roads without my head fair spun with em and finally she says to me you ready for the blueribbon winner homer i guess so i says at least its the blueribbon winner so far she says do you know homer that a man wrote an article in science today in proving that no man could run a mile in under four minutes he proved it with all sorts of calculations based on the maximum length of the male thighmuscles maximum length of stride maximum lung capacity maximum heartrate and a whole lot more i was taken with that article i was so taken that i gave it to worth and asked him to give it to professor murray in the math department at the university of maine i wanted those figures checked because i was sure they must have been based on the wrong postulates or something worth probably thought i was being sillyophelias got a bee in her bonnet is what he saysbut he took them well professor murray checked through the mans figures quite carefully and do you know what homer no missus those figures were right the mans criteria were solid he proved back in that a man couldnt run a mile in under four minutes he proved that but people do it all the time and do you know what that means no missus i said although i had a glimmer it means that no blue ribbon is forever she says somedayif the world doesnt explode itself in the meantimesomeone will run a twominute mile in the olympics it may take a hundred years or a thousand but it will happen because there is no ultimate blue ribbon there is zero and there is eternity and there is mortality but there is no ultimate and there she stood her face clean and scrubbed and shinin that darkish hair of hers pulled back from her brow as if to say just you go ahead and disagree if you can but i couldnt because i believe something like that it is much like what the minister means i think when he talks about grace you ready for the blueribbon winner for now she says ayuh i says and i even stopped groutin for the time bein id reached the tub anyway and there wasnt nothing left but a lot of those frikkin squirrelly little corners she drawed a deep breath and then spieled it out at me as fast as that auctioneer goes over in gates falls when he has been putting the whiskey to himself and i cant remember it all but it went something like this homer buckland shut his eyes for a moment his big hands lying perfectly still on his long thighs his face turned up toward the sun then he opened his eyes again and for a moment i swan he looked like her yes he did a seventyyearold man looking like a woman of thirtyfour who was at that moment in her time looking like a college girl of twenty and i cant remember exactly what he said any more than he could remember exactly what she said not just because it was complex but because i was so fetched by how he looked sayin it but it went close enough like this you set out route and then cut up denton street to the old townhouse road and that way you get around castle rock downtown but back to nine miles up you can go an old loggers road a mile and a half to town road which takes you to big anderson road by sites cider mill theres a cutroad the oldtimers call bear road and that gets you to once youre on the far side of speckled bird mountain you grab the stanhouse road turn left onto the bull pine roadtheres a swampy patch there but you can spang right through it if you get up enough speed on the graveland so you come out on route cuts through altons plantation to the old derry roadand theres two or three woods roads there that you follow and so come out on route just beyond derry hospital from there its only four miles to route in etna and so into bangor she paused to get her breath back then looked at me do you know how long that is all told nom i says thinking it sounds like about a hundred and ninety miles and four bust springs its miles she says i laughed the laugh was out of me before i thought i wasnt doing myself any favor if i wanted to hear this story to the end but homer grinned himself and nodded i know and you know i dont like to argue with anyone dave but theres a difference between having your leg pulled and getting it shook like a damn apple tree you dont believe me she says well its hard to believe missus i said leave that grout to dry and ill show you she says you can finish behind the tub tomorrow come on homer ill leave a note for worthhe may not be back tonight anywayand you can call your wife well be sitting down to dinner in the pilots grille inshe looks at her watchtwo hours and fortyfive minutes from right now and if its a minute longer ill buy you a bottle of irish mist to take home with you you see my dad was right save enough miles and youll save time even if you have to go through every damn bog and sump in kennebec county to do it now what do you say she was lookin at me with her brown eyes just like lamps there was a devilish look in them that said turn your cap around backrds homer and climb aboard this hoss i be first and you be second and let the devil take the hindmost and there was a grin on her face that said the exact same thing and i tell you dave i wanted to go i didnt even want to top that damn can of grout and i certain sure didnt want to drive that godevil of hers i wanted just to sit in it on the shotgun side and watch her get in see her skirt come up a little see her pull it down over her knees or not watch her hair shine he trailed off and suddenly let off a sarcastic choked laugh that laugh of his sounded like a shotgun loaded with rock salt just call up megan and say you know phelia todd that woman youre halfway to being so jealous of now you cant see straight and cant ever find a good word to say about her well her and me is going to make this speedrun down to bangor in that little champagnecolored godevil mercedes of hers so dont wait dinner just call her up and say that oh yes oh ayuh and he laughed again with his hands lying there on his legs just as natural as ever was and i seen something in his face that was almost hateful and after a minute he took his glass of mineral water from the railing there and got outside some of it you didnt go i said not then he laughed and this laugh was gentler she must have seen something in my face because it was like she found herself again she stopped looking like a sorority girl and just looked like phelia todd again she looked down at the notebook like she didnt know what it was she had been holding and put it down by her side almost behind her skirt i says id like to do just that thing missus but i got to finish up here and my wife has got a roast on for dinner she says i understand homeri just got a little carried away i do that a lot all the time worth says then she kinda straightened up and says but the offer holds any time you want to go you can even throw your shoulder to the back end if we get stuck somewhere might save me five dollars and she laughed ill take you up on it missus i says and she seen that i meant what i said and wasnt just being polite and before you just go believing that a hundred and sixteen miles to bangor is out of the question get out your own map and see how many miles it would be as the crow flies i finished the tiles and went home and ate leftoversthere want no roast and i think phelia todd knew itand after megan was in bed i got out my yardstick and a pen and my mobil map of the state and i did what she had told mebecause it had laid hold of my mind a bit you see i drew a straight line and did out the calculations accordin to the scale of miles i was some surprised because if you went from castle rock up there to bangor like one of those little piper cubs could fly on a clear dayif you didnt have to mind lakes or stretches of lumber company woods that was chained off or bogs or crossing rivers where there wasnt no bridges why it would just be seventynine miles give or take i jumped a little measure it yourself if you dont believe me homer said i never knew maine was so small until i seen that he had himself a drink and then looked around at me there come a time the next spring when megan was away in new hampshire visiting with her brother i had to go down to the todds house to take off the storm doors and put on the screens and her little mercedes godevil was there she was down by herself she come to the door and says homer have you come to put on the screen doors and right off i says no missus i come to see if you want to give me a ride down to bangor the short way well she looked at me with no expression on her face at all and i thought she had forgotten all about it i felt my face gettin red the way it will when you feel you just pulled one hell of a boner then just when i was getting ready to pologize her face busts into that grin again and she says you just stand right there while i get my keys and dont change your mind homer she come back a minute later with em in her hand if we get stuck youll see mosquitoes just about the size of dragonflies ive seen em as big as english sparrows up in rangely missus i said and i guess were both a spot too heavy to be carried off she laughs well i warned you anyway come on homer and if we aint there in two hours and fortyfive minutes i says kinda sly you was gonna buy me a bottle of irish mist she looks at me kinda surprised the drivers door of the godevil open and one foot inside hell homer she says i told you that was the blue ribbon for then ive found a way up there thats shorter well be there in two and a half hours get in here homer we are going to roll he paused again hands lying calm on his thighs his eyes dulling perhaps seeing that champagnecolored twoseater heading up the todds steep driveway she stood the car still at the end of it and says you sure let her rip i says the ball bearing in her ankle rolled and that heavy foot come down i cant tell you nothing much about whatall happened after that except after a while i couldnt hardly take my eyes off her there was somethin wild that crep into her face davesomething wild and something free and it frightened my heart she was beautiful and i was took with love for her anyone would have been any man anyway and maybe any woman too but i was scairt of her too because she looked like she could kill you if her eye left the road and fell on you and she decided to love you back she was wearin blue jeans and a old white shirt with the sleeves rolled upi had a idea she was maybe fixin to paint somethin on the back deck when i came bybut after we had been goin for a while seemed like she was dressed in nothin but all this white billowy stuff like a pitcher in one of those old godsandgoddesses books he thought looking out across the lake his face very somber like the huntress that was supposed to drive the moon across the sky diana ayuh moon was her godevil phelia looked like that to me and i just tell you fair out that i was stricken in love for her and never would have made a move even though i was some younger then than i am now i would not have made a move even had i been twenty although i suppose i might of at sixteen and been killed for itkilled if she looked at me was the way it felt she was like that woman drivin the moon across the sky halfway up over the splashboard with her gossamer stoles all flyin out behind her in silver cobwebs and her hair streamin back to show the dark little hollows of her temples lashin those horses and tellin me to get along faster and never mind how they blowed just faster faster faster we went down a lot of woods roadsthe first two or three i knew and after that i didnt know none of them we must have been a sight to those trees that had never seen nothing with a motor in it before but big old pulptrucks and snowmobiles that little godevil that would most likely have looked more at home on the sunset boulevard than shooting through those woods spitting and bulling its way up one hill and then slamming down the next through those dusty green bars of afternoon sunlightshe had the top down and i could smell everything in those woods and you know what an old fine smell that is like something which has been mostly left alone and is not much troubled we went on across corduroy which had been laid over some of the boggiest parts and black mud squelched up between some of those cut logs and she laughed like a kid some of the logs was old and rotted because there hadnt been nobody down a couple of those roadsexcept for her that isin im going to say five or ten years we was alone except for the birds and whatever animals seen us the sound of that godevils engine first buzzin along and then windin up high and fierce when she punched in the clutch and shifted downthat was the only motorsound i could hear and although i knew we had to be close to someplace all the timei mean these days you always arei started to feel like we had gone back in time and there wasnt nothing that if we stopped and i climbed a high tree i wouldnt see nothing in any direction but woods and woods and more woods and all the time shes just hammering that thing along her hair all out behind her smilin her eyes flashin so we come out on the speckled bird mountain road and for a while i known where we were again and then she turned off and for just a little bit i thought i knew and then i didnt even bother to kid myself no more we went cutslam down another woods road and then we come outi swear iton a nice paved road with a sign that said motorway b you ever heard of a road in the state of maine that was called motorway b no i says sounds english ayuh looked english these trees like willows overhung the road now watch out here homer she says one of those nearly grabbed me a month ago and gave me an indian burn i didnt know what she was talkin about and started to say so and then i seen that even though there was no wind the branches of those trees was dippin downthey was waverin down they looked black and wet inside the fuzz of green on them i couldnt believe what i was seein then one of em snatched off my cap and i knew i wasnt asleep hi i shouts give that back too late now homer she says and laughs theres daylight just up aheadwere okay then another one of em comes down on her side this time and snatches at heri swear it did she ducked and it caught in her hair and pulled a lock of it out ouch dammit that hurts she yells but she was laughin too the car swerved a little when she ducked and i got a look into the woods and holy god dave everythin in there was movin there was grasses wavin and plants that was all knotted together so it seemed like they made faces and i seen somethin sittin in a squat on top of a stump and it looked like a treetoad only it was as big as a fullgrowed cat then we come out of the shade to the top of a hill and she says there that was exciting wasnt it as if she was talkin about no more than a walk through the haunted house at the fryeburg fair about five minutes later we swung onto another of her woods roads i didnt want no more woods right theni can tell you that for surebut these were just plain old woods half an hour after that we was pulling into the parking lot of the pilots grille in bangor she points to that little odometer for trips and says take a gander homer i did and it said what do you think now do you believe in my shortcut that wild look had mostly faded out of her and she was just phelia todd again but that other look wasnt entirely gone it was like she was two women phelia and diana and the part of her that was diana was so much in control when she was driving the back roads that the part that was phelia didnt have no idea that her shortcut was taking her through places places that aint on any map of maine not even on those surveysquares she says again what do you think of my shortcut homer and i says the first thing to come into my mind which aint something youd usually say to a lady like phelia todd its a real pisscutter missus i says she laughs just as pleased as punch and i seen it then just as clear as glass she didnt remember none of the funny stuff not the willowbranchesexcept they werent willows not at all not really anything like em or anything elsethat grabbed off mhat not that motorway b sign or that awfullookin toadthing she didnt remember none of that funny stuff either i had dreamed it was there or she had dreamed it wasnt all i knew for sure dave was that we had rolled only a hundred and eleven miles and gotten to bangor and that wasnt no daydream it was right there on the little godevils odometer in black and white well it is she says it is a pisscutter i only wish i could get worth to give it a go sometimebut hell never get out of his rut unless someone blasts him out of it and it would probably take a titan ii missile to do that because i believe he has built himself a fallout shelter at the bottom of that rut come on in homer and lets dump some dinner into you and she bought me one hell of a dinner dave but i couldnt eat very much of it i kep thinkin about what the ride back might be like now that it was drawing down dark then about halfway through the meal she excused herself and made a telephone call when she came back she ast me if i would mind drivin the godevil back to castle rock for her she said she had talked to some woman who was on the same school committee as her and the woman said they had some kind of problem about somethin or other she said shed grab herself a hertz car if worth couldnt see her back down do you mind awfully driving back in the dark she ast me she looked at me kinda smilin and i knew she remembered some of it all rightchrist knows how much but she remembered enough to know i wouldnt want to try her way after dark if ever at allalthough i seen by the light in her eyes that it wouldnt have bothered her a bit so i said it wouldnt bother me and i finished my meal better than when i started it it was drawin down dark by the time we was done and she run us over to the house of the woman shed called and when she gets out she looks at me with that same light in her eyes and says now youre sure you dont want to wait homer i saw a couple of side roads just today and although i cant find them on my maps i think they might chop a few miles i says well missus i would but at my age the best bed to sleep in is my own ive found ill take your car back and never put a ding in her although i guess ill probably put on some more miles than you did then she laughed kind of soft and she give me a kiss that was the best kiss i ever had in my whole life dave it was just on the cheek and it was the chaste kiss of a married woman but it was as ripe as a peach or like those flowers that open in the dark and when her lips touched my skin i felt like i dont know exactly what i felt like because a man cant easily hold on to those things that happened to him with a girl who was ripe when the world was young or how those things feltim talking around what i mean but i think you understand those things all get a red cast to them in your memory and you cannot see through it at all youre a sweet man homer and i love you for listening to me and riding with me she says drive safe then in she went to that womans house me i drove home how did you go i asked he laughed softly by the turnpike you damned fool he said and i never seen so many wrinkles in his face before as i did then he sat there looking into the sky came the summer she disappeared i didnt see much of herthat was the summer we had the fire youll remember and then the big storm that knocked down all the trees a busy time for caretakers oh i thought about her from time to time and about that day and about that kiss and it started to seem like a dream to me like one time when i was about sixteen and couldnt think about nothing but girls i was out plowing george bascombs west field the one that looks acrost the lake at the mountains dreamin about what teenage boys dream of and i pulled up this rock with the harrow blades and it split open and it bled at least it looked to me like it bled red stuff come runnin out of the cleft in the rock and soaked into the soil and i never told no one but my mother and i never told her what it meant to me or what happened to me although she washed my drawers and maybe she knew anyway she suggested i ought to pray on it which i did but i never got no enlightenment and after a while something started to suggest to my mind that it had been a dream its that way sometimes there is holes in the middle dave do you know that yes i says thinking of one night when id seen something that was in a bad year for us but my kids didnt know it was a bad year all they knew was that they wanted to eat just like always id seen a bunch of whitetail in henry bruggers back field and i was out there after dark with a jacklight in august you can shoot two when theyre summerfat the secondll come back and sniff at the first as if to say what the hell is it fall already and you can pop him like a bowlin pin you can hack off enough meat to feed yowwens for six weeks and bury whats left those are two whitetails the hunters who come in november dont get a shot at but kids have to eat like the man from massachusetts said hed like to be able to afford to live here the year around and all i can say is sometimes you pay for the privilege after dark so there i was and i seen this big orange light in the sky it come down and down and i stood and watched it with my mouth hung on down to my breastbone and when it hit the lake the whole of it was lit up for a minute a purpleorange that seemed to go right up to the sky in rays wasnt nobody ever said nothing to me about that light and i never said nothing to nobody myself partly because i was afraid theyd laugh but also because theyd wonder what the hell id been doing out there after dark to start with and after a while it was like homer saidit seemed like a dream i had once had and it didnt signify to me because i couldnt make nothing of it which would turn under my hand it was like a moonbeam it didnt have no handle and it didnt have no blade i couldnt make it work so i left it alone like a man does when he knows the day is going to come up nevertheless there are holes in the middle of things homer said and he sat up straighter like he was mad right in the damn middle of things not even to the left or right where your priphral vision is and you could say well but hell they are there and you go around them like youd go around a pothole in the road that would break an axle you know and you forget it or like if you are plowin you can plow a dip but if theres somethin like a break in the earth where you see darkness like a cave might be there you say go around old hoss leave that alone i got a good shot over here to the leftards because it wasnt a cave you was lookin for or some kind of college excitement but good plowin holes in the middle of things he fell still a long time then and i let him be still didnt have no urge to move him and at last he says she disappeared in august i seen her for the first time in early july and she looked homer turned to me and spoke each word with careful spaced emphasis dave owens she looked gorgeous gorgeous and wild and almost untamed the little wrinkles id started to notice around her eyes all seemed to be gone worth todd he was at some conference or something in boston and she stands there at the edge of the decki was out in the middle with my shirt offand she says homer youll never believe it no missus but ill try i says i found two new roads she says and i got up to bangor this last time in just sixtyseven miles i remembered what she said before and i says thats not possible missus beggin your pardon but i did the mileage on the map myself and seventynine is topsas the crow flies she laughed and she looked prettier than ever like a goddess in the sun on one of those hills in a story where theres nothing but green grass and fountains and no puckies to tear at a mans forearms at all thats right she says and you cant run a mile in under four minutes its been mathematically proved it aint the same i says its the same she says fold the map and see how many miles it is then homer it can be a little less than a straight line if you fold it a little or it can be a lot less if you fold it a lot i remembered our ride then the way you remember a dream and i says missus you can fold a map on paper but you cant fold land or at least you shouldnt ought to try you want to leave it alone no sir she says its the one thing right now in my life that i wont leave alone because its there and its mine three weeks laterthis would be about two weeks before she disappearedshe give me a call from bangor she says worth has gone to new york and i am coming down ive misplaced my damn key homer id like you to open the house so i can get in well that call come at eight oclock just when it was starting to come down dark i had a sanwidge and a beer before leavingabout twenty minutes then i took a ride down there all in all id say i was fortyfive minutes when i got down there to the todds i seen there was a light on in the pantry i didnt leave on while i was comin down the driveway i was lookin at that and i almost run right into her little godevil it was parked kind of on a slant the way a drunk would park it and it was splashed with muck all the way up to the windows and there was this stuff stuck in that mud along the body that looked like seaweedonly when my lights hit it it seemed to be movin i parked behind it and got out of my truck that stuff wasnt seaweed but it was weeds and it was movinkinda slow and sluggish like it was dyin i touched a piece of it and it tried to wrap itself around my hand it felt nasty and awful i drug my hand away and wiped it on my pants i went around to the front of the car it looked like it had come through about ninety miles of splash and low country looked tired it did bugs was splashed all over the windshieldonly they didnt look like no kind of bugs i ever seen before there was a moth that was about the size of a sparrow its wings still flappin a little feeble and dyin there was things like mosquitoes only they had real eyes that you could seeand they seemed to be seein me i could hear those weeds scrapin against the body of the godevil dyin tryin to get a hold on somethin and all i could think was where in the hell has she been and how did she get here in only threequarters of an hour then i seen somethin else there was some kind of a animal halfsmashed onto the radiator grille just under where that mercedes ornament isthe one that looks kinda like a star looped up into a circle now most small animals you kill on the road is bore right under the car because they are crouching when it hits them hoping itll just go over and leave them with their hide still attached to their meat but every now and then one will jump not away but right at the damn car as if to get in one good bite of whatever the buggardly thing is thats going to kill iti have known that to happen this thing had maybe done that and it looked mean enough to jump a sherman tank it looked like something which come of a mating between a woodchuck and a weasel but there was other stuff thrown in that a body didnt even want to look at it hurt your eyes dave worsen that it hurt your mind its pelt was matted with blood and there was claws sprung out of the pads on its feet like a cats claws only longer it had big yellowy eyes only they was glazed when i was a kid i had a porcelain marblea croakerthat looked like that and teeth long thin needle teeth that looked almost like darning needles stickin out of its mouth some of them was sunk right into that steel grillwork thats why it was still hanging on it had hung its own self on by the teeth i looked at it and knowed it had a headful of poison just like a rattlesnake and it jumped at that godevil when it saw it was about to be run down tryin to bite it to death and i wouldnt be the one to try and yonk it offa there because i had cuts on my handshaycutsand i thought it would kill me as dead as a stone parker if some of that poison seeped into the cuts i went around to the drivers door and opened it the inside light come on and i looked at that special odometer that she set for tripsand what i seen there was i looked at that for a bit and then i went to the back door shed forced the screen and broke the glass by the lock so she could get her hand through and let herself in there was a note that said dear homergot here a little sooner than i thought i would found a shortcut and it is a dilly you hadnt come yet so i let myself in like a burglar worth is coming day after tomorrow can you get the screen fixed and the door reglazed by then hope so things like that always bother him if i dont come out to say hello youll know im asleep the drive was very tiring but i was here in no time ophelia tirin i took another look at that bogeything hangin offa the grille of her car and i thought yessir it must have been tiring by god yes he paused again and cracked a restless knuckle i seen her only once more about a week later worth was there but he was swimmin out in the lake back and forth back and forth like he was sawin wood or signin papers more like he was signin papers i guess missus i says this aint my business but you ought to leave well enough alone that night you come back and broke the glass of the door to come in i seen somethin hangin off the front of your car oh the chuck i took care of that she says christ i says i hope you took some care i wore worths gardening gloves she said it wasnt anything anyway homer but a jumpedup woodchuck with a little poison in it but missus i says where theres woodchucks theres bears and if thats what the woodchucks look like along your shortcut whats going to happen to you if a bear shows up she looked at me and i seen that other woman in herthat dianawoman she says if things are different along those roads homer maybe i am different too look at this her hair was done up in a clip at the back looked sort of like a butterfly and had a stick through it she let it down it was the kind of hair that would make a man wonder what it would look like spread out over a pillow she says it was coming in gray homer do you see any gray and she spread it with her fingers so the sun could shine on it nom i says she looks at me her eyes all asparkle and she says your wife is a good woman homer buckland but she has seen me in the store and in the post office and weve passed the odd word or two and i have seen her looking at my hair in a kind of satisfied way that only women know i know what she says and what she tells her friendsthat ophelia todd has started dyeing her hair but i have not i have lost my way looking for a shortcut more than oncelost my wayand lost my gray and she laughed not like a college girl but like a girl in high school i admired her and longed for her beauty but i seen that other beauty in her face as well just thenand i felt afraid again afraid for her and afraid of her missus i says you stand to lose more than a little stach in your hair no she says i tell you i am different over there i am all myself over there when i am going along that road in my little car i am not ophelia todd worth todds wife who could never carry a child to term or that woman who tried to write poetry and failed at it or the woman who sits and takes notes in committee meetings or anything or anyone else when i am on that road i am in the heart of myself and i feel like diana i said she looked at me kind of funny and kind of surprised and then she laughed o like some goddess i suppose she said she will do better than most because i am a night personi love to stay up until my book is done or until the national anthem comes on the tv and because i am very pale like the moonworth is always saying i need a tonic or blood tests or some sort of similar bosh but in her heart what every woman wants to be is some kind of goddess i thinkmen pick up a ruined echo of that thought and try to put them on pedestals a woman who will pee down her own leg if she does not squat its funny when you stop to think of itbut what a man senses is not what a woman wants a woman wants to be in the clear is all to stand if she will or walk her eyes turned toward that little godevil in the driveway and narrowed then she smiled or to drive homer a man will not see that he thinks a goddess wants to loll on a slope somewhere on the foothills of olympus and eat fruit but there is no god or goddess in that all a woman wants is what a man wantsa woman wants to drive be careful where you drive missus is all i says and she laughs and give me a kiss spang in the middle of the forehead she says i will homer but it didnt mean nothing and i known it because she said it like a man who says hell be careful to his wife or his girl when he knows he wontcant i went back to my truck and waved to her once and it was a week later that worth reported her missing her and that godevil both todd waited seven years and had her declared legally dead and then he waited another year for good measureill give the sucker that muchand then he married the second missus todd the one that just went by and i dont expect youll believe a single damn word of the whole yarn in the sky one of those big flatbottomed clouds moved enough to disclose the ghost of the moonhalffull and pale as milk and something in my heart leaped up at the sight half in fright half in love i do though i said every frigging damned word and even if it aint true homer it ought to be he give me a hug around the neck with his forearm which is all men can do since the world dont let them kiss but only women and laughed and got up even if it shouldnt ought to be it is he said he got his watch out of his pants and looked at it i got to go down the road and check on the scott place you want to come i believe ill sit here for a while i said and think he went to the steps then turned back and looked at me halfsmiling i believe she was right he said she was different along those roads she foundwasnt nothing that would dare touch her you or me maybe but not her and i believe shes young then he got in his truck and set off to check the scott place that was two years ago and homer has since gone to vermont as i think i told you one night he come over to see me his hair was combed he had a shave and he smelled of some nice lotion his face was clear and his eyes were alive that night he looked sixty instead of seventy and i was glad for him and i envied him and i hated him a little too arthritis is one buggardly great old fisherman and that night homer didnt look like arthritis had any fishhooks sunk into his hands the way they were sunk into mine im going he said ayuh ayuh all right did you see to forwarding your mail dont want none forwarded he said my bills are paid i am going to make a clean break well give me your address ill drop you a line from one time to the another old hoss already i could feel loneliness settling over me like a cloakand looking at him i knew that things were not quite what they seemed dont have none yet he said all right i said is it vermont homer well he said itll do for people who want to know i almost didnt say it and then i did what does she look like now like diana he said but she is kinder i envy you homer i said and i did i stood at the door it was twilight in that deep part of summer when the fields fill with perfume and queen annes lace a full moon was beating a silver track across the lake he went across my porch and down the steps a car was standing on the soft shoulder of the road its engine idling heavy the way the old ones do that still run full bore straight ahead and damn the torpedoes now that i think of it that car looked like a torpedo it looked beat up some but as if it could go the ton without breathin hard he stopped at the foot of my steps and picked something upit was his gas can the big one that holds ten gallons he went down my walk to the passenger side of the car she leaned over and opened the door the inside light came on and just for a moment i saw her long red hair around her face her forehead shining like a lamp shining like the moon he got in and she drove away i stood out on my porch and watched the taillights of her little godevil twinkling red in the darkgetting smaller and smaller they were like embers then they were like flickerflies and then they were gone vermont i tell the folks from town and vermont they believe because its as far as most of them can see inside their heads sometimes i almost believe it myself mostly when im tired and done up other times i think about them thoughall this october i have done so it seems because october is the time when men think mostly about far places and the roads which might get them there i sit on the bench in front of bells market and think about homer buckland and about the beautiful girl who leaned over to open his door when he come down that path with the full red gasoline can in his right handshe looked like a girl of no more than sixteen a girl on her learners permit and her beauty was terrible but i believe it would no longer kill the man it turned itself on for a moment her eyes lit on me i was not killed although part of me died at her feet olympus must be a glory to the eyes and the heart and there are those who crave it and those who find a clear way to it mayhap but i know castle rock like the back of my hand and i could never leave it for no shortcuts where the roads may go in october the sky over the lake is no glory but it is passing fair with those big white clouds that move so slow i sit here on the bench and think about phelia todd and homer buckland and i dont necessarily wish i was where they arebut i still wish i was a smoking man the ontological factor david barr kirtley has published fiction in magazines such as realms of fantasy weird tales lightspeed

to drive up to his house in providence and make an inventory of his property and i was the natural choice after all my recent bachelors degree in philosophy and east asian studies had done nothing to secure me regular employment and id had to move back in with my parents where id thrown myself into an ambitious project to create the worlds longestrunning manga comic about a flying mushroom who quotes hegel cornelius had had some sort of falling out with the rest of the family years before i was born over some possibly imagined slight hed lived alone in a mansion hed inherited from his mother i wasnt crazy about being by myself in a giant old house for years id suffered from an odd disconnected feeling as if nothing was real including myself and this caused me constant lowlevel anxiety as well as the occasional panic attack the distress inevitably intensified the longer i spent alone i had not mentioned this to anyone i told my dad i dont know if im really the best person to be going through his things i never even met the guy just do your best dad said everyone else is busy ill try to come and help out if i can so reluctantly i agreed i arrived in the late afternoon the house was gray victorian sprawled across the top of a low forested hill the central section was three stories tall and additional twostory wings spread out in either direction i drove up the gravel drive then pulled to a stop near the front door and got out dark clouds filled the sky and as i approached the house a cool breeze rose rustling the dry leaves that littered its porch i jogged up the front steps and let myself in with the key id been given the place was musty and dim with papers piled everywhere i wandered through room after room of tables and sofas and bookshelves pausing by a window i looked out into the backyard where a gazebo overgrown with weeds huddled beside a scumcovered pond i made my way into the kitchen the sinks and countertops were cluttered with dirty dishes and the cupboards revealed that the owners diet had consisted mostly of coffee and cold cereal so far this was about what id expected my first surprise came when i stepped into a parlor off the main corridor there was a door there a very strange door it was built into the far wall and painted bright green a revolting neon shade that clashed with the subdued hues of the rest of the house the door was quite smallid have to stoop to pass through itand extremely crooked though this seemed intentional and unlike the rest of the place this door looked new and clean and i suspected it was something cornelius had added himself strangest of all it was locked with no less than four heavy padlocks i stepped closer studying the locks i had only the one key and it obviously didnt fit any of them id have to come back later and see if i could spring them with my tools among my many odd and useless skills was picking locks at which i had always been uncannily talented i began gathering up all the loose papers and sorting them into piles on the dining room table there were the usual bills ads catalogs etc but also strange notebooks dozens of them full of puzzling diagrams and nearillegible scribbling though certain wordsportal opener worldjumped out at me i was so absorbed in the task that i didnt notice anyone enter the dining room but suddenly a voice at my elbow barked who are you i started violently and turned in the corner stood a large burly woman who was maybe in her midforties she wore a knapsack and her outfit looked like a cross between a sweatsuit and a uniform i im steven i said corneliushe was my great uncle whos cornelius she said he owns this place i mean he did when shed first spoken id thought she must be a friend of corneliusthough by all accounts he hadnt had any now i wondered if she might be a burglarshe was sort of dressed like onebut she spoke with such casual authority that i doubted this was the case at least i wasnt about to ask she studied me and i noticed that her irises were an odd golden color also i could swear that her skin had a faint bluish tinge to itlike something not of this world and it was as if shed just appeared out of thin air all right steve she said you seem harmless enough carry on but stay out of the east wing if you know whats good for you she turned as if to depart though she was standing in the corner wait i said who are you asha she called over her shoulder nice to meet you a dozen questions swirled in my mind but i sensed that id only get a chance to ask one and that one the most important rose to my lips wait i called softly areare you real ha thats a good one am i real she said as she walked straight through a solid wall and disappeared so obviously i was freaked out but what could i do run home and tell my parents that id been chased off by a ghost no thanks instead i turned on as many lights as i could and positioned myself on a couch in the center of one of the larger rooms where nothing could sneak up on me and played movies on my laptop to keep the silence at bay finally i passed out from sheer exhaustion when i woke it was morning and everything seemed more manageable as i wandered the empty house i was already half convinced that my encounter with asha had just been something id dreamed during the night still i avoided the east wing what i needed right then i decided was some sort of challenge to occupy my mind and the padlocks on the green door seemed just the thing id become increasingly intrigued by the door because as near as i could tell it couldnt possibly lead anywhere the layout of the surrounding rooms was like a maze but i was pretty sure id seen the far side of that wall and there was nothing there but blank plaster i pulled up a chair before the door and sat down wielding my tools the work went quickly the locks giving way one after another i placed each one on the floor at my feet then reached forward and pushed at the door which swung aside a rush of humid air hit me redolent with swamp smells of marsh grass and mud beyond the door lay a livid green sky above rolling hills dotted with forests and ponds in a daze i rose to my feet and strode forward my bare feet sinking into the surprisingly spongy earth another world i thought staring in wonder it was actually there actually real i glanced back over my shoulder from this side the green door was built into the wall of a small tower made of rough granite bricks through the door i could see back into the parlor of corneliuss mansion i wandered down the hill into the field below there was a small lake there its waters murky and brown and below the surface i could just make out the wavering suggestion of glimmering lights then a balmy breeze blew by and i heard voices on the air crouching in the underbrush i peered through a screen of trees a line of blackrobed men were making their way up the hill there were twenty of them and they wore hoods and chanted and some bore a palanquin upon which sat an ebony idol some sort of frogheaded deity on a gnarled throne it was a distinctly sinister tableau and i was in no hurry to join the parade now that my initial wonder was subsiding i had second thoughts about the wisdom of wandering barefoot and alone through an unknown world i turned to beat a hasty retreat and almost ran right into a strange woman who was crawling up the beach toward me she was thin and bony and had come from the water which dotted her pale flesh and her thin green hair was plastered back across her oddly elongated scalp when she was just a few feet away she cocked her head at me staring up with bulbous eyes and smiling faintly as if she were expecting a treat i backed away and suddenly she grinned the corners of her mouth stretching three times as wide as i wouldve thought possible her teeth were like a piranhas then she screamed a banshee wail a piercing shriek that went on and on i glanced behind me through the trees the blackrobed men were turning my way now and throwing back their hoods their faces were like hers and from beneath their robes they drew short staffs topped with tridents i edged around the womanher still screaming still eager and staringand sprinted back toward the tower and the green door i was out of breath and staggering by the time i was halfway up the hill and then i stumbled on that strangely pliant ground and fell to my hands and knees and the creatures swarmed about me capering and gibbering thrusting at me with their tridents i threw my arms over my face and curled into a ball how could i have been so stupid maybe freud had been right about the death drive that we all subconsciously seek our own destruction the weapons struck my shoulders my back my legs it took a moment before i realized that the pain was minimal as if they were children poking me with sticks i was not bleeding not harmed i opened one eye and a fishman roared into my face with his daggertoothed mouth instinctively i lashed out and when i struck his head it burst like an overinflated balloon splattering me with gore i dragged myself to my feet as the rest of the fishmen fled i had absolutely no idea what was going on i made it back to the tower passed through the green door and slammed it behind me as i snapped the locks shut one by one i swore that i would never ever ever go opening any mysterious doors ever again breathing a sigh of relief i turned around asha stood there frowning i screamed she seized me by the arm and growled come with me wwhere are we going i said as she dragged me through the halls but she didnt answer i said there were creatures in there they attacked me well what do you expect from a bunch of twos she muttered i had no idea what to make of that she escorted me into the west wing of the house into a section i hadnt really explored yet and marched me into a large bedroom built into the corner was another of those strange doors this one bright orange rather than bright green and tilted to the right rather than the left but otherwise identical to the otherright down to the four heavy padlocks i need you to open this asha said as we crossed the room i wasnt at all sure that was a good idea i pointed weakly at the locks uh my tools are back she reached out with her bare hands and ripped apart the locks as if they were made of cotton candy then she turned to face me open it she ordered now so what could i do with a trembling hand i gave the door a small push and it swung back with a creak revealing yet another alien worlddry rolling scrub plains beneath a dusty orange sky asha beamed excellent puzzled i said why couldnt you just open it yourself because im not an opener she said you are hard as that is to believe opener i thought she added quickly and now steve my boy theres something else i need you to do for me i need you to go through this door and find me a weapon a gun would be my first choice of course but any sort of weapon will doa sword an axe anything like that she reached into her knapsack and pulled out a revolver which she handed to me or even just some bullets if theyll work with this the gun felt amazingly heavy in my hand i said why do you need a weapon she scowled look theres no time to waste okay just do it trust me on this its important somehow maybe because i was still high on adrenaline from my encounter with the fishmen i found the guts to say no kid she growled fixing me with an intense glare you have no idea whats at stake here then tell me i said tell me whats going on but im not going to go marching off and bring back a weapon just because you say so for a moment asha looked so frustrated that i thought she might tear me apart the way she had the locks finally she sighed all right fine ill explain she snatched the gun from me and tossed it in her knapsack follow me i tagged along behind her as she led the way back toward the other end of the house okay she said as we went you know that there are different worlds and that its possible to open portals between them the first thing you have to understand is that not all worlds are created equal some are more real than others i chimed in but whos to say whats real and what isnt oh she said we use this she reached into the knapsack and pulled out a device that looked like a blackandpurplestriped candy cane its called an ometer each world and everything native to it has a specific ontological factor or of which is what the machine measures here ill show you she pointed the device at me and sections of it lit up in sequence until about half its length was glowing see she said youre a five oh i said is that good no she said oh but hey it could be worse like those degenerates you ran into earlier twos total figments not real enough to do any damage even to you so thats why id survived the attack of the fishmen i thought that made sense sort of what number are you i asked ten she said obviously after a moment i added at first i thought you were a ghost kid theres no such thing as ghosts but you walked right through a wall so yeah but it was just a five wall i frowned we were silent for a while she eyed me whats the matter you seem nonplussed i dont know i said i dont like this some of the greatest minds in history have grappled with the question of whats real and what isnt and how do we know and its something thats bothered me for a long time too and then to have someone come along and say its just a number that you can measure on a machine is that whats bothering you she said kid forget that crap weve got bigger problems much bigger what do you mean we were in the east wing of the house now we entered a large libraryhardwood floors overstuffed chairs a fireplace and of course built into the far wall was another of those small crooked doors this one bright purple asha nodded at it thats the one that killed him who i said your great uncle whats his name cornelius creating a portal is hard on anyone let alone a five he mustve been pretty desperate to get out of this craphole world cant say i blame him i stared at the purple door unlike the other two it wasnt locked he did hate it here i said unfortunately for him asha went on his first two attempts led to culdesac worlds and i guess that wasnt good enough for him this one here is different it leads to a world thats connected to half a dozen others you can get anywhere from here so whats the problem i said the problem she said pointedly is abraxas whats abraxas not whatwho abraxas is a type of being we call a demonsomeone who can soak up the reality of other people and absorb it into himself thats illegal of course and most demons refrain from using their ability but every once in a while you get a bad one and abraxas is one of the worst i see i said hes like the embodiment of nietzsches will to power she stared at me levelly for a moment then continued as if i hadnt spoken i caught up with him a few days ago here on this world im a sort ofbounty hunter you might say unfortunately abraxas is one sneaky bastard he gave me the slip and made off with a bunch of my gear to boot including my skeleton key without it i cant open portals i also used up all my bullets firing at him as he fled she sighed so here i am these portals that your great uncle created are the only ones on this world that are traversable at the moment and two of them as i said are dead ends she glanced over her shoulder at the purple door abraxas has to get through this one and if he doesif he gets awaythen we cant restore the stolen reality to the dozens of worlds including yours that hes pillaged which leaves all of you at greater risk of crossworld invasion i stood in stunned silence and she added grimly if someone doesnt lock him up soon one of these days hell have absorbed enough reality to put him beyond contention even by us tens and then therell be no stopping him ever so thats abraxas and he could be showing up here at any minute and ill have to fight him nowshe held up her massive handsthese hands are formidable things but nevertheless given the circumstances i really wouldnt mind having a weapon you know what i mean you getting the picture yes i said meekly this world is a five she said so nothing around here is real enough to harm him at all but behind the orange door is a world thats an eight not the best but a weapon from there should be enough to knock him for a loop id say i cant go myself because i have to stay and guard this door thats where you come in she looked me in the eye and said so thats the story now steve im asking you will you help me please my mind was made up okay i said ill do it terrific asha exclaimed finally all right lets get you prepped for a little crossworld travel first of allshe reached into her knapsack produced a bottle of pills and a canteen and handed them to metake some of these actually better take them all i opened the bottle and studied the pills which were small and dark and soft like caviar i tossed them in my mouth took a gulp from the canteen and swallowed what are they brain worms she said i froze she caught my expression and added quickly oh but not bad brain worms good brain worms they know most of the languages that are spoken across the worlds and pretty soon you will too oh i said uncertainly she passed me the knapsack take this too its got pretty much everything a crossworld traveler might need theres silver in the side pocket silver i said right it makes a good universal currency it gets traded around quite a lot actually so any silver you come across has a fair chance of having a higher of than ambient materials doesnt this world have any legends about invincible monsters that can only be harmed by silver yeah i said she nodded most worlds do now you know why she frowned unfortunately i have yet to come across anything on this piece of crap world with a high of i was getting a little irked by her attitude i mean i had mixed feelings about this world myself but it was my home on the other hand maybe the place she came from really was a whole lot better certainly what little id seen of a world with an of of two tended to bear out her prejudices that reminded me what if i get attacked again i said she blanched yeah thats an issue for sure be careful with yourself theyre eights and youre a five so theyre basically untouchable as far as youre concerned but i dont expect youll have any problems eights tend to be pretty civilized youll see i shouldered the pack all right is that everything yup she said thanks for doing this kid i really appreciate it see you soon okay okay i said and departed the library making my way toward the orange door i stepped out into a hot dry day and looked around on this side the door was built into a white brick wall that was about as tall as i was and that hugged the contours of the rolling hills for as far as i could see in either direction in the valley below a perfectly straight road ran from the horizon to a city of gleaming spires a few miles away i took a deep breath adjusted my pack and started down the hill toward the road hopefully i thought my sophomore effort at crossworld travel would turn out more auspiciously than my first though i was a lot more prepared this time around i had shoes for one thing and a pack full of food and water and money i also had a gun though it was empty most importantly i had a rough idea of what was going on i also had worms in my brain good worms yeah on the other hand this world was an eight and i was a mere five i stomped on the ground experimentally i supposed that it did feel a bit more substantial than usual and the colors around me did look more vibrant and saturated especially the looming orange sky after an hour i reached the road which was a hundred feet across and made of a smooth white substance that showed virtually no wear i set off toward the city a bit later i heard a distant humming sound and raised my head something was speeding down the road toward me and throwing up clouds of dust as it came it was white and seemed to float above the ground as it neared i saw that it looked almost exactly like a giant flying egg it came to a halt beside me then spoke in a low soothing voice the language was unfamiliar but i realized that i could indeed understand it it said greetings pilgrim may i conduct you to the city um okay i replied in that same language the eggs top half unfolded like a blooming flower revealing a cushioned red seat within welcome aboard i climbed a short set of steps and settled into the chair the dome reformed itself above methe vehicle resuming its egglike shapeand we accelerated toward the city from inside the things walls were transparent and i watched as the ground sped by beneath us and the city drew ever nearer we flew through an enormous gate and came to a halt in a white plaza beside a giant fountain the vehicle opened and let me out then sped away back to wherever flying eggs go there were people all around me they were varied in appearance but were all apparently human and most were dressed in white their garments simple and clean i felt a little conspicuous standing there in my street clothes which were still a bit spattered with fishman but no one seemed to pay me any attention as they strolled about chatting and laughing i wandered down a broad avenue toward the city center keeping an eye out for any sort of weapon having no knowledge of local customs i was a bit reluctant to just come right out and ask where i could buy a gun i kept hoping to see a big sign with a sword or machinegun on it but no such luck i passed a park the grass there had been shaped into a triangular field upon which children played a sport involving a cubeshaped ball and sticks that looked like a cross between a golf club and a cricket bat i paused for a moment to watch on a bench beside me sat a man who was watching the game he said dhajat season is always my favorite time of year he was an older fellow with a placid face and a long white beard and he held a glass of what looked like lemonade uh yeah mine too i said hoping that was an appropriate response he gave me a friendly smile what brings you to the city pilgrim um im looking for something i said he nodded sagely were all looking for something oh i said right should i chance it oh what the hell he seemed as friendly and talkative as anyone i was likely to meet i added but um actually im looking for something kind of specific truth he said enlightenment i was like you once dont worry youll find it no i said more like um a gun he chortled ha thats a good one i waited for him to elaborate but he didnt he was back to watching the game i said or a sword i mean any sort of weapon really slowly he turned to face me you arejoking um i said you came here to shop for weapons he laughed uproariously tourists he declared wiping tears from his eyes dont you know where you are no one would ever dream of bringing a weapon within a hundred miles of nervuh nah city of peace i started to get a sinking feeling i turned away things were definitely not looking good there were no weapons here no weapons anywhere near this whole city my mission was a complete failure there was nothing i could do to help stop abraxas and now hed probably escape through the purple door leaving earth forever in a state of crippled ontological peril also asha was going to be really pissed off then i had an idea asha eyed my offering with disbelief and what exactly she declared is that a dhajat bat i said and just what am i supposed to do with that um play dhajat i said but she put her face in her hands and shook her head kid she moaned is there something about the concept of a weapon that youre not getting its not my fault i said it was like a whole city of pacifists there were no weapons anywhere i just thought all right all right she interrupted give it here i passed her the bat and she took a few practice swings she sighed well its better than nothing i guess but i wish you wouldve she stopped suddenly what i said she whispered hes here she nodded at the fireplace get over there stay out of this i hurried to comply a short time later i heard footsteps approaching asha hefted the bat my dad walked into the room wait i cried as asha rushed him i lunged to interpose myself between them waving my arms its okay its my dad then i noticed that my dad was grinning in a very sinister very undadlike way and he was holding somethinga snow globe steve asha roared shoving me aside get out of the way its my dad hurled the globe to the floor at ashas feet then it was like i was staring into the sun i flew through the air i came to moments later draped across one of the overstuffed chairs which had been knocked to the floor apparently by me and i hurt everywhere i raised my head to try to see what was going on asha lay sprawled on the floor whatever that glass ball weapon had been shed absorbed the brunt of it and seemed to be out cold the dhajat bat had flown from her grasp and landed in the corner where a tall thin figure was bending over to retrieve it he didnt look at all like my dad now he wore a brown trenchcoat and fedora and the hat cast impossibly deep shadows over his face but i could make out hints of gaunt skeletal cheeks and a heavy jaw lined with jagged teeth he gripped the bat and straightened turning toward asha no i cried stumbling to my feet i snatched up a heavy ceramic ashtray and threw it at him but when it struck him it bounced off as if it were made of styrofoam and he paid no attention i felt a flood of despair the only object in the room with enough reality to affect him was the bat and wait i thought ashas knapsack her gun if it had come from her world it must have an of of ten like her i tore open the pack and yanked out the gun abraxas stood over asha and raised the bat to strike with a cry i hurled the gun at him as hard as i could it hit him in the back of the head and his hat went flying ow he screamed then he turned to regard me and his face was even more frightening than id imagined his eyes were black sockets within which green ghostfires blazed i fled in a mad panic sprinting out the door and into the hall as i rounded the corner abraxas stepped out through the wall right in front of me he smiled and i backed away cringing and stumbling as i retreated past the library door i noticed that ashas body was gone where suddenly two hands reached out through the wall seized abraxas by the shoulders and yanked him sideways he gaspedand the bat fell from his fingersas he was dragged back through the wall i moved to the door and watched as asha raised him above her head and then she spun him around and piledrove him into the floor which exploded like itd been hit by a meteor i ducked behind the wall as bits of flooring and foundation rained all about the room when i peeked in again i saw that the center of the library was now a giant crater and at its base were asha and abraxas he was on his knees and she had him in a chokehold i scooped up the dhajat bat and hurried forward as i neared abraxas slumped the fires that were his eyes dwindled to the size of candle flames then went out and asha yanked his arms behind his back and bound his wrists with glowing cuffs then she stood looking immensely pleased with herself ha she declared clapping her hands and raising them before her what did i tell you kid these hands are formidable things i let out a deep breath and lowered the bat thought he was pretty clever asha said using my own stunbulbs against me good thing i had them all rigged for onequarter powerjust in case someone ever grabbed one and tried to use it on me she prodded him with her toe and said guess youre not the only sneaky one around here eh smart guy she turned back to me and added still i dont know if i wouldve been able to get the drop on him if you hadnt distracted him that was real good thinking wow thanks asha i of course she said you did almost get me killed by jumping between us like that oh i said glumly yeah she waved a hand but dont worry about it that was my fault i shouldve warned you about his disguises no overall you did pretty great id say she added for a five i mean i grinned so what happens now i asked a few weeks later all the preparations had been made for my extended vacation a cab dropped me off in front of corneliuss mansion and i made my way through the house to the library which had been repaired with some help from ashas offworld friendswithout anyone around here being the wiser asha stood waiting beside the purple door you all set she asked me yup i said as i crossed the room in my backpack was food water and silver as well as a handgun that asha had provided loaded with often bullets she gestured to the door you want to do the honors i smiled and stepped forward and gave the door a push and it swung aside to reveal a night sky full of massed purple clouds and circling flocks of longnecked birds and below that soaring peaks beside plunging chasms and on every precipice a fortress whose windows blazed with yellow light like jackolanterns the night air that blew in past us was pleasantly brisk and smelled of rich earth and sweet flowers i paused to admire the view even if this world was only a six lets get a move on asha said as she stepped through the door no time to waste gawking at secondrate realities weve got a full itinerary ahead of us nines and tens all the way i took one last look around the library at my home world in all its modest fiveness then moved to follow her come on kid she told me let me show you what a real world looks

annabehls is set in the same universe as his story snatch me another which can be read at online magazine abyss apex dear annabehl im concerned about the inordinate amount of time that my yearold son jeff spends with himself a boy his age should be out and about playing with friends participating in sports and other afterschool activities i come from a very traditional family and i have to confess that im concerned that this behavior suggests that jeff may be gay my husband thinks im overreacting what do you think concerned tuscaloosa mom dear concerned generally a boy jeffs age spending time with himself is perfectly normal the question i would pose is how many of his selves does he spend time with attachment to any particular self might prove to be unhealthy if your sons behavior persists for more than a few weeks you need to revoke his snatcher privileges and take him in for some psiprobing if its of any comfort this sounds more like classic narcissism than homosexuality however should your son be gay you need to learn to love him for who he is alternatively search for a heterosexual replacement i recommend that you swallow two validums and pick up the recently published bonds between multiple mes by dr gregory byars for an excellent discussion of this subject dear annabehl im going through the most difficult period of my life i caught my husband robbie cheating on me the thing is hes cheating on mewith me he insists that as long as the person hes sleeping with is me he isnt technically cheating thats bs i say that he exchanged his vows with me not with skinnier stringyhaired slutty versions of me hes being immoral and unfaithful isnt he annabehl i just dont get it what does he see in other mes that he doesnt see in me im hurt lonely and frustrated doramemphis tn dear dora take a deep breath and a xantax dear its all a matter of perspective that robbie chooses to spend his time away from you with you is actually quite romantic in fact one might say hes exceedingly faithful and truly devoted you should be flattered as heck what strikes me as odd is that while robbie is off enjoying you youre lonely and frustrated get up off your derriere girl and kwitcherwhining you should be spending time with other robbies youll find that doing so will strengthen your marriage and make both of you much happier in the long run dear annabehl we lost our son tommy to an inoperable brain tumor just a few days before his sixth birthday my wife got it into her head that we should go forward with the birthday party with another version of tommy as a way to say our final goodbyes we set the snatcher to a highend frequency and nabbed another tommy who was none the wiser about his displacement well you guessed it the birthday party came and went and now tommy is still with us what about tommys real parents they must be going through hell and what about our tommy doesnt he deserve to be mourned whenever i raise this issue with my wife she gets angry and changes the subject she pretends that nothing ever happened i know i should love the new tommy but all i feel is numb what should i do lpchicago illinois dear lp i strongly recommend professional psiprobing so you can learn to accept tommys variant as part of your family your emotional confusion is understandable sweetie many people who suffer a loss like yours find it difficult to accept a replacement but your wife is behaving no differently than any mother would in her situation be sure to have tommy routinely checked for the condition that caused his initial passing it may become necessary to get yourselves another replacement good luck to you dear annabehl my mom and dad are fairly wellconnected as a result we have government authorization for total access to billions of snatcher frequencies my familys been on the move ever since the first snatcher prototype was developed weve skipped into all sorts of psychedelic realities including a blackandwhite dimension at a highend frequency where we were the only colored people in the world my parents who think theyre cool thought it would be educational for us to experience firsthand the prejudices faced by minorities well we were treated like friggin circus freaks but most of the time the differences were so subtle that i couldnt even tell wed skipped ive met a boy i really like who lives down the block from us so i want to stay here im not even sure if this is the reality we originally came from but its close enough i guess why do my parents insist on skipping around apart from having a new boyfriend here ive made other friends too and its hard to make friends every time i skip sometimes the same people are slightly off in a new reality and not as likeable i hate what the snatcher has done to my life my parents just dont understand elinorhouston tx dear elinor i suspect you may no longer be around to read this but in case some other you or others like you need advice on this subject i say inject some soft hemomusic take a long drag on a joint and relax honey the important thing is to speak to your parents and keep the lines of communication open if they refuse to take your feelings into account speak to a stream of variants until you find a set of parents who care enough about your feelings to listen and to lay down roots here instead of condemning the snatcher shame on you why dont you use it to help solve your problems dear annabehl my sister betty is having a crisis of faith before the breach war began variants of so many faiths skipped through our transborder that she wonders now whether our beliefs are any more true than the beliefs of other versions of us yesterday a bald variant of betty showed up and proclaimed her jesus christa cleanshaven christ with a buzz cutthe one true son of god she ridiculed our own bearded jesus and called him a slovenly hippie imposter ever since then betty has stopped going to church and has fallen into a deep depression she keeps asking about the nearinfinite number of souls that populate the transdimensional slate and why god if he exists would have created them to believe in so many different faiths what can i do to help her chastitypomfret conn dear chas ive consulted with spokesman father joseph e demichael about the catholic churchs position on this subject church doctrine he explained teaches us that the variants who refuse to believe in the true bearded jesusnot other bizarre jesii with different haircuts and wardrobesare doomed to eternal damnation in fact many church scholars believe that the very reason god allowed us to invent the snatcher is so we can seek out our variants and enlighten them about the one true god so whatever else happens at least our souls are safe dear pass it along tell betty to pour herself a tall glass of cabernet and relax dear annabehl im stationed at the frontlines near the great wall of china where the breach is at its worst the hordes continue to battle their way through weve been fighting hard to repel these forces and this week alone ive lost six friends and three versions of their replacements the otherdimensional armies grow more freakish every day some are barely humanoid in fact we dont know whats coming through next annabehl i have to confess im afraid im writing to ask your readers for their prayers and support any etransmissions they could send our way would provide a tremendous lift neural books and moviesand especially hemomusicwould be greatly appreciated as well thank you private sandy ripple special global forces all readers attention every citizen of this plane should applaud the heroism and selfsacrifice of our brave young troops thank you thank you thank you for defending the transborders from that wave of lowerdimensional scum private ripple while those of us who have not done a tour of duty cannot possibly understand the horrors you and your compatriots have faced we all extend our love and support readers please send your letters and donations to dear annabehl and we will arrange to forward them to the troops dont let our soldiers down yes theyre replaceable but remember so are the invaders this is why there appears to be no end in sight to this war support our troops dear annabehl maybe im oldfashioned but your advice to lp from chicago struck me as amazingly insensitive he had just lost his son to a brain tumor and his wife used their snatcher to abduct a variant from a nearby dimension of course he felt numb he never had a chance to grieve worse what about the parents of the variant they kidnapped they must be devastated by his disappearance this whole world is turning to crap what were you thinking annabehl an oldtimertopeka ks dear oldtimer i stand by my advice gramps there was simply no need for lp to grieve when a replacement was so easily accessible grieving is dead death is dead i did recommend psiprobing however so he could learn to accept his new son who is an innocent in all this after all as for the transdimensional parents who lost their child you seem to forget that they too can use their snatcher to find themselves a replacement so search for that antique bong in the back of your dusty closet old man and inhale deeply get with the times dear readers i am pleased that we are once again able to bring you my dear annabehl column after our long absence its been a difficult six months todays column is dedicated to all the courageous soldiers and their replacements who gave their lives at the breach i understand that theres still a great deal of confusion some pessimists might even call it chaos with the ardiente administration taking over although the ardiente underlords do have a pseudodemonic appearance dont let their horns and red tails throw you as theyve pointed out theyre broadminded traditionalists a godfearing saltoftheearthtype of people most importantly they have promised to rule benignly and to deregulate snatchers to allow total access into and out of our reality to people everywhere freedom is precious after all there will be a period of adjustment before things get back to normal but trust me readers they will keep working hard and have faith there is a reason for everything youll see this will all turn out for the best dear annabehl with the new government taking over and total access now fully in effect ive decided that its time for me and my family to take our leave from this reality my wife is reluctant to leave her friends behind but i keep telling her that we can relocate just a few frequencies away where she can have the same friends more or less meanwhile other mes are flooding in at an unprecedented rate mes with blue skin mes with mammary glands mes with really bad haircuts and mes indistinguishable from me in every objectively discernable way except every now and then one of me will smile in a dark sly way that gives me chills there isnt room in my house for all of mes and theres only one job for one of me they wont tell me but i think theyre all running from something something truly terrible in their own realities whatever it is im afraid that it may be coming how can i convince my wife to leave i think its time for everyone to escape across the transborder i know a lot of people who have made the same decision maybe ill find another world one where snatchers were never invented but how can i skip through unless it has a snatcher portal entrance do you have any advice on whether we should leave packed but notquiteready to gobiloxi mississippi dear packed this is annabehl filling in for annabehl annabehl persona prime has moved on to a higher plane and left this column in my lucky hands i consider it an honor to be stepping into her shoes figuratively and literally forgive me if it takes a bit of time to get up to speed in my reality i stripped for a living and doled out advice at the bar during breaks so this is quite a step up for me freedom is a precious wonderful gift go wherever you think youll be happy by all means cross the transborder take an acid trip do whatever were free dear annabehls while at work last week i dialed into my bank and discovered that all of my accounts had been emptied by the time i got home all of my clothes and other personal belongings were also gone its apparent that one of my variants has gone too far this time annabehl ive decided to commence legal action against my self and have retained an attorney whos agreed to take the case on a contingency basis my friends insist that litigation against ones self is just a waste of time and money i disagree part of the reason why the world economy is on the verge of collapse is because of the actions of a few variants like this one what do you think should i fight for my rights or should i do as my friends suggest and just let this go estebanbronx new york dear esteban have you ever heard of a little item called a snatcher step through it and retrieve your items upfrequency for goodness sake then snort a little elcitron and relax annabehl dear esteban annabehl is offbase on this one two wrongs dont make a right pursue your remedies the way all patriots do through litigation then snort a little elcitron and relax annabehl dear esteban ive consulted a legal expert who points out that service of process can be tricky in transdimensional litigation also the law is still unclear on whether our courts even have jurisdiction over our variants no i have to agree with annabehl and disagree with annabehl on this one take a short trip upfrequency and exercise a little selfhelp then snort a little elcitron and relax annabehl dear annabehls congrats on the great job youre doing in place of annabehl who was miles better than annabehl who was leagues better than annabehl who was almost as good id say as annabehl heres my dilemma ive asked my cousin jojo persona prime and three of her variants to serve in my bridal party as maids of honor it turns out that jojo one of jojos variants is feuding with her mother my aunt josie since that jojo isnt from this reality aunt josie isnt her real mother mind you but jojo cant seem to get this through her thick skull she refuses to attend unless i replace aunt josie with a varianteven though aunt josie really is in effect a variant at least in relation to the complaining jojo aunt josie refuses to attend if her selves are invited my aunt and my mom are oldfashioned and insist on being the only versions of themselves at the wedding two of the other jojos insist however that i invite their actual mothers from their respective realitiesand refuse to participate in the bridal party unless i do so meanwhile sean my fianc√© has demanded multiple mes be present on my wedding night i guess im my mothers daughter because i have no desire to share the stage with anyone on my wedding nighteven me i want my wedding night to be a special oneonone experience between me me prime that is and sean sean prime that is what should i do about jojo jojo jojo jojo aunt josie and sean im too busy and stressed to deal with all of this i have wedding plans to make desperate dixiesan diego ca dear dixie we annabehls are unanimous on this one schedule a session at the snatcher asap replace the troublesome jojothe jojo who still carries that unseemly transdimensional grudge against her mother your aunt nonprime to her actually though that jojo refuses to acknowledge itwith another more agreeable version of jojo and good riddance carrying that type of transdimensional baggage really is childish and unacceptable talk to the two remaining jojos and explain to them that this is your special day that weddings are expensive and that you decide how many variants of your guests can attend if they dont like it zap get yourself two more replacements as for your fianc√©s desire to turn your wedding night into an orgy youll have to forgive me honey but you might want to zap yourself a variant who has a little more regard for your feelings after the wedding night he can indulge in whatever multipleyou shenanigans you and other consenting variants of you wish to engage but on the wedding night hes a pig finally to reduce the stress snatch another you out of the snatcher and delegate these wedding tasks to your self then mix yourself a margarita and head to the simbeach for some welldeserved rnr dear annabehls ive come to the depressing realization that my life is empty and truly truly meaningless over the past few years ive met variants of myself whove led fascinating lives one lived in a remote village in guatemala where he helped construct homes for the poor one skydived at sunset from a stealth copter into the grand canyons colorado river another made a point of scaling everest every autumn and making love to a beautiful woman on its snowy mountaintops when i think about my own life annabehl im struck by the safe choices ive made i spend my days focused on the tedium of an office job ive never really wanted caring for an elderly mother who doesnt even recognize me anymore living life just going through the motions i can see the remainder of my humdrum life stretched out in front of me only im trying to pretend that i dont see it annabehl because i know i dont have the ability to make any changes anyway and thinking about it just makes me feel more hopeless and impotent and what does it matter what i choose to do for every south american village ive never visited for every mountain peak ive never climbed another version of me is out there embarking on those adventures anyway nothing seems to matter anymore jacobsalt lake city utah dear jacob im not going to tell you to stop feeling sorry for yourself and im not going to tell you to get up off your keister and make some changes in your life why bother somewhere some variant of you is making those necessary changes you see essentially youre right whatever you decide to do really is meaningless but theres certainly nothing to be gained by being depressed about this fact either youre suffering from classic symptoms of variant inadequacy kiddo which is not at all uncommon to give yourself a better perspective you need to interact with some downfrequency variants who dont have it anywhere near as good as you heck nothing cheers a person up more quickly than studying the misery of his variants so pop open a beer visit the snatcher and just relax annabehl annabehl annabehl annabehl and annabehl concur with annabehls advice annabehl annabehl and annabehl dissent with the substance of the advice but concur in the recommendation of a beer annabehl abstains dear annabehls im afraid so afraid i can barely function i feel totally adrift as if nothing no one that i know is quite right its difficult to explain but sometimes i swear i dont recognize my children didnt i used to have a unidaughter named allison i have a memory a fading dreammemory of brushing her tangled blond hair the thing is i know no one has unidaughters certainly not me i have an adorable set of identical septuplet boys and while i know that this is my house why do i sometimes find myself stumbling into rooms i never even knew existed and my friends why do i forget their names sometimes i stare into the mirroreyes of our pet elphine and i dont even recognize my own reflection the diagonal rows of black eyes that speckle my face seem unfamiliar to me im afraid afraid that the walls between realities have finally crumbled and that im the only one who sees it wasnt the sky blue a long time ago i could swear that it used to be didnt we used to walk upright on two legs im lost annabehls i dont think i know who or what i am any more lost in newfoundland dear lost were sorry to say that theres only one reality dear and were stuck with it the sky has always been deep red weve always skittered on six legs and weve always come in sets of seven nine or thirteen its not unusual to sometimes feel out of place to feel cast adrift like a windblown ember in the eye of a black tornado everything around you changing while youre standing still weve felt that way ourselves sometimes do what we do lost buck up fly high on the fumes of ecsahol if necessary and relax the goat variations jeff vandermeer is a twotime winner of the world fantasy award whose stories have been published

book review and the washington post vandermeers latest novel just completed is annihilation it would have been hot humid in september in that city and the secret service would have gone in first before him to scan for hostile minds even though it was just a middle school in a county hed won in the elections far away from the fighting he would have emerged from the third black armored vehicle blinking and looking bewildered as he got his bearings in the sudden sunlight his aide and the personal bodyguards who had grown up protecting him would have surrounded him by his first step onto the asphalt of the driveway they would have entered the school through the front stopping under the sign for photos and a few words with the principal the television cameras recording it all from a safe distance he would already be thinking past the event to the next and how to prop up sagging public approval ratings due both to the conflict and what the press called his recent indecision which he knew was more analogous to sickness he would be thinking about or around the secret cavern beneath the pentagon and the pale almost grublike face of the adept in his tank he would already be thinking about the machine by the end of the photo op the sweat itches on his forehead burns sour in his mouth but he has to ignore it for the cameras hes turning a new word over and over in his mind learned from a czech diplomat ossuary a word that sounds free and soaring but just means a pile of skulls the latest satellite photos from the battlefield states of kansas nebraska and idaho make him think of the word the evangelicals have been eschewing godmissiles for more personal methods of vengeance even as they tie down federal armies in an endless guerilla war sometimes he feels like hes presiding over a pile of skulls the smile on his face has frozen into a rictus as he realizes theres something wrong with the sun theres a red dot in its center and its eating away at the yellow bringing a hint of green with it he can tell hes the only one who can see it can sense the pulsing nervous worry on the face of his aide he almost says ossuary aloud but then sunspots wandering across his eyes they are bringing him down a corridor to the classroom where he will meet with the students and tell them a story they walk past the open doors to the cafeteriarow on row of sagging wooden tables propped up by rusted metal legs he experiences a flare of anger why this school with the infrastructure crumbling away the overpowering stale smell of macaroniandcheese and meatloaf makes him nauseous all the while he engages in small talk with the entourage of teachers trailing in his wake almost all overweight middleaged women with circles under their eyes and sagging skin on their arms many of them are black he smiles into their shiny receptive faces and remembers the hired help in the mansion growing up some of his best friends were black until he took up politics for a second as he looks down marveling at their snouts and beaks and muzzles their smiles melt away and hes surrounded by a pack of animals his aide mutters to him through clenched teeth and two seconds later he realizes the words were stop staring at them so much there have always been times when meeting too many people at once has made him feel as if hes somewhere strange all the mannerisms and gesticulations and varying tones of voice shimmering into babble but its only lately that the features of peoples faces have changed into a menagerie if he looks at them too long theyd briefed him on the secret rooms and the possibility of the machine even before theyd given him the latest intel on chinas occupation of japan and taiwan only three hours into his presidency an armored car had taken him to the pentagon away from his wife and the beginnings of the inauguration party once there theyd entered a greenlit steel elevator that went down for so long he thought for a moment it was broken it was just him his aide a blackops commander who didnt give his name and a small haggard man who wore an old gray suit over a faded white dress shirt with no tie hed told his vice president to meet the press while he was gone even though he was now convinced the old man had dementia the elevators had opened to a rush of stale cool air like being under a mountain and beneath the dark green glow of overhead lamps he could see rows and rows of transparent bathtubshaped deprivation vats in each floated one dreaming adept skin wrinkled and robbed of color by the exposure to the chemicals that preserved and pacified them every shaven head was attached to wires and electrodes every mouth attached to a breathing tube catheters took care of waste the stale air soon faded as they walked silent down the rows replaced by a smell like turpentine mixed with honeysuckle sometimes the hands of the adepts twitched like cats hunting in their sleep a vast slow repeating sound registered in his awareness only after several minutes did he realize it was the sound of the adepts as they slowly moved in their vats creating a slow ripple of water repeated in thousands of other vats the room seemed to go on forever into the far distance of a horizon tinged at its extremity by a darkening that hinted of blood his sense of disgust revulsion grew as the little man ran out ahead of them navigated a path to a control center a hundred yards in and to the left made from a luminous blue glass set a story up and jutting out over the vats like some infernal crane and still he did not know what to say the atmosphere combined morgue cathedral and torture chamber he felt a compulsion if he spoke to whisper the briefing papers hed read on the ride over had told him just about everything for years adepts had been screened out at birth and depending on the secret orders peculiar to each administration either euthanized or imprisoned in remote overseas detention camps those that managed to escape detection until adulthood had no rights if caught not even the rights given to illegal immigrants the founding fathers had been very clear on that in the constitution he had always assumed that adults when caught were eliminated or sent to the camps radicals might call it the last reflexive act of a puritanical brutality that reached across centuries but most citizens despised the invasion of privacy an adept represented or were more worried about how the separatist evangelicals had turned the homeland into a nation of west and east coasts with no middle but now he knew where his predecessor had been storing the bodies he just didnt yet know why in the control center they showed him the images being mined from the depths of the adepts rem sleep they ranged from montages as incomprehensible as the experimental films hed seen in college to single shots of dead people to grassy hills littered with wildflowers ecstasy grief madness peace anything imaginable came through in the adepts endless sleep only ten people in the world know every aspect of this project and three of them are dead mr president the blackops commander told him down below he could see the little man bluetinted going from vat to vat checking readings we experimented until we found the right combination of drugs to augment their sight one particular formula culled from south american mushrooms mostly worked best suddenly we began to get more coherent and varied images very different from before he felt numb he had no sympathy for the men and women curled up in the vats below himan adepts grenade had killed his father in midcampaign a decade before launching his own reluctant career in politicsbut still he felt numb are any of them dangerous he asked the blackops commander theyre all dangerous mr president every last one when did this start with a secret order from your predecessor mr president before we just disappeared them or sent them to work camps in the alaskas why did he do it even then he would realize later a strange music was growing in his head a distant sound fast approaching he did it mr president or said he did it as a way of getting intel on the heartland separatists understandable if idiosyncratic the separatists and the fact that the federal armies had become bogged down in the heartland fighting them were the main reasons his predecessors party no longer controlled the executive judicial or legislative branches and no one had ever succeeded in placing a mole within evangelical ranks the scenes continued to cascade over the monitors in a rapidfire nonsenserhythm what do you do with the images theyre sent to a full team of experts for interpretation mr president these experts are not told where the images come from what do these adepts see that is so important the blackops commander grimaced at the tone of rebuke the future mr president its early days but we believe they see the future and have you gained much in the way of intel the blackops commander looked at his feet no not yet we havent and we dont know why the images are jumbled some might even be from our past or present but we have managed to figure out one thing which is why youve been brought here so quickly something will happen later this year in september something down below the little man had stopped his purposeful wandering he gazed as if mesmerized into one of the vats something cataclysmic mr president across the channels across all of the adepts its quite clear every adept has a different version of what that something is and we dont know exactly when but in september he had a thousand more questions but at that moment one of the militarys top scientific researchers entered the control room to show them the schematics for the machinethe machine theyd found in the mind of one particular adept the time machine the teachers are telling him about the weather and hes pretending to care as he tries to ignore the florescent lighting as yellow as the skin that forms on old butter the cracks in the dull beige walls the faded construction paper of old projects taped to those walls drooping down toward a tired washedout green carpet thats paperthin under foot its the kind of event that hes never really understood the point of even as he understands the reason for it to prove that hes still fit for office to prove that the country some of it is free of war and division to prove he cares about kids even though this particular school seems to be falling apart why this class why today is what he really doesnt understand with so many world criseschinas imperialism the siberian separatist movement iraq as the only bulwark against russian influence in the middle east or a vice president he now knows may be too old and delusional to be anything other than an embarrassment and a cabinet he let his familys political cronies bully him into appointing and a secret cavern that has infected his thoughts infected his mind and that would lead to memories of his father and the awful silence into which they told him as he sat coked up and hungover that morning on the pastel couch in some sleazy apartment how it had happened while his father worked a town hall meeting in atlanta all of this has made him realize that theres only one way to succeed in this thing called the presidency just let go of the reality of the world in favor of whatever reality he wants or needs no matter how selfish the teachers are turning into animals again and he cant seem to stop it from happening the time machine had appeared as an image on their monitors from an adept named peter in vat and because they couldnt figure out the contextweapon camera something newthey had to wake peter up and have a conversation with him a time machine he told them a time machine a time machine that travels through time hed clarified and theyd believed him or if not believed him dared to hope he was right that what peter had seen while deprived of anything but his own brain like some deepsea fish like something constantly turning inwards and then turning inwards again had been a time machine if they didnt build it and it turned out later that it might have worked and could have helped them avert or change what was fated to happen in september that day three hours after being sworn in he had had to give the order to build a time machine and quickly something bad will happen in late summer something bad across the channels something awful what he kept asking and the answer was always the same we dont know they kept telling him that the adepts didnt seem to convey literal information so much as impressions and visions of the future filtered through dreamscapes as if the drugs theyd perfected which had changed the way the adepts dreamed both improved and destroyed focus in different ways in the end he had decided to build the machineand defend against almost everything they could think of or divine from the images any attack against the stillsurviving new york financial district or the monument to the queen mother in the new york harbor the random godmissiles of the christian jihadists of the heartland who hadnt yet managed to unlock the nuclear codes in the occupied states and even the lingering cesspool that was los angeles after the viruses and riots but they still did not really know hes good now at talking to people when its not a prepared speech good at letting his mind be elsewhere while he talks to a series of masks from behind his own mask the prepared speeches are different because hes expected to inhabit them and hes never fully inhabited anything any role in his life they round the corner and enter the classroom thirty children in plastic onepiece deskchairs looking solemn and the teacher standing in front of a beatup battlewagon of a desk overflowing with papers behind her posters theyd made for him or someone had made to look like the children made them most showing him with the crown on his head but also a blackboard which amazes him so anachronistic and hes always hated the sound of chalk on a blackboard hates the smell of glue and the sour foodsweat of unwashed kids its all so squalid and tired and oddly close to the atmosphere in the underground cavern the smell the adepts give off as they thrash in slowmotion in their vats silently screaming out images of catastrophe and oblivion the children look up at him when he enters the room like theyre watching something far away and halfwondrous halfmonstrous he stands there and talks to them for a while at first trying to ignore the window in the back of the classroom that wants to show him a scene that shouldnt have been there he says the kinds of things hes said to kids for years while on the campaign trail running for evergreater office has said these things for so many years that its become a sawdust litany meant to convince them of his charm his wit his competence later he wont remember what he said or what they said back its not important but hes thought about the implications of that in bed at night lying there while his wife reads her pale freckled shoulder like a wall above him he could stand in a classroom and say nothing and still they would be fascinated with him like a talisman like a golden statue no one had ever told him that sometimes you dont have to inhabit the presidency sometimes it inhabits you hed wondered at the time of coronation if hed feel different hed wondered how the parliament members would receive him given the split between the popular vote and the legislative vote but nothing had happened the parliament members had clapped some longer than others and hed been sworn in duly noting the absence of the rogue scottish delegation the crown of the americas had briefly touched his head like an iron kiss from the mouth of god as his predecessor had put it and then it was gone again under glass and he was back to being the secular president not some sort of divine king then theyd taken him to the pentagon hurtled him half a mile underground and hed felt like a man who wins a prize only to find out its worthless ossuary hed expected clandestine spy programs secret weapons special powers but he hadnt expected the faces in the vats or the machine before they built the time machine he had insisted on meeting peter in an interrogation room near the vats he felt strongly about this about looking into the eyes of the man he had almost decided to trust are you sure this will work he asked peter even as he found the question irrelevant ridiculous no matter what peter said no matter how impossible his scientists said it was how it subverted known science he was going to do it the curiosity was too strong peters eyes were bright with a kind of fever his face was the palest white possible and he stank of the chemicals theyd put him in a blue jumper suit to cover his nakedness itll work i pulled it out of another place it was a truesight a trueseeing i dont know how it works but it works itll work itll work and then he turned toward the black oneway glass at the far end of the room hands in restraints behind his back ill be free there was a thing in peters eyes he refused to acknowledge a sense of something being held back of something not quite right later he would never know why he didnt trust that instinct that perception and the only reason he could come up with was the strength of his curiosity and the weight of his predecessors effort to get to that point what exactly is the machine for exactly not justtime travel tell me something more specific the scientist accompanying them smiled he had a withered narrow face a firm chin and wore a jumpsuit that matched peters with a black belt at the waist that held the holster for an even blacker semiautomatic pistol he smelled strongly of a sickly sweet cologne as if hiding some essential putrefaction mr president he said peter is not a scientist and we cannot peer into his mind we can only see the images his mind projects until we build it we will not know exactly how it works and then when the machine was built and they took him to it he didnt know what to make of it he didnt think they did eitherthey were gathered around it in their protective suits like apes trying to figure out an internal combustion engine dont look directly into it the scientist beside him advised those who have experience a kind ofdisorientation unlike the apes examining it the two of them stood behind three feet of protective blastproof glass and yet both of them had moved to the back of the viewing roomas far away from the artifact as possible the machine consisted of a square housing made of irregularlooking gray metal caulked on the interior with what looked like rotted beef and in the center of this assemblage an eye of green light in the middle of the eye a piercing red dot the machine was about the size of a microwave oven when he saw the eye he shuddered could not tell at first if it was organic or a metallic lens the effect of the machine on his mind was of a thousand maggots inching their way across the top of a television set turned on but not receiving a station he couldnt stop looking as if the scientists warning had made it impossible not to stare a crawling sensation spread across his scalp his arms his hands his legs how does it work he asked the scientist we still dont know does the adept know not really he just told us not to look into it directly is it from the future that is the most logical guess to him it didnt look real it looked either like something from another planet or something a psychotic child would put together before turning to more violent pursuits where else could it be from the scientist didnt reply and anger began to override his fear he continued to look directly into the eye even as it made him feel sick well what do you know that it shouldnt work as we put the pieces togetherwe all thought we all thought it was more like witchcraft than science forgive me mr president he gave the scientist a look that the scientist couldnt meet had he meant the gravity of the insult had he meant to imply their efforts were as blasphemous as the adepts second sight and now what do you think now its awake alive but we dont see how its its what breathing mr president a machine shouldnt breathe how does it take anyone into the future do you think the temperature in the room seemed to have gone up he was sweating the eye of the thing impossibly alien bored into him was it changing color we think it doesnt physically send anyone into the future thats the problem we think it might somehowcreate a localized phenomenon he sighed just say what you mean the pulsing red dot the shifting green looking at him looking into him we think it might not allow physical travel just mental travel in that instant he saw adept peters pale face again and he felt a weakness in his stomach and even though there was so much protection between him and the machine he turned to the scientist and said get me out of here only it was too late the sickness the shifting had started the next day and he couldnt tell anyone about it not even his wife or they would have removed him from office the constitution was quite clear about what do with witches and warlocks at this point his aide would hand him the book theyd have gone through a dozen books before choosing that one it is the only one with nothing in it anyone could object to nothing in it of substance nothing his people thought that the stillfree press could use to damage him there was just a goat in the book a goat having adventures it was written by a constitutionalist an outspoken supporter of coronation and expansion as he takes the book he realizes mildly surprised that he has already become used to the smell of sweating children he has none of his own and the classroom grunge ossuary it sounded like a combination of osprey and sanctuary the students who attend the school all experience it differently from him their minds editing out the sensory perceptions hes still receiving the mess the depressed quality of the infrastructure but what if you couldnt edit it out and what if the stakes were much much higher so then they would sit him down at a ridiculously small chair almost as small as the ones used by the students but somehow he would feel smaller in it despite that as if he was back in college surrounded by people both smarter and more dedicated than he was as if he is posing and being told hes not as good an imposter but its still just a childrens book after all and at least theres air conditioning kicking in and the kids really seem to want him to read the book as if they havent heard it a thousand times before and he feeds off the look in their eyesthe president of north america and the britains is telling us a storyand so he begins to read he enjoys the storytelling nothing he does with the book can hurt him nothing about it has weight still he has to keep the pale face of the adept out of his voice and the russian problem and the chinese problem and the full extent of military operations in the heartland there are cameras after all its september and something terrible is going to happen but for a moment he forgets that fact and thats when his aide interrupts his reading comes up to him with a fake smile and serious eyes and whispers in his ear whispers in his ear and the sound is like a buzzing and the buzzing is numinous and allencompassing the breath on his ear is a tiny curse an infernal itch theres a sudden rush of blood to his brain as he hears the words and his aide withdraws he can hardly move is seeing light where there shouldnt be light the words drop heavy into his ear as if they have weight and he receives them and keeps receiving them and he knows what they mean eventually he knows what they mean throughout his body the aide says his voice flecked with relief mr president our scientists have solved it its not time travel or farsight its alternate universes the adepts have been staring into alternate universes what happens there in september may not happen here thats why theyve had such trouble with the intel the machine isnt a time machine except as soon as the aide opens his mouth the words become a trigger a catalyst and its too late for him a door is opening wider than ever before the machine has already infected him there are variations a long row of them detonating in his mind trying to destroy him a strange sad song is creeping up inside of him and he cant stop that either hes sitting in the chair wearing a black military uniform with medals on it hes much fitter the clothes tight to emphasize his muscle tone but his face is contorted around the hole of a festering localized virus charcoal and green and viscous he doesnt wear an eye patch because he wants his people to see how he fights the disease his left arm is made of metal his tongue is not his own colonized the way his nation has been colonized waging a war against bioresearch gone wrong and the rebels who welcome it who want to tear down anything remotely human themselves no longer recognizable as human his aide comes up and whispers that the rebels have detonated a biomass bomb in new york city which is now stewing in a broth of fungus and mutation the nearly instantaneous transformation of an entire metropolis into something living but alien the rate of change has become strange and accelerated in a world where this was always true the age of industrialization slowing it if only for a moment there are no people left in new york city his aide says what are your orders he hadnt expected this not so soon and it takes him seven minutes to recover from the news of the death of millions seven minutes to turn to his aide and say call in a nuclear strike and his aide comes up to him and whispers in his ear its time to go now theyve moved up another meeting wrap it up health insurance is on the agenda today along with social security something will get done about that and the environment this year or hell die trying hes sitting in the chair reading the book and hes gaunt eyes feverish military personnel surrounding him theres one camera with them army tv and the students are all in camouflage the electricity flickers on and off the school room has reinforced metal and concrete all around it the event is propaganda being packaged and pumped out to those still watching in places where the enemy hasnt jammed the satellites hes fighting a war against an escaped humancreated rapidly reproducing intelligent species prototype that looks a little bit like a chimpanzee crossed with a doberman the scattered remnants of the hated adept underclass have made common cause with the animals disrupting communications his aide whispers in his ear that atlanta has fallen with over sixtythousand troops and civilians massacred in pitched battles all over the city theres no safe air corridor back to the capital in fact the capital seems to be under attack as well what should we do he returns to reading the book nothing he can do in the next seven minutes will make any difference to the outcome he knows what they have to do but hes too tired to contemplate it just yet they will have to head to the heartland and make peace with the ecstatics and their godmissiles its either that or render entire stretches of north america uninhabitable from nukes and hes not that desperate yet he begins to review the ten commandments of the ecstatics in his mind one by one like rosary beads hes in midsentence when the aide hurries over and begins to whisper in his earjust as the first of the godmissiles strikes and the fire washes over and through him not even time to scream and hes nothing anymore not even a pile of ashes hes in a chair in a suit with a sweatstained white shirt and hes tired his voice as he reads thin and raspy five days and nights of negotiations between the rival factions of the new southern confederacy following a month of genocide between blacks and whites from arkansas to georgia too few resources too many natural disasters and no jobs the whole system breaking down although los angeles is still trying to pretend the world isnt coming to an end even as jets are falling out the sky except thats why hes in the classroom pretending pretending neighbor hasnt set upon neighbor for thirty days like in rwanda except not with machetes with guns teenagers shooting people in the stomach and laughing extremist talk radio urging them on closing in on a million people dead his aide comes up and whispers in his ear the truce has fallen apart theyre killing each other again and not just in the south in the north along political lines he sits there because hes run out of answers he thinks in another time another place i would have made a great president hes sitting in the classroom in the small chair in comfortable clothes reading the goat story no godmissiles here no viruses no invasions the chinese and russians are just on the cusp of being a threat but not there yet adepts here have no real farsight or are not believed and roam free los angeles is a thriving money pit not a huskedout shadow no the real threat here besides pollution is that hes mentally ill although no one around him seems to know it a head full of worms insecurity and pure naked need he rules a country called the united states that wavers between the first and the third world resources failing infrastructure crumbling political system fueled by greed and corruption when the aide comes up and whispers in his ear to tell him that terrorists have flown two planes into buildings in new york city theres blood behind his eyes as well as a deafening silence and a sudden leap from people falling from the burning buildings to endless war in the middle east bodies broken by bullets and bombs the future torques into secret trials torture rape and hundreds of thousands of civilians dead or displaced a country bankrupted and defenseless ruled ultimately by martial law and generals cities burn the screams of the living are as loud as the screams of the dying he sits there for seven minutes because he really has no idea what to do and his fate is to exist in a reality where towers do not explode in september where islamic fundamentalists are the least of his worries there is only one present only one future now and hes back in it driving it seven minutes have elapsed and theres a graveyard in his head seven minutes and hes gradually aware that in that span hes read the goat story twice and then sat there for thirty seconds silent now he smiles says a few reassuring words just as his aide has decided to come up and rescue him from the yawning chasm hes living in a place now where theyll never find him those children where theres a torrent of blood in his mind and a sky dark with planes and helicopters and soldiers blown to bits by the roadside at that point he would rise from his chair and his aide would clap encouraging the students to clap and they will bewildered by this man about whom reporters will say later doesnt seem quite all there an endless line of presidents rises from the chair with him the weight almost too much he can see each clearly in his head he can see what theyre doing and who theyre doing it to saying his goodbyes is like learning how to walk again while a nightmare plays out in the background he knows as they lead him down the corridor that hell have to learn to live with it like and unlike a man learning to live with missing limbsphantom limbs that do not belong that he cannot control but are always there and hell never be able to explain it to anyone hell be as alone and yet as crowded as a person can be the wall between him and his wife will be more unbearable than ever he remembers peters pale wrinkled yearning face and he thinks about making them release the man put him on a plane somewhere beyond his countrys influence thinks about destroying the machine and ending the adept project then hes back in the wretched glorious sunlight of a real an ordinary day and so are all of his reflections and shadows mimicking him forever the lonely songs of laren dorr george r r martin is the wildly popular author of the a song of ice and fire epic fantasy series and many other novels such as dying of the light and the armageddon rag his short fictionwhich has appeared in numerous anthologies and in most if not all of the genres major

a screenwriter on such television projects as the s version of the twilight zone and beauty and the beast a tv series based on a song of ice and fire debuted on hbo in there is a girl who goes between the worlds she is grayeyed and pale of skin or so the story goes and her hair is a coalblack waterfall with halfseen hints of red she wears about her brow a circlet of burnished metal a dark crown that holds her hair in place and sometimes puts shadows in her eyes her name is sharra she knows the gates the beginning of her story is lost to us with the memory of the world from which she sprang the end the end is not yet and when it comes we shall not know it we have only the middle or rather a piece of that middle the smallest part of the legend a mere fragment of the quest a small tale within the greater of one world where sharra paused and of the lonely singer laren dorr and how they briefly touched one moment there was only the valley caught in twilight the setting sun hung fat and violet on the ridge above and its rays slanted down silently into a dense forest whose trees had shiny black trunks and colorless ghostly leaves the only sounds were the cries of the mourningbirds coming out for the night and the swift rush of water in the rocky stream that cut the woods then through a gate unseen sharra came tired and bloodied to the world of laren dorr she wore a plain white dress now stained and sweaty and a heavy fur cloak that had been halfripped from her back and her left arm bare and slender still bled from three long wounds she appeared by the side of the stream shaking and she threw a quick wary glance about her before she knelt to dress her wounds the water for all its swiftness was a dark and murky green no way to tell if it was safe but sharra was weak and thirsty she drank washed her arm as best she could in the strange and doubtful water and bound her injuries with bandages ripped from her clothes then as the purple sun dipped lower behind the ridge she crawled away from the water to a sheltered spot among the trees and fell into exhausted sleep she woke to arms around her strong arms that lifted her easily to carry her somewhere and she woke struggling but the arms just tightened and held her still easy a mellow voice said and she saw a face dimly through gathering mist a mans face long and somehow gentle you are weak he said and night is coming we must be inside before darkness sharra did not struggle not then though she knew she should she had been struggling a long time and she was tired but she looked at him confused why she asked then not waiting for an answer who are you where are we going to safety he said your home she asked drowsy no he said so soft she could scarcely hear his voice no not home not ever home but it will do she heard splashing then as if he were carrying her across the stream and ahead of them on the ridge she glimpsed a gaunt twisted silhouette a tripletowered castle etched black against the sun odd she thought that wasnt there before she slept when she woke he was there watching her she lay under a pile of soft warm blankets in a curtained canopied bed but the curtains had been drawn back and her host sat across the room in a great chair draped by shadows candlelight flickered in his eyes and his hands locked together neatly beneath his chin are you feeling better he asked without moving she sat up and noticed she was nude swift as suspicion quicker than thought her hand went to her head but the dark crown was still there in place untouched its metal cool against her brow relaxing she leaned back against the pillows and pulled the blankets up to cover herself much better she said and as she said it she realized for the first time that her wounds were gone the man smiled at her a sad wistful sort of smile he had a strong face with charcoalcolored hair that curled in lazy ringlets and fell down into dark eyes somehow wider than they should be even seated he was tall and slender he wore a suit and cape of some soft gray leather and over that he wore melancholy like a cloak claw marks he said speculatively while he smiled claw marks down your arm and your clothes almost ripped from your back someone doesnt like you something sharra said a guardian a guardian at the gate she sighed there is always a guardian at the gate the seven dont like us to move from world to world me they like least of all his hands unfolded from beneath his chin and rested on the carved wooden arms of his chair he nodded but the wistful smile stayed so then he said you know the seven and you know the gates his eyes strayed to her forehead the crown of course i should have guessed sharra grinned at him you did guess more than that you knew who are you what world is this my world he said evenly ive named it a thousand times but none of the names ever seem quite right there was one once a name i liked a name that fit but ive forgotten it it was a long time ago my name is laren dorr or that was my name once when i had use for such a thing here and now it seems somewhat silly but at least i havent forgotten it your world sharra said are you a king then a god yes laren dorr replied with an easy laugh and more im whatever i choose to be there is no one around to dispute me what did you do to my wounds she asked i healed them he gave an apologetic shrug its my world i have certain powers not the powers id like to have perhaps but powers nonetheless oh she did not look convinced laren waved an impatient hand you think its impossible your crown of course well thats only half right i could not harm you with my ah powers not while you wear that but i can help you he smiled again and his eyes grew soft and dreamy but it doesnt matter even if i could i would never harm you sharra believe that it has been a long time sharra looked startled you know my name how he stood up smiling and came across the room to sit beside her on the bed and he took her hand before replying wrapping it softly in his and stroking her with his thumb yes i know your name you are sharra who moves between the worlds centuries ago when the hills had a different shape and the violet sun burned scarlet at the very beginning of its cycle they came to me and told me you would come i hate them all seven and i will always hate them but that night i welcomed the vision they gave me they told me only your name and that you would come here to my world and one thing more but that was enough it was a promise a promise of an ending or a start of a change and any change is welcome on this world ive been alone here through a thousand suncycles sharra and each cycle lasts for centuries there are few events to mark the death of time sharra was frowning she shook her long black hair and in the dim light of the candles the soft red highlights glowed are they that far ahead of me then she said do they know what will happen her voice was troubled she looked up at him this other thing they told you he squeezed her hand very gently they told me i would love you laren said his voice still sounded sad but that was no great prophecy i could have told them as much there was a time long agoi think the sun was yellow thenwhen i realized that i would love any voice that was not an echo of my own sharra woke at dawn when shafts of bright purple light spilled into her room through a high arched window that had not been there the night before clothing had been laid out for her a loose yellow robe a jeweled dress of bright crimson a suit of forest green she chose the suit dressed quickly as she left she paused to look out the window she was in a tower looking out over crumbling stone battlements and a dusty triangular courtyard two other towers twisted matchstick things with pointed conical spires rose from the other corners of the triangle there was a strong wind that whipped the rows of gray pennants set along the walls but no other motion to be seen and beyond the castle walls no sign of the valley none at all the castle with its courtyard and its crooked towers was set atop a mountain and far and away in all directions taller mountains loomed presenting a panorama of black stone cliffs and jagged rocky walls and shining clean ice steeples that gleamed with a violet sheen the window was sealed and closed but the wind looked cold her door was open sharra moved quickly down a twisting stone staircase out across the courtyard into the main building a low wooden structure built against the wall she passed through countless rooms some cold and empty save for dust others richly furnished before she found laren dorr eating breakfast there was an empty seat at his side the table was heavily laden with food and drink sharra sat down and took a hot biscuit smiling despite herself laren smiled back im leaving today she said in between bites im sorry laren i must find the gate the air of hopeless melancholy had not left him it never did so you said last night he replied sighing it seems i have waited a long time for nothing there was meat several types of biscuits fruit cheese milk sharra filled a plate face a little downcast avoiding larens eyes im sorry she repeated stay awhile he said only a short time you can afford it i would think let me show you what i can of my world let me sing to you his eyes wide and dark and very tired asked the question she hesitated wellit takes time to find the gate stay with me for a while then but laren eventually i must go i have made promises you understand he smiled gave a helpless shrug yes but look i know where the gate is i can show you save you a search stay with me oh a month a month as you measure time then ill take you to the gate he studied her youve been hunting a long long time sharra perhaps you need a rest slowly thoughtfully she ate a piece of fruit watching him all the time perhaps i do she said at last weighing things and there will be a guardian of course you could help me then a month thats not so long ive been on other worlds far longer than a month she nodded and a smile spread slowly across her face yes she said still nodding that would be all right he touched her hand lightly after breakfast he showed her the world they had given him they stood side by side on a small balcony atop the highest of the three towers sharra in dark green and laren tall and soft in gray they stood without moving and laren moved the world around them he set the castle flying over restless churning seas where long black serpentheads peered up out of the water to watch them pass he moved them to a vast echoing cavern under the earth all aglow with a soft green light where dripping stalactites brushed down against the towers and herds of blind white goats moaned outside the battlements he clapped his hands and smiled and steamthick jungle rose around them trees that climbed each other in rubber ladders to the sky giant flowers of a dozen different colors fanged monkeys that chittered from the walls he clapped again and the walls were swept clean and suddenly the courtyard dirt was sand and they were on an endless beach by the shore of a bleak gray ocean and above the slow wheeling of a great blue bird with tissuepaper wings was the only movement to be seen he showed her this and more and more and in the end as dusk seemed to threaten in one place after another he took the castle back to the ridge above the valley and sharra looked down on the forest of blackbarked trees where he had found her and heard the mourningbirds whimper and weep among transparent leaves it is not a bad world she said turning to him on the balcony no laren replied his hands rested on the cold stone railing his eyes on the valley below not entirely i explored it once on foot with a sword and a walking stick there was a joy there a real excitement a new mystery behind every hill he chuckled but that too was long ago now i know what lies behind every hill another empty horizon he looked at her and gave his characteristic shrug there are worse hells i suppose but this is mine come with me then she said find the gate with me and leave there are other worlds maybe they are less strange and less beautiful but you will not be alone he shrugged again you make it sound so easy he said in a careless voice i have found the gate sharra i have tried it a thousand times the guardian does not stop me i step through briefly glimpse some other world and suddenly im back in the courtyard no i cannot leave she took his hand in hers how sad to be alone so long i think you must be very strong laren i would go mad in only a handful of years he laughed and there was a bitterness in the way he did it oh sharra i have gone mad a thousand times also they cure me love they always cure me another shrug and he put his arm around her the wind was cold and rising come he said we must be inside before full dark they went up in the tower to her bedroom and they sat together on her bed and laren brought them food meat burned black on the outside and red within hot bread wine they ate and they talked why are you here she asked him in between mouthfuls washing her words down with wine how did you offend them who were you before i hardly remember except in dreams he told her and the dreamsit has been so long i cant even recall which ones are truth and which are visions born of my madness he sighed sometimes i dream i was a king a great king in a world other than this and my crime was that i made my people happy in happiness they turned against the seven and the temples fell idle and i woke one day within my room within my castle and found my servants gone and when i went outside my people and my world were also gone and even the woman who slept beside me but there are other dreams often i remember vaguely that i was a god well an almostgod i had powers and teachings and they were not the teachings of the seven they were afraid of me each of them for i was a match for any of them but i could not meet all seven together and that was what they forced me to do and then they left me only a small bit of my power and set me here it was cruel irony as a god id taught that people should turn to each other that they could keep away the darkness by love and laughter and talk so all these things the seven took from me and even that is not the worst for there are other times when i think that i have always been here that i was born here some endless age ago and the memories are all false ones sent to make me hurt the more sharra watched him as he spoke his eyes were not on her but far away full of fog and dreams and halfdead rememberings and he spoke very slowly in a voice that was also like fog that drifted and curled and hid things and you knew that there were mysteries there and things brooding just out of sight and faroff lights that you would never reach laren stopped and his eyes woke up again ah sharra he said be careful how you go even your crown will not help you should they move on you directly and the pale child bakkalon will tear at you and naaslas feed upon your pain and saagael on your soul she shivered and cut another piece of meat but it was cold and tough when she bit into it and suddenly she noticed that the candles had burned very low how long had she listened to him speak wait he said then and he rose and went outside out the door near where the window had been there was nothing there now but rough gray stone the windows all changed to solid rock with the last fading of the sun laren returned in a few moments with a softly shining instrument of dark black wood slung around his neck on a leather cord sharra had never quite seen its like it had sixteen strings each a different color and all up and down its length brightly glowing bars of light were inlaid amid the polished wood when laren sat the bottom of the device rested on the floor and the top came to just above his shoulder he stroked it lightly speculatively the lights glowed and suddenly the room was full of swiftfading music my companion he said smiling he touched it again and the music rose and died lost notes without a tune and he brushed the lightbars and the very air shimmered and changed color he began to sing i am the lord of loneliness empty my domain the first words ran sung low and sweet in larens mellow faroff fog voice the rest of the songsharra clutched at it heard each word and tried to remember but lost them all they brushed her touched her then melted away back into the fog here and gone again so swift that she could not remember quite what they had been with the words the music wistful and melancholy and full of secrets pulling at her crying whispering promises of a thousand tales untold all around the room the candles flamed up brighter and globes of light grew and danced and flowed together until the air was full of color words music light laren dorr put them all together and wove for her a vision she saw him then as he saw himself in his dreams a king strong and tall and still proud with hair as black as hers and eyes that snapped he was dressed all in shimmering white pants that clung tight and a shirt that ballooned at the sleeves and a great cloak that moved and curled in the wind like a sheet of solid snow around his brow he wore a crown of flashing silver and a slim straight sword flashed just as bright at his side this laren this younger laren this dream vision moved without melancholy moved in a world of sweet ivory minarets and languid blue canals and the world moved around him friends and lovers and one special woman whom laren drew with words and lights of fire and there was an infinity of easy days and laughter then sudden abrupt darkness he was here the music moaned the lights dimmed the words grew sad and lost sharra saw laren wake in a familiar castle now deserted she saw him search from room to room and walk outside to face a world hed never seen she watched him leave the castle walk off towards the mists of a far horizon in the hope that those mists were smoke and on and on he walked and new horizons fell beneath his feet each day and the great fat sun waxed red and orange and yellow but still his world was empty all the places he had shown her he walked to all those and more and finally lost as ever wanting home the castle came to him by then his white had faded to dim gray but still the song went on days went and years and centuries and laren grew tired and mad but never old the sun shone green and violet and a savage hard bluewhite but with each cycle there was less color in his world so laren sang of endless empty days and nights when music and memory were his only sanity and his songs made sharra feel it and when the vision faded and the music died and his soft voice melted away for the last time and laren paused and smiled and looked at her sharra found herself trembling thank you he said softly with a shrug and he took his instrument and left her for the night the next day dawned cold and overcast but laren took her out into the forests hunting their quarry was a lean white thing half cat half gazelle with too much speed for them to chase easily and too many teeth for them to kill sharra did not mind the hunt was better than the kill there was a singular striking joy in that run through the darkling forest holding a bow she never used and wearing a quiver of black wood arrows cut from the same dour trees that surrounded them both of them were bundled up tightly in gray fur and laren smiled out at her from under a wolfshead hood and the leaves beneath their boots as clear and fragile as glass cracked and splintered as they ran afterwards unblooded but exhausted they returned to the castle and laren set out a great feast in the main dining room they smiled at each other from opposite ends of a table fifty feet long and sharra watched the clouds roll by the window behind larens head and later watched the window turn to stone why does it do that she asked and why dont you ever go outside at night he shrugged ah i have reasons the nights are well not good here he sipped hot spice wine from a great jeweled cup the world you came from where you startedtell me sharra did you have stars she nodded yes its been so long though but i still remember the nights were very dark and black and the stars were little pinpoints of light hard and cold and far away you could see patterns sometimes the men of my world when they were young gave names to each of those patterns and told grand tales about them laren nodded i would like your world i think he said mine was like that a little but our stars were a thousand colors and they moved like ghostly lanterns in the night sometimes they drew veils around them to hide their light and then our nights would be all shimmer and gossamer often i would go sailing at startime myself and she whom i loved just so we could see the stars together it was a good time to sing his voice was growing sad again darkness had crept into the room darkness and silence and the food was cold and sharra could scarce see his face fifty long feet away so she rose and went to him and sat lightly on the great table near to his chair and laren nodded and smiled and at once there was a whooosh and all along the walls torches flared to sudden life in the long dining hall he offered her more wine and her fingers lingered on his as she took the glass it was like that for us too sharra said if the wind was warm enough and other men were far away then we liked to lie together in the open kaydar and i she hesitated looked at him his eyes were searching kaydar you would have liked him laren and he would have liked you i think he was tall and he had red hair and there was a fire in his eyes kaydar had powers as did i but his were greater and he had such a will they took him one night did not kill him only took him from me and from our world i have been hunting for him ever since i know the gates i wear the dark crown and they will not stop me easily laren drank his wine and watched the torchlight on the metal of his goblet there are an infinity of worlds sharra i have as much time as i require i do not age laren no more than you do i will find him did you love him so much sharra fought a fond flickering smile and lost yes she said and now it was her voice that seemed a little lost yes so much he made me happy laren we were only together for a short time but he did make me happy the seven cannot touch that it was a joy just to watch him to feel his arms around me and see the way he smiled ah he said and he did smile but there was something very beaten in the way he did it the silence grew very thick finally sharra turned to him but we have wandered a long way from where we started you still have not told me why your windows seal themselves at night you have come a long way sharra you move between the worlds have you seen worlds without stars yes many laren i have seen a universe where the sun is a glowing ember with but a single world and the skies are vast and vacant by night i have seen the land of frowning jesters where there is no sky and the hissing suns burn below the ocean i have walked the moors of carradyne and watched dark sorcerers set fire to a rainbow to light that sunless land this world has no stars laren said does that frighten you so much that you stay inside no but it has something else instead he looked at her would you see she nodded as abruptly as they had lit the torches all snuffed out the room swam with blackness and sharra shifted on the table to look over larens shoulder laren did not move but behind him the stones of the window fell away like dust and light poured in from outside the sky was very dark but she could see clearly for against the darkness a shape was moving light poured from it and the dirt in the courtyard and the stones of the battlements and the gray pennants were all bright beneath its glow puzzling sharra looked up something looked back it was taller than the mountains and it filled up half the sky and though it gave off light enough to see the castle by sharra knew that it was dark beyond darkness it had a manshape roughly and it wore a long cape and a cowl and below that was blackness even fouler than the rest the only sounds were larens soft breathing and the beating of her heart and the distant weeping of a mourningbird but in her head sharra could hear demonic laughter the shape in the sky looked down at her in her and she felt the cold dark in her soul frozen she could not move her eyes but the shape did move it turned and raised a hand and then there was something else up there with it a tiny manshape with eyes of fire that writhed and screamed and called to her sharra shrieked and turned away when she glanced back there was no window only a wall of safe sure stone and a row of torches burning and laren holding her within strong arms it was only a vision he told her he pressed her tight against him and stroked her hair i used to test myself at night he said more to himself than to her but there was no need they take turns up there watching me each of the seven i have seen them too often burning with black light against the clean dark of the sky and holding those i loved now i dont look i stay inside and sing and my windows are made of nightstone i feel fouled she said still trembling a little come he said there is water upstairs you can clean away the cold and then ill sing for you he took her hand and led her up into the tower sharra took a hot bath while laren set up his instrument and tuned it in the bedroom he was ready when she returned wrapped head to foot in a huge fluffy brown towel she sat on the bed drying her hair and waiting and laren gave her visions he sang his other dream this time the one where he was a god and the enemy of the seven the music was a savage pounding thing shot through with lightning and tremors of fear and the lights melted together to form a scarlet battlefield where a blindingwhite laren fought shadows and the shapes of nightmare there were seven of them and they formed a ring around him and darted in and out stabbing him with lances of absolute black and laren answered them with fire and storm but in the end they overwhelmed him the light faded and then the song grew soft and sad again and the vision blurred as lonely dreaming centuries flashed by hardly had the last notes fallen from the air and the final shimmers died than laren started once again a new song this time and one he did not know so well his fingers slim and graceful hesitated and retraced themselves more than once and his voice was shaky too for he was making up some of the words as he went along sharra knew why for this time he sang of her a ballad of her quest of burning love and endless searching of worlds beyond worlds of dark crowns and waiting guardians that fought with claws and tricks and lies he took every word that she had spoken and used each and transformed each in the bedroom glittering panoramas formed where hot white suns burned beneath eternal oceans and hissed in clouds of steam and men ancient beyond time lit rainbows to keep away the dark and he sang kaydar and he sang him true somehow he caught and drew the fire that had been sharras love and made her believe anew but the song ended with a question the halting finale lingering in the air echoing echoing both of them waited for the rest and both knew there was no more not yet sharra was crying my turn laren she said then thank you for giving kaydar back to me it was only a song he said shrugging its been a long time since i had a new song to sing once again he left her touching her cheek lightly at the door as she stood there with the blanket wrapped around her then sharra locked the door behind him and went from candle to candle turning light to darkness with a breath and she threw the towel over a chair and crawled under the blankets and lay a long long time before drifting off to sleep it was still dark when she woke not knowing why she opened her eyes and lay quietly and looked around the room and nothing was there nothing was changed or was there and then she saw him sitting in the chair across the room with his hands locked under his chin just as he had sat that first time his eyes steady and unmoving very wide and dark in a room full of night he sat very still laren she called softly still not quite sure the dark form was him yes he said he did not move i watched you last night too while you slept i have been alone here for longer than you can ever imagine and very soon now i will be alone again even in sleep your presence is a wonder oh laren she said there was a silence a pause a weighing and an unspoken conversation then she threw back the blanket and laren came to her both of them had seen centuries come and go a month a moment much the same they slept together every night and every night laren sang his songs while sharra listened they talked throughout dark hours and during the day they swam nude in crystalline waters that caught the purple glory of the sky they made love on beaches of fine white sand and they spoke a lot of love but nothing changed and finally the time drew near on the eve of the night before the day that was end at twilight they walked together through the shadowed forest where hed found her laren had learned to laugh during his month with sharra but now he was silent again he walked slowly clutched her hand hard in his and his mood was more gray than the soft silk shirt he wore finally by the side of the valley stream he sat and pulled her down by his side they took off their boots and let the water cool their feet it was a warm evening with a lonely restless wind and already you could hear the first of the mourningbirds you must go he said still holding her hand but never looking at her it was a statement not a question yes she said and the melancholy had touched her too and there were leaden echoes in her voice my words have all left me sharra laren said if i could sing for you a vision now i would a vision of a world once empty made full by us and our children i could offer that my world has beauty and wonder and mystery enough if only there were eyes to see it and if the nights are evil well men have faced dark nights before on other worlds in other times i would love you sharra as much as i am able i would try to make you happy laren she started but he quieted her with a glance no i could say that but i will not i have no right kaydar makes you happy only a selfish fool would ask you to give up that happiness to share my misery kaydar is all fire and laughter while i am smoke and song and sadness i have been alone too long sharra the gray is part of my soul now and i would not have you darkened but still she took his hand in both of hers lifted it and kissed it quickly then releasing him she lay her head on his unmoving shoulder try to come with me laren she said hold my hand when we pass through the gate and perhaps the dark crown will protect you i will try anything you ask but dont ask me to believe that it will work he sighed you have countless worlds ahead of you sharra and i cannot see your ending but it is not here that i know and maybe that is best i dont know anymore if i ever did i remember love vaguely i think i can recall what it was like and i remember that it never lasts here with both of us unchanging and immortal how could we help but to grow bored would we hate each other then id not want that he looked at her then and smiled an aching melancholy smile i think that you had known kaydar for only a short time to be so in love with him perhaps im being devious after all for in finding kaydar you may lose him the fire will go out someday my love and the magic will die and then you may remember laren dorr sharra began to weep softly laren gathered her to him and kissed her and whispered a gentle no she kissed back and they held each other wordless when at last the purple gloom had darkened to nearblack they put back on their boots and stood laren hugged her and smiled i must go sharra said i must but leaving is hard laren you must believe that i do he said i love you because you will go i think because you cannot forget kaydar and you will not forget the promises you made you are sharra who goes between the worlds and i think the seven must fear you far more than any god i might have been if you were not you i would not think as much of you oh once you said you would love any voice that was not any echo of your own laren shrugged as i have often said love that was a very long time ago they were back inside the castle before darkness for a final meal a final night a final song they got no sleep that night and laren sang to her again just before dawn it was not a very good song though it was an aimless rambling thing about a wandering minstrel on some nondescript world very little of interest ever happened to the minstrel sharra couldnt quite get the point of the song and laren sang it listlessly it seemed an odd farewell but both of them were troubled he left her with the sunrise promising to change clothes and meet her in the courtyard and sure enough he was waiting when she got there smiling at her calm and confident he wore a suit of pure white pants that clung a shirt that puffed up at the sleeves and a great heavy cape that snapped and billowed in the rising wind but the purple sun stained him with its shadow rays sharra walked out to him and took his hand she wore tough leather and there was a knife in her belt for dealing with the guardian her hair jetblack with lightborn glints of red and purple blew as freely as his cape but the dark crown was in place goodbye laren she said i wish i had given you more you have given me enough in all the centuries that come in all the suncycles that lie ahead i will remember i shall measure time by you sharra when the sun rises one day and its color is blue fire i will look at it and say yes this is the first blue sun after sharra came to me she nodded and i have a new promise i will find kaydar someday and if i free him we will come back to you both of us together and we will pit my crown and kaydars fires against all the darkness of the seven laren shrugged good if im not here be sure to leave a message he said and then he grinned now the gate you said you would show me the gate laren turned and gestured at the shortest tower a sooty stone structure sharra had never been inside there was a wide wooden door in its base laren produced a key here she said looking puzzled in the castle here laren said they walked across the courtyard to the door laren inserted the heavy metal key and began to fumble with the lock while he worked sharra took one last look around and felt the sadness heavy on her soul the other towers looked bleak and dead the courtyard was forlorn and beyond the high icy mountains was only an empty horizon there was no sound but laren working at the lock and no motion but the steady wind that kicked up the courtyard dust and flapped the seven gray pennants that hung along each wall sharra shivered with sudden loneliness laren opened the door no room inside only a wall of moving fog a fog without color or sound or light your gate my lady the singer said sharra watched it as she had watched it so many times before what world was next she wondered she never knew but maybe in the next one she would find kaydar she felt larens hand on her shoulder you hesitate he said his voice soft sharras hand went to her knife the guardian she said suddenly there is always a guardian her eyes darted quickly round the courtyard laren sighed yes always there are some who try to claw you to pieces and some who try to get you lost and some who try to trick you into taking the wrong gate there are some who hold you with weapons some with chains some with lies and there is one at least who tried to stop you with love yet he was true for all that and he never sang you false and with a hopeless loving shrug laren shoved her through the gate did she find him in the end her lover with the eyes of fire or is she searching still what guardian did she face next when she walks at night a stranger in a lonely land does the sky have stars i dont know he doesnt maybe even the seven do not know they are powerful yes but all power is not theirs and the number of worlds is greater than even they can count there is a girl who goes between the worlds but her path is lost in legend by now maybe she is dead and maybe not knowledge moves slowly from world to world and not all of it is true but this we know in an empty castle below a purple sun a lonely minstrel waits and sings of her of swords and horses carrie vaughn is the author of the bestselling series about a werewolf named kitty who hosts a talk radio advice show shes also written for young adults steel voices of dragons the novels discords apple and after the golden age many short stories and shes a contributor to george r r martins wild cards series when she isnt writing she collects hobbies and enjoys the great outdoors in colorado where she makes her home iraised my daughter on disney princess movies because id loved them so much as a girl the music the happily ever afters and those amazing dresses they made me dream of other worlds and id wondered what it would be like to dance at a ball to marry a prince to live in a world with magic maybe i thought that maggie would turn into me or something like me id have a friend i could sigh over the movies with a little girl i could dress in satin princess gowns but maggies questions startled me how come the girls dont get to ride horses and have swords and things then i showed her mulan in which the girl rides a horse and has a sword and my sixyearold astutely observed but shes dressed like a boy so i signed her up for fencing lessons i read an article in the paper about the local fencing school where one of the studentsa girlhad just won a medal in the world championships and a scholarship to harvard who knew harvard offered fencing scholarships the school advertised that their classes boosted confidence and increased poise and selfesteem especially for girls maggie loved it better she worked at it listened to everything her coach said practiced at home with a dowel rod from daves workshop making little gliding steps across the kitchen floor lining her feet up with the lines on the linoleum i watched her during lessons then sparring with her classmates and when my heart wasnt in my throat imagining all the ways she could get hurt felt a tingle of pride every time she outwitted her opponent scooped her blade out of the way swished it over and touched to score a point when she took her mask off her face glowed with smiling the advertisements were right she grew to be confident and poised more than i ever was at her age when i tended to creep along slouching in oversized sweaters at twelve the riding lessons started because she begged and kept her grades up dave printed off an article about modern pentathlon a strange sport where athletes competed in running swimming pistol shooting fencing and riding supposedly the event was modeled on nineteenthcentury military training replicating the skills a spy would need to cross enemy lines and deliver a message to his commander maggie read the article her eyes growing rounder and rounder she took up jogging in the mornings before school my daughter showed no interest at all in conventional sports like volleyball or gymnastics id been in marching band when she was fifteen dave asked her jokingly as he gave our credit card number to the fencing supply companys websiteyet againfor new epee blades and shoes because shed grown out of the old ones swords and horses why couldnt you have been a track star like your old man she didnt look up from her horse magazine didnt smile and answered seriously because when corlath whisks me away to damar i have to be ready dave stared at her blankly i think its from a book she read i explained she kept a stack of paperbacks by her bed most of them had swords or horses or both on the covers her riding coach told dave and me she has a gift shes a natural even i could see it and all i knew about horses was what i learned from disney movies the animals carried her around jumping courses their ears flicked back and listening to her though she never seemed to move while she sat on their backs never seemed to tell them what to do she had an uncanny way with the horses and i thought maybe its all those books about horses that gave her that sixth sense her coach wanted us to buy her a horse a big thoroughbred whod been competing in europe and was experienced enough to teach maggie about advanced riding and boost her confidence she laid out a plan including all the expenses showing what it would take for maggie to ride in the world championships the olympics it cost too much of course the horse alone cost a third of what our house was worth never mind what it cost to keep a horse we didnt want to break maggies heart by telling her we couldnt help her chase such a dreamyou want to support your children strange though she seemed to understand she never asked for more than we could give she said smiling wisely my time will come when she was seventeen maggie disappeared the police found her carshed driven herself to a riding lessonon the road by the lake where my family had a cabin i couldnt tell them why she might have gone there they didnt find any sign of maggie it made the news for weeks because she was young and pretty blond and smiling we took out a second mortgage and offered a huge reward for information we went on the news showshow could we not when the cameras camped outside our doorstep the whole neighborhood put up yellow ribbons it was all so exhausting i let dave do all the talking about how much we prayed for her safe return somber he braced himself with his arm around my shoulder i told the police what every mother tells the policeshe isnt the kind of girl to just run away shes not like that she got straight as she took out the trash they just shook their heads shes seventeen they said she could have done anything are there any boys anyone she was seeing no i said none shed never dated which had been a vague cause of worry another difference between her and me that i didnt understand when i was fifteen i couldnt wait to date boys couldnt wait to find my prince charming when she was fifteen i told dave the horse thing shell grow out of it they always grow out of it when they discover boys except if id been paying attention id have known that some girls didnt her riding instructors for example devoted women who practically lived at the barn because they hadnt grown out of it no there werent any boys except for corlath a character in a book with a sword and a horse on the cover she couldnt have run away i told them she was taken whisked away i couldnt say by whom after two years everyone assumes that shes dead we wait to hear word that her body has been found by a hiker in the woods decayed beyond recognition theyll need her dental records to confirm her identity dave wants to sell the house and move i refuse because what if she comes home how will she know where to go i keep her room clean and ready i threw all my dvds of disney princess movies away i wonder if its my fault that shes gone if id watched her closer made her take gymnastics instead of fencingid never understood her and she knew it somehow and she ran away she didnt run away dave says sometimes lying in bed at night both of us pretending to sleep but really staring at opposite walls and holding ourselves rigid he says this she isnt that kind of girl except that shes gone and is it really easier to believe that someone had taken her had done things to her or that shes locked up helpless somewhere wondering why we dont come looking for her wondering why there isnt a prince to rescue her no she wouldnt look for a prince shed always carried her own sword im the one whod looked for a prince every couple of months dave takes me to the cabin its the family cabin that i share with four of my cousinsa house really with two stories three bedrooms a screenedin porch a stone walkway leading to a tiny wooden dock jutting into the lake where we tie up the canoes dave wants me to get away from the cameras the news the phone calls we still sometimes get from police about tips that didnt pan out every time the phone rings my heart stops is it maggie calling to ask us to come get her and bring her home or is it the police telling us that theyve found her or whats left of her when we came here as a family maggie would sit out on the dock at twilight reading a book and watching the evening mist form over the water she said she dreamed pictures in the haze stories from the books she read they found the car just a few miles away she must be close one way or the other the cabin holds as many difficult memories as the house but i think dave needs the quiet the solitude and he needs to believe that its me who needs the quiet every time we visit i sit on the dock watching the mist and wonder what she saw horses and swords warriors riding out against dragons who breathed fire warriors with long streaming hair who didnt have to disguise themselves as boys those are the stories she told herselfthats what she saw in the mist id sat out here when i was a girl but if i saw pictures in the mist over the water or heard voices calling i dont remember shed dreamed of competing in modern pentathlon in the olympics someday id applauded the goal supported her all i could as best as i knew howyou try to support your children even when you dont understand their dreams or the visions they see in the mist all that was taken away from her from me every time i sit on the dock in the evening dave comes after dark to help me to my feet and lead me back to the cabin ive usually grown too stiff from sitting there and cant bring myself to stand and walk away how long can it go on our lives have stuck waiting for maggie to come home i could stay out on this dock for the rest of my life become a statue sitting here one day dave wont bother coming to get me one day hell just leave sell the house like he wants and start a new life somewhere he has that luxury me ill never have another little girl daves gone to town for groceries he asked me to stay in the house until he got back but ive come to sit on the dock for the afternoon ill get sunburned and when he gets back hell yell at me for it but i wont be offended he yells for other reasons from helplessness well hold each other after he yells at me my skin flushes and tingles and burns in the sun and i stay by the water watching the sun splash flecks of gold on the tiny rippling waves shadows grow long thin and stretched the sky turns an impossible royal blue and the air begins to bite this is when the mist starts to rise from the water when the flecks of gold disappear and the water turns pewter thick like molten metal some birds cry bats dip over the water snatching at insects and fish splash to the surface doing the same and there is splashing more steady than the fish rhythmic and purposeful oars tucked gently into the water not fish leaping carelessly both canoes are tied to the dock no one visits us here or if they do they drive someone is coming over the water and i cant be bothered to stand then it appears sliding out of the mist not a canoe but something larger like a rowboat but stretched its wood not plastic or aluminumboards fitted together and sealed with pitch the bow slopes up and ends in a spiral carving there are four hunched figures in the boat hidden in shadows not shadowstheyre wearing cloaks with hoods up the largest of them sits in the middle and works the oars the oars creak in the oarlocks but the figure itself makes no sound another figure sits in the back holding the long smooth handle of the rudder two more sit in the front one of them leans forward searching the other reaches out for her like hes afraid she might fall over the side im not sure why i think that figure is a woman i wait because i cant not wait pictures in the mist is this what maggie saw had she always seen strangers so that she didnt think them strange and would follow them get into their cars and let them take her away the boat slides up to the end of the dock a rope is thrown out one of the men jumps onto the dock and ties the rope to the post the woman gets out and runs three steps stops stares at me throws back her hood to show her yellow hair and her face my maggies face a little weathered maybe and i wonder what has made her look tired i just stare at her mom the cloak pushed over her shoulders now reaches to her ankles it might be wool thick and homespun she wears a thick leather vest over a longsleeved brown shirt belted over leather pants her tall boots look softer and more comfortable than her usual stiff black riding boots theres a sword hanging from her belt by leather straps its hidden in a scabbard and seems heavier and more threatening than anything she ever used in fencing class she kneels in front of me im hugging my knees to my chest my muscles are frozen but my face is wet mom she says again fearfully her voice cracking you didnt run away i kept telling them you didnt run away i had to go mom i had to maggie they took you away from me they took you away i stare at her my heart bleeding and breaking she is a ghost and i have gone mad at last she puts her arms around me i fall into her embrace sobbing like a child inconsolable she is solid my child not a ghost i look over her shoulder at the men i believei assumetook her away from me masters of some religious cult or a gang were there any boys the police asked and like a fool i said no when i didnt know anything the three of them stand near the boat watching us uncomfortably theyre dressed like maggie in leather and rough cloth high boots scuffed and worn cloaks with hoods studded belts and swords the largest of them has coarse hair tied back with a piece of leather he looks over the water clutching the hilt of his sword hes standing guard the posture is unmistakable the oldest has short hair the color of fog and a trimmed beard he watches the third man who watches my daughter this ones face is set in hard lines his lips frowning an expression that makes him formidable yet handsome unreachably handsome i hate him for the way he watches my daughter with such intensity his eyes burn he has short hair and no beard and wears a polished red stone on a chain this means something this all means something but i cant guess what maggie must sense me staring back at him because she pulls away and turns to look back and forth between us mom i have so much to tell you i clutch her sleeves holding her arms as best i can my knuckles white the scenarios playing in my mind to explain what i see before me are muddled it doesnt help when maggie says this is my husband hes the king king of what the words dont make sense they took you away is all i can find to say i had to go she pulls on my arms helping me to stand i feel like an old woman none of my joints work but a moment later im standing maggie is still talking they needed me they still need me i didnt know what was happening at first i came here something drew me here i watched the mist over the lake like i used to do when i was little this time the mist spoke to me maybe it had always been speaking to me but this time i really heard it i was at that pointi didnt want to go to college couldnt train for the pentathlon and i no idea what to do with my life so i stepped out i stepped over the waterand there he was with the boat waiting she belongs with us the man the one maggie said is a king and her husband speaks im surprised i understand himi expect him to speak a guttural scandinavian language he sets his shoulders fisting his hands like hes preparing to do battle i realize that maggie isnt staying who are you my voice is shrill mom maggie recognizes the tone the grayhaired man steps forward we are warriors protecting you and your world from a darkness you cannot fathom its silly words from the blurb on a paperback we called one of you to join us in the battle for a long time we called almost she came too late he glares like this is my fault i glare like i dont believe him mom i only have a few minutes i have to say goodbye why why call her because you did not answer when i called you and this wasnt me failing my duty to his world i had betrayed him personally that is what his look says to me he might have been the prince in his day had there been a time when i was a girl staying with my family and cousins at the cabin standing on this dock when i heard voices in the mist and ran away because i was afraid wheres dad maggie asks is he here i shake my head i havent heard the car return crunching along the gravel drive hes getting groceries she presses her lips in a line will you tell him i was here will you tell him i love him i love you both im sorry i cant stay maggie the word is a sob filled with desperation its no comfort that shes crying too theres still fighting i have to go the thought of her using that sworda real sword with a sharp edge that draws blood not a dull flexible rod with a button on the tip that registers hits with a green or red lightmakes me ill the thought of her coming up against such a weapon makes me ill the large man says we should go the shadows grow close hes right the mist has become a wall around us the king nods meg its not her name but she nods when had she become meg if she wanted us to call her meg why didnt she say anything she studies me like she expects to never see me again they will have children my grandchildren and i will never see them i want you to be proud of me mom im happy with him i need you to be happy for me you try to be supportive all i want to do is scream but i nod she kisses my cheek then lets go of me the king holds out his hand to her and she takes it a look of such trust passes between them i cant understand it because i come from a world without princes they have saved each others lives he guides her back to the boat maggie i cry stumbling forward falling to my knees i love you dont go please the boat all its passengers aboard fades back to the mist without even a splash you did not answer when i called you just after twilight under a dark blue sky dave finds me lying on the dock as if id curled up to sleep he picks me up carries me to the house puts me to bed and i dont even notice i pretend im dreaming i wake up sometimelamps light the room the windows are darkto smell hot tea and a crackling fire dave sits by the bed watching me with something like desperation he is no king or wizard from the mist his brown hair is thin the hairline receding he wears a plaid flannel shirt untucked over gray sweatpants not leather armor what were you doing out there he says i know the words are crazy but i have to say them because she asked me to i saw maggie she was here she said to tell you she loves you she loves us she had to go rolling to my side i stretch my arm under the pillow and hug it to my face she came back i think strangely happy she didnt have to come back to tell me what happened to her but she did she isnt coming back we stare at each other because after all this time ive made it real saying the words has locked hope away sealed its coffin she isnt coming back dave puts another log on the fire in the bedroom fireplace then watches it burn i dont say another word about seeing maggie and neither does he if i say another word hell say something like therapy or hospital and well fight weve both had counseling apart and together and mainly it helps us get through the day and add up the days so we can get through the weeks and the months but every day has felt like the one before it and we dont know how to move on dave is afraid that insanity is the next symptom of being frozen i can stay frozen for the rest of my life we should get back dave says the next morning at breakfast the neighborsll wonder what happened to us he smiles trying to make it a joke never mind the neighbors daves job wont wait i left mine when i lost maggie not going back is part of being frozen but dave is responsible just a little longer i lean on the edge of the sink looking out the kitchen window at the lake the dock the sun is up sending quicksilver sparkles over the water she stood there yesterday like a dream another day or week or year this is close to where she is wherever she is i think i should stay ill pack up today dave says we can leave tomorrow morning after breakfast i dont bother changing out of my pajamas i pull on a robe slip my feet into canvas sneakers and walk down to the lake i sit crosslegged at the end of the dock close enough to hear water lapping against the wood i can spend a last few moments with her the mist wont rise until evening still i hear the water and think of oars i keep very very still listening for the call i dont know why id obviously never heard it before only whispers easy to ignore i let maggie learn to fight with a sword learn to ride horses like the princesses in the movies never did did i doom her then made sure she heard the call then left me or would she have found those things on her own resented me for keeping them from her and left me anyway i dont know she seemed happy she seemed to be in love i am standing at the edge of the dock toes hanging over the edge of the warped and weathered boards the sun is setting in moments the mist will rise ill call to her as loud as i can ill call take me with you if she cant stay here maybe i can go a gray tendril swirls on the pewter surface of the water i clench my hands i step out an ancient slender boat does not catch me does not rise up to keep me dry i splash into icecold water sink like a stone gasp for breath and choke on water instead reflex takes over because my mind is numb startled at what i have done because of course the boat wasnt there never would come for me and what was i thinking i thrash and kick yet somehow i cant find the surface cant find the air the lake is a trap that has caught me something grabs hold of me takes my arm a force pulls up i try to grab it back but my hands arent in the right place then i touch air then my face reaches air and my mouth gapes open to suck in a breath i sound like a bellows hands pull at my shirt im flopping like a fish in someones grasp my back scrapes against the edge of the dock then im sitting there dave hugs me close clings to me hes shouting what are you doing what do you think youre doing i cant lose you both i cant lose you too hes crying ive never seen him cry i clutch his shirt in clawlike hands to let him know im alive he holds me rocks me and i curl up in his arms i only wanted to see where maggie went i say weakly he shifts moving me away so he can look at me he touches me my face my soaking hair his eyes and nose are running his whole face is wet you think she killed herself he says my eyes widen nooh god no she didnt i wasnt trying but thats what it looks like i pull myself back into his embrace i cant explain it not now i think well never understand what happened youre shivering come in and sit by the fire he helps me stand never lets go of me my own true prince were leaving in the morning right i ask dave nods we reach the cabin close the door and shut out the night before the mist covers the water impossible dreams tim pratt has won a hugo award for short fiction and

home from the revival movie house where hed caught an evening showing of to have and have not when he first saw the video store he stopped on the sidewalk head cocked frowning at the narrow store squeezed between a kitschy gift shop and a bakery he stepped toward the door peered inside and saw old movie posters on the walls racks of dvds and vhs tapes and a big screen tv against one wall the lettering on the door read impossible dreams video and the smudges on the glass suggested it had been in business for a while except it hadnt been pete knew every video store in the county from the big chains to the tiny place staffed by film students up by the university to the little porno shop downtown that sometimes sold classic italian horror flicks and bootleg asian movies hed never even heard of this place and he walked this way at least twice a week pete believed in movies like other people believed in god and he couldnt understand how hed overlooked a store just three blocks from his own apartment he pushed open the door and a bell rang the shop was small just three aisles of dvds and a wall of vhs tapes fluorescent lights and ancient blue industrial carpet and there were no customers the clerk said let me know if you need any help and he nodded barely noticing her beyond the fact that she was female somewhere south of thirty and had short pale hair that stuck up like the fluff on a baby chick pete headed toward the classics section he was a cinematic omnivore but you could judge a video store by the quality of its classics shelf the same way you could judge a civilization by the state of its prisons he looked along the row of familiar titlesand stopped at a dvd turned faceout with a foil new release sticker on the front pete picked it up with trembling hands the box purported to be the directors cut of the magnificent ambersons by orson welles is this a joke he said holding up the box almost angry what the clerk said he approached her brandishing the box and he could tell by her arched eyebrows and guarded posture that she thought he was going to be a problem sorry he said this says its the directors cut of the magnificent ambersons with the missing footage restored yeah she said brightening that came out a few weeks ago you didnt know before you could only get the original theatrical version the one the studio butchered but the missing footage he interrupted it was lost destroyed and the only record of the last fifty minutes was the continuity notes from the production she frowned well yeah the footage was lost and everyone assumed it was destroyed but they found the film last year in the back corner of some warehouse how had this news passed pete by the forums he visited online should have been buzzing with this a film buffs wet dream how did they find the footage its an interesting story actually welles talks about it on the commentary track i mean its a little scattered but the guys in his nineties what do you expect he youre mistaken pete said unless welles is speaking from beyond the grave he died in the s she opened her mouth closed it then smiled falsely pete could practically hear her repeating mental customer service mantras the customer is always right even when hes wrong sure whatever you say do you want to rent the dvd yeah he said but i dont have an account here you local we just need a phone number and id and some proof of address i think ive got my last pay stub pete said rooting through his wallet and passing over his papers she gave him a form to fill out then typed his information into her computer while she worked he said look i dont mean to be a jerk its justid know i know a lot about movies you dont have to believe me she said tapping the dvd case with her finger totals he took out his wallet again but though it bulged with unsorted receipts and scraps of paper with notes to himself there was no cash take a credit card she grimaced theres a fivebuck minimum on credit card purchases sorryhouse rules ill get a couple of other movies he said she glanced at the clock on the wall it was almost i know youre about to close ill hurry he said she shrugged sure he went to the scifi shelfand had another shock i robot was there but not the forgettable action movie with will smiththis was older and the credits said written by harlan ellison but ellisons adaptation of the isaac asimov book had never been produced though it had been published in book form must be some bootleg student production he muttered and he didnt recognize the name of the production company butbutit said winner of the academy award for best adapted screenplay that had to be a student directors little joke straightfacedly absurd box copy as if this were a film from some alternate reality worth watching certainly though again he couldnt imagine how hed never heard of this maybe it had been done by someone local he took it to the counter and offered his credit card she looked at the card dubiously visa sorry we only take weber and fostercard pete stared at her and took back the card she held out to him this is a major credit card he said speaking slowly as if to a child ive never even heard of shrugging she looked at the clock again more pointedly this time sorry i dont make the rules he had to see these movies in matters of filmnew film strange filmpete had little patience though in other areas of his life he was easygoing to a fault but movies mattered please i live right around the corner just let me go grab some cash and come back ten minutes please her lips were set in a hard line he gestured at the magnificent ambersons i just want to see it as it was meant to be seen youre into movies right you understand her expression softened okay ten minutes but thats it i want to get home too pete thanked her profusely and all but ran out of the store he did run when he got outside three mostly uphill blocks to his apartment in a stucco duplex fumbling the keys and cursing finally getting into his sock drawer where he kept a slim roll of emergency cash he raced back to impossible dreams breathing so hard he could feel every exhalation burning through his body a stitch of pain in his side pete hadnt run really run since gym class in high school a decade earlier he reached the bakery and the gift shop but there was no door to impossible dreams video between themthere was no between at all the stores stood side by side without even an alleyway dividing them pete put his hand against the brick wall he tried to convince himself he was on the wrong block that hed gotten turned around while running but he knew it wasnt true he walked back home slowly and when he got to his apartment he went into his living room with its floortoceiling metal shelves of tapes and dvds he took a disc down and loaded it into his highend regionfree player then took his remote in hand and turned on the vast plasma flatscreen tv the surroundsound speakers hummed to life and pete sank into the exquisitely contoured leather chair in the center of the room pete owned a rusty fourdoor honda with miles on the engine he lived mostly on cheap macaroni and cheese and he saved money on toilet paper by stealing rolls from the bathrooms in the universitys admissions office where he worked he lived simply in almost every way so that he could live extravagantly in the world of film he pressed play pete owned the entire twilight zone television series on dvd and now the narrators eminently reasonable voice spoke from the speakers introducing the tale of a man who finds a dusty little magic shop full of wonders as he watched pete began to nod his head and whispered yes pete checked in the morning he checked at lunch he checked after leaving his job in the admissions office in the evening but impossible dreams did not reappear he grabbed dinner at a little sandwich shop then paced up and down the few blocks at the far end of the commercial street near his apartment at he leaned against a light pole and stared at the place where impossible dreams had been hed arrived at what last night but who knew if time had anything to do with the miraculous video stores manifestation what if it had been a onetime only appearance around the door was suddenly there pete had blinked that was all but between blinkings something had happened and the store was present again pete shivered a strange exultation filling him and he wondered if this was how people who witnessed miraculous healings or bleeding statues felt he took a deep breath and went into the store the same clerk was there and she glared at him i waited for you last night im sorry pete said trying not to stare at her did she know this was a shop of wonders she certainly didnt act as though she did he thought she was of the miracle not outside it and to her a world with the magnificent ambersons complete and uncut was nothing special i couldnt find any cash at home but i brought plenty tonight i held the videos for you she said you really should see the welles itll change your whole opinion of his career thats really nice of you im going to browse a little maybe pick up a few things take your time its been really slow tonight even for a tuesday petes curiosity about herthe proprietor or at least clerk of a magic shopwarred with his desire to ransack the shelves you always work by yourself mostly except on weekends there really should be two clerks here but my boss is losing money like crazy with people downloading movies online getting dvds by mail order all that stuff she shook her head pete nodded he got movies online and in the mail too but there was something to be said for the instant gratification of renting something from the store without waiting for mail or download sorry to hear that this seems like a great store are you here every night she leaned on the counter and sighed lately yeah im working as much as i can double shifts some days i need the money i cant even afford to eat lately beyond like an apple at lunch time and noodles for dinner my roommate bailed on me and ive had to pay twice the usual rent while i look for a new roommate it sucks i justah sorry i didnt mean to dump all over you no its fine pete said while she spoke he was able to look straight at her openly and hed noticed that in addition to being a purveyor of miracles she was pretty in a frayedattheedges expunk sort of way not his type at allexcept that she obviously loved movies browse on she said and opened a heavy textbook on the counter pete didnt need any more encouragement than that last night hed developed a theory and everything he saw now supported it he thought this store belonged to some parallel universe a world much like his own but with subtle changes like different names for the major credit cards but even small differences could lead to huge divergences when it came to movies every film depended on so many variablesa directors capricious enthusiasm a studios faith in a script a big stars availability which starlet a producer happened to be sleeping withany of those factors could irrevocably alter the course of a film and hollywood history was littered with the corpses of films that almost got made here in this world some of them were made and pete would go without sleeping for a week if necessary to see as many as possible the shelves yielded miracle after miracle here was the death of superman directed by tim burton starring nicolas cage in petes universe burton and cage had both dropped the project early on here was total recall but directed and written by david cronenberg not paul verhoeven here was the terminator but starring o j simpson rather than arnold schwarzeneggerthough schwarzenegger was still in the film as kyle reese here was raiders of the lost ark but starring tom selleck instead of harrison fordand there was no sign of any later indiana jones films which was sad petes hands were already full of dvds and he juggled them awkwardly while pulling more movies from the shelves here was casablanca starring george raft instead of bogart and maybe it had one of the alternate endings too here a john wayne world war ii movie hed never heard of but the box copy said it was about the ground invasion of the japanese islands and called it a riveting historical drama a quick scan of the shelves revealed no sign of stanley kubricks dr strangelove and those two things together suggested that in this world the atomic bomb was never dropped on japan the implications of that were potentially vastbut pete dismissed broader speculations from his mind as another film caught his eye in this world kubrick had lived long enough to complete artificial intelligence on his own and pete had to see that without steven spielbergs sentimental touch turning the movie into pinocchio you only get them for three days the clerk said amused and pete blinked at her feeling like a man in a dream you going to have time to watch all those im having a little film festival pete said and he washe planned to call in sick to work and watch all these movies and copy them if he could who knew what kind of bizarre copy protection technology existed in this world well my boss wont want to rent twenty movies to a brand new member you know could you maybe cut it down to four or five to save me the hassle of dealing with him you live near here right so you can always bring them back and rent more when youre done sure pete said he didnt like it but he was afraid shed insist if he pushed her he selected four moviesthe magnificent ambersons the death of superman i robot and casablancaand put the others away once hed rented a few times maybe shed let him take ten or twenty movies at once pete would have to see how much sick time he had saved up this was a good time to get a nasty flu and miss a couple of weeks of work the clerk scanned the boxes tapped her keyboard and told him the total he handed over two fives two ones two quarters a dime two nickels and couple of pennieshed brought lots of cash this time the clerk looked at the money on the counter then up at him with an expression caught between amusement and wariness she tapped the bills i know you arent a counterfeiter because then youd at least try to make the fake money look real what is this from a game or something its not foreign because i recognize our presidents except the guy on whats this a dime pete suppressed a groan the money was different hed never even thought of that he began to contemplate the logistics of armed robbery wait youve got a couple of nickels mixed in with the fake money she said and pulled the two nickels aside so thats only you still owe me i feel really dumb pete said yeah its money from a game i was playing yesterday i must have picked it up by mistake he swept up his bills and coins youre a weird guy pete i hope you dont mind me saying nodding dolefully he pulled a fistful of change from his pockets i guess i am he had a lot of nickels which were realor close enoughin this world and he counted them out on the counter worth enough for one movie hed go to the bank tomorrow and change his cash for sacks of nickels as much as he could carry and he would rent all these movies five cents at a time sure he could just snatch all four movies and run now but then hed never be able to come back and there were shelves upon shelves of movies he wanted to see here for tonight hed settle for just the magnificent ambersons this one he said and she took his nickels shaking her head in amusement she passed him a translucent plastic case and pennies in change odd little octagonal coins ill put these away mr nickels she said taking the other movies hed brought to the counter enjoy and let me know what you think of it pete mumbled some pleasantry as he hurried out the door disc clutched tight to his chest and he alternated walking and running back to his apartment once inside he turned on his humming stack of av components and opened the tray on the dvd player he popped open the plastic case and removed the discsimple black with the title in silver lettersand put it in the tray the disc was a little smaller than dvds in this world but it seemed to fit okay the disc spun hummed and the display on the dvd flashed a few times before going blank the television screen read no disc pete swore and tried loading the disc again but it didnt work he sat in his leather chair and held his head in his hands money wasnt the only thing that was different in that other world dvd encryption was too even his regionfree player which could play discs from all over the world couldnt read this version of the magnificent ambersons the videotapes would be similarly uselesshed noticed they were different than the tapes he knew from this world some format that didnt exist here smaller than vhs larger than betamax but all was not lost pete went out the door carrying the magnificent ambersons with him since he couldnt bear to let it go he raced back to impossible dreams do you rent dvd players he gasped out of breath mines broken we do pete she said but theres a deposit you planning to pay that in nickels of course not he said i got some real money from home can i see the player to hell with being reasonable hed snatch the player and run she had his address but this wasnt her world and in a few more minutes the shop would disappear again he could come back tomorrow night with a toy gun and steal all the dvds he could carry he would bring a suitcase to load them all in hed she set the dvd player on the counter with the cord curled on top the electrical plugs two posts were oddly angled one perpendicular to the other and pete remembered that electrical standards werent even the same in europe as they were in north america so it was ridiculous to assume his own outlets would be compatible with devices from another universe he rather doubted hed be able to find an adapter at the local radio shack and even if he could rig something the amount of voltage carried in his wires at home could be all wrong and he might destroy the dvd player the way some american computers got fried if you plugged them into a european power outlet never mind he said defeated he made a desultory show of patting his pockets and said i forgot my wallet you okay pete she asked sure i was just really excited about seeing it he expected some contemptuous reply something like its just a movie the sort of thing hed been hearing from friends and relatives his entire life instead she said hey i get that dont worry well have it in stock when you get your player fixed old orson isnt such a hot seller anymore sure pete said he pushed the dvd back across the counter at her want a refund you only had it for twenty minutes keep it pete said he hung around outside and watched from across the street as the clerk locked up about ten minutes past he blinked and the store disappeared in the moment his eyes were closed he trudged away that night at home he watched his own dvd of the magnificent ambersons with its butchered continuity its studiomandated happy ending tacked on so as not to depress wartime audiences and afterward he couldnt sleep for wondering what might have been pete didnt think impossible dreams was going to reappear and it was before it did he wondered if the window was closing if the store would appear later and later each night until it never reappeared at all gone forever in a week or a day pete pushed open the door a heavy plastic bag in his hand the clerk leaned on the counter eating crackers from little plastic packages the kind that came with soup in a restaurant hi mr nickels she said youre the only customer i get after lately you ah said you didnt have money for dinner lately and i wanted to apologize for being so much trouble and everythinganyway i brought some food if you want some hed debated all day about what to bring fast food was outwhat if her world didnt have mcdonalds what would she make of the packaging he worried about other things tooshould he avoid beef in case mad cow disease was rampant in her world what if bird flu had made chicken into a rare delicacy what if her culture was exclusively vegetarian hed finally settled on vegetarian egg rolls and rice noodles and hot and sour soup hed seen hong kong action movies in the store so he knew chinese culture still existed in her world at least and it was a safe bet that the food would be mostly the same you are a god pete she said opening a paper container of noodles and wielding her chopsticks like a pro you know what i had for lunch today a pear and i had to steal it off my neighbors tree i got the crackers off a tray in the dining hall you saved my life dont mention it im really sorry i was so annoying the last couple of nights she waved her hand dismissively mouth crammed with egg roll and in her presence pete realized his new plan was impossible hed hoped to endear himself to her and convince her to let him hang around until after closing so he could stow away and travel to her world where he could see all the movies and maybe become the clerks new roommate it had all made sense at in the morning the night before and hed spent most of the day thinking about nothing else but now that hed set his plan in motion he realized it was more theatrical than practical it might work in a movie but in life he didnt even know this womans name she wouldnt welcome him into her life and even if she did what would he do in her world he spent all day processing applications ordering transcripts massaging a database and filing things but what would he do in her world what if the computers there had totally different programming languages what would he do for money once his hypothetical giant sack of nickels ran out im sorry i never asked your name he said im ally she said eat an egg roll i feel like a pig pete complied and ally came around the counter ive got something for you she went to the big screen tv and switched it on we dont have time to watch the whole thing but theres just enough time to see the last fifty minutes the restored footage before i have to close up she turned on the dvd player and the magnificent ambersons began oh ally thanks he said hey your dvd players busted and you really should see this for the next fifty minutes pete watched the cast was similar with only one different actor that he noticed and from everything hed read this was substantially the same as the lost footage hed heard about in his world welless genius was apparent even in the butchered rko release but here it was undiluted a clarity of vision that was almost overwhelming and this version was sad profoundly so a tale of glory and inevitable decline when it ended pete felt physically drained and sublimely happy closing time pete ally said thanks again for dinner im a fiend for chinese she gently herded him toward the door as he thanked her again and again glad you liked it she said we can talk about it tomorrow she closed and locked the door and pete watched from a doorway across the street until the shop disappeared just a few minutes after the window was closing the shop appearing for less time each night hed just have to enjoy it while it lasted you couldnt ask more of a miracle than it was willing to give the next night he brought kung pao chicken and asked what her favorite movies were she led him to the employee picks shelf and showed him her selections its mostly nostalgia but i still love the lunch bunchyou know the sequel to the breakfast club set ten years later molly ringwalds awesome in it and return of the jedi i know a lot of people hate it but its one of the best movies david lynch ever directed i thought dune was a muddle but he really got to the heart of the star wars universe its so much darker than the empire strikes back jason and the argonauts by orson welles of course thats on everybodys list pete found himself looking at her while she talked instead of at the boxes of the movies she enthused over he wanted to see them of course every one but he wouldnt be able to and really he was talking to a woman from another universe and that was as remarkable as anything hed ever seen on a screen she was smart funny and knew as much about movies as he did hed never dated muchhe was more comfortable alone in the dark in front of a screen than he was sitting across from a woman at dinner and his relationships seldom lasted more than a few dates when the women realized movies were his main mode of recreation but with allyhe could talk to her their obsessions were congruent and complementary or maybe he was just trying to turn this miracle into some kind of theatrical romance you look really beautiful when you talk about movies he said youre sweet mr nickels pete came the next three nights a few minutes later each time as the door appeared for shorter periods of time ally talked to him about movies incredulous at the bizarre gaps in his knowledgeyouve never heard of sara hansen shes one of the greatest directors of all time pete wondered if shed died young in his world or never been born at all ally had a fondness for bad science fiction movies especially the many ed wood films starring bela lugosi who had lived several years longer in allys world instead of dying during the filming of plan from outer space she liked good scifi movies too especially ron howards enders game pete regretted that hed never see any of those films beyond the snippets she showed him to illustrate her points and he regretted even more that hed soon be unable to see ally at all when the shop ceased to appear as seemed inevitable she understood character arcs the use of color the underappreciated skills of silent film actors the bizarre audacity of prehayescodeera films the perils of voiceover why an extended singlecamera continuous scene was worth becoming rapturous about why the animation of ray harryhausen was in some ways infinitely more satisfying than the slickest cgi she was his people why do you like movies so much he asked on that third night over a meal of szechwan shrimp her leaning on her side of the counter he on his she chewed thinking somebody described the experience of reading great fiction as being caught up in a vivid continuous dream and i think movies do that better than any other kind of story some people say the best movie isnt as good as the best book and i say theyre not watching the right movies or else theyre not watching them the right way my life doesnt make a lot of sense sometimes im hungry and lonely and cold my parents are shit i cant afford tuition for next semester i dont know what i want to do when i graduate but when i see a great film i feel like i understand life a little better and even notsogreat films help me forget the shitty parts of my life for a couple of hours movies taught me to be brave to be romantic to stand up for myself to take care of my friends i didnt have church or loving parents but i had movies cheap matinees when i cut school videos after i saved up enough to buy a tv and player of my own i didnt have a mentor but i had obiwan kenobi and jimmy stewart in its a wonderful life sure movies can be a way to hide from life but shit sometimes you need to hide from life to see a better life on the screen to know life can be better than it is or to see a worse life and realize how good you have it movies taught me not to settle for less she took a swig from her water bottle thats why i love movies wow pete said thats wow so she said looking at him oddly why do you pretend to like movies pete frowned what pretend hey its okay you came in and said you were a big movie buff but you dont even know who sara hansen is youve never seen jason and the argonauts you talk about actors starring in movies they didnt appear in i mean i figured you liked me you didnt know how else to flirt with me or something but i like you and if you want to ask me out you can you dont have to be a movie trivia expert to impress me i do like you pete said but i love movies i really do pete you thought clark gable was in gone with the wind she shrugged need i say more pete looked at the clock he had fifteen minutes wait here he said i want to show you something he ran home the run was getting easier maybe exercise wasnt such a bad idea he filled a backpack with books from his reference shelvesthe encyclopedia of science fiction movies the afi film guide the previous years video and dvd guide othersthen ran back panting he set the heavy bag on the counter books he gasped read gasp see you gasp tomorrow okay pete ally said raising her eyebrow in that way she had whatever you say pete lurched out of the store still breathing hard and when he turned to look back the door had already disappeared it wasnt even yet time was running out and even though ally would soon leave his life forever he couldnt let her think he was ignorant about their shared passion the books might not be enough to convince her tomorrow hed show her something more pete went in as soon as the door appeared at nearly ally didnt waste time with pleasantries she slammed down his copy of the afi desk reference and said what the hell is going on pete took the bag off his shoulder opened it and withdrew his slim silver laptop along with a cd wallet full of dvds gone with the wind he said inserting a disc into the laptop calling up the dvd controls and fast forwarding to the first scene with clark gable ally stared at the lcd screen and pete watched the reflected colors move against her face gables voice though tinny through the small speakers was resonant as always pete closed the laptop gently i do know movies he said just not exactly the same ones you do this those books you youre from another world its like like something out of the twilight zone i know but actually youre from another world every night for an hour or soless latelythe door to impossible dreams appears on my street what i dont understand come on he said and held out his hand she took it and he led her out the door look he said gesturing to the bakery next door the gift shop on the other side the bike repair place across the street ally sagged back against the door halfretreating back inside the shop this isnt right this isnt whats supposed to be here go on back in he said the store has been appearing later and vanishing sooner every night and id hate for you to get stranded here why is this happening ally said still holding his hand i dont know pete said maybe theres no reason maybe in a movie there would be but some movies reassure us that life makes sense ally said and some movies remind us that life doesnt make any sense at all she exhaled roughly and some things dont have anything to do with movies bite your tongue pete said listen keep the laptop the battery should run for a couple of hours theres a spare in the bag all charged up which should be good for a couple more hours watching movies really sucks up the power im afraid i dont know if youll be able to find an adapter to charge the laptop in your worldthe standards are different but you can see a couple of movies at least i gave you all my favorite dvds great stuff by hayao miyazaki beat takeshi wes anderson some classicstake your pick pete he leaned over and kissed her cheek its been so good talking to you these past few nights he tried to think of what hed say if this was the last scene in a movie his casablanca farewell moment and a dozen appropriate quotes sprang to mind he dismissed all of them im going to miss you ally thank you pete she said and went reluctantly back into impossible dreams she looked at him from the other side of the glass and he raised his hand to wave just as the door disappeared pete didnt let himself go back the next night because he knew the temptation to go into the store would be too great and it might only be open for ten minutes this time but after pacing around his living room for hours he finally went out after and walked to the place the store had been thinking maybe shed left a note wishing for some closure some finalreel gesture a rose on the doorstep something but there was nothing no door no note no rose and pete sat on the sidewalk wishing hed thought to photograph ally wondering which movies shed decided to watch and what shed thought of them hey mr nickels pete looked up ally stood there wearing a red coat his laptop bag hanging from her shoulder she sat down beside him i didnt think youd show and i did not relish the prospect of wandering in a strange city all night with only fifty dollars in nickels to keep me warm some of the street names are the same as where im from but not enough of them for me to figure out where you lived ally what are you doing here you gave me those books she said and they all talk about citizen kane by orson welles how it transformed cinema she punched him gently in the shoulder but you didnt give me the dvd but everyones seen citizen kane not where im from the print was destroyed hearst knew the movie was based on his life and he made a deal with the studio the guards looked the other way and someone destroyed the film welles had to start over from nothing and he made jason and the argonauts instead but youve got citizen kane how could i not come see it but ally you might not be able to go back she laughed then leaned her head on his shoulder i dont plan to go back theres nothing for me there pete felt a fist of panic clench in his chest this isnt a movie he said no ally said its better than that its my life i just dont know ally patted his leg relax pete im not asking you to take me in unlike blanche duboisplayed by jessica tandy not vivien leigh where im fromi dont depend on the kindness of strangers i ran away from home when i was fifteen and never looked back ive started from nothing before with no friends or prospects or id and i can do it again youre not starting from nothing pete said putting his arm around her definitely not the lights werent going to come up the curtain wasnt coming down this wasnt the end of a movie for once pete liked his life better than the vivid continuous dream of the screen come on lets go watch citizen kane they stood and walked together just out of curiosity he said which movies did you watch on the laptop oh none of them i thought it would be more fun watching them with you pete laughed ally i think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship she cocked her head and raised her eyebrows you sound like youre quoting something she said but i dont know what weve got a lot of watching to do he said weve got a lot of everything to do ally replied like minds robert reed is the author of more than two hundred works of short science fiction with the occasional fantasy and odd horror thrown into the mix he has also published various novels including marrow and the well of stars two epic tales about a worldsized starship taking a lap around the galaxy his novella a billion eves won the hugo in reed lives in lincoln nebraska with his wife and daughter and a computer jammed with forgotten files this is what you do begin with a fleck of your skin and a modest fee then a psychological evaluation that is little better than nothing and forms to sign always forms then someone wearing a narrow smile sits before you listing the most obvious troubles that come with too much of this very good thing obsessions addictions depression spiritual obliteration chronic indifference or a pernicious amorality that infects every facet of what has always been the truth told a ridiculously insignificant life do you wish to continue that someone asks of course you do do you understand the terms and obligations of this license of course you cannot youve barely paid attention to any of the dark warnings if you really could appreciate the countless risks you wouldnt have come here in the first place are you absolutely certain that you wish to continue she asks one final time or he asks or sometimes several attendants sit before you speaking with a shared voice are you willingly and happily accepting any and all of these negative consequences with a cocky smile you say sure or you say of course i do and leak a nervous sigh or you simply smile and nod and with a tight little voice ask so what happens next next is a cool hand reaching out dropping a tiny white pill into your damp palm there is evidence and much informed conjecture that the pill is a delivery system for subtle technologies that rework the mind most assume that this is how the authority reads thoughts which in turn allows it to turn imprecise wishes into worthy gifts carefully you place the miracle pill on your tongue and swallow there comes a tingling sensation brief and perhaps imagined and then you make yourself laugh telling your audience i know some of us have troubles but i wont youll see im going to do just fine thank you dont worry about me josh is eighteen today and legal he sits in a small room and he sits at the shore of a great ocean barely two meters across the ocean resembles a puddle of quiet gray water that bland appearance is part of its charm josh decides incalculably deep and wondrously complex the ocean is filled with machines too vast and swift to have been built by mere humans to get a sense of the vastness imagine the visible universe thoroughly rebuilt every star and scrap atom is used to build a single computer pushing local physics as far as they can be pushed in every dimension and that machine still cannot make even the most rudimentary calculations necessary to serve that eighteenyearold manchild who sits on a plain wooden stool crouched over the great ocean but of course josh isnt sitting inside just this one room there are trillions of very nearly identical roomswhere trillion is a sloppy fat number meant to imply an immeasurable multitude and there are trillions of identical joshes peering down into a uniform graynessa shared quantum linkage connecting all that is potential and possible and everything inevitable for josh and his world this linkage is a very new technology hello he whispers nervously the gray surface shimmers slightly then josh says a book a novel words cause a multitude of realms to work together the authority suddenly engaged a deceptively quiet voice asks the obvious who is the author of this book this novel josh can say any name but he takes a deep breath and blurts me by me the authority inquires do you mean your own genotype this is why josh surrendered a piece of his own skin his very complex and specific dna serves as an identity and as a marker sure yeah my genotype then he flinches confessing this is my first time but the authority knows that already are there other criteria like what josh had thought that he came prepared but he feels sick with nervous energy almost too anxious to think i pick random examples the authority cautions but you may narrow the category in significant ways for instance what is the authors age how well did this novel sell and did the author win any awards or commendations awards he hadnt quite thought of that you mean whatlike the nobel prize exactly the nobel prize certainly the voice purrs josh licks his lips im a very good writer he boasts people say so then with a nervous gravity he says okay i wrote the novel in my thirties and i won the nobel prize and the pulitzer too does the novel have a theme i dont care then he reconsiders saying maybe yeah how about how it feels to be eighteen yeah i want a novel about growing upa comingofage story you know are there any other criteria sir with a determined nod josh says no thats plenty a closed doorway stands behind him each of the other milky white walls is equipped with its own makeportal from one portal comes a thick leatherbound volume that hits the floor with an impressive thud josh picks it up and turns to the title page reading a name that isnt his but why should the author call himself josh thorngate besides genetics they might share nothing at all and what will be next sir politics josh closes the book from his tone and upright posture it is obvious that he has given this request some consideration i want my memoirs or a journalfrom a universe where im an old man and important like a president or some sort of world leader perhaps you might narrow your aim josh agrees and trying not to miss an opportunity he asks like how there are many forms of government democracy josh suggests but that doesnt sound original does it no wait what else is possible the authority begins by listing the familiar democratic governments quickly spiraling outwards into increasingly peculiar political systems when the voice says something about a holy godhood josh interrupts asking whats that a despotic state the authority allows high technologies are concentrated in one persons hands and he or she rules over a population of worshipful peasants that he blurts thats what i want he says i want a journal written by my genotype who happens to be the leader of a holy godhood and then please the second makeportal opens the resulting volume is deceptively small with too much text for any reasonable book fifty thousand pages of private thoughts have been buried inside a few sheets of bound plastic josh stands and walks around the ocean opening the cover and calling up a random page and then i gave him wings he reads and because he had scorned me i chased him high enough that his lungs froze and he plunged back to earth again he blanks the page and sighs settling on the stool again you have one more request the authority reminds him three requests are standard for each session three gifts from the compliant genie why is that nearly universal among humans sir the authority prods josh is eighteen bright and possessing some genuine talents standardized tests and wellmeaning teachers have told him to expect good things from his life and his devoted if rather critical parents have inflated his sense of selfworth that and he is eighteen years old he has one overriding talenta passion that will never be greater than it is today and because it is his request to make he grins as he says i want a digital a video made by me at my age and with my background very very close to this reality i understand sir having sex yes sir the voice couldnt be less surprised having sex with two girls at once silence are there any examples like that quietly the voice asks would you like to request specific women what name two women eighteen years old or older and if they are registered in this reality i could conceivably gather enough material to fill the rest of your natural life sir josh already knew this but understanding an abstract theory isnt the same as hearing it promised and a promise is nothing compared to a belief he shivers now and grins and feels deliciously ashamed but first the authority says with a slightly ominous tone what what is it you must give your gifts now sir since you are requesting three examples of your genotypes accomplishments you must surrender three works from your own life and accomplishments please this can be a trauma sometimes the client examines his own gifts with a suddenly critical eye and all confidence collapses how can a tiny soul measure up against nobel winners and godlike despots but eighteenyearold boys are a blend of cockiness and unalloyed ignorance without hesitation josh pulls three offerings from a long gym bag a fat rambling term paper about the role of robots in the war of ignorance an elevenpage story about a misunderstood adolescent and a comic book written by him and illustrated with help from a popular software the superhero wearing joshs face and his unremarkable fantasies about violence and revenge with a gentle importance he sets his gifts on top of the infinite ocean each item sinks and vanishes and when they are found suitablemeaning complex enough and unique to this singular realityjosh is allowed to finish his final request with a dry mouth he names the two most beautiful girls from high school but one girl hasnt registered josh learns so in a moment of inspired lust he mentions his thirtyyearold twicedivorced algebra teacher then in the next breath a shiny disc drops from the final makeportal he grabs it up and laughs pocketing the disc and then shoving his lesser treasures into his gym bag thank you josh tells the authority youre welcome sir then as he stands ready to leave the voice says visit me again sir which is as close to a joke as the authority ever comes it is a wonderful world as is every earth perched beside the great ocean experience and technical expertise pass into the authority and they emerge again shared with all for very minimal fees very quickly lives have improved wealth and princely comfort are the norm few work and fewer have to today every house is spacious and beautiful each powered by some tiny devicea fusion reactor no bigger than a thumb perhaps food and fine china and furnishings and elaborate cloths are grown in makeportals produced new every day water is recycled toilets are always clean and sweetsmelling unless the inhabitants dont require prosaic nonsense like food or their own corporeal bodies many many things are possible and everything possible is inevitable and this one particular world no matter how peculiar is just about as likely as any other each citizen owns a million great novels every digital library is filled with wonderful movies and holo programs immersion games and television shows plays and religious festivals captured by cameras and spectacles that cannot easily be categorized even local classics exist in a million alternate forms varied endings different beginnings or every word or image exactly the same but created by entirely different hands surrounded by such wealth the crushing chore is to decide what to watch and read and play which of these remarkable snowflakes do you snatch from the endless blizzard this is why people gravitate towards the familiar in the absolute mayhem of everything possible why not find treasures that have been created in one fashion or another by you or at least by some great version of your own little self because no one else may look at the ocean the divine one kills the slaves who carried him to this place he murders them with a casual thought and drinks a little ceremonial blood from each and then flings the limp carcasses into the stinking heap that always stands beside the great temple then he waves an arm in a particular way awakening a network of machines that make the crust shiver and split yet even as the ground rolls beneath him the ocean remains perfectly still unimpressed when he speaks machines enlarge his tiny human voice old friend he announces with a sharp peal of thunder i am here the response is silence three genealogies give me three family trees with my greatness astride the highest finest branch no says the authority yes first it says you must honor me with three gifts i honor no one but myself for a moment the authority says nothing and then quietly it asks must we debate this point each time of course the divine one laughs heartily for a long while our debates are half the fun my friend are we friends the divine one stands at the shorelinean outwardly ordinary man peering down into the opaque fluid in my life every other creature is my slave my personal imperfect possession you are the exception why else would i look forward to our meetings like me you are immortal like me you are wondrously free you have your own voice and your own considerable powers even if i wished i could never abuse you i am a puddle the authority interrupts a drop of goo you could boil me to steam to nothing and fill the hole that remains with your own shit i could never destroy you he replies never why not the divine one pauses grins we both know perfectly well this is but one world and i am only one god removing you from this single place would be like stealing just one cell from my immortal hide a pause then again the authority says three gifts three trinkets he rumbles thats what i will give you a new slave appearsa beautiful young woman with a dead face and full hands she keeps her eyes down setting an ornate satchel at the feet of her living god and then she kneels and dies without complaint once her body has been drained of a little blood and thrown aside he opens the satchel using his own little hands he looks tentative fingers unaccustomed to handling mundane objects his first offering is a journal encompassing the last three moons of his life the second is an immersion recording showing the long day festival that he choreographed half a million bodies parading and dancing along the avenue of honored bones and a nanoscale digitalhis third offeringshows the sculpture that he fashioned at the end of that very good day fashioned from the harvest of severed limbs and breasts and sexual organs without comment the ocean swallows the three gifts three genealogies he repeats you know my tastes each offering has to be different from my family tree and different from each other and i want stories i want to see from my genotypes origins back into the deepest imaginable past with biographies of the ancestors when possible it is an enormous request which means that it takes all of three heartbeats to accomplish the results appear as sophisticated maps injected into his enhanced consciousness and with a genuine relish he sets those elaborate trees beside his own ancestral history marveling at how genes and circumstances interact to produce what is always in a very narrow sense him are we finished the authority asks when i found you the divine one begins then he sighs correcting himself when my agents of discovery built the first quantumpiercing machines and i reached into the optional universes and found you waiting for me yes i was intrigued and furious since i am just one existence inside an incalculable vastnesswell i felt righteously pissed and intrigued the authority repeats deeply relentlessly with a decidedly human gesture he shrugs how many years have we been meeting this way an astonishing number is offered it has been a rewarding friendship he claims lonely gods need a good companion or two silence tell me and be honest now the god smiles asking how many of my genotypes are learning from my lessons as i stand here as i breathe how many of them are taking what i give them and then setting out to conquer their own little worlds i cannot give a number the authority replies but there is a multitude isnt that so many the voice concedes yes the divine one launches into a roaring laugh the sound swelling until the great temple quivers and crumbles dust and slabs of rock falling on all sides until later he promises until always the authority purrs one of the more difficult conceptsone that can still astonish after a lifetime of study and hard thoughtis that fact that your parents are not always your parents probability and wild coincidence will always find ways to create you a couple makes love each donating half of their genetic material to the baby if each parent happens to contain half of your particular genes who is to say that you cant be the end result or perhaps parents consciously tweak their embryos genetics aiming for some kind of enhancement and getting you in the bargain or there is the less likely earth where cloning is the norm and you are a temporarily popular child millions of you born in a single year and then there is an even more peculiar earth where you have been built from scratch inside someones laboratory synthetic genes stitched together by entities that arent in the littlest bit human the salient point is that your parents dont have to be your parents and frankly in the vast majority of cases they are not which implies if you follow that same relentless logic that the grandparents and history are even less likely to remain yours in three days josh will be twentysix years old he sits with his parents eating their pot roast when he was a boy back in the days when meat bled and mothers cooked their sunday roasts were always dry as sawdust but even though his mother has a fully modern kitchen her cultured roast has still been tortured to a dusty brown gristle this must be how they like it josh decides old people he thinks dismissively they can never change can they shaking his head josh cuts at the tough meat and his mother asks what are you doing eating he growls that isnt what she means his father snaps i mean with your life she says then with a practiced exasperation she reminds him weve always had such hopes for you dear josh drops his knife and fork staring at the opposite wall you always had such promise honey the young man sighs heavily why did he believe this night would go any other way bullshit says his father its bullshit youre wasting your life playing around with that goddamn authority yeah well mutters josh its my life you dont see us visiting it every day its not that often josh shakes his head explaining there arent enough facilities for the demand and there wont ever be thats how its rationed once every six weeks is the most i can manage and then what mother whines all day and night you play with your treasures isnt that right josh reaches under the dining room table and dont give me your bullshit about leading a contemplative life father warns a thick finger stabbing in his direction i dont want to hear how youre getting in touch with your genius and the rest of that bullshit if josh had doubts or second thoughts they just vanished silently with a cold precision he opens the envelope and sets out portraits arranging them in rows on the dining table ten twenty thirty pictures in all in each image some version of josh smiling at the unseen camera in each a different set of parents smile with an honest warmth loving hands draped across his shoulders or running their fingers through his hair clothes vary and the backgrounds in one image saturn and its silvery rings halfway fill the sky but what matters is what remains unchangedthe seamless loving joy of proud parents and their very happy son joshs parents arent idiots they know exactly what he is showing them now leave me alone josh snaps backing away from the table i mean it stay out of my life what happens nextwhat will gnaw at him for yearsis the weeping not from his mother who simply looks sad and a little deflated no its father who bursts into tears fists rubbing hard at eyes and a stupid stupid blubbering coming from someplace deep and miserable a person with your genetics can emerge in any century any eon you might be a general in napoleons army or the first human to reach alpha centauri or a talented shaman in the age of flint even your world is subject to the same whims and caprices stare into the deepest reaches of the gray ocean gaze past every little blue earth and you realize that the basic beginnings of humanity can emerge from a host of alternate hominids and from myriad cradleworlds that only look and taste and feel like this insignificant home of yours josh is in his early thirties age is supposedly meaningless now aging is a weakness and a disease left behind in more cramped less brilliant times but most people who reach their thirties still start to sense the weight of their years and with experience they suffer those first nagging thoughts about limits and death and the great nothingness that lies beyond three gifts please this could be the same room as the first room it is not but the look of the place is exactly the same a door and white walls and three makeportals the gray ocean still lies at his feet the authoritys voice is quiet and insistent and perfectly patient josh continues to visit every six weeks a pattern has evolved and calcified he brings the same ragged gym bag with the same three basic offerings he has a comprehensive journal of his last fortytwo days he has written a story or poem into which he has put some small measure of work and with a digital recorder he has captured an hour of his life a sexual interlude oftentimes a wedding or swap party on occasion or like today an hour of nothing but josh speaking to the camera trying to explain to an unseen audience what it means to be him again the authority asks do you have three gifts josh nods and hesitates i was wondering he mutters how likely is itthat someone else actually notices what ive done here silence i know everything possible has to happen the gym bag is set between his feet staring at the worn plastic handles he says right now a trillion josh thorngates are handing their gifts to you were identical to each other right down to the heisenberg level our gifts are the same the only difference is that in these other universes some bug near alpha centauri runs right not leftor a photon from some faraway quasar goes unseen or some tiny bullshit like that josh hesitates for an instant so what are the odds his expression is serious determined if you have a random trillion entities with my genotype named josh or not from this earth or somewhere else what are the odds that just one of them is going to see this stupidass poem that is a fine question the authority replies josh almost grins thank you i guess three gifts if you please arent you going to give an answer no the grin dissolves into a grimace with a practiced formality josh sets the three items on the surface of the ocean watching them sink and vanish but the authority remains silent for longer than usual prompting josh to ask for the first time are they unique enough enough is the verdict give me a journal josh says i want a very specific journal such as from a world where im the last living human a moment later a drab brown journal falls from the first makeportal bringing with it the scent of fire and rot grabbing the prize he says and now another journal from a world where im the very first human being the second portal opens another volume falls to the floor in every way it is the same as the first the same brown cover the same stink of decay and heat and inside the same handwritten words translated into joshs language the surprise freezes him but arent there stories about this sort of coincidence or jokeor whatever you want to call it what else the authority asks then after a quiet moment it says josh it says what else would you like today josh he snorts and shakes his head a digital he manages sticking to his original script im the last human male on earth and all of the surviving women have to come to me for sex the disc hits the floor rolls until it collides with his gym bag and then falls onto its back he doesnt pick up the disc instead with a low wary voice he asks who built you everyone built me the voice replies everyone builds me now but who started you who built your foundation josh presses asking do you know what world and what people began piecing you together silence i mean it must have been ages ago and a very advanced world unless i am lying the authority warns and nobody built me josh flinches you should ask your other question again the voice recommends eyes wide josh begins to open his mouth not that i will supply any answers the authority interrupts but you should pose the question how likely is it that i will be noticed ask ask ask and perhaps something good will come from that wondering you are to be the future they tell me but there is no future the scourge doesnt know your tissue your taste they explain to me we made you so that we could cross with you our offspring will acquire your immunities and you will father an entirely new species beginning now but the scourge spreads faster than anticipated and when it doesnt kill it drives its victims insane even now the mob runs like rivers in the street even here inside this armored laboratory i can smell the fires as the city burns time is short they admit i spend my days squirting my unique stuff into important little bottles time is very short she moans she is small and thick and smells like an animal with my eyes shut and my nose wrapped in a towel i crawl on top of her and push and pump and in my head i try to imagine any creature more desirable than this what begins with an intoxicating addictive joy can eventually grow stale imagination carries the soul only so far more than you realize you tend to make the same basic requests of the authority to see versions of yourself dressed in power fame and incandescent wealth and to balance that equation you occasionally glance at yourself in the throes of misery and despair sometimes this is enough you never ask for more but sometimes after ten years or a thousand your capacity to learn and feel astonished has become noticeably dulled gradually inexorably that sweet initial thrill fades into a soft emotional hum then your only obvious choice is to cast an even larger net you want to see yourself you tell the authority except that you spell out an important change or two little alterationsa stitch here and a tuck thereall buried in your otherwise equal genetics no matter how brilliant or wise every male inevitably asks to see how his life would have progressed with a larger more talented penis while females always hunger for greater beauty many many times this is where it ends you never progress past a diet of simple whatifs and prurient eavesdropping then the rest of your narrow existence is spent sitting at home watching digitals or immersions where gigantic or perfectly gorgeous versions of yourself share their days with equally spectacular specimens they could be married they often joke that they are husband and wife in every universe except for this one pauline is pretty and she is sexually creative and she absolutely adores josh and josh worships her isnt it astonishing that they found one another two people so perfectly meshed its a rare blessing in any age their friends and siblings arent nearly as lucky they realize time after time they find themselves taking bleak comfort from the divorces and other larger tragedies that afflict those around them josh has been with pauline for ten years and in another ten or fifteen years they will start their family thats the plan the inevitability another decade spent as the golden couple and then they will gladly move to their next joyous stage they always visit the authority together two avid users they first met in the waiting room josh leaving just as pauline came inside of course they still use separate rooms only an official attendant can enter with a client but afterwards they always share their new treasures with each other josh likes to collect digitals showing alternate incarnations of them as a couple sexual interludes weddings babies born or graceful double funerals at the end of happy shared lives on this particular day he requests two digitals paulines birthday is next week and he wants a celebration from a highly advanced worlda place where people never age and his love has turned a robust and youthful one million years old the other digital comes from what might be an even stranger realitywhere pauline is a queen the ruler of a decidedly alien world and josh is the ignorant peasant boy who has been brought in to serve the queens notsodelicate needs and your third request the authority presses the divine one says josh i want an undated journal from him the despot has always intrigued him every year without fail josh allows himself another little taste of that spoiled silly god with a thump the last item hits the floor josh reads the first line no no no liar no he laughs puzzled and a little thrilled then with the digitals in his pockets and the journal in his bag he leaves stepping out into the hallway to find pauline waiting for him she has been crying what josh asks she shakes her head wipes at her eyes and again with her little mouth clamped shut she shakes her head what happened he demands to know but pauline wont say they walk outside and she says josh what but she cant find the words tears flow and she sobs and when they are riding home just the two of them she says i love you i love you too he replies warily for a moment she seems pleased but when the tears slacken she becomes distant almost cold josh has to wonder if this is the same woman that he woke up beside a tentative voice asks what did you get today her answer is a cold stare show me he demands nothing special with an expert eye he examines the designations and reads a few random lines what could have happened stop she begs their car obeys instantly for an instant she smiles but if anything it is a mocking expression that only makes josh angrier and more scared ill be right back she promises stepping out into the sunshine they have parked outside a small local park its ornate garden enclosed by a high iron fence where are you going josh asks wait here she tells him he does for a moment too long at least he waits for her to return then he gets out and follows passing through the black gate and into a little green glade there he finds pauline dead a suicide apparently or maybe he doesnt find her body maybe josh follows her footprints across the sweet damp grass observing that she was running the entire way passing through the park and through the opposite gate and regardless what happens after that she is gone she is lost as good as dead to him no no no liar no he writes then he drops the minds stylus furious eyes gazing at each of the new offerings from the gray puddle i dont believe this none of this youve invented these silly trees just to anger me the puddle doesnt reply the silly trees are three vast and comprehensive genealogical records each record begins differently and each ends the same a creature with his glorious genetics rules not just this world but the entire sky as well to the ends of the galaxy and beyond these three gods hold sway shit he mutters a young slave stands nearby watching his display with a fascinated horror the divine one is so perplexed and furious that he hasnt bothered to kill her yet and he barely notices her now seeing the faintest trace of a hope she runs he kills her at the temples door and drains her body dry of its blood shit he repeats you made this all up he claims knowing that that cannot be true you did this just to be cruel you fucker the authority remains silent its gray face calm and smooth because you feel unhappy you must be deeply flawed in an era of plenty and enlightenment how can you do anything but smile when you look at realities very close to yours you see yourself smiling your grinning happy face is wrapped around bubbly creatures that arent at all like you creatures that seem to enjoy everything about this wondrous boundless existence in the midst of this life you begin to kill yourself they warned you that this could happen years ago they told you that suicide was more than a real hazard it was a statistical certainty by every means imaginable and none original you busily extinguish your lifetrillions of times every instant accomplishing in the process a measurable and important nothing josh delivers his last three offerings the final fortytwo days of his journal and a short story about a billionyearold man who can never escape living the same velvet day over and over and finally a digital that he makes while he sits beside the ocean discussing the nature of the universe and himself with the grayvoiced authority tell me that im not small josh begs but the authority cannot give that simple gift honest and inflexible it says but you are small unimportant josh moans you are trivial josh of course you are then it takes a different tact given the opportunity it asks would you want to matter would you wish to live in a universe where every motion of yours matters where your mistakes sweep away the stars and the laws of nature need your constant attentions yes and yes josh says and no and never no silence descends the first two offerings have dropped from view swallowed by the gray fluid now josh removes the disc from his camera and watches as it dissolves into the everything what do you want today josh he doesnt seem to hear the question he cocks his head as if listening to a sound only he can hear and with that josh begins to nod reaching inside the gym bag a calm hand bringing up a simple black pistol the weapon just made itself born from a package of cream cheese a stack of coins and a dusting of microchines a single bullet resides in the newborn chamber with a smooth certain motion he lifts the barrel to his head his mouth his temple the soft tissues behind his lower jaw sometimes and he squeaks pauline as he abruptly tugs at the trigger setting loose a nearly infinite series of astonishingly quiet little barksa bullet smaller than his little finger passing through the soft wet center of his mind but in at least one reality the gun fails a mistake in fabrication unthinkably rare and inevitable spares him spares him and embarrasses him a long strange moment passes josh staring at the pistol a sense of betrayal surging giving him a temporary rage he flings the pistol at the ocean and with a drumlike thump it skips sideways sliding across the floor and into one of the white corners again just as calmly as before the authority asks what do you want today josh cant you tell he laughs and sobs and on shaky legs he rises and walks over to the pistol recovering it before returning to his stool will the gun work now the question appears in his face his actions with a stubborn hopefulness he brings the barrel back up to his temple and only at the last instant does he notice the new pressure like an insistent little tug it keeps him from feeling the barrel kissing his skin he feels warm fingers that arent his little fingers curling around his suddenly trembling hand he looks back over his shoulder she says maybe not who is the woman then he remembers she was sitting in the outer office sitting behind the first desk as he came in for his appointment her name is not today she tells him what i dont think you should who are you teller she replies what whats that my name teller she spells it and smiles at first glance she looks young but everybody looks young and it means nothing something in the eyes or deeper implies an age substantially greater than his own anyway she says with a fond assurance you cant actually kill yourself why not and she laughs apparently enjoying his foolishness his desperate folly of course you cant how could you havent you paid any attention to what weve been telling you he shakes his head woefully again with an unnerving determination the authority asks what three things do you want today josh with an easy strength teller pulls the pistol from his hand answer him she suggests how about he pauses thinking in clumsy obvious ways okay he says a journal from someone exactly like me and from right after his botched suicide the first makeportal opens disgorging its gift he looks up at the woman admitting i didnt come with a list this time i dont know dont lie she warns then she takes a halfstep backwards as if giving him a taste of privacy theres something you desperately want to see he blurts the name of his lover twice he says pauline and then adds where she didnt kill herself she went through the gate and i found her waiting for me naked thats the universe i want a digital showing us together there okay a disc falls to the floor and rolls what else the authority asks sad eyes blink and lift another digital he blurts showing me having sex with he glances at his savior she shrugs her shoulders amiable to whatever he wishes not that josh drops his head his face flushing slowly slowly a curious look builds and then he smiles abruptly saying i want an autobiography except each of my novel genes are changed are a little different its a kind of cheat he used to play this game with pauline the two of them changing identities except he says i want tellers genes and im living on a distant very alien world a narrow smile builds under the old eyes does that make any sense he asks somebody teller or the authority or maybe himself but it must make sense beside him the last makeportal opens and out flies an enormous metallic butterfly accompanied by a wild music and a fragrance like sweat and cinnamon or you somehow manage to escape suicide you are just lucky enough or maybe youre composed of sterner stuff either way you find yourself alive but the authority still remains and after some cold consideration you decide that it is the central problem in your tiny life once the source of edification and strength it is now something else entirely a temptation and weakness an affliction growing more dangerous with time and a drug that has long ago scorched away your sites of delicious attachment a smart person knows what to do with strength and a steely resolve anyone can save themselves give up the drug deny the enticement the authority is a piss hole tiny and unworthy of your attentions tell it so declare that you wont visit again and then dont you might live another ten thousand years and if you cant find the energy and focus to be busy every moment then you must not be trying very hard now are you in this realm at least in your life you simply admit defeat the authority is too much of an attraction so you walk away simply and forever you leave temptation behind perhaps you join communities of likeminded souls on distant moons you and your new companions live like monks life is stripped to its minimal best horizons end at the horizon and only a select few works of literature wait on the shelves begging to be read again and if it is true that every action and thought achievement and failure are repeated endlessly throughout creation if originality is nothing but an illusion well at least inside these virtuous walls amidst the dust and silent shadows every little word you utter sounds fresh and feels almost at least a little bit worthy conquering the sky would be a childs waste of time but he is a grand magnificent child and like anyone with enough pride and vanity he revels in his glorious undertaking his first act is to boil the gray puddle to steam and smoke then with stirring words and programmed thoughts he marshals his world loyal slaves quickly fashioning a fleet of starships each ship vast and swollen with fuel armored and bristling with every awful weapon then from the underside of his own tiny phallus the divine one scrapes away a few living cells coaxing each to divide and differentiate a thousand clones of himself grown in a thousand puddles of warm salty water each clone receives injections of memories and dreams while maturing each baby is given the same powerful tools that have made his life such a perfect pleasure at some point even the divine one is uncertain who is the original among the thousand and one he is just another captain of a starship his destination set eyes forward their destinations are the thousand and one closest suns the exhaust from so many great engines boils the earth to a bubbling cherrycolored slag but he pretends not to notice only the slaves look back at the dead world they are checking the plasma flows they claim and none of them weep they know better than to grieve weep and die that is his rule the earth was just a temporary island of rock and metal they tell themselves and it just happens to be gone while in a multitude of other realms it lives on this breeds hope that idea of undiluted possibility for slaves the little gray ocean remains a promisetheir only tangible sign that no existence no matter how awful and how wicked has any genuine importance at all and then my cocoon split on its skyside josh reads aloud and what i saw first was my last skin smiling at me he stops reading setting down the butterfly book teller watches him a very old woman when this earth discovered the authority her body has been regenerated by most means but not everywhere the bare breasts have a telltale sag and the pubic hair is shot full of white perhaps because of these details teller seems both exotic and uniquely handsome in every circumstance she carries herself with a seamless confidence her smile is pleasant and wise but distant and it is the distance that often infuriates josh she knows something he complains why wont she tell him what she knows the creature is looking at her last skin she offers the skin she was wearing before her pupae stage i figured as much he replies attempting to laugh the alien is a much more complex species than humans in one incarnation she possessed a humans body and mind then she slept and grew the humanlike genes falling asleep too a stew of new genes transforming her into something infinitely more marvelous ive never seen anything like this josh complains like what so different so bizarre deep eyes grow even more distant what wont she tell him it doesnt pick at random he says ive known that for years everybody knows it who doesnt pick at random josh wont say the name the authority instead he shakes his head asking why did it show me this because i just tried to kill myself she watches him or because you were there with me maybe then her eyes lift higher i dont know she responds her voice quiet nothing deceitful in its tone or her expression if either of those things played a role in its choice i cant say he jumps on one word choice he repeats so you know that it does choose i mean she shrugs pulling her strong young legs against her sagging breasts you havent told me she mentions what do you really think about this strange woman josh has read the butterfly diary at least a dozen times and there have been little moments when he almost feels that he understands what the creature wrote not in words but she wrote them as scents as pheromones yet despite the damage done by translations and the pervading alienness to every portion of this text josh feels an eerie sense that he already knows this other understands her even that she is his friend or some distant sister or she is the lover sitting in his own bed watching him with her own secret gaze he closes the book and places it back inside its cage in the corner of an eye he sees a knowing grin but her face goes blank when he looks straight at her again he says thank you as always she asks for what then she shrugs laughing with tenderness like i told you you came that day looking so sad and desperate and alone and i wanted to help did all of you come help me the question is ludicrous and he knows it what josh wants is to hear her answer and the tone of her voice only me she says not true but then she touches his bare knee and smiles and asks really now how many more than one would be enough i am wings tied about a soul which flies past the skin of the sky and i am enormous and sometimes i am sad i miss my legs my walk in my dreams i am small and ugly and happy in my dreams the sky is unreachable and the sky could not be more magnificent almost as easily as you kill yourself you murder whole worlds fusion exchanges nanochine blooms conscious plagues or simple kinetic blasts your methods of annihilation run the gamut from what is likely to the slightly less likely and your reasons are pulled from the same bloody mix of excuses selfhatred selfpity selfrighteous fury or some little accident happens to slip tragically out of hand every moment you kill too many worlds to count and within each of those brutal moments a trillion times as many worlds continue to prosper happy and fertile beneath a loving wellloved sun after eons of uninterrupted exploration and conquest the divine one finally discovers an opponent with real muscle and heart the world has jupiters mass oceans of acid sloshing against continents built of warm black iron its aliens are decidedly alien their physiology genetics and basic morphology conform to an entirely different evolution but they are organized one leader at the helm and all the rest willingly enslaved for thirty centuries the war is a clash of equals but the divine one is quicker to adapt and at least in this one reality he finds one tiny critical advantage and in a matter of hours he manages to defeat and butcher the entire alien horde then alone he descends he finds his opponent the oncegreat despot hiding inside a steel temple and with a thought he kills the creature kills it and drains it of its strange white blood and tosses the corpse over the far horizon then he sets out to explore the broad hallways and giant rooms of the temple examining sculptures made from body parts and images of parades celebrating suffering and sacrifice his enemy was remarkably similar to him despite all of their profound differences they were very much the same here lived a god in mortal clothes and what if he had spared the creature what if they had spoken how much more would they have found in common in the backmost room behind a series of massive doors he discovers the bottomless gray ocean waiting what are you doing here the divine one roars the authority calls to him by name and then says hello again my friend you arent the same puddle he complains i dont believe this what kind of trick is this three offerings the authority calls out and as always in return i will give you three items of your choice the divine one orders his journal brought to him riding in a highgravity walker a slave girl enters the room then he carves the journal into three equal hunks each portion enormous each describing a separate million years of wandering through the milky way one after the other the offerings sink into the thick gray fluid and then with a quiet decidedly unimpressed voice the authority says accepted standing beside the ocean the divine one shivers do you want your usual the authority inquires three genealogies leading up to lesser incarnations of yourself no he whispers no he rumbles then with a sorry shake of the head he says show me three journals from minds like mine and bodies that are not thinking the truth is easy you fit together the puzzle more often than you realize and in the normal course of days you dismiss the idea as ludicrous or ugly or useless or dull understanding is less easy you have to learn a series of words and the concepts that come attached to those words and real understanding brings a kind of appreciation cold and keen not too different from the cutting edge of a highly polished razor blade but believing the truth embracing the authentic with all of your self conscious and otherwise that is and will always be supremely difficult if not outright impossible josh sits alone studying his lost loves journals something obvious has occurred to me he reads hearing paulines voice and ever since i cant think about anything else but i cant talk about it not to anyone not even josh not even after sitting here for an entire day i cant seem to put down even a single word that hints at this thing that i know how can i tell josh show him help him see closing the journal josh wipes at his eyes and thinks and after a very long while with a courage barely equal to the task he starts to examine every treasure that his lost love acquired over the last five years given to her by an entity that does nothing by chance he cries for a while and then he stops another voice is crying astonishingly he forgot about the slave girl she remains inside the walker waiting to be killed sad and hopeless she wipes at her wet eyes and her bladder lets loose a thin trickle of urine and she very nearly begs please kill me now and remove me from all this misery he wont with a gesture he wraps her inside a more subtle exoskeleton then he beckons to her saying come here sit next to me she has to obey doesnt she sit he says again and then unexpectedly he says or stand whatever makes you happiest she kneels beside the bottomless ocean give it three offerings he suggests three things you have made or written down three examples of yourself the girl nearly faints and then with a soft suspicious voice she asks why but he cannot tell her why that becomes instantly obvious all that the divine one can manage is to throw a warm arm around her naked shoulder squeezing her with a reassuring strength and with a mouth that is a little dry and little nervous he kisses her on the soft edges of her ear teller instantly senses that josh knows yet they still cant talk about it not directly not as long as there is still some taste of ignorance in the world around them what they can do is smile and hold hands sharing an enlightened warmth thinking hard about how the world will change when everyone understands josh has already made his next appointment with the authority as it happens teller is at work that day she sits behind her usual desk smiles and kisses him before he walks to the usual room with the authority he can talk with a genuine pride he can tell it i understand now i know the voice purrs its really awfully simple he says looking back i suppose i must have heard the idea or thought it up for myselfi dont know maybe a couple million times the silence has an approving quality one soul he says thats all there is my old lover realized it when she read a book a book of essays she had written in another realm as a little girl the author was riding on horseback through a woodland she found herself thinking about how she was riding past one tree and past the tree was another tree that she was also riding past just as she was passing the rest of the forest that lay beyond both trees she was thinking how there was no clear point where she could say im not riding past those faraway trees so if there was no end point she reasoned and if the world was truly round then clearly she was riding past every tree in the world thrilled with the idea she rode straight home and told her mother run in a little circle she claimed and the entire world passes by your shoulder to which her mother remarked thats a very silly idea my dear josh pauses sitting in the usual chair and placing the old gym bag between his feet pauline was pretty sharp i can almost see how she got from there to the idea about there being just the one soul he shrugs admitting with me i was lucky in this one reality at least i happened to stumble over the right series of thoughts i got to thinking about how when i looked at other soulswhen i ask you to show me someone with my genetics or nearly soi always considered that person as being me essentially like minds in very similar situations and we were the same people a shared incarnation but if we were the same and if souls slightly different from my neighboring soul are the same as himas mewell then weve got a situation where there is no logical or meaningful end quietly the authority says yes i belong to one vast soul josh mutters you do says the voice and if there cant be two separate souls in the universe then the two of uswell i guess you and i are the same person in essence absolutely a beautiful joyous notion the silence is pleased if not entirely original that is then josh laughs a disarming tone leading into the calm simple question why dont you just tell us at the beginning with our first meetingwhy not say this is the way it is there are different ways to learn the authority replies i suppose to be told a wonder is one thing but to take a very long extremely arduous voyage and then discover the same wonder with your own eyes and mindisnt that infinitely more appealing josh josh says nothing after a little pause the authority asks what three offerings do you have for me today josh reaching inside the gym bag he says actually i brought just one little something yes with both hands josh lifts his gift into the light then with the final words you cruel shit he turns off the magnetic bottle and a lump of antiiron begins to descend towards the slick gray face of the ocean the city of blind delight catherynne m valente is the new york times bestselling author of over a dozen works of fiction and poetry including palimpsest the orphans tales series deathless and the crowdfunded phenomenon the girl who circumnavigated fairyland in a ship of her own making she is the winner of the andre norton award the tiptree award the mythopoeic award the rhysling award and the million writers award she has been nominated for the hugo nebula locus and spectrum awards the pushcart prize and was a finalist for the world fantasy award in and she lives on an island off the coast of maine with her partner two dogs and enormous cat there is a train which passes through every possible city it folds the world like an accordioned map and speeds through the folds like a long white cry piercing black dots and capitalstars and vast blue bays its tracks bound the firmament like bones wet humming iron with wriggling runnels of quicksilver slowly replacing the old ash wood planks and the occasional golden bar to mark a historic intersection so long past the plaque has weathered to blank these tracks bear up under the hurtling train the locomotive serpent circumnavigating the globe like a beloved egg though they would not admit it and indeed hardly remember at all new york and paris and tokyo london and mombasa and buenos aires los angeles and seattle and christchurch and beijing nothing more than intricate overswarmed stations on the line festooned and decorated beyond all recognition of necessity this train passes through the city of blind delight which lies somewhat to the rear of ulan bator and also somewhat diagonally from greenland beneath a thin veneer of iowa city lying below it as a bone of a ringfinger may lie beneath both flesh and glove unseen gnarled and jointed ivory hidden by mute skin dumb leather the line is its sole access point yet in chicago a woman in black glasses stands with a bag full of celery and lemons and ice in her arms she watches trains silver past while the cream and gold of union station arches behind her and does not know if this one or this or even that ghostly express gasping by is a car of the line does not know which if any of these graffitibarnacled leviathans would take her to a station carved from baobabroots and papaya rinds or one of mirrors angled to make the habitual strain of passengers to glimpse the incoming rattlers impossible so that the train appears with its headlight blazing as if out of thin air or to blind delight itself where the station arches and vestibules are formed by acrobatic dancers their bodies locked together with laced fingers and toes stretching in shifts over the glistening track their faces impassive as angels it is almost painful to imagine how close she has come how many times to catching the right one but each day she misses it without realizing that she has missed anything at all and the dancers of blind station writhe without her she will miss it today too but he will catch it he will even brush her elbow as he passes her hurrying through doors which open and shut like arms and it is not impossible that he will remember the astringent smell of cold lemons long afterward she has no reason to follow himthis train has the wrong letter on its side and he is running too fast even to look at the letter so certain is he that he is late but she longs to anyway for no reason at all she watches the tails of his blue coat slip past the inexorable doors the car this man whose name is gris enters is empty even at five oclock an advertisement looms near the city map a blank and empty image of skin spreading across the entire frame seen at terrible closeness pores and hair and lines beaming bright it is brown healthy there is no text and he cannot think what it is meant to sell lotion soap perfume he extends a hand to touch the paper and it recoils shudders the hairs bristle translucent goosebumps prickle gris blinks and sits down abruptly folding his hands tightly around his briefcase the train rocks slowly from side to side he does not worry about a tickettaker you use your ticket to enter the station these days not the train once within the dark warm station which is not unlike a cathedral all trains are open to the postulant he is a postulant though he does not think in those terms he once took an art history course in collegethere was a girl of course he had wanted to impress with a red braid and an obscure love of crivelli the professor had put up a slide of raphaels selfportrait and he remembers his shock on seeing that face with the projectorlight shining through it that face which had seemed to him disturbingly blank vapid even idiotic he is like me gris had thought that is my face not the man who was a painter but the man who was affectless a fool the man who was thinner than the professors rough mechanical light i am like that he thought then he thinks now blank and empty like a child like skin he falls asleep and does not hear the station call but the line is patient the doors wait open into the dark a soft sucking wind blowing out of the tunnels and across the platform the line has determined the trajectory of its passenger he stirs when the skinadvertisement shivers above him and blearylimbed steps off of the silver car into the stationshadows the sun filters in a pink wash through the lattice of bodies gris thinks of crivellis angels how sharp and dour they were on the walls of the girl with the red braids bedroom these people are like that the topmost ones staring down at him their hair making strangely colored banners fluttering with the traingenerated winds he is grateful the floor is plain tile that he does not have to walk on stomachs and thighbones he gapesdo not all tourists gape he gapes and his chin tilts up to the banners of hair ignoring the rush of those for whom the human ceiling is no more unusual than one of glass and iron they swarm around him he does not notice across the gleaming floor a calf clicks its hooves gris shifts his gaze numbly the smell of the calf beguilingfor it is roasted brown and glistening its ears basted in brown sugar its skin crisp and hot there is a long knife in its side and with clear imploring eyes the calf looks up at him turning its pierced flank invitingly it swishes its broiled tail a girl runs up in a blue smock knocking griss briefcase down and pulls the knife out cutting a pink slice of veal and chewing it noisily she thrusts the blade back in towards the calfs rump a tidy child he feels his mouth dry and though he has found his way to the city of blind delight in the place of the woman with the black glasses and the lemons he is lost as she would not have been near the apex of the ceiling a woman with long red hair like a sheeting hensblood and black eyes detaches herself from the throng smoothly replaced by a young man with hardly any hair at all on his legs she climbs down the wall as nimble as a spider dropping thread and in no time at all slaps her bare heels on the clean floor retrieving a green dress and golden belt from a darkened booth and covering her skin chilled from the heights barefoot she strides towards the conspicuous tourist as the calf wanders off holding her hand out in a nearly normal gesture of the world to which gris is accustomed this woman is called otthild and she was born here in blind station her mother was a tickettaker a tokenchanger she kept her hair bobbed and curled like a silent movie gamine her uniform crisp and red even when it was stretched by her belly and the buttons uttered brassy cries of protest when the time came she shrugged off her blazer and trousers hung her hat on a silver peg and climbed up the wall of limbs helped along by a crooked knee here and an elbow there until she reached a rafter of long thick torsos clasped together leg by arm and on this she lay and gave birth to her child in midair a daughter caught by the banisters and neatly deposited at the gleaming turnstile by an obliging windowsill with a yellow beard otthild was thus the darling of the station she had never taken the line out of the city of blind delight nor desired to there are many words for what otthild does they have little meaning in the city but she collects them like seashells from the tourists of all she prefers fallen woman since this describes her birth perfectly most of her customers are touristsshe prefers them to locals and the pay is better she shakes the strangers hand and he is absurdly grateful she guides him to the door of the station a gorgeously executed arch of four women standing on each others red shouldersthe topmost pair held their children outstretched and the youths clasped hands in a graceful peak she instructs her bewildered charge to purchase a return ticket from the coiffed man in a glass booth before they leave and again he is grateful for her the arch winks as otthild passes beneath them her polished hair shining against her dress outside the station the city of blind delight opens up in a long valley no road in its heart connects to any road which might lead into a long avenue or highway by which traveling quickly a man might reach the smallest town on any map he knows the line is entrance and exit mother and father there are lights down there in the vale as there are lights in any city but here the light comes from strange lampposts faceted diamonds each face as large as a hand and more like bowls than lamps full of clearest water within black fish circle their luminous lures dangling green and glowing from thin whiskerstalks otthild ticks the glass of one near her with her fingernails and the light swells up washing her cheeks come down she says come into the city down to the river gris goes he does not know why though he suspects it has something to do with her hair and his blankness she leads and he follows and he wants to be surprised that he is not hanging his clothes up in a halfempty closet and drinking scotch until he falls asleep in his computer chair but she is walking before him down a long road to a long river and the late sun is on her scalp like crivellis annunciation the river that flows through the city of blind delight is filled with a rich brandy and all folk take their sustenance there it has no name it is simply the river other cities have a need for names it floods its banks regularlythere is a festival but then there are festivals for everything here the river inundates its shores and fields of grapevines sprout in the swampy mud without the need of vintners to tend them in the fall the purple fruit drops off and rolls back into the water and the current is so sweet on that day but now it is summer and the vines loop and whorl and some few lime trees bend over the water their branches heavy with green tarts there are women by the river when gris and otthild arrive kneedeep but they are not washerwomenthe profession is unheard of here they splash playfully in the redgold surf with long ladles the size of croquet mallets scooping up the redolent water and serving it to each other otthild takes a ladle from the grassy park which leads into the current one with a red and goldflecked handle and dips it deep offering it to him my name is gris he says she tilts her head grey how odd i found a man in the station once called vermillion he was shaking and hiding his eyes in the vestibulehe wouldnt even come out of the train he looked up at me from the steel floor like a calf imploring uncomprehending he said he came from the north from the city of quaint despairing and he could not bear to look outside the doors of the carriage his mother had been an agoraphobe in pearl earrings his father a claustrophobe in iron cufflinks and between them he could hardly move for terror his brothers had dragged him to the train but he could do no more than huddle and quiver and hide from the light i kissed him so many times i let my hair fall over him so that he was neither exposed nor shut away and against the rocking walls of that little vestibule i wrapped my legs around his waist he paid me in his mothers earrings gris started are you a whore then she smiled what profession could remain in a city where the river makes one drunk and the trees bear cream and crust even still i am not anyones for the taking i am not a calf i am not a lime or a grape but here we are impatient with all that is not readily available and so in the province of ease all things are simplified there are two occupations in the city of blind delightthe station dancers and the prostitutes i am both gris rubs his forehead and drinks from the proffered ladle it tastes harsh and he coughs a cough of burnt grapes why am i here his voice is so small he cannot even now remember what sort of scotch he has at home or how far it is from union station to his apartment the line must have wanted you it has its own reasons like anything that lives in the earth it dreams and becomes restless curious even morbidly so what would happen if this substance were added to that one even though it says expressly not to on the label there is a conductor i have heard that perhaps she has brass buttons on her uniform like my mother perhaps she has circuits on her eyelids perhaps she saw your blue coat and your briefcase and thought otthild is lonely perhaps she was hungry for lime tarts and you stumbled onto her train because you could not be bothered to check the track number you can go and wait for the evening train if you like it makes no difference to me he looks at her and it is a look she knows no one is hungry in the city of blind delight except those who look at otthild that way i used to know a girl who looked like you he mumbles looks at the girls splashing each other in the murky river she had your hair she loved this old painter that no one has ever heard of a painter obsessed with perspective who could never get it quite right but he painted these cities these cities like cut jewels terrible and crisp and clear with a woman in the corner sometimes full of the light of god like an afterthought most men knew a woman who looked like me otthild laughs what would i have to pay in a city without want she frowns looks at him seriously her dark eyes fixing him to the riverbed she opens the top three buttons of her emerald dress and takes his hand gently guiding it to her breast she feels like the advertisement we are not without want she whispers no one is without want her house is made of brown cakes it reminds him of the house in the fairy tale but there are no red candies glinting in its cornices bricks of solid cake and barley sugar mortared in creamicing the color of an old womans hair stack sedately into a small cottage at the end of a prosperous streetbut all streets are prosperous here her street is paved in bread there are no doors or locks fat citizens lie about in the road telling jokes about the size of their bellies she leads him to a bed which is mercifully of the linenandwood variety and lies down on her back toes pointed downward all around the bed are intricate boxes of gold and silver and ivoryhe does not ask she indicates the buttons on her dress black jet with tiny engravings of peasants carrying water and wood and tilling fields decorating each one gris undoes each one carefullyher dress is a simple thing with buttons from collar to hem beneath it she is as naked as the ceiling of the station and he thinks of the annunciation the slender golden light penetrating the grey belly of mary but she is not grey he thinks he is he is grey and blank he is the raphael of idiot features the line was not looking for him how could it look for him perhaps it wanted the woman with the black glasses and he only slipped by because she was burdened with her fruit and her ice he leans in to kiss her but otthild stops him and indicates her sternum he sees there as he had not seen before when she was a rafter swaying high above his head four knobs of bone she smiles encouragingly and he slips each one loose like buttons her skin opens soft as cloth and her bones and her lungs peeling back like giftbox tissue beneath all this is her heart and it is golden gleaming bright at the bottom of her body a good part of her blood is gold too flowing out from the metallic ventricles she is terrible and crisp and clear a jacobean diagram of womanhood her heart burning burning burning golden as god gris begins to weep and his tears splash on its hard glittering surface i told you she chuckles she does not move to fasten her chest there was a man a long time ago when the city was new and the line had only just come throughthe tracks just unfurled here like a wet fern and where there are tracks there eventually is a city the edges of the railroad curl out into the valley and drag up a town from the earth whatever town the conductor dreams of that day whatever city the tracks long to see and so there is a river of brandy and the limetart trees and roads of bread the line brought folk and they stayed there was a man with a hand of gold being the son of a jeweler and having lost the flesh one in a factory which pounded out ice by the thousandcube load when he left the station and saw the river winding thick along the vale and the roads with their brown crust he wept for nothing here freezes and resolving never to leave pounded his hand into a railroad tie to honor the line now the train comes to rest precisely on the golden tie and that man long dead holds the city to the line my mother grew up working in the station beside her mother and her grandmother and she saw the tie glitter at the bottom of the tracks every day she thought it the most beautiful of all the things in the city of blind delight chiefly because it was so often hidden down in the dark of the tunnel she thought often of the icepounder whose fingers lay thus across the track and came to love this thing in her mind which was less than a memory and more than a dream one night after the train had sped down the tunnel she crept across the platform and scrambled down to the gleaming tie she lay down upon it and felt it warm against her cheek she wept for the dead man and for a thing called ice which she had never seen when i was born she said i was so heavy because of the gold because of my father and she polished my heart every night for me before bed otthild touched griss face his smooth blank cheeks you see we are not without want but we are peculiar and refined in our ways of wanting since vulgar food necessity is satisfied gris could not bear to look at her heart with its slow clanking beating he closed up her chest with shaking hands and sat on the edge of her bed would it help otthild said if i had a knife in my side she drew his face down to hers and he felt the hard bone buttons beneath him he looked at her red hair coiled on the pillow as he pressed into her and thought of the girl with the braid who he had only loved once who had afterwards stared at her stucco ceiling and told him that crivelli sometimes used chalk rendered in glue made from rabbitfat to make the tears of his pieta it dried hard and clear so that if you could touch one of his paintings you would feel the tears falling beneath your hands falling like tiny stones of grief like little buttons of bone it is properly always dark after sex gris wants to feel guilty but he feels nothing after all a businessman and a prostitute are as near a thing to an archetype as he can think of these days a salaryman and whore walk into a barstop me if youve heard this one he stops he looks over his naked shoulder at her at her four small buttons her hair falls over one heavy breast she pulls a strip of drywallpastry and chews it thoughtfully what can i pay you he sighs what do you want she rolls onto her stomach and smiles softly her lips without paint pink and thin most of us in the city are collectors she says some are monomaniacal like my mother but when the sun is always warm and your house is made of food desire curls in on itself and finds other objects i know a woman by the butterpits who collects calfs tails she has a whole coat of them i collect tickets griss mouth opens slightly he pulls his creased return ticket out of his discarded coats pocket but if i give it to you i can get another for the morning train cant i otthild shrugs you buy a ticket to enter the station these days not the train but the glass booth is well within the arch maybe they would sell you a new one maybe they would let you inside maybe not we are often perverse maybe the station is full of midwesterners trying to buy a ticket home with everything they own even flesh even bone perhaps that longdead man did not lose his hand in an ice factory but to buy a ticket here or a ticket back all of that is your business curious histories and i do not collect those she kneels beside the bed and clicks open the jeweled boxes one by one gold silver ivory opal onyx lacquer inside them all are countless tickets old and new with magnetic strips without some have the city of blind delight as a destination others are simpler new york to st johns odessa to moscow edinburgh to glasgow but there are carefully inked and stamped tickets from the city of envious virgins to the city without roses from the city of variable skylines to the city of mendicant crows there is one almost dust from venice to the city of false perspective she opens a box for him of polished steel tableware melted into a cubical shape gris reaches out and strokes her sternum his eyes sliding closed he feels her fastened chest the buttons like hardened tears he lets his ticket fall into the box shadows drift over the neat printing the city of blind delight to chicago midnight express there is a train which passes through every possible city it folds the world like an accordioned map and speeds through the folds like a long white cry of necessity this train passes through chicago the city of winds a city which was once a lakebed and even now if you were to dig far enough beneath the railroad tracks you would find the thin translucent skeletons of monstrous fish with fins like scythes a woman in black glasses stands with a bag full of strawberries and wheatflour and frozen trout in her arms she watches trains silver past while the cream and gold of union station arches behind her as she has done every day since she moved here from california a long pale car screeches into the platform before her she does not look at the track number or the arcane code of the letters blazing on the side with only a small hesitation as she shifts the weight of her groceries from one hip to another she steps through the doors that open and close like arms light shines through the glass ceiling and illuminates the spot where she stood just a moment before like an afterthought flower mercy needle chain yoon ha lee lives in louisiana with her family but has been menaced by more clouds of mosquitoes than alligators her fiction has appeared in lightspeed the magazine of fantasy science fiction and clarkesworld among other venues she owns no guns and plans to keep it that way but has occasionally been known to stockpile books on military history and philosophy this story owes a great deal to the curious argument in daniel dennetts freedom evolves which posits that free will and determinism are not in fact mutually exclusive the usual fallacy is that in every universe many futures splay outward from any given moment but in some universes determinism runs backwards given a universes state s at some time t there are multiple previous states that may have resulted in s in some universes all possible pasts funnel toward a single fixed ending œâ if you are of millenarian bent you might call œâ armageddon if you are of grammatical bent you might call it punctuation on a cosmological scale if you are a philosopher in such a universe you might call œâ inevitable the woman has haunted blackwheel station for as long as anyone remembers although she was not born there she is human and her straight black hair and brownblack eyes suggest an ancestral inheritance tangled up with tigers and shapeshifting foxes her native language is not spoken by anyone here or elsewhere they say her true name means things like gray and ash and grave you may buy her a drink bring her candied petals or chaotic metals but its all the same she wont speak her name that doesnt stop people from seeking her out today its a man with mirrorcolored eyes he is the first human she has seen in a long time arighans flower he says it isnt her name but she looks up arighans flower is the gun she carries the stranger has taken on a human face to talk to her and he is almost certainly interested in the gun the gun takes different shapes but at this end of time origami multiplicity of form surprises more by its absence than its presence sometimes the gun is long and sleek sometimes heavy and blunt in all cases it bears its makers mark on the stock a blossom with three petals falling away and a fourth about to follow at the blossoms heart is a character that itself resembles a flower with knotted roots the characters meaning is the guns secret the woman will not tell it to you and the gunsmith arighan is generations gone everyone knows what i guard the woman says to the mirroreyed man i know what it does he says and i know that you come from people who worship their ancestors her handon a glass of water two degrees from freezingstops slides to her side where the holster is thats dangerous knowledge she says so hes figured it out her peoples historians called arighans flower the ancestral gun they werent referring to its age the man smiles politely and doesnt take a seat uninvited small courtesies matter to him because he is not human his mind may be housed in a superficial fortress of flesh but the busy computations that define him are inscribed in a vast otherspace the man says i can hardly be the first constructed sentience to come to you she shakes her head its not that do computers like him have souls she wonders she is certain he does which is potentially inconvenient im not for hire its important he says it always is they want chancellors dead or generals discarded lovers or rival reincarnates bodhisattvas or bossesall the old tawdry stories people in all the broad and narrow senses of the term the reputation of arighans flower is quite specific if mostly wrong is it she says ordinarily she doesnt talk to her petitioners at all ordinarily she ignores them through one glass two three four like a child learning the hard way that you cant outcount infinity there was a time when more of them tried to force the gun away from her the woman was a duelist and a killer before she tangled her life up with the flower though and the flower comes with its own defenses including the womans inability to die while she wields it one of the things she likes about blackwheel is that the administrators promised that they would dispose of any corpses she produced blackwheel is notorious for keeping promises the man waits a little longer then says will you hear me out you should be more afraid of me she says if you really know what you claim to know by now the other people in the bar none of them human are paying attention a musician whose instrument is made of fossilized wood and silk strings a magister with a seawrack mane engineers with their sketches hanging in the air and a single doodled starship at the boundary the sole exception is the tattooed traveler dozing in the corner dreaming of distant moons in no hurry the woman draws the flower and points it at the man she is aiming it not at his absent heart but at his left eye if she pulled the trigger she would pierce him through the false pupil the musician continues plucking plangent notes from the instrument the others seeing the gun gawk for only a moment before hastening out of the bar as if that would save them yes the man says outwardly unshaken you could damage my lineage badly i could name programmers all the way back to the first people who scratched a tally of birds or rocks the guns muzzle moves precisely horizontally now the right eye the woman says youve convinced me that you know you havent convinced me not to kill you its half a bluff she wouldnt use the flower not for this but she knows many ways to kill theres another one he says i dont want to speak of it here but will you hear me out she nods once curtly covered by her palm engraved silverbright in a language nobody else reads or writes is the word ancestor once upon a universe an empresss favored duelist received a pistol from the empresss own hand the pistol had a stock of silvergilt and niello an efflorescence of vines framing the makers mark the gun had survived four dynasties with all their rebellions and coups it had accompanied the imperial arsenal from homeworld to homeworld of the ancestral pistol the empires archives said two things do not use this weapon for it is nothing but peril and this weapon does not function in a reasonable universe both statements would not be true the man follows the woman to her suite which is on one of blackwheels tidier levels the sitting room comfortable but not luxurious by blackwheeler standards accommodates a couch sized to human proportions a metal table shined to blurry reflectivity a vase in the corner there are also two paintings on silk rather than some less ancient substrate one is of a mountain by night serenely anonymous amid its stylized clouds the other in a completely different style consists of a cavalcade of shadows only after several moments study do the shadows assemble themselves into a face neither painting is signed sit the woman says the man does do you require a name he asks yours or the targets i have a name for occasions like this he says it is zheu kerang you havent asked me my name she remarks im not sure thats a meaningful question kerang says if im not mistaken you dont exist wearily she says i exist in all the ways that matter i have volume and mass and volition i drink water that tastes the same every day as water should i kill when it moves me to do so ive unwritten death into the history of the universe his mouth tilts up at unwritten nevertheless he says your species never evolved you speak a language that is not even dead it never existed many languages are extinct to become extinct something has to exist first the woman folds herself into the couch next to him not close but not far its an old story she says what is yours four of arighans guns are still in existence kerang says the womans eyes narrow i had thought it was three arighans flower is the last the gunsmiths final work the others she knows of are arighans mercy which always kills the person shot and arighans needle which removes the targets memories of the wielder one more has surfaced kerang says the character in the makers mark resembles a sword in chains they are already calling it arighans chain what does it do she says because he will tell her anyway this one kills the commander of whoever is shot kerang says if thats anyone at all admirals ministers monks schoolteachers its a peculiar sort of loyalty test now she knows you want me to destroy the chain once upon a universe a duelist named shiron took up the gun that an empress with empiricist tendencies had given her i dont understand how a gun that doesnt work could possibly be perilous the empress said she nodded at a sweating man bound in monofilament so that he would dismember himself if he tried to flee this man will be executed anyway his name struck from the roster of honored ancestors see if the gun works on him shiron fired the gunand woke in a city she didnt recognize whose inhabitants spoke a dialect she had never heard before whose technology she mostly recognized from historical dramas the calendar they used at least was familiar it told her that she was years too early no amount of research changed the figure later shiron deduced that the man she had executed traced his ancestry back years to a particular individual most likely that ancestor had performed some extraordinary deed to join the aristocracy and had by the reckoning of shirons people founded his own line unfortunately shiron didnt figure this out before she accidentally deleted the human species yes kerang says i have been charged with preventing further assassinations arighans chain is not a threat i can afford to ignore why didnt you come earlier then shiron says after all the chain might have lain dormant but the others ive seen the mercy and the needle he says by which he means that hes copied data from those who have theyre beautiful he isnt referring to beauty in the way of shadows fitting together into a womans profile or beauty in the way of suncolored liquor at the right temperature in a faceted glass he means the beauty of logical strata of the crescendo of axiomaxiomcorollaryproof of quod erat demonstrandum any gun or shard of glass could do the same as the mercy shiron says understanding him and drugs and dreamscalpels will do the needles work given time and expertise but surely you could say the same of the chain she stands again and takes the painting of the mountain down and rolls it tightly i was born on that mountain she says something like it is still there on a birthworld very like the one i knew but i dont think anyone paints in this style perhaps some art historian would recognize its distant cousin i am no artist but i painted it myself because no one else remembers the things i remember and now you would have it start again how many bullets have you used kerang asks it is not that the flower requires special bulletsit adapts even to emptinessit is that the number matters shiron laughs low almost husky she knows better than to trust kerang but she needs him to trust her she pulls out the flower and rests it in both palms so he can look at it three petals fallen a fourth about to follow thats not the number but he doesnt realize it youve guarded it so long he says inspecting the makers mark without touching the gun i will guard it until i am nothing but ice shiron says you may think that the chain is a threat but if i remove it theres no guarantee that you will still exist its not the chain i want destroyed kerang says gently its arighan do you think i would have come to you for anything less shiron says into the awkward quiet after a while so you tracked down descendants of arighans line his silence is assent there must be many arighans flower destroys the targets entire ancestral line altering the past but leaving its wielder untouched in the empire shiron once served the histories spoke of arighan as an honored guest shiron discovered long ago that arighan was no guest but a prisoner forced to forge weapons for her captors how arighan was able to create weapons of such novel destructiveness no one knows the flower was arighans clever revenge against a people whose state religion involved ancestor worship if descendants of arighans line exist here then arighan herself can be undone and all her guns unmade shiron will no longer have to be an exile in this timeline although it is true that she cannot return to the one that birthed her either shiron snaps the painting taut the mountain disintegrates but she lost it lifetimes ago silent lightning crackles through the air unknots zheu kerang from his humanshaped shell tessellates deadend patterns across the equations that make him who he is the painting had other uses as do the other things in this roomshe believes in versatilitybut this is good enough kerangs body slumps on the couch shiron leaves it there for the first time in a long time she is leaving blackwheel station what she does not carry she can buy on the way and blackwheel is loyal because they know and they know not to offend her blackwheel will keep her suite clean and undisturbed and deliver water nearfreezing in an elegant glass night after night waiting kerang was a pawn by his own admission if he knew what he knew and lived long enough to convey it to her then others must know what he knew or be able to find it out kerang did not understand her at all shiron unmazes herself from the station to seek passage to one of the hubworlds where she can begin her search if shiron had wanted to seek revenge on arighan she could have taken it years ago but she will not be like arighan she will not destroy an entire timeline of people no matter how alien they are to her shiron had hoped that matters wouldnt come to this she acknowledges her own na√Øvet√© there is no help for it now she will have to find and murder each child of arighans line in this way she can protect arighan herself protect the accumulated sum of history in case someone outwits her after all this time and manages to take the flower from her in a universe where determinism runs backwardswhere no matter what you do everything ends in the same inevitable œâchoices still matter especially if you are the last guardian of an incomparably lethal gun although it has occurred to shiron that she could have accepted kerangs offer and that she could have sacrificed this timeline in exchange for the one in which neither arighan nor the guns ever existed she declines to do so for there will come a heatdeath and she is beginning to wonder if a constructed sentiencea computercan have a soul what of the universe itself the greatest computer of all in this universe they reckon her old shiron is older than even that in millions of timelines she has lived to the pallid end of life in each of those endings arighans flower is there as integral as an edge is to a blade while it is true that science never proves anything absolutely that an inconceivably large but finite number of experiments always pales beside infinity shiron feels that millions of timelines suffice as proof without arighans flower the universe cannot renew itself and start a new story perhaps that is all the reason the universe needs and shiron will be there when the heatdeath arrives as many times as necessary so shiron sets off it is not the first time she has killed and it is unlikely to be the last but she is not after all this time incapable of grieving œâ angles orson scott card is the

first of a new young adult series pathfinder his latest book is the lost gate the first volume of a new fantasy series hakira enjoyed coasting the streets of manhattan the old rustedout building frames seemed like the skeleton of some ancient leviathan that beached and died but he could hear the voices and horns and growling machinery of crowded streets and smell the exhaust and cooking oil even if all that he saw beneath him were the tops of the trees that had grown up in the longvanished streets with a world as uncrowded as this one there was no reason to dismantle the ruins or clear the trees it could remain as a monument for the amusement of the occasional visitor there were plenty of places in the world that were still crowded as always most people enjoyed or at least needed human company and even recluses usually wanted people close enough to reach from time to time satellites and landlines still linked the world together and ports were busy with travel and commerce of the lighter sort like bringing outofseason fruits and vegetables to consumers who preferred not to travel to where the food was fresh but as the year was about to pass away there were places like this that made the planet earth seem almost empty as if humanity had moved on in fact there were probably far more human beings alive than anyone had ever imagined might be possible no human had ever left the solar system and only a handful lived anywhere but earth one of the earths anywayone of the angles of earth in the past five hundred years millions had passed through benders to colonize versions of earth where humanity had never evolved and now a world seemed full with only a billion people or so of the trillions of people that were known to exist the one that hakira was going to see lived in a twohundredyearold house perched on the southern coast of this island where in ancient times artillery had been placed to command the harbor back when the atlantic reached this far inland back when invaders had to come by ship hakira set his flivver down in the meadow where the homing signal indicated switched off the engine and slipped out into the bracing air of a summer morning only a few miles from the face of the nearest glacier he was expectedthere was no challenge from the security system and lights showed him the path to follow through the shadowy woods because his host was something of a showoff a pair of sabertooth tigers were soon padding along beside him they might have been computer simulations but knowing moshes reputation they were probably genetic backforms very expensive and undoubtedly chipped up to keep them from behaving aggressively except perhaps on command and moshe had no reason to wish hakira ill they were after all kindred spirits the path suddenly opened up onto a meadow and after only a few steps he realized that the meadow was the roof of a house for here and there steeppitched skylights rose above the grass and flowers and now with a turn the path took him down a curving ramp along the face of the butte overlooking the hudson plain and now he stood before a door it opened a beaming moshe stood before him dressed in of all things a kimono come in hakira you certainly took your time we set our appointment by the calendar not the clock whenever you arrive is a good time i merely noted that my security system showed you taking the grand tour on the way manhattan a sad place like a sweet dream you can never return to a poets soul thats what you have ive never been accused of that before only because youre japanese said moshe they sat down before an open fire that seemed real but gave off no smoke heat it had however so that hakira felt a little scorched when he leaned forward there are japanese poets i know but is that what anyone thinks of when they think of the wandering japanese hakira smiled but you do have money not from moneychanging said moshe and what i dont have which you also dont have is a home hakira looked around at the luxurious parlor i suppose that technically this is a cave a homeland said moshe for nine and a half centuries my friend your people have been able to go almost anywhere in the world but one an archipelago of islands once called honshu hokkaido kyushu hakira suddenly overcome by emotion raised his hand to stop the cruel list i know that your people too have been driven from their homeland repeatedly said moshe i hope you will forgive me sir but it is impossible to imagine yearning for a desert beside a dead sea the way one yearns for the lush islands strangled for nearly a thousand years by the chinese dragon dry or wet flat or mountainous the home to which you are forbidden to return is beautiful in dreams who has the soul of a poet now your organization will fail you know i know nothing of the kind sir it will fail china will never relent because to do so would be to admit wrongdoing and that they cannot do to them you are the interlopers the toothless peace council can issue as many edicts as it likes but the chinese will continue to bar those of known japanese ancestry from even visiting the islands and they will use as their excuse the perfectly valid argument that if you want so much to see japan you have only to bend yourself to a different slant there is bound to be some angle where your tourist dollars will be welcome no said hakira those other angles are not this world and yet they are and yet they are not well now there is our dilemma either we will do business or we will not and it all hinges on that question what is it about that archipelago that you want is it the land itself you can already visit that very landand we are told that because of inanimate incoherency it is the same land no matter what angle you dwell in or is your desire really not simply to go there but to go there in defiance of the chinese is it hate then that drives you no i reject both interpretations said hakira i care nothing for the chinese and now that you put the question in these terms i realize that i myself have not thought clearly enough for while i speak of the beautiful land of the rising sun in fact what i yearn for is the japanese nation on those islands unmolested by any other governing ourselves as we have from the beginning of our existence as a people ah said moshe now i see that we perhaps can do business for it may be possible to grant you your hearts desire me and all the people of the kotoshi ah the eternally optimistic kotoshi it means this year doesnt it as in this year we return as your people say next year in jerusalem a japan where only the japanese have ruled for all these past thousand years in a world where the japanese are not rootless wanderers legendary toymakersforhire but rather are a nation among the nations of the world and one of the greatest of them is that not the home you wish to return to yes said hakira but that japan does not exist in this world not even now when the chinese no longer need even half the land of the original han china so you do not want the japan of this world at all do you the japan you want is a fantasy a dream a hope a wish a plan and it hasnt occurred to you that in all the angles of the world there might not be such a japan it isnt like the huge library in that story where it is believed that among all the books containing all the combinations of all the letters that could fit in all those pages there is bound to be a book that tells the true history of all the world there are many angles yes but our ability to differentiate them is not infinite and in many of them life never evolved and so the air is not breathable it is an experiment not lightly undertaken oh of course to find a world so nearly like our own that a nation called japanor i suppose nipponexists at all where a language like japanese is even spokenyou do speak japanese yourself dont you my parents spoke nothing else at home until i was five and had to enter school yes well to find such a world would be a miracle and to search for it would be a fools errand and yet it has been searched for hakira waited moshe did not go on has it been found what would it be worth to you if it had angle Œ∏ youre a scientist said leonard this is beneath you i have continuous video said b√™to with a mechanical clock in it so you can see the flow of time the chair moves there is nothing you can do that hasnt been faked by somebody sometime but why would i fake it to publish this is the end of my career exactly my point b√™to you are a geologist of all things geologists dont have poltergeists stay with me leonard watch this how long i dont know sometimes its immediate sometimes it takes days i dont have days play cards with me as we used to in faculdade look at the chair first though nothing attached to it a normal chair in every way you sound like a magician on the stage but it is normal so it seems seems all right dont trust me you move it put it where you want all right upside down it doesnt matter on top of the door i dont care and we play cards you deal it is the problem of memory we have mapped the entire brain we can track the activity of every neuron of every synapse we have analyzed the chemical contents of the cells we can find in the living brain without surgery exactly where each muscle is controlled where perceptions are rooted we can even stimulate the brain to track and recall memory but that is all we cannot account for how memory is stored and we cannot find where i know that in your textbooks in secondary school and perhaps in your early undergraduate classes you have read that memory was the first problem solved but that was a misunderstanding we discovered that after mapping a particular memory if that exact portion of the brain was destroyedand this was in the early days with clumsy equipment that killed thousands of cells at a time an incredibly wasteful procedure and potentially devastating to the subjectif that exact spot was destroyed the memory was not lost it could resurface somewhere else so for many years we believed that memory was stored holographically small portions in many places so that losing a bit of a memory here or there did not cause the entire sequence to be lost this however was chimerical for as our research became more and more precise we discovered that the brain is not infinite and such a wasteful system of memory storage would use up the entire brain before a child reached the age of three because you see no memory is lost some memories are hard to recover and people often lose track of their memories but it is not a problem of storage it is a problem of retrieval portions of the network break down so tracks cannot be followed or the routing is such that you cannot link from memory a to memory x without passing through memories of such power that you are distracted from the attempt to retrieve but given timeor hyperstimulation of related memory tracksall memories can be retrieved all every moment of your life we cannot recover more than your perceptions and the sense you made of them at the time but that does not change the fact that we can recover every moment of your childhood every moment of this class and we can recover every conscious thought though not the unconscious streaming thought behind it it is all storedsomewhere the brain is merely the retrieval mechanism this has led some observers to conclude that there is in fact a mind or even a soula nonphysical portion of the human being existing outside of measurable space but if that is so it is beyond the reach of science i however am a scientist and with my colleaguessome of whom once sat in the very chairs where you are sittingi have labored long and hard to find an explanation that is in fact physical some have criticized this effort because it shows that my faith in the nonexistence of the immaterial is so blind that i refuse to believe even the material evidence of immateriality dont laugh it is a valid question but my answer is that we cannot validly prove the immateriality of the mind by the sheer fact of our inability to detect the material of which it is made i am happy to tell you that we have received word that the journal mindand we would not have settled for anything less than the premiere journal in the fieldhas accepted our article dealing with our findings by no means does this constitute an answer but it moves the field of inquiry and reopens the possibility at least of a material answer to the question of memory for we have found that when neurons are accessed for memory there are many kinds of activity in the cell the biochemical of course has been very hard to decode but other researchers have accounted for all the chemical reactions within the cell and we have found nothing new in that area nor is memory electrochemical for that is merely how raw commands of the coarsest sort are passed from neuron to neuronrather like the difference between using a spray can as opposed to painting with a monofilament brush our research of course began in the submolecular realm trying to find out if in some way the brain cells were able to make changes in the atom in the arrangement of protons and neutrons or some information somehow encoded in the behavior of electrons this proved alas to be a dead end as well but the invention of the muonoscope has changed everything for us because at last we had a nondestructive means of scanning the exact state of muons through infinitesimal passages of time we were able to find some astonishing correlations between memory and the barely detectable muon states of slant and yaw yaw as you know is the constantthe yaw of a muon cannot change during the existence of the muon slant also seemed to be a constant and in the materials which had previously been examined by physicists that was indeed the case however in our studies of brain activity during forced memory retrieval we have found a consistent pattern of slant alteration within the nuclei of atoms in individual brain cells because the head must be held utterly still for the muonoscope to function we could only work with terminally ill patients who volunteered for the study and were willing to die in the laboratory instead of with their families spending the last moments of their lives with their heads opened up and their brains partially disassembled it was painless but nevertheless emotionally disturbing to contemplate and so i must salute the courage and sacrifice of our subjects whose names are all listed in our article as coauthors of the study and i believe that our study has now taken us as far as biology can go given the present equipment the next move is in the hands of physicists ah yes what we found you see i became sidetracked by my thought of our brave collaborators because i remembered their memories which meant remembering who they were and what it cost them toand i am being distracted again what we found was during the moment of memory retrieval when the neuron was stimulated and went into the standard memoryretrieval state there is a momenta moment so brief that until fifteen years ago we had no computer that could have detected it let alone measured its durationwhen all the muons in all the protons of all the atoms in all the memoryspecific rna molecules in the nucleus of the one neuronand no otherschange their slant more specifically they seem according to the muonoscope to wink out of existence for that brief moment and then return to existence with a new pattern of slantsyes varying slants impossible as we have been told that waswhich exist for a period of time perhaps a thousand times longer than the temporary indetectability though this is still a span of time briefer than a millionth of a picosecond and during the brief existence of this anomalous slantstate which we call the angle the neuron goes through the spasm of activity that causes the entire brain to respond in all the ways that we have long recognized as the recovery of memory in short it seems that the pertinent muons change their slant to a new angle and in that angle they are encoded with a snapshot of the brainstate that will cause the subject to remember they return to detectability in the process of rebounding to their original slant but for the brief period before they have completed that rebound the pattern of memory is reported via biochemical and then electrochemical changes to the brain as a whole there are those who will resent this discovery because it seems to turn the mind or soul into a mere physical phenomenon but this is not so in fact if anything our discovery enhances our knowledge of the utterly unique majesty of life for as far as we know it is only in the living brain of organisms that the very slant of the muons within atoms can be changed the brain thus opens tiny doorways into other universes stores memories there and retrieves them at will yes i mean other universes the first thing that the muonoscope showed us was the utter emptiness of muons there are even theorists who believe that there are no particles only attributes of regions of space and theoretically there is no reason why the same point in space cannot be occupied by an infinite number of muons as long as they have different slants and perhaps yaws for theoretical reasons that i do not have the mathematics to understand i am told that while coterminous muons of the same yaw but different slants could impinge upon and influence each other coterminous muons of different yaw could never have any causal relationship and there could also be an infinite series of infinite series of universes whose muons are not coterminous with the muons of our universe and they too are permanently undetectable and incapable of influencing our universe but if the theory is correctand i believe our research proves that it isit is possible to pass information from one slant of this physical universe to another and since by this same theory all material reality is in fact merely information it is even possible that we might be able to pass objects from one such universe to another but now we are in the realm of fantasy and i have spent as much time on this happy announcement as i dare you are after all students and my job is to pass certain information from my brain to yours which does not im afraid involve mere millionths of a picosecond angle œÜ i cant stand it i cant i wont live here another day another hour but it never harms us and we cant afford to move the chair is on top of the door it could fall it could hurt one of the children why is it doing this to us what have we done to offend it we havent done anything its just malicious its just enjoying itself no dont make it angry im fed up stop this go away leave us alone what good is it to break the chair and smash the room no good nothing does any good go get the children take them out into the garden ill call a taxi well go to your sisters house they dont have room for tonight they have room not another night in this evil place hakira examined the contract and it seemed simple enough passage for the entire membership of kotoshi if they assembled at their own expense free return for up to ten days but only at the end of the ten days as a single group there would be no refund for those who returned but all that seemed fair enough especially since the price was not exorbitant of course this contract isnt binding anyway said hakira how could it be enforced this whole passage is illegal not in the target world it isnt said moshe and thats where it would have to be enforced nu its not as if i can find a lawyer from that world to represent my interests now it makes no sense for me to have dissatisfied customers how do i know you wont just strand us there said hakira it might not even be a world with a breathable atmospherea lot of angles are still mostly hydrocarbon gas with no free oxygen at all didnt i tell you i go with you in fact i have toim the one who brings you through brings us dont you just put us in a bender and bender moshe laughed those primitive machines no wonder the near worlds are never foundbenders cant make the fine distinctions that we make no i take you through we go together what we all join hands andyoure serious why are you wasting my time with mumbo jumbo like this if its mumbo jumbo then well all hold hands and nothing will happen and youll get your money back right moshe spread his hands what do you have to lose it feels like a scam then leave you came to me remember because you got that group of zionists through exactly my point said moshe i took them through i came back they didntbecause they were absolutely satisfied theyre in a world where israel was never conquered by the surrounding arab states so jews still have their own hebrewspeaking state the same world i might add where japan is still populated by selfgoverning japanese whats the catch no catch except that we use a different mechanism that is not approved by the government and so we have to do it under the table but why does the other world allow it asked hakira why do they let you bring people in this is a rescue said moshe they bring you in as refugees from an unbearable reality they bring you home the government of israel in that reality as a matter of policy declares that jews have a right to returneven jews from a different angle and the government of japan recently decided to offer the same privilege to you its still so hard to believe that anyone found a populated world that has japanese at all well isnt it obvious said moshe nobody found that world what do you mean that world found us hakira thought about it for a moment thats why they dont use benders they have their own technology for reslanting from angle to angle exactly right except for your use of the word they and now hakira understood not they you youre not from this world youre one of them when we discovered your tragic world i was sent to bring jews home to israel and when we realized that the japanese suffered a similar tragic loss the decision was made to extend the offer to you hakira bring your people home angle Œ∏ i told them i didnt want to see you i know i was sitting there playing cards and suddenly im almost killed it never happened that way before the chair usually justslid or sometimes floated it was smashed to bits i had a concussion its taken ten stitches ill have this scar on my face for the rest of my life but i didnt do it i didnt know it would happen that way how could i there were no wires you know that you saw nossa yes i saw but its not a ghost i never said it was i dont believe in ghosts what then i dont know everything else i think of sounds like fantasy but then telephones and satellite tv and movies and submarines once sounded like fantasy to anyone who thought of such ideas and in this case thereve been stories of ghosts and hauntings and poltergeists sincesince the beginning of time i imagine only theyre rare so rare that they dont often happen to scientists in the history of the world real scientists are rarer than poltergeists and if such things did happen to a scientist how many of them might have done as you urged me to doignore it pretend it was a hallucination move to another place where such things dont happen and the scientists who refuse to blind their eyes to the evidence before themwhat happens to them ill tell you what happens because ive found seven of them in the past two hundred yearswhich isnt a lot but these are the ones who published what happened to them and in every case they were immediately discredited as scientists no one listened to them any more their careers were over the ones who taught lost tenure at their universities three of them were committed to mental institutions and not once did anyone else seriously investigate their claims except of course the people who are already considered to be completely bobo the paranormalists the regular batch of fakers and hucksters and the same thing will happen to you no because i have you as a witness what kind of witness am i i was hit in the head do you understand i was in the hospital delirious concussive and i have the scar on my face to prove it no one will believe me either some will even wonder if you didnt beat me into agreeing to testify for you ah leonard god help me but youre right call an exorcist im a scientist i dont want it to go away i want to understand it so b√™to scientist explain it to me if it isnt a ghost to be exorcised what is it a parallel world no listen listen to me maybe in the empty spaces between atoms or even the empty spaces within atoms there are other atoms we cant detect most of the time an infinite number of them some very close to ours some very far and suppose that when you enclose a space and somebody in one of those infinite parallel universes encloses the same space it can cause just the slightest bit of material overlap you mean theres something magic about boxes come on you asked for possibilities but if the landforms are similar then the places where towns are built would be similar too the confluence of rivers harbors good farmland people in many universes would be building towns in the same places houses all it takes is one room that overlaps and suddenly you get echoes between worlds you get a single chair that exists in both worlds at once what somebody in our world goes and buys a chair and somebody in the other world happens to go and buy the same one on the same day no i moved into the house that chair was already there haunted houses are always old arent they old furniture its been there long enough undisturbed for the chair to have spilled a little and exist in both worlds soyou take the chair and put it on top of the door and the people in the other world come home and find the chair has been movedmaybe they even saw it moveand hes fed up hes furious he smashes the chair ludicrous well something happened and you have the scar to prove it and you have the chair fragments well no what you threw them out my best guess is that they threw them out or else i dont know when the chair lost its structure the echo faded anyway the pieces are gone no evidence that clinches it if you publish this ill deny it b√™to no you wont i will ive already had my face damaged im not going to let you shatter my career as well b√™to drop it i cant this is too important science cant continue to refuse to look at this and find out whats really going on yes it can scientists regularly refuse to look at all kinds of things because it would be bad for their careers to see them you know its true yes i know its true scientists can be blind but not me and not you either leonard when i publish this i know youll tell the truth if you publish this ill know youre crazy so when people ask me ill tell them the truththat youre crazy the chair is gone now anyway chances are this will never happen again in five years youll come to think of it as a weird hallucination a weird hallucination that left you scarred for life go away b√™to leave me alone i call it the angler and using it is called angling it looks expensive it is too expensive to sell it as a toy its not for children anyway look its expensive because its really hightech but thats a plus and the more popular it becomes the more the perunit cost will drop weve studied the price point and we think were right on this ok fine what does it do ill show you put on this cap and i certainly will not not until you tell me what it does sure i understand no problem what it does is it puts you into someone elses head oh its just a dreamer those have been around for years they had their vogue but no not a dreamer true we do use the old dreamer technology as the playback system because why reinvent the wheel we were able to license it for a song so why not but the thing that makes this special is thisthe recording system recording you know about slantspace right thats all theoretical games not really just theoretical i mean its well known that our brains store memory in slantspace right sure yeah i knew that well see heres the thing theres an infinite number of different universes that have a lot of their matter coterminous with ours here it comes engineer talk we cant sell engineering babble there are people in these other worlds like ghosts they wander around and their memories are stored in our world where just sitting there in the air just a collection of angles wherever their head is in our world and a lot of other parallel worlds they have their memories stored as a pattern of slants havent you had the experience of walking into a room and then suddenly you cant remember why you came in im seventy years old it happens all the time it has nothing to do with being seventy it happened when you were young too only youre more susceptible now because your own brain has so much memory stored that its constantly accessing other slants and sometimes your head space passes through the head space of someone else in another world and poof your thoughts are confusedjammed reallyby theirs my head just happens to pass through the space where the other guys head just happens to be in an infinite series of universes there are a lot of them where people about your height might be walking around what makes it so rare is that most of them are using patterns of slants so different that they barely impinge on ours at all and you have to be accessing memory right at that moment too anyway thats not what mattersthat is coincidence but you set up this recorder here at about the height of a human being and turn it on and as long as you dont put it say on the thirtieth floor or the bottom of a lake or something within a day youll have this thing filled up with what up to twenty separate memory states we could build it to hold a lot more but its so easy to erase and replace that we figured twenty was enough and if people want more we can sell peripherals right anyway you get these transitory brain states memories and its the whole package the complete mental state of another human being for one moment in time not a dream not fictionalized you know those dreams they were sketchy haphazard pretty meaningless i mean its boring to hear other people tell their dreams how cool is it to actually have to sit through them but with the angler you catch the whole fish youve got to put it on though to know why its going to sell and its nothing permanent well its permanent in the sense that youll remember it and itll be a pretty strong memory but you know youll want to remember it so thats a good thing it doesnt damage anything though and thats all that matters i can try it on one of your employees first though if you want or ill put it on myself no ill do it ill have to do it in the end before ill make the decision so i might as well do it from the start put on the cap and no its not a toupee if i were going to get a rug id choose a better one than this all right a snug fit but thats why we made it elastic how long does it take objective time only a fraction of a second subjectively of course well you tell us ready sure give me a one two three all right ill do one two three and then flip it like four ok yeah yeah do it one two three ah aaah oh give it a few seconds just relax its pretty strong you didnt how could this i its all right to cry dont worry first time most people do i was just shes just i was a woman fiftyfifty chance i never knew how it felt to this should be illegal technically it falls under the same laws as the dreamer so you know not for children and all that i dont know if id ever want to use it again its so strong give yourself a few days to sort it out and youll want it you know you will yes no dont try to push any paperwork on me right now im not an idiot im not signing anything while my heads sobuttomorrow come back tomorrow let me sleep on it of course we couldnt ask for anything more than that have you shown this to anyone else youre the biggest and the best we came to you first were talking exclusive right well as exclusive as our patents allow what do you mean weve patented every method weve thought of but we think there are a lot of ways to record in slantspace in fact the real trouble is the hardest thing is to design a record that doesnt bend space on the other side i mean peoples heads wont go through the recording field if the recorder itself is visible in their space what im saying is well be exclusive until somebody finds another way to do it without infringing our patent thatll take years of course but how many years no faster than three and probably longer and we can tie them up in court longer still look at me im still shaking can you play me the same memory we could build a machine that would do that but you wont want to the first time with each one is the best doing the same person twice can leave you a littleconfused bring me the paperwork tomorrow for an exclusive for five years well launch with enough product to drop that price point from the start it took a month for the members of kotoshi to assemble only a few decided not to go and they took a vow of silence to protect those who were leaving they gathered at the southern tip of manhattan in the parlor of moshes house they had no belongings with them its one of the unfortunate side effects of the technology we use moshe explained nothing that is not organically connected to your bodies can make the transition to the new slant as when you were born you will be naked when you arrive thats why wholesale colonization using this technology is impracticalno tools nor can you transfer any kind of wealth or art you come emptyhanded is it cold there the climate is different said moshe youll arrive on the southern tip of manhattan and it will be winter but there are no glaciers closer than greenland anyway youll arrive indoors i live in this house and use it for transition because there is a coterminous room in the other angle nothing to fret about hakira looked for the technology that would transfer them moshe had spoken of this room perhaps it was much larger than bender technology and had been embedded in the walls of the room yet if they could not bring anything with them that wasnt part of their bodies moshes people must have built their machinery here instead of importing it yet if they hadnt brought wealth how had moshe obtained the money to buy this house let alone manufacture their slantchanging machinery interesting puzzles of course there were two obvious solutions the first would be a disappointment but it was the most predictablethat it was all fakery and moshe would try to abscond with their money without having taken them anywhere at all there was always the danger that part of the scam was killing those who were supposed to be transported so that thered be no one left to complain foreseeing that hakira and the others were alert and prepared the other possibility though was the one that made hakiras spine tingle theoretically since slantshifting had first been discovered as a natural function of the human brain there was always the chance of nonmechanical transfer between angles one of the main objections to this idea had always been that if it were possible all the worlds should be getting constant visits from any that had learned how to transfer by mental power alone the common answer to that was how do you know they arent constantly visiting some even speculated that sightings of ghosts might well be of people coming or going but moshes warning about arriving nude would explain quite nicely why there hadnt been more visits its hard to be subtle about being nude in most human cultures do any of you asked moshe have any embedded metal or plastic in your bodies this includes fillings in your teeth but would also include metal plates or silicon joint replacements heart pacemakers nontissue breast implants and of course eyeglasses i can assure you that as quickly as possible all these items will be replaced except for pacemakers of course if you have a pacemaker youre simply not going what happens if we do have some kind of implant asked one of the men nothing painful no wound it simply doesnt go with you it remains here the effect on you is as if it simply disappeared and of course the objects would remain here hanging in the air and then fall to the groundor the chair since most of you will be sitting but to tell the truth thats the least of my problemspart of your fee goes to cleaning up this room since the contents of your bowels also remain behind several people grimaced as i said youll never notice except you might feel a bit lighter and more vigorous its like having the perfect enema and no matter how nervous you are you wont need to urinate for some time well now are we ready anyone want to step outside after all no one left well this couldnt be simpler you must join hands bare hands skin to skin connect tightly the whole circle no one left out hakira couldnt help but chuckle hakira is laughing said moshe because he mockingly suggested that maybe our method of transfer was some kind of mumbo jumbo involving all joining hands well he was right only this happens to be mumbo jumbo that works well see wont we thought hakira in moments all their hands were joined hold your hands up so i can see said moshe good good all right absolute silence please a moment first said hakira to the others he said softly nippon this year with fierce smiles or no expression at all the others murmured in reply fujiyama kotoshi it was done hakira turned to moshe and nodded they bowed their heads and made no sound beyond the unavoidable sound of breathing and an occasional snifflethey had just come in from the cold one man coughed several people glared at him others simply closed their eyes meditating their way to silence hakira never took his eyes from moshe watching for some kind of signal to a hidden confederate or perhaps for him to activate some machinery that might fill the room with poison gas but nothing two minutes three four and then the room disappeared and a cold wind blew across forty naked bodies they were in the open air inside a high fence and around them in a circle stood men with swords swords everything was clear now well said moshe cheerfully letting go and stepping back to join the armed men one of them had a long coat for him which he put on and wrapped around himself the transfer worked just as i told you it wouldyoure naked there was no machinery involved and dont you feel vigorous neither hakira nor any of the people of kotoshi said a thing i did lie about a few things said moshe you see we stumbled upon what you call slanting at a much more primitive stage in our technological development than you and wherever we went that wasnt downright fatal and that wasnt already fully inhabited there you were already overpopulating every world we could find we had come upon the technique too late so weve come recruiting if were to have a chance at defeating you and your kind so we have a decent chance of finding worlds to expand into we need to learn how to use your technology how to use your weapons how to disable your power system how to make your ordinary citizens helpless since our technology is far behind yours and we couldnt carry technology from world to world anyway the way you can this was our only choice still no one answered him you are taking this very calmlygood the previous group was full of complainers arguing with us and complaining about the weather even though its much colder this time that first group was very valuableweve learned many medical breakthroughs from them for instance and many people are learning how to drive cars and how to use credit and even the theory behind computer programming but youwell i know its a racial stereotype but not only are you japanese every bit as educated as the jews from the previous group you tend to be educated in mathematics and technology instead of medicine law and scripture so from you we hope to learn many valuable things that will prepare us to take over one of your colonies and use it as a springboard to future conquest isnt it nice to know how valuable and important you are one of the swordsmen let rip a string of sounds from another language moshe answered in the same language my friend comments that you seem to be taking this news extremely well only a few points of clarification are needed said hakira you are in fact planning to keep us as slaves allies said moshe helpers teachers not slaves we are free to go then to return home if we wish no i regret not are we free not to cooperate with you you will find your lives are much more comfortable if you cooperate will we be taught this mental method of transferring from angle to angle moshe laughed please you are too humorous is this a global policy on your world or are you representing only one government or perhaps a small group not responsible to any government there is one government on this world and we represent its policy said moshe it is only in the area of technology that we are not as advanced as you we gave up tribes and nations thousands of years ago hakira looked around at the others in his group any other questions have we settled everything of course it was just a legal formality he knew perfectly well that they were now free to act this was in fact almost the worstcase scenario no clothing no weapons cold weather surrounded but that was why they trained for the worst case at least there were no guns and they were outdoors moshe i arrest you and all the armed persons present in this compound and charge you with wrongful imprisonment slavery fraud and moshe shook his head and gave a brief command to the swordsmen at once they raised their weapons and advanced on hakiras group it took only moments for the nude japanese to sidestep the swords disarm the swordsmen and leave them prostrate on the ground their own swords now pointed at their throats the japanese who were not involved in that task quickly scoured the compound for more weapons and located the clumsy oldfashioned keys that would open the gate within moments they had run down and captured those guards who had been outside the gates not one got away only two had even attempted to fight they were as a result dead to moshe hakira said i now add the charge of assault and attempted murder youll never get back to your own world said moshe we each have the complete knowledge necessary to make our own bender out of whatever materials we find here we are also quite prepared to take on any military force you send against us or to flee if necessary even if we have to travel we have you the real question is whether we will learn the secret of mental reslanting from you before or after we build a bender for ourselves i can promise you considerable lenience from the courts if you cooperate never oh well someone else will how did you know demanded moshe there is no world but ours with japanese in it or jews none of the inhabited worlds have had cultures or languages or civilizations or histories that resembled each other in any way we knew you were a con man but we also knew the zionists were gone without a trace we also knew that someday wed have to face people from another angle who had learned how to reslant themselves we trained very carefully and we followed you home like stray mongrels said moshe oh and we do have to be told where the previous batch of slaves are being keptthe zionists you kidnaped before theyll all be killed said moshe nastily that would be such a shame for you said hakira he beckoned to one of his men now armed with a sharp sword in japanese he told his comrade that unfortunately moshe needed a demonstration of their relentless determination at once the sword flicked out and the tip of moshes nose dropped to the ground the sword flicked again and now moshe lost the tip of the longest finger of the hand that he had been raising to touch his maimed nose hakira bent over and scooped up the nose and the fingertip id say that if we get back to our world within about three hours surgeons will be able to put these back on with only the tiniest scar and very little loss of function or shall we delay longer and sever more protruding body parts this is inhuman said moshe on the contrary said hakira this is about as human as it gets are the people of your angle so determined to control every world you find not at all said hakira we never interfered with any world that already had human life youre the ones who decided on war and i must say im relieved that the general level of your technology turns out to be so low and that wherever you go you arrive naked moshe said nothing his eyes glazed over hakira murmured to his friend with the sword the point of it quickly rested against the tender flesh just under moshes jaw moshes eyes grew quite alert dont even think of slanting away from us said hakira i am the only one who speaks your language said moshe you have to sleep sometime i have to sleep sometime how will you know whether im really asleep or merely meditating before i transfer take a thumb said hakira and this time lets make him swallow it moshe gulped what sort of vengeance will you take against my people apart from fair trials for the perpetrators of this conspiracy well establish an irresistible presence here watch you very carefully and conduct such trade as we think appropriate you yourself will be judged according to your cooperation now come on moshe save some time take me back to my world a bender is already being set up at your housethe troops moved in the moment we disappeared you know that its just a matter of time before they identify this angle and arrive in force no matter what you do i could take you anywhere said moshe and no doubt youre threatening to take me to some world with unbreathable air because youre willing to die for your cause i understand that im willing to die for mine but if im not back here in ten minutes my men will slaughter yours and begin the systematic destruction of your world its our only defense if you dont cooperate believe me the best way to save your world is by doing what i say maybe i hate you more than i love my people said moshe what you love is our technology moshe every bit of it come with me now and youll be the hero who brings all those wonderful toys home youll put my finger and nose back on in my world the year is said hakira well put them on you wherever you want them and give you spares just in case lets go said moshe he took hakiras hand and closed his eyes the magician and the maid and other stories christie yant is a science

best science fiction fantasy and armored she lives in a former temperance colony on the central coast of california where she sometimes gets to watch rocket launches with her husband and her two amazing daughters she called herself audra though that wasnt her real name he called himself miles but she suspected it wasnt his either she was young how young she would not say beautiful or so her emil had told her and she had a keen interest in stories miles was old tattooed perverted and often mean but he knew stories that no one else knew and she was certain that he was the only one who could help her get back home she found him among the artists makers and deviants they called him uncle and spoke of him sometimes with loathing sometimes respect but almost always with a tinge of awea magician in a world of technicians they did not know what to make of him but audra saw him for what he truly was there once was a youth of low birth who aspired to the place of kings magician the villagers scoffed emil you will do naught but mind the sheep but in his heart he knew that he could possess great magic the hedge witches and midwives laughed at the shepherd boy who played at sorcery but indulged his earnestness he learned charms for love and marriage womens magic but he would not be shamed by it and for wealth and luck but none of this satisfied him for it brought him no nearer to the throne for that he needed real power and he did not know where to find it he had a childhood playmate named aurora and as they approached adulthood aurora grew in both beauty and cleverness their childhood affection turned to true love and on her birthday they were betrothed the day came when the youth knew he had learned all that he could in the nearby villages and towns the lovers wept and declared their devotion with an exchange of humble silver rings with a final kiss emil left his true love behind and set out to find the source of true power it was not hard to meet him once she understood his tastes a tuck of her skirt a tug at her chemise a bright ribbon new stockings and dark kohl to line her eyes she followed him to a club he frequented where musicians played discordant arrangements and the patrons were as elaborately costumed as the performers she walked past his booth where he smoked cigarettes and drank scotch surrounded by colorful young women and effeminate young men you there bo peep come here she met his dark eyes turned her back on him and walked away the sycophants who surrounded him bitched and whined their contempt for her he barked at them to shut up as she made her way to the door once she had rejected him it was easy she waited for his fourth frustrated overture before she joined him at his table so she said as she lifted his glass to her lips uninvited tell me a story what kind of story a fairy tale whatsomething with elves and princes and happilyeverafter no she said and reached across the corner of the table to turn his face toward her he seemed startled but complied and leaned in until their faces were just inches apart a real fairy tale with wolves and witches jealous parents woodsmen charged with murdering the innocent tell me a story miles she could feel his breath against her cheek falter as she leaned ever closer and spoke softly into his ear tell me a story that is true audra was footsore and weary when they reached the house at dawn she stumbled on the stone walk and caught miless arm to steady her are you sure you dont need anything from home he asked as he worked his key in the lock at his mention of home she remembered again to hate him quite sure she said he faced her this time with a different kind of appraisal there was no leer no suspicion he touched her face and his habitual scowl relaxed into something like a smile you remind me of someone i knew once long ago the smile vanished and he opened the front door stepping aside to let her pass his house was small and filled with a peculiar collection of things that told her she had the right man many of them where achingly familiar to audra a wooden spindle in the entryway wound with golden thread a dainty glass shoe on the mantle almost small enough to fit a child in the corner a stone statue of an ugly twisted creature one arm thrown protectively over its eyes what a remarkable collection she said and forced a smile it must have taken a long time to assemble longer than i care to think of he picked a golden pear off the shelf and examined it none of it is what i wanted he returned it to the shelf with a careless toss ill show you the bedroom the room was bare in contrast with the rest of the house no ornament hung on the white plaster walls no picture rested on the dresser the bed was small though big enough for two and covered in a faded quilt it was flanked by a table on one side and a bent wood chair on the other audra sat stiffly at the foot of the bed the mattress creaked as miles sat down beside her she turned toward him with resolve and braced herself for the inevitable she would do whatever it took to get back home she had done worse and with less cause he leaned in close and stroked her hair she could smell him sweet and smoky familiar and foreign at the same time she lifted a hand to caress his smooth head where he lingered above her breast he caught her wrist and straightened pressed her palm to his cheekeyes closed forehead creased in painthen abruptly dropped her hand and rose from the bed if you need more blankets theyre in the wardrobe sleep well he said and left audra to wonder what had gone wrong and to consider her next move aurora was as ambitious as emil but of a different nature she believed that the minds of most men were selfish and swayed only by fear or greed in her heart there nestled a seed of doubt that emil could get his wish through pure knowledge and practice she resolved in her love for him to secure his place through craft and wile aurora knew the ways of tales she planted the seed of rumor in soil in which it grew best the bowry the laundry anywhere the women gathered she talked of his power but word of the powerful sorcerer had to reach the king himself and to get close enough she would need to use a different craft the hands of guards and pikemen were rougher than emils the mouths of servants less tender she ignited the fire of ambition in their hearts with flattery and fanned it with promises that emil the most powerful sorcerer in the kingdom would repay those who supported him once he was installed in the palace and if she had regrets as she hurried from chamber to cottage in the cold night air she dismissed them as just a step on the road toward realizing her lovers dream audra woke at midday to find a note on the chair in the corner of the room in deep black ink and an unpracticed hand was written stay if you like or go as you please i am accountable to only one and that one is not you if that arrangement suits you make yourself at home m it suited her just fine she searched the house she wasnt sure what she was looking for but she was certain that any object of power great enough to rip her from her own world would be obvious somehow it would be odd otherworldly she thoughtbut that described everything here like a ravens hoard every nook contained some shiny stolen object on a shelf in the library she found a clear glass apothecary jar labeled east wind thief she thought audra hoped that the east wind didnt suffer for the lack of the contents of the jar she would keep an eye on the weather vane and return it at the first opportunity something on the shelf caught her eye small and shining and her contempt turned to rage murderer she pocketed emils ring miles seemed to dislike mirrors there were none in the bedroom none even in the washroom the only mirror in the house was an ornate gilded thing that hung in the library she paused in front of it startled at her disheveled appearance she smoothed her hair with her fingers and leaned in to examine her bloodshot eyesand found someone elses eyes looking back at her the gaunt androgynous face that gazed dolefully from deep within the mirror was darker and older than her own hello she said to the magic mirror im audra the mirror shook its head disapprovingly youre right she admitted but we dont give strangers our true names do we she considered her new companion the long lines of its insubstantial face told audra that it had worn that mournful look for a long time did he steal you as well perhaps we can help each other find a way home the answer is here somewhere the face in the mirror brightened and it nodded audra had an idea would you like me to read to you emil travelled a bitter road in search of the knowledge that would make his fortune by day he starved by night he froze but one day luck was with him and he caught two large healthy hares before sunset as he huddled beside his small fire the hares roasting over the flames a short and grizzled man came out of the forest carrying a sack of goods good evening grandfather emil said to the little man sit share my fire and supper the man gratefully accepted what do you sell emil asked pots and pans needles and spices the old man said know you any magic emil asked disappointed he was beginning to think the knowledge he sought didnt exist and he was losing hope what does a shepherd need with magic how did you know im a shepherd emil asked in surprise i know many things the man said and then groaned and doubled over in pain what ails you emil cried rushing to the old mans side nothing that you can help lad ive a disease of the gut that none can cure and my time may be short emil questioned the man about his ailment and pulled from his pack dozens of pouches of herbs and powders he heated water for a medicinal brew while the old man groaned and clutched his stomach the man pulled horrible faces as he drank down the bitter tea but before long his pain eased and he was able to sit upright again emil mixed another batch of the preparation and assured him that he would be cured if he drank the tea for seven days i was wrong about you the man said youre no shepherd he pulled a scroll from deep within his pack for your kindness ill give you what youve traveled the world seeking the little man explained that the scroll contained three powerful spells written in a language that no man had spoken in a thousand years the first was a spell to summon a benevolent spirit who would then guide him in his learning the second summoned objects from one world into another for every child knew that there were many worlds and that it was possible to pierce the veil between them the third would transport a person between worlds if he could decipher the three spells he would surely become the most powerful sorcerer in the kingdom emil offered the old man what coins he had but he refused he simply handed over the scroll bade emil farewell and walked back into the forest audra filled her time reading to the mirror the shelves were filled with hundreds of books old and new leatherbound and giltedged or flimsy and sized to be carried in a pocket she devoured them looking for clues how she got here how she might get back on a bottom shelf in the library in the sixth book of a twelvevolume set she found her story the illustrations throughout the blue clothbound book were full of round cheerful children and curling vines she recognized some of her friends and enemies from her old life there was miska who fooled the manwiththeironhead and whom she had met once on his travels on another page she found the fairy who brought the waterfall to the mountain whom audra resolved to visit as soon as she got home she turned the page and her breath caught in her throat the magician and the maid the title read beneath the illustration were those familiar words once upon a time a white rabbit bounded between birch trees toward audras cottage between the treetops a castle gleamed pink in the sunset light the place where her story was supposed to end audra traced the outline of the rabbit with her finger and then traced the two lonely shadows that followed close behind two shadows one her own and the other emils audra was reading to the mirror a story it seemed to particularly like it did tricks for her as she read creating wispy images in the glass that matched the prose she had just reached the best part where the trolls turn to stone in the light of the rising sun when she heard footsteps outside the library door the mirror looked anxiously toward the sound and then slipped out of sight beyond the carved frame the door burst open who are you talking to miles demanded whos here he smelled of scotch and sweat and his overcoat had a new stain no one i like to read aloud i am alone here all day she said dont pretend i owe you anything he slouched into the chair and pulled a cigarette from his coat you might make yourself useful he said read to me the room was small and she stood no more than an arms length away feeling like a school girl being made to recite she opened to a story she did not know a tale called the snow queen and began to read miles closed his eyes and listened little kay was quite blue with cold indeed almost black but he did not feel it for the snow queen had kissed away the icy shiverings and his heart was already a lump of ice she read she glanced down at him when she paused for breath to find him looking at her in a way that she knew all too well finally an advantage she let her voice falter when he ran a finger up the side of her leg lifting her skirt a few inches above her knee she did not stop readingit was working something in him had changed as she read sex was a weak foothold but it was the only one she had and perhaps it would be a step toward getting into his mind he dragged some sharp flat pieces of ice to and fro and placed them together in all kinds of positions as if he wished to make something out of them he composed many complete figures forming different words but there was one word he never could manage to form although he wished it very much it was the word eternity he fingered the cord tied at her waist and tugged it gently at first then more insistently he leaned forward in the chair and unfastened the last hook on her corset just at this moment it happened that little gerda came through the great door of the castle cutting winds were raging around her but she offered up a prayer and the winds sank down as if they were going to sleep and she went on till she came to the large empty hall and caught sight of kay she knew him directly she flew to him and threw her arms round his neck and held him fast while she exclaimed kay dear little kay i have found you at last his fingers stopped their manipulations his hands were still on her the fastenings held between his fingertips she dared not breathe whatever control she had for those few minutes was gone she tried to reclaim it to keep going as if nothing had happened she even dropped a hand from the book and reached out to touch him his hand snapped up and caught hers he stood pulling hard on her arm enough he left the room without looking back she heard the front door slam audra straightened her clothes in frustration and wondered again what had gone wrong it took only a moments thought for audra to decide to follow him she peered out into the street there he was a block away already casting a long shadow in the lamp light on the wet pavement her feet were cold and her shoes wet through by the time he finally stopped at a warehouse deep in a maze of brick complexes he manipulated a complex series of locks on the dented and rusting steel door and disappeared inside so this was where he went at night not to clubs and parlors as she had thought but here on the edge of the inhabited city to a warehouse only notable for having all its window glass the windows were too high for her to see into but a dumpster beneath one of them offered her a chance the metal bin was slick with mist and she slipped off it twice but on her third try she hoisted herself on top and nervously peered through the filthy glass of the window in the dim light she could just make out the shape of miles rubbing his hands fiercely together as if to warm them then unrolling somethingpaper or parchmentspreading it out carefully in front of him on the concrete floor he stood and began to speak the room grew brighter and a face appeared in front of him suspended in the aira familiar face made of dim green light audra could see little of it through the dirty glass she could hear miless voice urgent and almost desperate but the words he shouted at the thing made no sense to her she shifted her weight to ease the pain of her knee pressing against the metal of the dumpster and slipped she fell and cried out in pain as she landed hard on the pavement she didnt know if miles had heard but she did not wait to find out she picked herself upnow wet filthy and achingand ran when she reached the house she went straight to the library audra shifted the books on the shelf so that the remaining volumes were flush against each other and she hid her book in the small trunk where she kept her few clothes the mirrors face emerged from its hiding place behind the frame looking worried and wan its my story after all she told it i wont let him do any more damage what if he takes the cottage the woods where would i have to go home to no he cant have any more of our story the language of the scroll was not as impossible as the little man had saidwhile it was not his own it was similar enough that someone as clever as emil could puzzle it out he applied himself to little else and before long emil could struggle through half of the first spell but when he thought of arriving home after so long still unable to execute even the simplest of the three the frustration in him grew surely he thought he should begin with the hardest for having mastered that the simpler ones will come with ease so thinking he set out to learn the last of the three spells before he arrived home when miles finally returned the following evening at dusk he looked exhausted and filthy as if he had slept on the floor of the warehouse she met him in the kitchen and didnt ask questions he brooded on a chair in the corner while she chopped vegetables on the island butcher block never taking his eyes off her then stood abruptly and left the room the hiss and sputter of the vegetables as they hit the pan echoed the angry inarticulate hiss in her mind she had been here for days and she was no closer to getting home the knife felt heavy and solid in her hand as she cubed a slab of marbled meat she imagined miles under the knife imagined his fear and pain she would get it out of himhow to get homeand he would tell her what he had done to her emil before the miserable bastard died sounds from the next room were punctuated with curses the crack of heavy books being unshelved made her flinch where is it he first seemed to ask himself then louder where he demanded of the room at large then a roar erupted from the doorway what have you done with it you vicious witch a cold wash of fear cleared away her thoughts of revenge what are you talking about my book he said where is it what have you done with it he came at her hunched like an advancing wolf they circled the butcher block she gripped the knife and dared not blink for fear that he would take a split second advantage and lunge for her you have many books and i only care about one his hand shot out and caught her wrist bringing her arm down against the scarred wood with a painful shock the knife fell from her hand he dragged her into the library there he said pointing to the shelf where her book had been six of twelve it was there and now its not he relaxed his grip without letting go if you borrowed it its fine i just want it back he released her and forced a smile now where is it youre right she said i borrowed it i didnt realize it was so important to you its very special yes she said her voice low and hard it is and with that she knew she had given herself away miles shoved her away from him she fell into the bookcase as he left the small library and shut the door behind him a key turned in the lock it was too late she rested with her forehead against the door and caught her breath she tried to pry open the small window but it was sealed shut with layers of paint she considered breaking the glass and then thought better of it she could escape from this house it was true but not from this world for that she still needed miles she watched the sun set through the dirty window and tried to decide what to do when he let her out she heard him pacing through the house talking to himself with ever greater stridency but the words made no sense to her it gave her a headache the sound of the key in the door woke her she grabbed at the first thing that might serve as a weapon a sturdy hardcover she held in front of her like a shield miles stood in the doorway a long wicked knife in his hand who are you he finally asked his eyes narrowed with suspicion and how did you know someone whose life you destroyed liar thief murderer she produced emils ring he seemed frozen where he stood his eyes darting back and forth between the ring in her hand and her face i am none of those things he said you took all of this she gestured around the room you took him and you took me and what did you do with the things that were of no use to you she had been edging toward him while she talked she threw the book at his arm and it struck him just as she had hoped the knife fell to the floor and she dove for it snatching it up before miles could stop her she had him now she thought and pressed the blade against his throat he tried to push her off but she had a tenacious grip on him and he ceased his struggle when the knife pierced his thin skin she felt his body tense in her hands barely breathing and perfectly still you still havent told me who you are where is he she demanded where is who his voice was smooth and controlled the man you stole like you stole me like you stole all of it where is he youre obviously very upset put that down let me go and well talk about it i dont know about any stolen man but maybe i can help you find him he voice was calm slightly imploring asking for understanding and offering help she hesitated wondering what threat she was really willing to carry out against an enemy who was also her only hope she waited a moment too long miles grabbed a heavy jar off the shelf and hurled it at the wall the east wind ripped through the room finally free fatigued and halfstarved emil made his way slowly toward his home and tried to unlock the spell soon he had three words and then five and soon a dozen he would say them aloud emphasizing this part or that elongating a sound or shortening it until the day he gave voice to the last character on the page and something happened a spark a glimmer of magic he had ciphered out the spell finally on the coldest night he could remember with not a soul in sight he raised his voice against the howling wind and shouted out the thirteen words of power as weeks turned into months the stories of emil the sorcerer grew until finally even the king had heard and wanted his power within his own control but emil could not be found the angry vortex threw everything off the shelves audra ducked and covered her head as she was pummeled by books and debris miles crouched behind the trunk which offered little protection from the gale there was a crash above audras head her arms flew up to protect her eyes broken glass struck her arms and legs some falling away some piercing her skin the window broke with a final crash and the captive wind escaped the room the storm was over books thumped and glass tinkled to the ground audra opened her eyes to the wreckage miles was already sifting through the pages and torn covers no he said no it has to be here my story has to be here he bled from a hundred small cuts but he paid them no mind audra plucked shards of dark glass out of her flesh the shards gave off no reflection at all a cloud drifted from where the mirror had hung over the wreckagestrewn shelves searching on the floor beside audras trunk the lid torn off in the storm it seemed to find what it was looking for it slipped between the pages of a blue clothbound volume and disappeared here audra said clutching the volume to her chest he scrambled toward her until they kneeled together in the middle of the floor face to face smoke curled out of the pages only a wisp at first then more green and glowing like a sunbeam in a mossy pond crept out and wrapped itself around both them the guide you sought was always here a voice whispered your captive emil and your friend aurora audraauroralooked at the man she had hated and saw what was there all along her emil thirty years since he had disappeared with bald head and graying beard miles who kept her because she looked like his lost love but who wouldnt touch her in faith to his beloved emil looked back at her tears in the eyes that had seemed so dead and without hope until now now emil speak the

don juan the second place you come tothe first having proved unsatisfactory for one reason and anotheris a city which could almost be san francisco perhaps it is sitting out there on the peninsula between the ocean and the bay white buildings clambering over improbably steep hills it occupies the place in your psychic space that san francisco has always occupied although you dont really know yet what this city calls itself perhaps youll find out before long you go forward what you feel first is the strangeness of the familiar and then the utter heartless familiarity of the strange for example the automobiles and there are plenty of them are all halftracks low sleek sexy sedans that have the flashy detroit styling the usual chrome the usual streamlining the lowraked windows all agleam but there are only two wheels both of them in front with a pair of treadbelts circling endlessly in back is this good design for city use who knows somebody evidently thinks so here and then the newspapers the format is the same narrow columns gaudy screaming headlines miles of black type on coarse greyishwhite paper but the names and the places have been changed you scan the front page of a newspaper in the window of a kerbside vending machine big photo of chairman degrasse serving as host at a reception for the patagonian ambassador an account of the tribal massacres in the highlands of dzungaria details of the solitude epidemic that is devastating persepolis when the halftracks stall on the hillsides which is often the other drivers ring silvery chimes politely venting their impatience men who look like navahos chant what sound like sutras in the intersections the traffic lights are blue and orange clothing tends toward the prosaic greys and dark blues but the cut and slope of mens jackets has an angular formal eighteenthcentury look verging on pomposity you pick up a bright coin that lies in the street it is vaguely metallic but rubbery as if you could compress it between your fingers and its thick edges bear incuse lettering to god we owe our swords on the next block a squat twostorey building is ablaze and agitated clerks do a desperate dance the fire engine is glossy green and its pump looks like a diabolical cannon embellished with sweeping flanges it spouts a glistening yellow foam that eats the flames and oxidizing runs off down the gutter a trickle of sluggish blue fluid everyone wears eyeglasses here everyone at a sidewalk caf√© pale waitresses offer mugs of boilinghot milk into which the silent tightfaced patrons put cinnamon mustard and what seems to be tabasco sauce you offer your coin and try a sample imitating what they do and everyone bursts into laughter the girl behind the counter pushes a thick stack of paper currency at

parade is coming trumpets drums faroff chanting look four naked boys carry an open brocaded litter on which there sits an immense block of ice a great frosted cube mysterious impenetrable patagonia the onlookers cry sadly the word is wrenched from them patagonia next marching by himself a mitred bishop advances all in green curtseying to the crowd tossing hearty blessings as though they were flowers forget your sins cancel your debts all is made new all is good you shiver and peer intently into his eyes as he passes you hoping that he will single you out for an embrace he is terribly tall but whitehaired and fragile somehow despite his agility and energy he reminds you of norman your wifes older brother and perhaps he is norman the norman of this place and you wonder if he can give you news of elizabeth the elizabeth of this place but you say nothing and he goes by and then comes a tremendous wooden scaffold on wheels a true juggernaut at the summit of which rests a polished statue carved out of gleaming black stone a human figure male plump arms intricately folded face complacent the statue emanates a sense of vast sumerian calm the face is that of chairman degrasse hell die in the first blizzard murmurs a man to your left another turning suddenly says with great force no its going to be done the proper way hell last until the time of the accidents just as hes supposed to ill bet on that instantly they are nose to nose glaring and then they are wageringa tense complicated ritual involving slapping of palms interchanges of slips of paper formal voiding of spittle hysterical appeals to witnesses the emotional climate here seems a trifle too intense you decide to move along warily you leave the caf√© looking in all directions before you began your travels you were told how essential it was to define your intended role were you going to be a tourist or an explorer or an infiltrator those are the choices that confront anyone arriving at a new place each bears its special risks to opt for being a tourist is to choose the easiest but most contemptible path ultimately its the most dangerous one too in a certain sense you have to accept the builtin epithets that go with the part they will think of you as a foolish tourist an ignorant tourist a vulgar tourist a mere tourist do you want to be considered mere are you able to accept that is that really your preferred selfimagebaffled bewildered led about by the nose youll sign up for packaged tours youll carry guidebooks and cameras youll go to the cathedral and the museums and the marketplace and youll remain always on the outside of things seeing a great deal experiencing nothing what a waste you will be diminished by the very travelling that you thought would expand you tourism hollows and parches you all places become one a hotel a smiling swarthy sunglassed guide a bus a plaza a fountain a marketplace a museum a cathedral you are transformed into a feeble shrivelled thing made out of gluedtogether travel folders you are naked but for your visas the sum of your lifes adventures is a box of leftover small change from many indistinguishable lands to be an explorer is to make the macho choice you swagger in bent on conquest for isnt any discovery a kind of conquest your existential position like that of any mere tourist lies outside the heart of things but you are unashamed of that and while tourists are essentially passive the explorers role is active an explorer intends to grasp that heart take possession squeeze in the explorers role you consciously cloak yourself in the trappings of power selfassurance thick bankroll stack of credit cards you capitalize on the glamour of being a stranger your curiosity is invincible you ask unabashed questions about the most intimate things never for an instant relinquishing eye contact you open locked doors and flash bright lights into curtained rooms you are magellan you are malinowski you are captain cook you will gain much butah here is the priceyou will always be feared and hated you will never be permitted to attain the true core nor is superficiality the worst peril remember that magellan and captain cook left their bones on tropic beaches sometimes the natives lose patience with explorers the infiltrator though his is at once the most difficult role and the most rewarding one will it be yours consider youll have to get right with it when you reach your destination instantly learn the regulations find your way around like an old hand discover the location of shops and freeways and hotels figure out the units of currency the rules of social intercourseall of this knowledge mastered surreptitiously through observation alone while moving about silently camouflaged never asking for help you must become a part of the world you have entered and the way to do it is to encourage a general assumption that you already are a part of it have always been a part of it wherever you land you need to recognize that life has been going on for millions of years life goes on there steadily with you or without you you are the intrusive one and if you dont want to feel intrusive youd better learn fast how to fit in of course it isnt easy the infiltrator doesnt have the privilege of buying stability by acting dumb you wont be able to say how much does it cost to ride on the cable car you wont be able to say im from somewhere else and this is the kind of money i carry dollars quarters pennies halves nickels is any of it legal tender here you dont dare identify yourself in any way as an outsider if you dont get the idioms or the accent right you can tell them you grew up out of town but thats as much as you can reveal the truth is your eternal secret even when youre in trouble especially when youre in trouble when your backs to the wall you wont have time to say look i wasnt born in this universe at all you see i came zipping in from some other place so pardon me forgive me excuse me pity me no no no you cant do that they wont believe you and even if they do theyll make it all the worse for you once they know if you want to infiltrate cameron youve got to fake it all the way jaunty smile steely even gaze and you have to infiltrate you know that dont you you dont really have any choice infiltrating has its dangers too the rough part comes when they find you out and they always will find you out then theyll react bitterly against your deception theyll lash out in blind rage if youre lucky youll be gone before they learn your sweaty little secret before they discover the discarded phrasebook hidden in the boardinghouse room before they stumble on the tornoff pages of your private journal theyll find you out they always do but by then youll be somewhere else you hope beyond the reach of their anger and their sorrow beyond their reach suppose i show you for exhibit a cameron reacting to an extraordinary situation you can test your own resilience by trying to picture yourself in his position there has been a sensation in camerons mind very much like that of the extinction of the cosmos a thunderclap everything going black a blankness a total absence followed by the return of light flowing inward upon him like high tide on the celestial shore a surging stream of brightness moving with inexorable certainty he stands flatfooted dumbfounded high on a bare hillside in warm earlyhour sunlight the houseredwood timbers picture window driftwood sculptures paintings books records refrigerator gallon jugs of red wine carpets tiles avocado plants in wooden tubs carport car drivewayis gone the neighbouring houses are gone the winding street is gone the eucalyptus forest that ought to be behind him rising toward the crest of the hill is gone downslope there is no oakland there is no berkeley only a scattering of crude squatters shacks running raggedly along unpaved switchbacks toward the pure blue bay across the water there is no bay bridge on the far shore there is no san francisco the golden gate bridge does not span the gap between the city and the marin headlandcameron is astonished not that he didnt expect something like this but that the transformation is so complete so absolute if you dont want your world any more the old man had said you can drop it cant you let go of it let it drop cant you of course you can and so cameron has let go of it hes in another place entirely now wherever this place is it isnt home the sprawling bay area cities and towns arent here never were goodbye san leandro san mateo el cerrito walnut creek he sees a landscape of gentle bare hills rolling meadows the dry brown grass of summer the scarring hand of man is evident only occasionally he begins to adapt this is what he must have wanted after all and though he has been jarred by the shock of transition he is recovering quickly he is settling in he feels already that he could belong here he will explore this unfamiliar world and if he finds it good he will discover a niche for himself the air is sweet the sky is cloudless has he really gone to some new place or is he still in the old place and has everything else that was there simply gone away easy he has gone everything else has gone the cosmos has entered into a transitional phase nothings stable any more from this moment onward camerons existence is a conditional matter subject to ready alteration what did the old man say go wherever you like define your world as you would like it to be and go there and if you discover that you dont care for this or dont need that why go somewhere else its all trips this universe what else is there there isnt anything but trips just trips so here you are friend new frameworks new patterns new there is a sound to his left the crackling of dry brush underfoot and cameron turns looking straight into the morning sun and sees a man on horseback approaching him he is tall slender about camerons own height and build it seems but perhaps a shade broader through the shoulders his hair like camerons is golden but it is much longer descending in a straight flow to his shoulders and tumbling onto his chest he has a soft full curling beard untrimmed but tidy he wears a widebrimmed hat buckskin chaps and a light fringed jacket of tawny leather because of the sunlight cameron has difficulty at first making out his features but after a moment his eyes adjust and he sees that the others face is very much like his own thin lips jutting highbridged nose cleft chin cool blue eyes below heavy brows of course your face is my face you and i i and you drawn to the same place at the same time across the many worlds cameron had not expected this but now that it has happened it seems to have been inevitable they look at each other neither speaks during that silent moment cameron invents a scene for them he imagines the other dismounting inspecting him in wonder walking around him peering into his face studying it frowning shaking his head finally grinning and saying ill be damned i never knew i had a twin brother but here you are its just like looking in the mirror we arent twins weve got the same face same everything trim away a little hair and nobody could tell me from you you from me if we arent twins what are we were closer than brothers i dont follow your meaning friend this is how it is im you youre me one soul one identity whats your name cameron of course first name kit thats short for christopher isnt it my name is cameron too chris short for christopher i tell you were one and the same person out of two different worlds closer than brothers closer than anything none of this is said however instead the man in the leather clothing rides slowly toward cameron pauses gives him a long incurious stare and says simply morning nice day and continues onward wait cameron says the man halts looks back what never ask for help fake it all the way jaunty smile steely even gaze yes cameron remembers all that somehow though infiltration seems easier to bring off in a city you can blend into the background there more difficult here exposed as you are against the stark unpeopled landscape cameron says as casually as he can using what he hopes is a colourless neutral accent ive been travelling out from inland came a long way umm didnt think you were from around here your clothes inland clothes the way you talk different so new to these parts wondered if you could tell me a place i could hire a room till i got settled you come all this way on foot had a mule lost him back in the valley lost everything i had with me umm indians cutting up again you give them a little gin they go crazy the other smiles faintly then the smile fades and he retreats into impassivity sitting motionless with hands on thighs face a mask of patience that seems merely to be a thin covering for impatience or worse indians they gave me a rough time cameron says getting into the fantasy of it umm cleaned me out let me go umm umm cameron feels his sense of a shared identity with this man lessening there is no way of engaging him i am you you are i and yet you take no notice of the strange fact that i wear your face and body you seem to show no interest in me at all or else you hide your interest amazingly well cameron says you know where i can get lodging nothing much around here not many settlers this side of the bay i guess im strong i can do most any kind of work maybe you could use umm no cold dismissal glitters in the frosty eyes cameron wonders how often people in the world of his former life saw such a look in his own a tug on the reins your time is up stranger the horse swings around and begins picking its way daintily along the path desperately cameron calls one thing more umm is your name cameron a flicker of interest might be christopher cameron kit chris that you kit the others eyes drill into his own the mouth compresses until the lips are invisible not a scowl but a speculative pensive movement there is tension in the way the other man grasps his reins for the first time cameron feels that he has made contact kit cameron yes why your wife cameron says her name elizabeth the tension increases the other cameron is cloaked in explosive silence something terrible is building within him then unexpectedly the tension snaps the other man spits scowls slumps in his saddle my womans dead he mutters say who the hell are you what do you want with me imim cameron falters he is overwhelmed by fear and pity a bad start a lamentable start he trembles he had not thought it would be anything like this with an effort he masters himself fiercely he says ive got to know was her name elizabeth for an answer the horseman whacks his heels savagely against his mounts ribs and gallops away fleeing as though he has had an encounter with satan go the old man said you know the score this is how it is everythings random nothings fixed unless we want it to be and even then the system isnt as stable as we think it is so go go go he said and of course hearing something like that cameron went what else could he do once he had his freedom but abandon his native universe and try a different one notice that i didnt say a better one just a different one or two or three or five different ones it was a gamble certainly he might lose everything that mattered to him and gain nothing worth having but what of it every day is full of gambles like that you stake your life whenever you open a door you never know whats heading your way not ever and still you choose to play the game how can a man be expected to become all hes capable of becoming if he spends his whole life pacing up and down the same courtyard go make your voyages time forks again and again and again new universes split off at each instant of decision left turn right turn honk your horn jump the traffic light hit your gas hit your brake every action spawns whole galaxies of possibility we move through a soup of infinities if repressing a sneeze generates an alternative continuum what then are the consequences of the truly major acts the assassinations and inseminations the conversions the renunciations go and as you travel mull these thoughts constantly part of the game is discerning the precipitating factors that shaped the worlds you visit whats the story here dirt roads donkeycarts handsewn clothes no industrial revolution is that it the steamengine manwhat was his name savery newcomen wattsmothered in his cradle no mines no factories no assembly lines no dark satanic mills that must be it the air is so pure here you can tell by that its a simpler era very good cameron you see the patterns swiftly but now try somewhere else your own self has rejected you here besides this place has no elizabeth close your eyes summon the lightning the parade has reached a disturbing level of frenzy marchers and floats now occupy the side streets as well as the main boulevard and there is no way to escape from their demonic enthusiasm streamers cascade from office windows and gigantic photographs of chairman degrasse have sprouted on every wall suddenly like dark infestations of lichen a boy presses close against cameron extends a clenched fist opens his fingers on his palm rests a glittering jewelled case eggshaped thumbnailsized spores from patagonia he says let me have ten exchanges and theyre yours politely cameron declines a woman in a blue and orange frock tugs at his arm and says urgently all the rumours are true you know theyve just been confirmed what are you going to do about that what are you going to do cameron shrugs and smiles and disengages himself a man with gleaming buttons asks are you enjoying the festival ive sold everything and im going to move to the highway next godsday cameron nods and murmurs congratulations hoping congratulations are in order he turns a corner and confronts once more the bishop who looks like elizabeths brother who is he concludes indeed elizabeths brother forget your sins he is crying still cancel your debts cameron thrusts his head between two plump girls at the kerb and attempts to call to him but his voice fails nothing coming forth but a hoarse wordless rasp and the bishop moves on moving on is a good idea cameron tells himself this place exhausts him he has come to it too soon and its manic tonality is more than he wants to handle he finds a quiet alleyway presses his cheek against a cool brick wall and stands there breathing deeply until he is calm enough to depart all right onward empty grasslands spread to the horizon this could be the gobi steppe cameron sees neither cities nor towns nor even villages just six or seven squat black tents pitched in a loose circle in the saddle between two low greygreen hummocks a few hundred yards from where he stands he looks beyond across the gently folded land and spies dark animal figures at the limits of his range of vision about a dozen horses close together muzzle to muzzle flank to flank horses with riders or perhaps they are a congregation of centaurs anything is possible he decides though that they are indians a war party of young braves maybe camping in these desolate plains they see him quite likely they saw him some while before he noticed them casually they break out of their grouping wheel ride in his direction he awaits them why should he flee where could he hide their pace accelerates from trot to canter from canter to wild gallop now they plunge toward him with fluid ferocity and a terrifying eagerness they wear open leather jackets and rough rawhide leggings they carry lances bows battleaxes long curved swords they ride small agile horses hardly more than ponies tireless packets of energy they surround him pulling up the fierce little steeds rearing and whinnying they peer at him point laugh exchange harsh derisive comments in a mysterious language then solemnly they begin to ride slowly in a wide circle around him they are flatfaced smallnosed bearded with broad prominent cheekbones the crowns of their heads are shaven but long black hair streams down over their ears and the napes of their necks heavy folds in the upper lids give their eyes a slanted look their skins are coppercoloured but with an underlying golden tinge as though these are not indians at all butwhat japanese a samurai corps no probably not japanese but not indians either they continue to circle him gradually moving more swiftly they chatter to one another and occasionally hurl what sound like questions at him they seem fascinated by him but also contemptuous in a sudden demonstration of horsemanship one of them cuts from the circular formation and goading his horse to an instant gallop streaks past cameron leaning down to jab a finger into his forearm then another does it and another streaking back and forth across the circle poking him plucking at his hair tweaking him nearly running him down they draw their swords and swish them through the air just above his head they menace him or pretend to with their lances throughout it all they laugh he stands perfectly still this ordeal he suspects is a test of his courage which he passes eventually the lunatic galloping ceases they rein in and several of them dismount they are little men chesthigh to him but thicker through the chest and shoulders than he is one unships a leather pouch and offers it to him with an unmistakable gesture take drink cameron sips cautiously it is a thick greyish fluid both sweet and sour fermented milk he gags winces forces himself to sip again they watch him closely the second taste isnt so bad he takes a third more willingly and gravely returns the pouch the warriors laugh not derisively now but more in applause and the man who had given him the pouch slaps camerons shoulder admiringly he tosses the pouch back to cameron then he leaps to his saddle and abruptly they all take off mongols cameron realizes the sons of genghis khan riding to the horizon a worldwide empire yes and this must be the wild west for them the frontier where the young men enact their rites of passage back in europe after seven centuries of mongol dominance they have become citified domesticated sippers of wine theatregoers cultivators of gardens but here they follow the ways of their allconquering forefathers cameron shrugs nothing for him here he takes a last sip of the milk and drops the pouch into the tall grass onward no grass here he sees the stumps of buildings the blackened trunks of dead trees mounds of broken tile and brick the smell of death is in the air all the bridges are down fog rolls in off the bay dense and greasy and becomes a screen on which images come alive these ruins are inhabited figures move about they are the living dead looking into the thick mist he sees a vision of the shock wave he recoils as alpha particles shower his skin he beholds the survivors emerging from their shattered houses straggling into the smouldering streets naked stunned their bodies charred their eyes glazed some of them with their hair on fire the walking dead no one speaks no one asks why this has happened he is watching a silent movie the apocalyptic fire has touched the ground here the land itself is burning blue phosphorescent flames rise from the earth the final judgment the day of wrath now he hears a dread music beginning a death march all cellos and basses the dark notes coming at wide intervals ooom ooom ooom ooom ooom and then the tempo picks up the music becomes a danse macabre syncopated lively the timbre still dark the rhythms funereal ooom ooom ooomdeooom deooom deooom deooomdeooom jerky chaotic wildly gay the distorted melody of the ode to joy lurks somewhere in the ragged strands of sound the dying victims stretch their fleshless hands toward him he shakes his head what service can i do for you guilt assails him he is a tourist in the land of their grief their eyes reproach him he would embrace them but he fears they will crumble at his touch and he lets the procession go past him without doing anything to cross the gulf between himself and them elizabeth he murmurs norman they have no faces only eyes what can i do i cant do anything for you not even tears will come he looks away though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing but this world is beyond the reach of love he looks away the sun appears the fog burns off the visions fade he sees only the dead land the ashes the ruins all right here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come onward onward and now after this series of brief disconcerting intermediate stops cameron has come to a city that is san francisco beyond doubt not some other city on san franciscos site but a true san francisco a recognizable san francisco he pops into it atop russian hill at the very crest on a dazzling brilliant cloudless day to his left below lies fishermans wharf ahead of him rises the coit tower yes and he can see the ferry building and the bay bridge familiar landmarksbut how strange all the rest seems where is the eyestabbing transamerica pyramid where is the colossal sombre stalk of the bank of america the strangeness he realizes derives not so much from substitutions as from absences the big embarcadero developments are not there nor the chinatown holiday inn nor the miserable tentacles of the elevated freeways nor apparently anything else that was constructed in the last twenty years this is the old shortshanked san francisco of his boyhood a sparkling miniature city unmanhattanized skylineless surely he has returned to the place he knew in the sleepy s the tranquil eisenhower years he heads downhill searching for a newspaper box he finds one at the corner of hyde and north point a brightyellow metal rectangle san francisco chronicle ten cents is that the right price for one roosevelt dime goes into the slot the paper he finds is dated tuesday august in what cameron still thinks of with some irony now as the real world the world that has been receding rapidly from him all day in a series of discontinuous jumps it is also tuesday the th of august so he has not gone backward in time at all he has come to a san francisco where time had seemingly been standing still why in vertigo he eyes the front page a threecolumn headline declares fuehrer arrives in washington under it to the left a photograph of three men smiling broadly positively beaming at one another the caption identifies them as president kennedy fuehrer goering and ambassador togarashi of japan meeting in the white house rose garden cameron closes his eyes using no data other than the headline and the caption he attempts to concoct a plausible speculation this is a world he decides in which the axis must have won the war the united states is a german fiefdom there are no highrise buildings in san francisco because the american economy shattered by defeat has not yet in thirty years of peace returned to a level where it can afford to erect them or perhaps because american venture capital prodded by the financial ministers of the third reich hjalmar schacht the name drifts out of the swampy recesses of memory now tends to flow toward europe but how could it have happened cameron remembers the war years clearly the tremendous surge of patriotism the vast mobilization the great national effort rosie the riveter lucky strike green goes to war lets remember pearl harbor as we did the alamo he doesnt see any way the germans might have brought america to her knees except one the bomb he thinks the bomb the nazis get the bomb in and wernher von braun invents a transatlantic rocket and new york and washington are nuked one night and thats it weve been pushed beyond the resources of patriotism we cave in and surrender within a week and so he studies the photograph president kennedy grinning standing between reichsfuehrer goering and a suave youthfullooking japanese kennedy ted no this is jack the very same jack who looking jowly heavy bags under his eyes deep creases in his facehe must be almost sixty years old nearing the end of what is probably his second term of office jacqueline waiting none too patiently for him upstairs get done with your japs and nazis love and lets have a few drinkies together before the concert yes johnjohn and caroline are somewhere on the premises too the nations darlings models for young people everywhere yes and goering indeed the very same goering well into his eighties monstrously fat chin upon chin multitudes of chins vast bemedalled bosom little mischievous eyes glittering with a long lifetimes cheery recollections of gratified lusts how happy he looks and how amiable it was always impossible to hate goering the way one loathed goebbels say or himmler or streicher goering had charm the outrageous charm of a monstre sacr√© of a nero of a caligula and here he is alive in the s a mountain of immoral flesh having survived adolf to becomecameron assumessecond fuehrer and to be received in pomp at the white house no less perhaps a state banquet tomorrow night rollmops sauerbraten kassler rippchen koenigsberger klopse washed down with flagons of bernkasteler doktor schloss johannisberg or does the fuehrer prefer beer we have the finest lagers on tap lowenbrau wurzburger hofbrau but wait something rings false in camerons historical construct he is unable to find in john f kennedy those depths of opportunism that would allow him to serve as puppet president of a naziruled america taking orders from some slickhaired hardeyed gauleiter and hopping obediently when the fuehrer comes to town bomb or no bomb there would have been a diehard underground resistance movement decades of guerrilla warfare bitter hatred of the german oppressor and of all collaborators no surrender then the axis has won the war but the united states has retained its autonomy cameron revises his speculations suppose he tells himself hitler in this universe did not break his pact with stalin and invade russia in the summer of but led his forces across the channel instead to wipe out britain and the japanese left pearl harbor alone so the united states never was drawn into the war which was over in fairly short ordersay by september of the germans now rule europe from cornwall to the urals and the japanese have the whole pacific west of hawaii the united states lost in dreamy neutrality is an isolated nation a giant portugal economically stagnant largely cut off from world trade there are no skyscrapers in san francisco because no one sees reason to build anything in this country yes is this how it is he seats himself on the stoop of a house and explores his newspaper this world has a stock market albeit a sluggish one the dowjones industrials stand at some of the listings are familiaribm att general motorsbut many are not litton syntex and polaroid all are missing so is xerox but he finds its primordial predecessor haloid in the quotations there are two baseball leagues each with eight clubs the boston braves have moved to milwaukee but otherwise the table of teams could have come straight out of the s brooklyn is leading in the national league philadelphia in the american in the news section he finds recognizable names new york has a senator rockefeller massachusetts has a senator kennedy robert apparently he is currently in italy yesterday he toured the majestic tomb of mussolini near the colosseum today he has an audience with pope benedict an airline advertisement invites san franciscans to go to new york via twas glorious new starliners now only twelve hours with only a brief stop in chicago the accompanying sketch indicates that they have about reached the dc level here or is that a dc with all those propellers the foreign news is tame and sketchy not a word about israel vs the arabs the squabbling republics of africa the peoples republic of china or the war in south america cameron assumes that the only surviving jews are those of new york and los angeles that africa is one immense german colonial tract with a few patches under italian rule that china is governed by the japanese not by the heirs of chairman mao and that the south american nations are torpid and unaggressive yes reading this newspaper is the strangest experience this voyage has given him so far for the pages look right the tone of the writing feels right there is the insistent texture of unarguable reality about the whole paper and yet everything is subtly off everything has undergone a slight shift along the spectrum of events the newspaper has the quality of a dream but he has never known a dream to have such overwhelming substantive density he folds the paper under his arm and strolls toward the bay a block from the waterfront he finds a branch of the bank of americasome things withstand all permutationsand goes inside to change some money there are risks but he is curious the teller unhesitatingly takes his fivedollar bill and hands him four singles and a little stack of coins the singles are unremarkable and lincoln jefferson and washington occupy their familiar places on the cent nickel and quarter but the dime shows ben franklin and the fiftycent piece bears the features of a heartylooking man youngish fullfaced bushyhaired whom cameron is unable to identify at all on the next corner eastward he comes to a public library now he can confirm his guesses an almanac yes and how odd the list of presidents looks roosevelt he learns retired in poor health in and that so far as he can discover is the point of divergence between this world and his the rest follows predictably enough wendell willkie defeating john nance garner in the election maintains a policy of strict neutrality whileyes it was as he imaginedthe germans and japanese quickly conquer most of the world willkie dies in office during the presidential campaignaha thats willkie on the half dollarand is briefly succeeded by vice president mcnary who does not want the presidency a hastily recalled republican convention nominates robert taft two terms then for taft who beats james byrnes and two for thomas dewey and then in the long republican era is ended at last by senator lyndon johnson of texas johnsons running mateit is an amusing reversal cameron thinksis senator john f kennedy of massachusetts after the traditional two terms johnson steps down and vice president kennedy wins the presidential election he has been reelected in naturally in this placid world incumbents always win there is of course no un here there has been no korean war no movement of colonial liberation no exploration of space the almanac tells cameron that hitler lived until mussolini until the world seems to have adapted remarkably readily to axis rule although a german army of occupation is still stationed in england he is tempted to go on and on comparing histories learning the transmuted destinies of such figures as hubert humphrey dwight eisenhower harry truman nikita khrushchev lee harvey oswald juan peron but suddenly a more intimate curiosity flowers in him in a hallway alcove he consults the telephone book there is one directory covering both alameda and contra costa counties and it is a much more slender volume than the directory which in his world covers oakland alone there are two dozen cameron listings but none at his address and no christophers or elizabeths or any plausible permutations of those names on a hunch he looks in the san francisco book nothing promising there either but then he checks elizabeth under her maiden name dudley and yes there is an elizabeth dudley at the familiar old address on laguna the discovery causes him to tremble he rummages in his pocket finds his ben franklin dime drops it in the slot he listens theres the dial tone he makes the call the apartment what he can see of it by peering past her shoulder looks much as he remembers it wellworn couches and chairs upholstered in burgundy and dark green stark whitewashed walls elaborate sculpturesher ownof grey driftwood huge ferns in hanging containers to behold these objects in these surroundings wrenches powerfully at his sense of time and place and afflicts him with an almost unbearable nostalgia the last time he was here if indeed he has ever been here in any sense was in but the memories are vivid and what he sees corresponds so closely to what he recalls that he feels transported to that earlier era she stands in the doorway studying him with cool curiosity tinged with unmistakable suspicion she wears unexpectedly ordinary clothes a loosefitting embroidered white blouse and a short pleated blue skirt and her golden hair looks dull and carelessly combed but surely she is the same woman from whom he parted this morning the same woman with whom he has shared his life these past seven years a beautiful woman a tall woman nearly as tall as heon some occasions taller it has seemedwith a serene smile and steady green eyes and smooth taut skin yes she says uncertainly are you the man who phoned yes chris cameron he searches her face for some flicker of recognition you dont know me not at all not at all should i know you perhaps probably not its hard to say have we once met is that it im not sure how im going to explain my relationship to you so you said when you called your relationship to me how can strangers have had a relationship its complicated may i come in she laughs nervously as though caught in some embarrassing faux pas of course she says not without giving him a quick appraisal making a rapid estimate of risk the apartment is in fact almost exactly as he knew it except that there is no stereo phonograph only a bulky archaic victrola and her record collection is surprisingly scanty and there are rather fewer books than his elizabeth would have had they confront one another stiffly he is as uneasy over this encounter as she is and finally it is she who seeks some kind of social lubricant suggesting that they have a little wine she offers him red or white red please he says she goes to a low sideboard and takes out two cheap clumsylooking tumblers then effortlessly she lifts a gallon jug of wine from the floor and begins to unscrew its cap you were awfully mysterious on the phone she says and youre still being mysterious now what brings you here do we have mutual friends i think it wouldnt be untruthful to say that we do at least in a manner of speaking your own manner of speaking is remarkably roundabout mr cameron i cant help that right now and call me chris please as she pours the wine he watches her closely thinking of that other elizabeth his elizabeth thinking how well he knows her body the supple play of muscles in her back the sleek texture of her skin the firmness of her flesh and he flashes instantly to their strange absurdly romantic meeting years ago that june when he had gone off alone into the sierra high country for a week of backpacking and following heaps of stones that he had wrongly taken to be trail markers had come to a place well off the path a private place a cool dark glacial lake rimmed by brilliant patches of latelying snow and had begun to make camp and had become suddenly aware of someone elses pack thirty yards away and a pile of discarded clothing on the shore and then had seen her swimming just beyond a pinetipped point heading toward land rising like venus from the water naked noticing him startled by his presence apprehensive for a moment but then immediately making the best of it relaxing smiling standing unashamed shindeep in the chilly shallows and inviting him to join her for a swim these recollections of that first contact and all that ensued excite him terribly for this person before him is at once the elizabeth he loves familiar joined to him by the bond of shared experience and also someone new a complete stranger from whom he can draw fresh inputs that jolting gift of novelty which his elizabeth can never again offer him he stares at her shoulders and back with fierce intense hunger she turns toward him with the glasses of wine in her hands and before he can mask that wild gleam of desire she receives it with full force the impact is immediate she recoils she is not the elizabeth of the sierra lake she seems unable to handle such a level of unexpected erotic voltage jerkily she thrusts the wine at him her hands shaking so that she spills a little on her sleeve he takes the glass and backs away a bit dazed by his own frenzied upwelling of emotion with an effort he calms himself there is a long moment of awkward silence while they drink the psychic atmosphere grows less torrid a certain mood of remote businesslike courtesy develops between them after the second glass of wine she says now how do you know me and what do you want from me briefly he closes his eyes what can he tell her how can he explain he has rehearsed no strategies already he has managed to alarm her with a single unguarded glance what effect would a confession of apparent madness have but he has never used strategies with elizabeth has never resorted to any tactics except the tactic of utter candidness and this is elizabeth slowly he says in another existence you and i are married elizabeth we live in the oakland hills and were extraordinarily happy together another existence in a world apart from this a world where history took a different course a generation ago where the axis lost the war where john kennedy was president in and was killed by an assassin where you and i met beside a lake in the sierras and fell in love theres an infinity of worlds elizabeth side by side worlds in which all possible variations of every possible event take place worlds in which you and i are married happily in which you and i have been married and divorced in which you and i dont exist in which you exist and i dont in which we meet and loathe one another in whichin whichdo you see elizabeth theres a world for everything and ive been travelling from world to world ive seen nothing but wilderness where san francisco ought to be and ive met mongol horsemen in the east bay hills and ive seen this whole area devastated by atomic warfare anddoes this sound insane to you elizabeth just a little she smiles the old elizabeth cool judicious performing one of her specialities the conditional acceptance of the unbelievable for the sake of some amusing conversation but go on youve been jumping from world to world i wont even bother to ask you how what are you running away from ive never seen it that way im running toward toward what an infinity of worlds an endless range of possible experience thats a lot to swallow isnt one world enough for you to explore evidently not you had all infinity she says yet you chose to come to me presumably im the one point of familiarity for you in this otherwise strange world why come here whats the point of your wanderings if you seek the familiar if all you wanted to do was find your way back to your elizabeth why did you leave her in the first place are you as happy with her as you claim to be i can be happy with her and still desire her in other guises you sound driven no he says no more driven than faust i believe in searching as a way of life not searching for just searching and its impossible to stop to stop is to die elizabeth look at faust going on and on going to helen of troy herself experiencing everything the world has to offer and always seeking more when faust finally cries out this is it this is what ive been looking for this is where i choose to stop mephistopheles wins his bet but that was fausts moment of supreme happiness true when he attains it though he loses his soul to the devil remember so you go on on and on world after world seeking you know not what just seeking unable to stop and yet you claim youre not driven he shakes his head machines are driven animals are driven im an autonomous human being operating out of free will i dont make this journey because i have to but because i want to or because you think you ought to want to im motivated by feelings not by intellectual calculations and preconceptions that sounds very carefully thought out she tells him he is stung by her words and looks away down into his empty glass she indicates that he should help himself to the wine im sorry she says her tone softening a little he says at any rate i was in the library and there was a telephone directory and i found you this is where you used to live in my world too before we were married he hesitates do you mind if i ask what youre not married no i live alone and like it you always were independentminded you talk as though you know me so well ive been married to you for seven years no not to me never to me you dont know me at all he nods youre right i dont really know you elizabeth however much i think i do but i want to i feel drawn to you as strongly as i was to the other elizabeth that day in the mountains its always best right at the beginning when two strangers reach toward one another when the spark leaps the gap tenderly he says may i spend the night here no somehow the refusal comes as no surprise he says you once gave me a different answer when i asked you that not i someone else im sorry its so hard for me to keep you and her distinct in my mind elizabeth but please dont turn me away ive come so far to be with you you came uninvited besides id feel so strange with youknowing you were thinking of her comparing me with her measuring our differences our points of similarities what makes you think i would you would i dont think thats sufficient reason for sending me away ill give you another she says her eyes sparkle mischievously i never let myself get involved with married men she is teasing him now he says laughing confident that she is beginning to yield thats the damnedest farfetched excuse ive ever heard elizabeth is it i feel a great kinship with her she has all my sympathies why should i help you deceive her deceive what an oldfashioned word do you think shed object she never expected me to be chaste on this trip shed be flattered and delighted to know that i went looking for you here shed be eager to hear about everything that went on between us how could she possibly be hurt by knowing that i had been with you when you and she are nevertheless id like you to leave please you havent given me one convincing reason i dont need to i love you i want to spend the night with you you love someone else who resembles me she replies i keep telling you that in any case i dont love you i dont find you attractive im afraid oh she does but youdont i see how do you find me then ugly overbearing repellent i find you disturbing she says a little frightening much too intense much too controlled perhaps dangerous you arent my type im probably not yours remember im not the elizabeth you met by that mountain lake perhaps id be happier if i were but im not i wish you had never come here now please go please onward this place is all gleaming towers and airy bridges a glistening fantasy of a city high overhead float glassy bubbles silent airborne passenger vehicles containing two or three people apiece who sprawl in postures of elegant relaxation bronzed young boys and girls lie naked beside soaring fountains spewing turquoiseandscarlet foam giant orchids burst in tropical voluptuousness from the walls of colossal hotels small mechanical birds wheel and dart in the soft air like golden bullets emitting sweet pinging sounds from the tips of the tallest buildings comes a darker music a ground bass of swelling hundredcycle notes oscillating around an insistent central rumble this is a world two centuries ahead of his at the least he could never infiltrate here he could never even be a tourist the only role available to him is that of visiting savage jemmy button among the londoners and what after all was jemmy buttons fate not a happy one patagonia patagonia thees ticket eet ees no longer good here sor coloured rays dance in the sky red green blue exploding showering the city with transcendental images cameron smiles he will not let himself be overwhelmed though this place is more confusing than the world of the halftrack automobiles jauntily he plants himself at the centre of a small park between two lanes of flowing noiseless traffic it is a formal garden lush with toothy orangefronded ferns and thorny skyrockets of looping cactus lovers stroll past him arm in arm offering one another swigs from glossy sweatbeaded green flasks that look like tubes of polished jade delicately they dangle blue grapes before each others lips playfully they smile arch their necks take the bait with eager pounces then they laugh embrace tumble into the dense moist grass which stirs and sways and emits gentle thrumming melodies this place pleases him he wanders through the garden thinking of elizabeth thinking of springtime and coming ultimately to a sinuous brook in which the citys tallest towers are reflected as inverted needles he kneels to drink the water is cool sweet tart much like young wine a moment after it touches his lips a mechanism rises from the spongy earth five slender brassy columns three with eyesensors sprouting on all sides one marked with a pattern of dark gridwork one bearing an arrangement of winking coloured lights out of the gridwork come ominous words in an unfathomable language this is some kind of police machine demanding his credentials that much is clear im sorry he says i cant understand what youre saying other machines are extruding themselves from trees from the bed of the stream from the hearts of the sturdiest ferns its all right he says i dont mean any harm just give me a chance to learn the language and i promise to become a useful citizen one of the machines sprays him with a fine azure mist another drives a tiny needle into his forearm and extracts a droplet of blood a crowd is gathering they point snicker wink the music of the building tops has become higher in pitch more sinister in texture it shakes the balmy air and threatens him in a personal way let me stay cameron begs but the music is shoving him pushing him with a flat irresistible hand inexorably squeezing him out of this world he is too primitive for them he is too coarse he carries too many obsolete microbes very well if thats what they want hell leave not out of courtesy alone in a flamboyant way he bids them farewell bowing with a flourish worthy of raleigh blowing a kiss to the fivecolumned machine smiling even doing a little dance farewell farewell the music rises to a wild crescendo he hears celestial trumpets and distant thunder farewell onward here some kind of oriental marketplace has sprung up foulsmelling cluttered medieval swarthy old men whitebearded in thick grey robes sit patiently behind open burlap sacks of spices and grains lepers and cripples roam everywhere begging importunately slender longlegged men wearing only tight loincloths and jingling dangling earrings of bright copper stalk through the crowd on solitary orbits buying nothing saying nothing their skins are dark red their faces are gaunt their solemn features are finely modelled they carry themselves like inca princes perhaps they are inca princes in the haggle and babble of the market cameron hears no recognizable tongue spoken he sees the flash of gold as transactions are completed the women balance immense burdens on their heads and show brilliant teeth when they smile they favour patchwork skirts that cover their ankles but they leave their breasts bare several of them glance provocatively at cameron but he dares not return their quick dazzling probes until he knows what is permissible here on the far side of the squalid plaza he catches sight of a woman who might well be elizabeth her back is to him but he would know those strong shoulders anywhere that erect stance that cascade of unbound golden hair he starts toward her sliding with difficulty between the closepacked marketgoers when he is still halfway across the marketplace from her he notices a man at her side tall a man of his own height and build he wears a loose black robe and a dark scarf covers the lower half of his face his eyes are grim and sullen and a terrible cicatrice wide and glaringly crosshatched with stitch marks runs along his left cheek up to his hairline the man whispers something to the woman who might be elizabeth she nods and turns so that cameron now is able to see her face and yes the woman does seem to be elizabeth but she bears a matching scar angry and hideous up the right side of her face cameron gasps the scarfaced man suddenly points and shouts cameron senses motion to one side and swings around just in time to see a short thickbodied man come rushing toward him wildly waving a scimitar for an instant cameron sees the scene as though in a photograph he has time to make a leisurely examination of his attackers oily beard his hooked hairynostriled nose his yellowed teeth the cheap glassylooking inlaid stones on the haft of the scimitar then the frightful blade descends while the assassin screams abuse at cameron in what might be arabic it is a sorry welcome cameron cannot prolong this investigation an instant before the scimitar cuts him in two he takes himself elsewhere with regret onward to a place where there is no solidity where the planet itself has vanished so that he swims through space falling peacefully going from nowhere to nowhere he is surrounded by a brilliant green light that emanates from every point at once like a message from the fabric of the universe in great tranquillity he drops through this cheerful glow for days on end or what seems like days on end drifting banking checking his course with small motions of his elbows or knees it makes no difference where he goes everything here is like everything else here the green glow supports and sustains and nourishes him but it makes him restless he plays with it out of its lambent substance he succeeds in shaping images faces abstract patterns he conjures up elizabeth for himself he evokes his own sharp features he fills the heavens with a legion of marching chinese in tapered straw hats he obliterates them with forceful diagonal lines he causes a river of silver to stream across the firmament and discharge its glittering burden down a mountainside a thousand miles high he spins he floats he glides he releases all his fantasies this is total freedom here in this unworldly place but it is not enough he grows weary of emptiness he grows weary of serenity he has drained this place of all it has to offer too soon too soon he is not sure whether the failure is in himself or in the place but he feels he must leave therefore onward terrified peasants run shrieking as he materializes in their midst this is some sort of farming village along the eastern shore of the bay neat green fields a cluster of low wicker huts radiating from a central plaza naked children toddling and crying a busy subpopulation of goats and geese and chickens it is midday cameron sees the bright gleam of water in the irrigation ditches these people work hard they have scattered at his approach but now they creep back warily crouching ready to take off again if he performs any more miracles this is another of those bucolic worlds in which san francisco has not happened but he is unable to identify these settlers nor can he isolate the chain of events that brought them here they are not indians nor chinese nor peruvians they have a european look about them somehow slavic but what would slavs be doing in california russian farmers maybe colonizing by way of siberia there is some plausibility in thattheir dark complexions their heavy facial structure their squat powerful bodiesbut they seem oddly primitive halfnaked in furry leggings or less as though they are no subjects of the tsar but rather scythians or cimmerians transplanted from the prehistoric marshes of the vistula dont be frightened he tells them holding his upraised outspread arms toward them they do seem less fearful of him now timidly approaching staring with big dark eyes i wont harm you id just like to visit with you they murmur a woman boldly shoves a child forward a girl of about five bare with black greasy ringlets and cameron scoops her up caresses her tickles her lightly sets her down instantly the whole tribe is around him no longer afraid they touch his arm they kneel they stroke his shins a boy brings him a wooden bowl of porridge an old woman gives him a mug of sweet wine a kind of mead a slender girl drapes a stole of auburn fur over his shoulders they dance they chant their fear has turned into love he is their honoured guest he is more than that he is a god they take him to an unoccupied hut the largest in the village piously they bring him offerings of incense and acorns when it grows dark they build an immense bonfire in the plaza so that he wonders in vague concern if they will feast on him when they are done honouring him but they feast on slaughtered cattle instead and yield to hint the choicest pieces and afterward they stand by his door singing discordant energetic hymns that night three girls of the tribe no doubt the fairest virgins available are sent to him and in the morning he finds his threshold heaped with newly plucked blossoms later two tribal artisans one lame and the other blind set to work with stone adzes and chisels hewing an immense and remarkable accurate likeness of him out of a redwood stump that has been mounted at the plazas centre so he has been deified he has a quick faustian vision of himself living among these diligent people teaching them advanced methods of agriculture leading them eventually into technology into modern hygiene into all the contemporary advantages without the contemporary abominations guiding them toward the light moulding them creating them this world this village would be a good place for him to stop his transit of the infinities if stopping were desirable god prophet king of a placid realm teacher inculcator of civilization a purpose to his existence at last but there is no place to stop he knows that transforming happy primitive farmers into sophisticated twentiethcentury agriculturalists is ultimately as useless a pastime as training fleas to jump through hoops it is tempting to live as a god but even divinity will pall and it is dangerous to become attached to an unreal satisfaction dangerous to become attached at all the journey not the arrival matters always so cameron does godhood for a little while he finds it pleasant and fulfilling he savours the rewards until he senses that the rewards are becoming too important to him he makes his formal renunciation of his godhead then onward and this place he recognizes his street his house his garden his green car in the carport elizabeths yellow one parked out front home again so soon he hadnt expected that but every leap he has made he knows must in some way have been a product of deliberate choice and evidently whatever hidden mechanism within him that has directed these voyages has chosen to bring him home again all right touch base digest your travels examine them allow your experiences to work their alchemy on you you need to stand still a moment for that afterward you can always leave again he slides his key into the door elizabeth has one of the mozart quartets on the phonograph she sits curled up in the livingroom window seat leafing through a magazine it is late afternoon and the san francisco skyline clearly visible across the bay through the big window is haloed by the brilliant retreating sunlight there are freshly cut flowers in the little crystal bowl on the redwoodburl table the fragrance of gardenias and jasmine dances past him unhurriedly she looks up brings her eyes into line with his dazzles him with the warmth of her smile and says well hello hello elizabeth she comes to him i didnt expect you back this quickly chris i dont know if i expected you to come back at all as a matter of fact this quickly how long have i been gone for you tuesday morning to thursday afternoon two and a half days she eyes his coarse new beard his ragged sunbleached shirt its been longer for you hasnt it weeks and weeks im not sure how long i was in eight or nine different places and i stayed in the last one quite some time they were villagers farmers some primitive slavonic tribe living down by the bay i was their god but i got bored with it you always did get bored so easily she says and laughs and takes his hands in hers and pulls him toward her she brushes her lips lightly against him a peck a playkiss their usual first greeting and then they kiss more passionately bodies pressing close tongue seeking tongue he feels a pounding in his chest the old inextinguishable throb when they release each other he steps back a little dizzied and says i missed you elizabeth i didnt know how much id miss you until i was somewhere else and aware that i might never find you again did you seriously worry about that very much i never doubted wed be together again one way or another infinitys such a big place darling youd find your way back to me or to someone very much like me and someone very much like you would find his way to me if you didnt how many chris camerons do you think there are on the move between worlds right now a thousand a trillion trillion she turns toward the sideboard and says without breaking the flow of her words would you like some wine and begins to pour from a halfempty jug of red tell me where youve been she says he comes up behind her and rests his hands on her shoulders and draws them down the back of her silk blouse to her waist holding her there kissing the nape of her neck he says to a world where there was an atomic war here and to one where there still were indian raiders out by livermore and one that was all fantastic robots and futuristic helicopters and one where johnson was president before kennedy and kennedy is alive and president now and one whereoh ill give you all the details later i need a chance to unwind first he releases her and kisses the tip of her earlobe and takes one of the glasses from her and they salute each other and drink draining the wine quickly its so good to be home he says softly good to have gone where i went good to be back she fills his glass again the familiar domestic ritual red wine is their special drink cheap red wine out of gallon jugs a sacrament more dear to him than the burnt offerings of his recent subjects halfway through the second glass he says come lets go inside the bed has fresh linens on it cool inviting there are three thick books on the night table shes set up for some heavy reading in his absence cut flowers in here too fragrance everywhere their clothes drop away she touches his beard and chuckles at the roughness and he kisses the smooth cool place along the inside of her thigh and draws his cheek lightly across it sandpapering her lovingly and then she pulls him to her and their bodies slide together and he enters her everything thereafter happens quickly much too quickly he has been long absent from her if not she from him and now her presence excites him there is a strangeness about her body her movements and it hastens him to his ecstasy he feels a mild pang of regret but no more hell make it up to her soon enough they both know that they drift into a sleepy embrace neither of them speaking and eventually uncoil into tender new passion and this time all is as it should be afterward they doze a spectacular sunset blazes over the city when he opens his eyes they rise they take a shower together much giggling much playfulness lets go across the bay for a fancy dinner tonight he suggests trianon blue fox ernies anywhere you name it i feel like celebrating so do i chris its good to be home again its good to have you here she tells him she looks for her purse how soon do you think youll be heading out again not that i mean to rush you but you know im not going to be staying of course i know yes you would she had never questioned his going they both tried to be responsive to each others needs they had always regarded one another as equal partners free to do as they wished i cant say how long ill stay probably not long coming home this soon was really an accident you know i just planned to go on and on and on world after world and i never programmed my next jump at least not consciously i simply leaped and the last leap deposited me on my own doorstep somehow so i let myself into the house and there you were to welcome me home she presses his hand between hers almost sadly she says you arent home chris what he hears the sound of the front door opening footsteps in the hallway you arent home she says confusion seizes him he thinks of all that has passed between them this evening elizabeth calls a deep voice from the living room in here darling i have company oh who a man enters the bedroom halts grins he is cleanshaven and dressed in the clothes cameron had worn on tuesday otherwise they could be twins hey hello he says warmly extending his hand elizabeth says he comes from a place that must be very much like this one hes been here since five oclock and we were just going out for dinner have you been having an interesting time very the other cameron says ill tell you all about it later go on dont let me keep you you could join us for dinner cameron suggests helplessly thats all right ive just eaten breast of passenger pigeonthey arent extinct everywhere i wish i could have brought some home for the freezer so you two go and enjoy ill see you later both of you i hope will you be staying with us weve got notes to compare you and i he rises just before dawn in a marvellous foggy stillness the camerons have been wonderfully hospitable but he must be moving along he scrawls a thankyou note and slips it under their bedroom door lets get together again someday somewhere somehow they wanted him as a house guest for a week or two but no he feels like a bit of an intruder here and anyway the universe is waiting for him he has to go the journey not the arrival matters for what else is there but trips departing is unexpectedly painful but he knows the mood will pass he closes his eyes he breaks his moorings he gives himself up to his sublime restlessness onward onward goodbye elizabeth goodbye chris ill see you both again onward for further reading what
