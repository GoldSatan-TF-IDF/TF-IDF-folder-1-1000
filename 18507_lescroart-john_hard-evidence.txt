there are any technical errors they are solely the fault of the author every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based on imperfect knowledge oliver wendell holmes jr part i dismas hardy walked hipdeep in green ice water his rubbergloved hands on the fins of a sixfoot white shark outside in the world it was nearly two oclock of an early summer morning but here at the steinhart there was no time the overhead light reflected off the institutional green walls clammy with distilled seasweat somewhere out of the room a motor throbbed dully the only noise in hardys world was the steady slush and suck of the water curling behind him as he walked around and around alone in the circular pool pico morales had called around seven to ask if he felt like doing some walking when pico called it meant that some fishing boat had landed a great white shark and had contacted the aquarium the sharks bred just off the farallons and the steinhart or pico its curator wanted a live one badly the problem was that the beasts became so traumatised or wounded or both after they were caught that none survived too exhausted to move on their own they had to be walked through the water so that they could breathe it was hardys third and last hourlong shift tonight hed been spelled by a couple of other volunteers earlier and pico was due any minute so hardy just walked unthinking putting down one foot after another dragging and pulling the halfdead monster along with him on his first break hed stripped off his wetsuit changed and walked over to the little shamrock for a guinness or two hardys brotherinlaw frannies brother moses mcguire had been off lynne leish was working her normal sunday shift behind the rail and hardy had taken his drink to the back and sat speaking to no one on his next break hed gone out and climbed a fence into the japanese tea garden sitting on a footbridge he listened to the orchestrated trickle of the artificial stream that flowed between the bonsais and pagodas the fog had been in and it hadnt made the evening any warmer hardy wasnt paying attention when pico came in suddenly there he was at the side of the pool his huge bulk straining his wetsuit to its limit pico had a large black drooping moustache that got wet every time he brought the steaming cup to his lips hey diz hardy willing his legs forward looked up and grunted hows the baby hardy kept moving dont know pico rested his cup on the edge of the pool and slid in he shivered as the cold water came under his suit next time hardy came around pico grabbed the shark and goosed its belly let it go he said hardy walked another two steps then released the fins the shark turned ninety degrees and took a nosedive into the tiles on the bottom of the tank pico sighed hardy leaned his elbows up against the rim of the pool lack of family structure pico said thats what does it what does what hardy was breathing hard i dont think they have much will to live these guys you know abandoned at birth left to fend for themselves probably turn to drugs run with a bad crowd eat junk food time we get em theyre just plum licked hardy nodded good theory pico in the bottoms of his wetsuit his enormous stomach protruding like a tumor sat on the lip of the tank sipping coffee and brandy hardy was out of the pool the shark hung still in the water its nose on the bottom without saying anything pico handed his mug to hardy were doing something wrong peek pico nodded follow that reasoning diz youre onto something they do keep dying dont they i think this one odd probably mainlining he grabbed the mug back fucking shark drug addicts lack of family structure hardy said yeah pico plopped in and walked over to the shark want to help hoist this sucker out and stroll through his guts further the cause of science hardy emptied picos coffee mug sighed and brought the gurney over pico had tied a rope around the sharks tail and slung it over a pulley in the ceiling suddenly the tail twitched and pico jumped back as if stung spasmodic crackhead shark rapists you sure its just a spasm hardy didnt want to cut the thing up if it wasnt dead yet it isnt the chacha diz pull on that thing will you hardy pulled and the shark came out of the water slow and heavy hardy guided it onto the gurney he waited while pico hauled himself out of the pool i am reminded of a poem hardy said winter and spring summer and fall you look like a basketball pico ignored him and reached for his coffee mug need i take this abuse from someone who steals my coffee there was coffee in that and a little brandy cuts the aftertaste they flipped the shark on its back pico went into his office and came out a minute later with a scalpel he traced a line up the sharks belly to its gills laying open the stomach cavity slicing a strip of flesh he held it up to hardy want some sushi the tank gurgled hardy leaned over the gurney careful not to block the light while pico cut he reached into the stomach and began pulling things out two or three small fish a piece of driftwood a rubber ball a tin can junk food pico muttered leave out the food part hardy said pico reached back in and brought out something that looked like a starfish he pulled it up looking at it quizzically whats that hardy asked i dont know it looks then as though hed been bit pico screamed jumped back throwing the object to the floor hardy walked over to look partially digested and covered with slime it was still recognizable for what it was a human hand severed at the wrist the first finger missing and on the pinkie a seagreen jade ring hardy expected that the guys in blue would be first on the scene he would likely know them from the shamrock where the police dropped in frequently enough to keep the presence alive sometimes your irish bar will get a little rowdy and it helped to have the heat appear casually to remind patrons that a certain minimum standard of decorous behaviour would be maintained for the better part of nine years hardy had been the daytime bartender at the little shamrock hed only been back in the das office for four months now since rebecca had been born and he and frannie had gotten married hardy and his onetime boss current friend partner and brotherinlaw moses mcguire were both reasonable hands with the shillelagh of kentucky ash that hung behind the bar under the cash register mcguire doctor of philosophy in his cups himself had twice thrown people through the front window of the shamrock most other times the forced exit was old west fashion through the swinging double doors neither hardy nor moses was quick on the no good publican was but both of them had needed assistance from the beat cops from time to time the shamrock wasnt a cop bar but the guys from park station had trouble paying for drinks if they stopped in during off hours hardy stood just inside the front entrance to the aquarium the black and white pulled up the searchlight on the car scanning the front of the building from the street to the entrance was a twentyyard expanse of open cement at of a pitchdark morning hardy didnt blame them for the caution he stepped outside they walked back behind the tanks in the damp hallway bathed in a faint greenish overhead light the two cops followed hardy amid the burps and gurglings of the aquarium he did know them dan soper and bobby varela a fullback and a sprinter hardy thought the three of them made a parade the give of leather slap of holster clomp of heavy shoes jingle of cuffs and keys beat cops werent dressed for ambush it reminded hardy of his days on the force walking a beat with abe glitsky he had been a different guy back then now he felt older almost protective of these cops the beat was the beginning they came into what hardy called the walking room pico had changed into a turtleneck and sportcoat though he still wore his swim trunks he stared emptily straight ahead sitting on the edge of the pool next to the gurney that held the shark find anything else hardy asked pico let himself off the pools lip withering hardy with a look after the introductions varela walked over to the hand still lying where pico had thrown it that what it looks like thats what it is hardy said whered you get this shark soper asked hey bobby varela was poking at the hand with a pencil leave it would you pico told soper how the shark had come to the steinhart soper wanted to know the fishing boats name captain time of capture all that hardy walked over to varela who was still hunched over and stood over him pretty weird huh varela looked back over his shoulder straightening naw we get these three four times a week i wonder if the guy drowned varela couldnt seem to take his eyes off the thing youd hope so wouldnt you howd you like to have been alive instead soper had passed them going into picos office to use the telephone pico came over hes getting some crimelab people down here no way am i putting my hand in that guy again varela shivered i dont blame you he walked back to the shark and gingerly lifted the incision along its stomach with his pencil cant see much theres more in there pico said wed just started varela stepped back dans right i think well just wait hardy stared down at the hand i wonder who it was he said oh well find out soon enough varela said pico leaned back against the pool how can you be sure he said it could be anybody yeah but weve got one major clue whats that pico asked hardy turned let me guess he said fingerprints hardy lifted his redrimmed eyes from the folder he was studying it was threethirty in the afternoon and last night had been a long one ending around sunrise hed driven home from the steinhart changed into a new brown suit looked in at frannie curled up in their bed at rebecca sleeping in the new room hed built onto the back of the house and headed downtown where he now worked as an assistant district attorney on the third floor of the hall of justice on seventh and bryant the job wasnt going very well the case he was laboring over now like the others he was currently prosecuting came from the lower rungs of the criminal ladder this one involved a prostitute whod been caught by an undercover cop posing as a tourist wandering around union square the girl esme aiella was twentytwo black two priors she was out on bail and was even now as hardy read probably out hustling hardy was wondering what purpose this all served or the bust of a city employee derek graham who sold lids of marijuana on the side hardy had known guys like derek in college and very few of them went on to become ringleaders in say the medellin cartel derek had three kids lived in the mission and was trying to make ends meet so his wife could stay home with the kids still this was hardys job now nailing the petty malefactors the lowlifes the unlucky or the foolish this wasnt the high drama of the passionate crime the romance of big deals gone crooked beautiful people desperately denying their libidos their greed their shallowness no this was down below the stage lights where the denizens lived on the slimy border of the law slipping over the line not even seeing it trying to get a little money a little power a little edge maybe even some release some fun in a life story that wasnt ever going to make it past the footlights mostly hardy thought it was sad hardy had thought perhaps unrealistically that coming back to work as an assistant district attorney he wouldnt have to deal with this level again he was after all nearly forty now and hed done his apprenticeship with the da ten years ago back when he started hed had to work through the issue of whether he could morally prosecute the socalled victimless crimes hookers casual dopers somewhere in his heart he believed that these crimes werent as real as the ones that hurt people he tended to believe that if grownups wanted to get laid or get high or get dead by jumping off the golden gate bridge society should let them god knows it had enough truly bad things to correct why waste the time on this pettiness but this he knew wasnt a good attitude his job was to prosecute people who broke the law whether they had done anything he considered wrong was moot and he was a new hire only brought on because hed left with a few friends like chief assistant da art drysdale also he suspected although he didnt know for certain that his exfatherinlaw superior court judge andy fowler had put in a good word for him he hadnt actively practiced law in ten years hed been a bartender was still part owner of the shamrock and he really couldnt expect guys whod made a linear career of criminal law to step aside while the new guy got the hot cases of course even if he were doing murders the fun stuff the majority of them were nhi cases no humans involved it was a pretty apt term lowlifes killing each other for reasons that would be laughable they were laughable if they werent so tragic this morning hardy had run into arnie tiano and elizabeth pullios in the hallway laughing so hard their sides hurt so this poor son of a bitch the victim leon hes trying to get some hubcaps back on this car in the middle of the day its his car red you know an old ford so the perp germaine sees him comes out and asks what he thinks hes doing messing with his germaines car which in truth is parked around the corner looks a lot like leons car i guess same model red and all but germaine is so loaded he cant see that well and leon says fuck off its my car which it is so germaine goes inside and comes out with a gun and leon says what you gonna do shoot me and germaine says yeah and pumps four shots into him pullios howls get out of here swear to god i mean theres ten witnesses hanging around the curb and this guy just blows leon away walks back inside and takes a nap which is what hes doing when we get there both arnie and elizabeth laughing laughing laughing but it beat bartending not that there was anything wrong with bartending working behind the rail was an uncomplicated and stressfree life hed taken pride in the way he mixed drinks getting along with everybody sleepwalking then suddenly it wasnt enough wasnt nearly enough after hed broken his routine once trying to help the cochrans once trying to save his own life he realized that hed changed survival wasnt enough hed fallen in love his new wife now had a baby that hed treat as his own even if it wasnt there was a future again not a succession of days in half a guinness haze it surprised him how good it felt the time behind the bar had begun to weigh heavily the regulars the pickups at the bar the stupid irish fights over darts or whether jameson was better than that protestant piss bushmills it was all the same ol same ol the alcohol discussions laden with a profundity that never stood the scrutiny of the next sunrise so it was back to the law to a real job to something he cared about to go with the new life he was building frannie was pregnant again too the coroners office was in the same building hardy worked in on the ground floor to wheel the gurneys in there was easy access from the parking lot the public could enter without being frisked without going through the detector at the back door to the hall of justice hardy was sitting on one of the yellow plastic chairs in the outer office it was fourthirty and he was meeting esmes attorney at five in his office so he took a break and decided to go check on the hand the receptionist was one of those rare marvels of civil service sixto was about twentyfive wore a tie and slacks combed his hair spoke english politely and with some grammatical precision a miracle i dont think theyve found anything yet mr hardy he said it hasnt been a good day mondays never are bad weekend sixto nodded two homicides this driveby stuff what gets into people there wasnt any answer to that and sixto didnt expect one so i doubt if theyve gotten to anything with the hand but ill keep on it okay ill let you know hardy thanked him and got up outside the door in the june fog he stopped to take in the parking lot the freeway blocking the horizon to his right which was starting to sound like rush hour walking toward him from the back door were detective sergeant abe glitsky and chief ada art drysdale guys hardy said nodding the guys were not in good humor coming abreast of him drysdale said we dont want to talk about it the hand glitsky as big black and mean looking as the lanky white drysdale seemed benign snapped what hand he reached behind hardy and pulled at the door were not talking drysdale said they were walking in the door thats what i like hardy said the free and easy flow of information the genial give and take of ideas the door had closed on him hardy stood a moment shrugged and went up to meet esmes attorney aaron jaans crossed spitshined shoes over his wellcreased pants showing a bit of the red garter that held black socks halfway up his calf the thought crossed hardys mind that jaans might be esmes pimp as well as her attorney hardy didnt have any moral problem about prosecuting pimps he hated pimps i guess the basic problem here is the priors hardy said esme doesnt seem to be getting the message jaans leaned onto the back legs of the chair across from hardys desk he pulled the cuff of his pants down over the distracting garter the lawyer had a broad elastic dark black face high forehead aquiline nose straight hair starting to go a little gray there was still a trace of a rogue british accent from somewhere shes a working girl mr hardy and you and i both know that you can arrest her every other day and shes still going to go on the street when shes out not if shes in jail she wont jaans rolled his eyes but quickly deciding against too much histrionics in jail weve got felony grand theft here four hundred and sixteen dollars thats jail jaans leaned forward again elbows on his knees mr hardy you and i know that no judge wants this kind of rap going to trial clogs the docket horrible it also ties up your vice witness for the better part of a day or two gets him off the street and what good is he doing you start taking all these people to trial well you know this as well as i do hardy was getting a little tired of the civics lesson he shuffled the folder in front of him pretended to be reading the offer he said is felony probation ninety days in jail or a fivethousanddollar fine are you serious hardy nodded yep is there some new policy going down hardy shook his head wheres my client going to get five thousand dollars do you think shes going to go out and get a job typing somewhere managing a mcdonalds she wont do that she has no skills mr hardy you know what shell do dont you shell have to be on her back for a month to make that kind of money do you want that im sure her pimp could get her that money in two and a half seconds but shes not talking about her pimp she says she doesnt have a pimp so i ask myself how can we get a handle on this pimp close up his shop jaans took a breath you know mr hardy some of these pimps are not nice men i grant you but they do provide protection for their girls abortions if they need them that kind of thing theyre keeping their assets productive thats all simple business you know how long a lone girl on the street is going to last youre telling me that pimps are solid citizens is that it jaans turned his palms up they provide a service hardy leaned forward fingers laced elbows on his desk what they do mr jaans what pimps do he paused as you and i both know is take these ignorant poor sad really helpless women and keep them degraded stoned and on their backs until their looks go at twentyfive after which their life span due to needles and disease and just generally getting the shit beaten out of them is about six months hardy took a breath calming himself down so maybe this five thousand will make esme decide to give up her pimp and then maybe i can have a little fun jaans nodded he uncrossed his legs stood up and reached his hand over the desk hardy surprised got up himself hesitated then decided to take it ill convey your offer to my client jaans said he stopped at the door turned raised a finger to make a point then decided against it and disappeared into the hallway lou the greeks was a restaurant and watering hole for cops and das across the street from the hall of justice lou was married to a chinese woman who did the cooking so the place served an eclectic menu of egg rolls chow mein shaslik rice pilaf hot and sour soup baklava and fortune cookies occasionally lous special would be something like kung pao pita pockets or potsticker kabobs there were two bars standing room only at the front and back walls now at fivethirty the din was ferocious an armwrestling contest was going on in the center of the room twenty or thirty cops screaming trying to get their bets in drysdale and glitsky huddled over an ancient pong machine by the back door hardy pushed his way through the crowd drysdale was ahead eight to six neither of the men looked up boo hardy said glitsky looked up for an instant but it was long enough for the blip to get by him damn nine six drysdale said gotta pay attention just play glitsky growled hardy watched the blip move back and forth both of these guys were good playing at the master level and the blip really moved hardy went to the bar elbowed his way in and ordered a pint of cranberry juice lots of ice back at the pong game glitsky glowered in defeat drysdale sat back in his chair legs crossed savoring a beer hardy squatted checking out the final score of eleven to six you owe me five bucks glitsky told him drysdale sipped his beer he never beats me anyway i wouldnt pay him can we talk about the hand what hand hardy looked at drysdale what hand he says drysdale ran it down for abe who had spent the day interviewing family members of a murdered old man the hand wasnt the most compelling item of the day for him so who is it glitsky asked when hed finished drysdale shrugged some guy he said then to hardy whats to talk about how about if he was killed how about it you think he was killed glitsky asked i think hes dead at least how he got that way i dont know i wondered if youd heard anything i heard a good new song the other day glitsky said hardy turned to drysdale i thought the coroner might have come up with something drysdale frowned i doubt hes even looked at it it sounded like garth brooks but it could have been merle haggard a lot of these country guys sound the same to me hardy chewed some ice yeah well if it does turn out to be a homicide i wouldnt mind drawing the case homicides a pretty long shot drysdale said guy might have drowned anything i know i just wanted to put the word in drysdale thought about the proposal you havent had a murder yet have you diz hardy shook his head not close it could have been randy travis though glitsky said sometimes when he sings low he sounds a little like the hag drysdale appeared to think hard a minute glitsky was humming the first few bars of his song finally drysdale looked at the last inch of beer in his glass and finished it off sounds fair he said to hardy you found it if its a murder its your case glitsky stopped humming hardy makes the big time he said reining in his natural enthusiasm hardy fished in his pocket and dropped a couple of quarters into the console in front of him have another game he said to drysdale and this time let him win hardy sat on the navajo rug on the floor of his living room way up at the front of the house his adopted daughter rebecca was in his lap her tiny hand picking at the buttons of his shirt in the fireplace some oak burned outside the cocoon of fog that wrapped the house was darkening by degrees up in the kitchen he heard frannie humming doing the dishes from their dinner the room like the rest of the house had changed with frannies arrival previously hardy had lived almost exclusively in his back rooms the kitchen his bedroom the office his house was in the old victorian railroad style living room up front a dining room then a small utility room all of which opened to the right off a long hallway that ended at the kitchen while hardy had designed and built the back room for rebecca frannie had painted and redecorated the front rooms brightening them up in white with dusty rose accents hardys nautical theme pieces such as they were were banished to his office now on the mantel in place of the dusty old blowfish was an exquisite caravan of venetian blownglass elephants a framed davinci poster a study of horses graced the wall to the left of the fireplace on the right frannie had filled the builtin bookshelves with hardcovers from hardys office barbara tuchman hardys complete wambaugh collection most of steinbeck marquez jack london four new lamps filled the corners with light hardy took it all in the plants the dark sheen of the cherry diningroom furniture his baby girl it seemed nearly impossible to him that all of this was so comfortable now so right frannie came through the dining room and stood leaning against the doorpost her long red hair glinted in the light from the fire she wore jeans and a stanford sweatshirt white reeboks you were so quiet she said hardy rested a flat palm against rebeccas stomach feeling the heart pumping i dont think i was home once this time of night when i was bartending you miss it bartending he shook his head no its funny i used to think i was addicted to it you know the noise and the action now im sitting here the fire pops and thats plenty she came over and sat down indianstyle across from him she ran a finger up her daughters leg left her hand there arent you tired did you sleep at all last night hardy shrugged as mr zevon says ill sleep when im dead frannie didnt like hearing that rebeccas biological father eddie cochran frannies husband had been killed just about a year ago hardy sensed it he put his hand over hers in truth i am severely fatigued as frannie got up to pull the curtains over the bay window the doorbell rang we dont want any hardy said i know frannie went to the door jeff elliot knew news when he saw it and if a human hand turning up in a sharks belly didnt deserve more than a graph on the back page hed eat his press card he knew that a good percentage of all the great stories watergate lincoln savings pete rose had begun as tiny drops in the vast pool of information that came to a paper every day and what made those drops congeal to a trickle that became a flood had been the reporters who viewed the news as their canvas news happened sure but what made the news a story was what excited him you couldnt make things up but you could manufacture interest an angle a hook thats what made a good reporter and jeff knew he had the gift his bosses just hadnt seen it yet so things werent moving as quickly for him as hed hoped in college in wisconsin hed been the editor of the paper then three years at the akron clarion and finally his big break the san francisco chronicle but now hed been on the coast for seven months and he was amazed that even here in the big city so little came in via the police incidence reports the irs that was even remotely sexy and thats what hed been doing the lowest dog work checking over the irs looking for a lead a grabber a story and then today finally the hand he balanced his crutches against the doorway to ring the bell almost immediately the door opened to a very pretty redhaired woman in a stanford sweatshirt the house smelled of oak and baking bread he gave his little waif grin im sorry to bother you he said but is this where dismas hardy lives im jeff elliot with the chronicle and id just like to ask him a few questions its interesting you should ask that hardy said it came up just today downtown what came up the homicide question theyd moved into the dining room and frannie had poured a black and tan guinness and ale in two layers for her husband the reporter really not much more than a kid with a pair of bad legs had a cup of coffee frannie pregnant had a glass of water and sat quietly nursing rebecca listening well the odds are good that whoever it is hes probably recently dead it could be a straight drowning but we had to consider the fact that somebody killed this guy and dumped him in the ocean the reporter had his dictaphone on the table between them but hardy said were still a long way from knowing that i dont believe the coroners even had a chance to examine the thing yet at least he hadnt by the time i left the office is that normal well if there was a body to go with it hed have done something im sure but we havent got anything from missing persons at least not yet theyre checking other jurisdictions im sure hardy shrugged its a process thats all theyll get to it frannie finished nursing and went to the back of the house to put down the sleeping infant when she got back dismas had finished his beer and she could tell by his look that he was fading he hadnt slept after all in two days they were talking about pico morales pulling out the hand back at the aquarium frannie went around behind dismas massaged his shoulders and cleared her throat im afraid this news conference has got to come to an end ive got a tired man here whos too macho to admit it oh gosh jeff elliot looked at his watch flicked off the tape machine im sorry i didnt mean to keep you ive got to get this story written and filed anyway im afraid its not much new as a story i dont know ive just got a feeling about this one its somebodys hand for gosh sake hardy nodded you got a card ill let you know if we find something da calls mystery hand a homicide by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer an assistant district attorney conceded last night that the grisly find on sunday of a human hand wearing a jade ring was a homicide the hand was discovered in the stomach of a great white shark the same animal featured in the movie jaws that had been delivered alive to the steinhart aquarium over the weekend assistant district attorney dismas hardy who coincidentally had been present at the aquarium when the hand was discovered said the das office was looking into the matter somebody killed this guy and dumped him in the ocean hardy said to date there are no leads on the victims identity hardy acknowledged that authorities were checking with other jurisdictions in the area although the coroner has not yet performed any tests on the hand hardy appeared confident that the victim would soon be identified and an investigation into the probable murder begun its a process hardy said theyll get there christopher locke was fiftytwo years old and the first africanamerican ever elected district attorney of the city and county of san francisco locke thought his job essentially took place in the rarefied air of policy he lobbied hard for the death penalty for example he determined whether there would be a crackdown on graffiti prosecutions on gay bashing in the mission district he worked with the police department on coordinating the work of the gang task force he went to a lot of lunches spoke both inside the city and around the state on issues involving law enforcement lockes longtime ally and best friend to the extent it was possible to have one was art drysdale with whom he entrusted much of the daytoday running of the office art was fair and firm too outspoken to be a political rival a good administrator and even better lawyer the last thing locke had time for or wanted to do was interact with his junior staff but here he was this tuesday morning awaiting the arrival of dismas hardy four months in the office hardys file lay next to the chronicle open on his desk in front of him it didnt seem to locke to be much of an article but it had evidently been enough to prompt a call from some homicide lieutenant to the police chief himself dan rigby who in turn had deemed it important enough to call locke at home before hed had his coffee then fifteen minutes later hed gotten another call from john strout the coroner asking what the hell this homicide business was all about drysdale had thought hed just run down and tell hardy to button it but locke had promised rigby hed handle the matter personally so here he was dorothy buzzed and a minute later hardy let himself through the door locke remembered him from when hed welcomed him to the office a formality about which locke was punctilious at the time locke had briefly wondered how drysdale had found an opening on the staff for a male caucasian hardy wasnt a kid by any means this was his second time around with the da he should know better dont sit down hardy this wont take long locke busied himself for a moment with hardys file without looking up he said i notice youve got seventeen specially assigned prelims preliminary hearings youre supposed to be prosecuting yes sir thats about right thats exactly right according to your file am i missing something i hadnt counted them perhaps prelim work isnt worthy of your time hardy stood in the classic atease position this is about the article it wasnt a question thats right its about the article the quote was out of context it happens all the time im wondering why you found it proper to be discussing this matter with the press at all i found the hand i thought the reporter was going for something a little more human interest it doesnt appear he was it appears you got yourself sandbagged yes sir it does so ive instructed mr drysdale to send a little more prelim work your way the way we do it we like to have our attorneys work on the cases they get assigned is that clear yes sir and mr drysdale will be doing the assigning yes sir and it would be good policy and a good habit to acquire if you prefaced any remarks you ever make to a reporter with the words this is off the record understood hardy nodded and agreed until he was dismissed though hardy didnt like him aaron jaans was a decent even wellrespected attorney in response to what he considered hardys outrageous offer he had requested that they talk to a judge in superior court rather than municipal court before there was even a preliminary hearing to determine whether hardys offer would be made to stick as a courtesy hardy had complied with the request now they were in judge andy fowlers courtroom and esme aiella stood before the bench next to aaron jaans she was wearing a skintight blue tube that began an inch above her nipples and ended four inches below her crotch her hair had been straightened and dyed a shade of red that did not occur in nature ms aiella the judge was saying the facts of this case seem to speak for themselves but before i make any ruling whatever i want to hear from you that you are not interested in reducing grand theft the charge against you from a felony to a misdemeanor esme stood silent her hand to her mouth ms aiella i dont believe you asked her a question your honor fowler glared at aaron jaans threw a glance at dismas hardy who was standing to jaans right then spoke again looking directly at esme ms aiella the court directs you to speak up can you hear me clearly the woman nodded would you please use words can you hear me clearly yes sir your honor my client fowler held up his palm mr jaans i am speaking to your client directly is that clear without waiting for a response the judge continued now ms aiella you are in a bad situation here i must tell you that the charge of grand theft is very serious if you are convicted there will not just be a fine there is the possibility the very real possibility of going to prison do you understand the hand came away from her mouth yes sir do you care about that she shrugged it dont matter going to prison doesnt matter esme shrugged again fowler looked over at hardy clearly it didnt matter lecturing arguing or threatening wasnt going to make any difference the judges eyes roamed the back of the courtroom for a moment then he brought down his gavel he indicated that hardy follow him to his chambers the court will take a brief recess theres no hope the judge said it was a statement so atypical of andrew bryan fowler that hardy couldnt immediately reply there was nothing about the judge that suggested he could ever think there was no hope he looked as always terrific his thick black hair was peppered with enough gray to suggest wisdom but not at the expense of advanced age as a teenager hed modeled for the sears catalog and his tanned face still had those fine allamerican lines his grayblue eyes were penetrating chin strong teeth perfect nose straight andys handmade blue dress shirt was wrinklefree even under his robes and the gold cufflinks customized with his initials abf provided just the right tone for a judge the cufflinks were often visible as fowler sat on the bench his fingers templed at his lips listening to an argument he would later recall nearly verbatim the cufflinks added to what the romans had called gravitas the nearly indescribable quality that rendered a mans acts and judgments significant on the bench his honor andy fowler possessed gravitas in spades here in his chambers or at home it was different but not so very different hardy hung out around the house in jeans and a sweatshirt in his bartending days hed been happy in tennis shoes old corduroys tshirts even now in one of his three new suits hardy was aware of the knot of his tie at his adams apple andy by contrast would arrive at a sunday barbeque in pressed khakis tasseled cordovan loafers dress shirt and blazer sometimes with a tie when andy played tennis which he did well and often at the olympic club he wore whites hardy guessed he slept in tailored pyjamas and wore a bathrobe and slippers to have his coffee alone in his kitchen hardy picked the paperweight off the desk it was a strange and beautiful piece of lightgreen jade nearly translucent oddly shaped with sea birds and whales etched in light relief on the highly polished surface fowler was hanging his robe in the corner he turned around i dont like to do this to you but even without this girls cooperation were not going with felony grand theft on this were not why not because this kind of entrapment will not wash in my department diz chris locke knows this art drysdale knows it i dont know why they keep sending these turkeys up here to superior court the judge was getting to be infamous around the hall for his views on entrapment his popularity once very high had suffered for it but he was opposed to putting people away for crimes he thought they wouldnt have committed without a push from the police the woman he said picks up a john in union square and they go to his hotel room the television set in the room is surprise really a video camera and when our boy goes out of the room to the bathroom we get a lovely picture of esme aiella taking his wallet which happens to contain just enough american dollars to constitute what the law calls grand theft he shook his head in disgust because i like you i run a bluff like i just did who knows maybe shell give up her pimp but shes not going to give up her pimp theres no way so now this goes back to what it is a misdemeanor prostitution that should not take up time in my courtroom she did steal the money andy diz they all steal why do you think prostitutions illegal in the first place so we just fine her and forget it fowlers shoulders sagged every single day of the year we fine em and forget em theres just no hope he repeated the heft and balance of the paperweight felt incredibly good hardy sat down with it passing it back and forth in his hands the judge walked to one of the two windows behind his desk and crossed his hands behind his back hardy got up put the paperweight back in its spot and went and stood next to the man whod been his fatherinlaw for five years andy are you all right the judge sighed sure im fine he flicked his smile back on see fowler didnt talk about there being no hope but if he didnt want to talk at the moment hardy wasnt going to push it so what about next time with esme aiella dont we ever get the hammer the judge stared at nothing out his grimy window cure her you mean his laugh was more a bitter snort fowler parted the shades of his window as if looking for something not seeing it he moved back to his desk into his red leather chair a girl like esme all the girls like esme theyre turning tricks because nothing matters anyway their pimp is their father he beats them and sleeps with them you think esmes father was sleeping with her fowler reached for the paperweight now himself nodding or her brother or uncle or all of the above women in the trade they were broken in at home and on the flip side if their daddy was screwing them even if they dont go into it fulltime theyll turn a trick or two its cheap psychology but its in every profile hardy knew it was true he remembered the interview hed read where some reporter had asked a prostitute whether she had been abused as a child and the woman had laughed that was her response laughter that the guy could be so dumb as to even ask that question honey shed replied not abused fucked hit messed with and thats everybody i know every single girl in the trade so theres no hope hardy said i wouldnt hold my breath the judge absently cupped the paperweight in his hand bouncing it with a dull thump on the desktop a minute had passed fowler continued to tap the paperweight against the desk then as if theyd been talking about it all along he said yeah somethings eating me i suppose he put the jade down swiveled in his chair im not myself diz i feel like an old clock whos run out of spring how longs it been since youve had a vacation fowler snorted a real vacation a year ago august but i just spent last weekend in the sierras put some miles on the hiking boots didnt see a soul fowler put the paperweight down here i am back in civilization and it doesnt seem to have helped a bit hardy nodded couple of years ago i was feeling the same way so i went on the wagon and flew down to cabo for two weeks did that make you feel better not at all fowler smiled well thats a big help thanks it did pass though other stuff came up yeah i know the problem is life keeps going on while youre waiting for that other stuff suddenly almost with a jolt the judge straightened up oh listen to me a little case of the blues and his honor becomes maudlin his honors allowed to get down just like anybody else you getting out at all having any fun want to come over and see my new family have some dinner i dont think so diz but thanks id keep seeing you with jane thinking about what might have been hardys first marriage to the judges daughter had ended in divorce if you want to play some squash though id be happy to whip you at the olympic fowler was up now going back to his robes hardy reached over and picked up the paperweight again deal he said then whered you get this thing fowler turned what but seeing what his face darkened uncontrolled for a second why dont you take it he said hardy went to put it down no i cant diz take the damn thing put it in your pocket i dont want to see it anymore andy come on diz lets pack it up ive got a courtroom waiting for my august presence he brushed by in a swish of robes stopping at the door he held it open for hardy ill call you when i get a court for squash true to his word locke saw that hardy got more prelims five new special assignments were in his box when he got back from court he sighed pulled the paperweight from his pocket and picked up the telephone the files could wait jane fowler worked as a buyer for i magnin she was getting ready to go out to lunch but she took his call he hadnt talked to her since his marriage to frannie which he thought was understandable the idea of platonic friendship with an exspouse made them both uncomfortable and the last time theyd seen each other before hardy and frannie had gotten engaged they slept together which also didnt make things easier hardy and jane had loved each other for several years they had had a lot of good times then had endured the death of their son together but after that hardy had lost faith in everything and if a marriage needed anything it was faith so theyd gotten divorced then after nearly a decades separation theyd reconnected for a few months long enough for them both to realize that another try at marriage wouldnt work they wanted different things out of life now and if they were still attracted to one another hardy thought it would be bad luck to confuse that with what he had with frannie jane sounded as she always did refined and composed shades of her father im glad you called she said ive missed you its okay to miss you a little isnt it are you all right is everything okay hardy laughed im fine jane everythings peachy with me but i just got out of a meeting with your dad have you seen him recently i know she said i almost called you about it last week but i didnt know how youd feel about that i didnt want to make you uncomfortable you can call me jane whats going on with andy i dont really know im really a little worried he asked me over to his house for dinner last week and he was so distracted or depressed slower i thought maybe he was just showing his age finally he wasnt any slower from the bench it was only back in chambers on his own time i thought he might have had a small stroke or something did you ask him jane laughed you know daddy the great denyer hes picking at his food hardly talking and i ask him if hes all right and of course hes just fine couldnt be better and then he got drunk andy got drunk you remember the time you and moses drank a watermelon full of gin the answer is no you dont remember anything about it i remember the hangover okay that but up till the last time i saw daddy id never seen anybody so drunk since then hardy whistled the watermelon drunk had become part of moses and hardy lore if andy fowler had gotten that drunk he was not himself something was seriously wrong did he give you any idea what was bothering him no he just said he deserved a little fun in his life what was the matter with a judge being human too then he started drinking cognac talking about mom and when i was a baby and all the decisions hed made not to have fun while he got to be a lawyer and a judge and now his life was almost over anyway finally he just got all slurry and i put him to bed the line was silent for a second im glad you noticed something too it wasnt just me no i dont think it was just you anyway im here to help if something comes up just so you know maybe ill play some squash with him feel him out a little there was another pause thanks for calling she said were still friends were still friends were always friends jane after they hung up hardy took the jade paperweight out of his pocket and put it on his desk why would andy have just given him hell not just given demanded he take such a beautiful piece well enough about andy fowler he thought time to go to work he reached for the new case folders and pulled them in front of him he opened the first one a dui driving under the influence the influence in this case being alcohol eleventh offense level of point nine which last year wasnt illegal hardy closed the file squared the small stack on the middle of his desk put the paperweight on top of it and decided to go to lunch art drysdale was juggling baseballs in his office in his youth hed played a couple of weeks as a utility man for the san francisco giants capping a fiveyear career in professional baseball before turning to the law now he coached a police athletic league teenage baseball team and played a little bleague mens softball at nights he liked juggling he could do it blindfolded if he had to it also tended to disarm anyone watching him such as dismas hardy who was standing in the doorway in the early afternoon pretty great stuff you threw me there hardy said theres even one guy who might have done something wrong as opposed to illegal art kept juggling not looking at the balls illegal is wrong das handbook chapter one i like the woman who didnt use her pooper scooper we ought to really throw the book at her doggy doo on the street drysdale gathered the balls in held them in one huge hand heck of a nuisance weve got to enforce those leash laws next thing you know packs of wild hounds are destroying our society hardy came in and sat down but seriously art no but seriously diz he moved forward in his chair you are not making friends here friends is how we like to do it i scratch your back you scratch mine its a big office what with the police and the da and the coroner all here in one big happy building now in one swell foop you have pissed off rigby strout and locke this is not good politics politics is not drysdale held up a hand and three baseballs i know youve been out of the deskjob environment a while now but any office i dont care where call it what you want there is politics cooperation gets things done you alienate the chiefs of three departments i guarangoddamntee you you will not have job satisfaction i dont suppose it matters that everything the reporter said was taken out of context oh that matters you still got your job so it matters that much but its close id go mend some fences if i were you work hard impress people with your enthusiasm to get convictions on your cases like that hardy stood up this gives a whole new meaning to helping clean up the streets you know drysdale allowed himself a smile maybe the handll turn into something the baseballs flew back up into the air hardy stopped in the doorway maybe the handll turn into something drysdale nodded his attention split at best could happen he said could happen at four oclock hardy called it quits and went over to lou the greeks it had been a long afternoon john strout the coroner was a courtly southern gentleman who accepted hardys apology with apparent sincerity although sixtos clipped and formal greeting at the desk indicated that there had been some harsh feelings earlier in the day the chief of police john rigby wasnt available so hardy scheduled an appointment with him for the next afternoon the police sergeant who served as rigbys secretary took the opportunity to gently remind hardy that homicides were usually determined by police work after which they were passed up to the das office hardy tried to cheer himself with the argument that he had very quickly passed through the justanotherfaceinthecrowd stage at work everyone in the building seemed to know who he was it wasnt much consolation he wrote a memo to locke that he threw in the wastebasket there wasnt any fence to mend with locke he figured hed either get a good conviction record and move up or not get one and move out there was a fine line between kissing ass and mending fences at lous hardy sat alone at the bar spinning the jade paperweight he was nursing a black and tan when a tall very attractive woman pulled up the stool next to him hardy had never spoken to her before but he knew who she was she put a hand on his shoulder leaned close and told him not to let the bastards get him down he dropped the jade into his pocket as she flashed him a mouthful of teeth and extended the hand that had been on his shoulder elizabeth pullios youre dismas hardy guilty hardy took the warm fine hand which seems to be todays magic word pullios might not be the bestlooking woman in the das office hardy thought but she thought she was and so occasionally really could be perhaps five foot eight with shoulderlength chestnut hair that shone even in the dim light at lous she had a big nose a generous mouth deepset eyes and high cheekbones she wore a brush of tasteful makeup just enough to set off the angles and highlight the eyes guilty is every days magic word she said she signaled lou behind the bar for a drink then came back to hardy ruffled the brass feathers huh art told me about it art told me about it too you get reamed hardy managed a wry smile i can still sit down but i think ill pass on talking to reporters for a while no dont she said her drink arrived a double scotch mist from the looks of it and she drank half of it in a gulp dont stop talking to anybody theyre just trying to bust your balls talk to anybody you can use whos trying to bust my balls locke and art youre new and thats what they do find out what youre made of they play the bureaucrat game cause its their control mechanism which sometimes is good for some people but if you want some kickass cases dont let em stop you if youre good in front of a jury everythings forgiven believe me it was coming back to hardy the story on elizabeth pullios she was known as a ballbreaker in her own right she delighted in prosecuting did it with a singular passion it was said more than half truthfully that she favored the death penalty for car theft pickpocketing pursesnatching she had been married during her first few years as a da to a guy in the office and when he accepted a better job in private practice on the defense side she had divorced him she couldnt live with a defense attorney she said they were the scum of the earth worse almost than defendants now the word was shed have you if you were good enough so hardy was forewarned he figured he could talk to her safely enough he was after all in love with frannie im afraid this reporter elliot kind of used me instead of vice versa he said she shrugged that off look thats what reporters do but they can also keep a case hot a lot of us have been known to leak stuff just dont let your name out that message was pretty clear pullios finished her drink and signaled lou again buy you another she asked hardy wasnt half through his first but an oldhand bartender like himself could nurse a couple of brews along for as long as he needed did art ask you to talk to me no but he told me you were frustrated about your work i put a little together and i hate to see new guys get shafted its bad for all of us the round of drinks came hardy and pullios clicked glasses to the good guys she said thats us hardy remember that thats always us hardy was out of lous before five there was a steady cool breeze coming off the bay and it threw some grit up into his face and eyes as he walked down the alley next to the hall of justice detective sergeant abraham glitsky was sitting on the hood of hardys suzuki samurai if youre going home i could use a dropoff he said my cityowned vehicle is once again on the blink why is there never enough money to keep things working ive got a better one what accounts for your jolly high spirits lately glitsky slid off the car letting out a breath i know he said hardy passed by him and unlocked the passenger door too many dead guys i guess you go see enough bodies a day you smile less its a proven fact it brought hardy up short his desire to get interesting cases murders tended in some way to reduce their horror especially after his chat with elizabeth pullios but most of the time on his job he was in suspect mode where he had a perpetrator he was trying to convict it was easy to forget that half of glitskys job was concerned with victims families friends mourning hardy got in his seat and started the engine glitsky shook his head one of the weekend drivebys was a kid about isaacs age isaac was the eldest of glitskys three children a twelveyearold even looked a little like him except for the hole in his forehead even after a few months on the job hardy hadnt developed a taste for cop humor he didnt know if he wanted to it rarely made anyone laugh they rode in silence for a minute heading west into the sun finally hardy said im waiting for what your two cents worth glitsky squinted into the sunset and id love to give it as i know youre often in need of my counsel and advice but i dont have a clue what youre talking about the hand being a homicide that was you huh i was afraid it was you you didnt see it glitsky shook his head i didnt get to the paper today but some guys were talking about this jerkoff d a yeah that was me well look at the bright side like i always do maybe it was a homicide maybe youll get the case win it get a big conviction become da run for governor win that heres your stop hardy said you need a lift in the morning ill bet its a woman frannie said not andy fowler you wait and see its a woman the paperweight was a gift from a woman that he isnt seeing she broke up with him and suddenly he couldnt bear to see it anymore it reminded him too much of her and shed broken his heart i knew i shouldnt let you stay home all day youve gotten addicted to the soaps havent you dismas my finely honed prosecutorial skills have wheedled the truth from you at last jesus frannie said i have never watched a soap opera in my life and you know it im not so sure anymore hardy said the soaring language andy couldnt bear it shed broken his heart and all that from a piece of jade he looked across the table at his wife her green eyes looked nearly black in the candlelight they were in the dining room finishing up a meal of filet mignon with bearnaise sauce new potatoes and string beans that frannie had cooked in olive oil and garlic hardy was half through a bottle of good california cabernet okay sherlock but ive known andy for fifteen years and he doesnt have girlfriends that you have known about youd think i would have gotten some inkling once or twice maybe he just keeps that separate especially from jane maybe jane would be hurt why would jane be hurt i dont know her mothers memory hardy shook his head not after all this time im sure shed want her dad to have some love life tm not so sure of that maybe he just thinks its better to be discreet i mean he is a public figure if he went through a succession of women now its a succession the guy didnt keep a harem frannie he might have how would you know i know him frannie smiled you wait hardy moved the last morsel of his rare filet around in the remainder of the sauce ill wait he said this is very bad for my cholesterol you know i notice youre struggling with it how did jane sound hardy swallowed his food took a sip of wine jane was all right he reached across and covered frannies hand with his own janes okay and we dont have any secrets you and me right right come around here she pulled away still smiling no would you please come around here hardy pushed his chair back and frannie came around the table and sat on his lap since you asked so nice she said she put her arms around his neck and kissed him thoroughly for the better part of a minute hardy stood up carrying her and walked through the kitchen into the bedroom the chronicle building was at fifth and mission about six blocks from the hall of justice hardy walked through the morning fog which did a lot more than chill the air and while tony bennett might not care he was probably one of the very few who didnt hardy gave away a few bucks in change to some homeless people who sat against the buildings on third wrapped in newspapers or old blankets shivering by the time he got to the chronicle his bones felt brittle and old jeff elliot anchored one of the newer desks in a cavernous room that smelled like an old school his crutches were propped against the desk all too visible propped as in prop hardy thought he was turned to face a video terminal and was talking on the telephone when hardy got to his desk all of this is off the record he began elliot turned saw hardy held up a finger and continued talking into the mouthpiece hardy continued right on when i got into work this morning i wasnt as mad as i was yesterday but pretty close did i mention this is off the record elliot muttered something into the telephone hung up and turned squarely to face hardy he didnt look so young nor so friendly as he had at hardys house two days earlier his face still boyish looked sallow and wan as though he hadnt slept in a couple of days the dishwater hair hung lank and long over the ears his tie was loosened at his throat although his shirt was fresh mr hardy he said sticking out his hand over the desk hardy ignored the hand off the record everything i ever say to you again completely and absolutely off the record is that clear elliot to his credit didnt bluff much though he did try his sheepish grin my editor wouldnt run the story without a source you didnt tell me not to use your name hardy held up a hand i dont care about your politics theres enough where i work elliot shrugged i needed the hardy stopped him you could have accomplished the same thing being straight with me im a pretty reasonable guy but i am truly a bad enemy elliot was sitting farther back eyes wide if thats a threat he said then stopped to his surprise hardy noticed elliots hands were shaking on the desk the boy was scared something in hardy wanted to go for the jugular but he had liked elliot at his house and the shaking hands made him lose the stomach for it he sat down put his arms and elbows on the desk its no threat its a tip thats all dont make enemies you dont need to this is the big city people play for keeps even nice guys like me hardy flashed him a grin now id like you to do me a favor elliot came slowly forward if i can i guess i owe you one thats the right guess hardy said owen nash jeff elliots voice was thick with excitement where are you now hardy at his desk pushed away one of the case folders and swirled on his chair to look out the window gray on gray he had asked elliot to go to missing persons and check to see if either a large woman or a man someone with a fullsized hand had been reported missing im downstairs the call just came in this morning the timings right hardy said missing persons would not get involved with a persons disappearance until three days had passed right well this was called in by a guy wait a sec a guy named ken farris phone number you got a pencil hardy took the number owen nash and this number anything else theyve got nine missing kids and three skipped or missing wives all of them within the range of normal size but owen nash is the only missing adult male this week thats not so common its a real start its a start maybe and thats all it is jeff and its a big big maybe still elliot said but why couldnt you just come down and ask around hardy sighed why get into it politics he said but it was a good idea i wish it had been mine so what do we do now you dont do anything i start a little followup and you wait until i call you got it and i might not but if theres a story its yours thats the deal hardy hadnt intended to mention anything to anybody but drysdale poked his head in through his door the minute he hung up just making the rounds he said you better today theyve got a missing adult male drysdale frowned leaning on the door who does missing persons does this directly relate to one of the two dozen folders i see so prominently displayed on your desk not even indirectly hardy smiled drysdale let himself in the door and pulled it closed after him diz do yourself a favor would you clear a few of these he picked up part of the stack of files and dropped it on the middle of the desk give me some numbers so i can point to your caseload and say this guys been a horse in the minors lets give him a shot at the big time hardy spun the jade paperweight now doing its appointed task on his desk okay art okay thank you drysdale started to go but hardy called him back can you tell me anything about elizabeth pullios i can tell you a lot about her why she kind of gave me a pep talk yesterday out of the blue maybe she thinks youre cute i got the feeling she doesnt need to seek out men drysdale nodded leaning against the doorpost he had his hands in his pockets one leg crossed over the other relaxation incarnate no she does not need to seek out men so whats her story whys she such a redhot checking the hallway behind him drysdale pulled the door shut and straddled one of the chairs facing hardys desk looking out the window at the gray behind him he took a breath her mother was raped and killed by a guy whod been on parole three days hed been a model prisoner in for rape served four years when they let him out for good behavior i think it left her with an impression hardy whistled well i guess were all motivated by something but some of the staff think pullios takes it a little far drysdale stood up and stretched anyway the fact remains i want to put somebody away id go with her every time dont get personal with her though shes very onetrack hardy held up his left hand the one with frannies ring im a newlywed art im not in the market i wouldnt bet thats a big issue with her hardys first move after his superior left was to pick up the telephone and dial the number jeff elliot had given him ken farris the man who had reported the missing person owen nash a sultryvoiced receptionist got crisp and efficient when hardy said he was from the das office he patched him through immediately this is ken farris who am i talking to hardy told him there was a pause i dont understand youre with the san francisco district attorneys office is owen in jail the telephone beeped if thats your call waiting farris cut him off we record all our phone calls here is that a problem he didnt wait for a response look im sorry but whats the da got to do with owen being missing is he alive please just tell me that i dont know that mr farris he heard a deep exhalation relief or frustration he couldnt tell which and didnt want to wait to find out what im calling about how im involved here has to do with a hand that turned up in a sharks belly hardy could almost hear farriss brain changing gears the one in the chronicle i read about that what has that got to do with owen maybe nothing mr nash is a missing male and the hand may be from an elderly male what do you mean might be did the paper have that you think the hand might be owens i think it might be worth a look thats all there might be some bit of skin with something youd recognize the shape of a fingernail something the fingerprints are gone but dont i remember something about a ring hardy nodded into the phone there was a jade ring on the little finger the phone beeped again all their calls hardy thought farris was curt then it wasnt owen he wore a gold wedding band on his left hand but no other jewelry what hand was it its a right hand well it isnt owen then thats definite farris sighed again letting out some more pressure thank god derek graham had been a maintenance man in sewers for thirteen years he was a fortyyearold caucasian male supervisor with a wife and three children as a tenured city employee he was immune to just about anything that might threaten his job but the political reality was that a white management person who lost his job in san francisco would find it filled immediately by a member of any one of the myriad minority groups san francisco called its own already hardy knew the sharks were circling and a righteous drugbust conviction could put derek not only in jail but on the street for while it was still only a misdemeanor to smoke marijuana in san francisco possession of anything over an ounce was interpreted as intent to sell and that was a felony dereks cityissued chevrolet caprice with its buy america bumper sticker had a burnedout brake light this turned out to be bad luck for derek he had just finished half a joint so he could get home a little relaxed and not snap at his kids when a patrol car pulled him over the officer had smelled that smell and with his olfactory evidence as probable cause had searched the caprice and found roughly eight ounces of sensimilla in the trunk this led to a search of dereks house and the discovery of the hydroponic garden in the basement derek was in a lot of trouble and he was very worried about it look he told hardy i cant lose my job he was in hardys office with his courtappointed attorney a young woman named gina roake ms roake hadnt said a word since introducing derek to hardy five minutes earlier hardy had addressed his remarks to her at first but derek kept butting in so hardy went to the horses mouth losing your job isnt the half of it he said derek was six feet tall and weighed hardy figured about oneeightyfive he had a handsome cleanshaven face topped by a businessmans haircut for this meeting at which he wasnt particularly welcome by either attorney hed chosen not to wear a tie but in dress slacks and a pressed buttondown checkered shirt he looked more than presentable he could have been applying for a job at a construction site its not like ive done anything criminal hell he said to hardy you work for the city what do you make growing dope is criminal hardy answered and my salary is irrelevant i could look it up but say its fortyfive derek continued without pause hardy made a year in his new job and he let his suspect go on you got kids hardy nodded well then you know you cant make it on fortyfive here i work for the city fifteen years the file says thirteen so split a hair thirteen i work here thirteen years fulltime and my wife and i are trying to raise three kids right so she can stay home with em why have kids if youre not going to raise them yourself right i got no record before this im not whining im just telling you the truth raising your kids right includes marijuana horticulture hardy asked my oldest kid is seven the grass is a second job thats all it is there wasnt any doubt of that hardy made his fiftytwo but he owned one quarter of the little shamrock and that brought in another grand or so a month plus frannie had a quarterofamilliondollar insurance policy from her first husbands death which they were saving for the kids college but at least if they really needed it it was there hardy knew what derek was saying it was hard to make it on one salary in these times but hardy right now was a prosecutor he remembered art drysdales words illegal is wrong he said you should have thought of that when you planted your garden not liking himself very much who am i hurting tell me that im no dealer i got eight guys i offload a key on hardy held up a hand now were talking any of these people have names derek just shook his head come on man these are normal people like me and you how old are you forty tell me you didnt smoke a little weed in college hardy couldnt tell him that he didnt know many people of his generation including many on the police force who hadnt had a hit or two of marijuana at one time or another to him it was a nonissue but here he was playing at no being the law suddenly he turned and spoke directly to ms roake could we have a conference please he looked pointedly at derek theres a reason the court appoints an attorney the coffee shops down on one when hed gone hardy closed the file ms roake gina may i call you gina what does he want he doesnt want to lose his job i think is there an automatic administrative removal on conviction theres no question the plea is guilty am i right the question is the charge gina gave him a tight little smile misdemeanor i dont think so but if were talking felony hes fired gina seemed to be about twenty although she must have been older she bit her lower lip i really think he just wanted the money to help his family hardy fairly snapped at her people rob banks and kill people all the time to get money for their families gina stiffened visibly and hardy backed off look i dont mean to jump all over you but lets not play his game the guy was growing a good amount of dope and thats illegal how about you think up some heavy misdemeanor that will satisfy me i mean a good one he pleads to that pays a heavy fine does some community service ill try to sell that to my boss and your man keeps his job ginas dark eyes brightened youd do that he goes near marijuana again even a little recreational joint and well crucify him clear she nodded her head holding her hands tightly together in her lap as though she were congratulating herself oh yes yes thats wonderful she got up from the chair in a shush of nylons shook hardys hand thanking him and went out the door before he could change his mind hed just handed one to the defense he wondered what elizabeth pullios would say about that on second thought he didnt have to wonder he knew what shed say thinking on that he crossed his hands behind his head and looked up at the ceiling brown water stains on the acoustic tile wonderful he said on the way into work hardy had told glitsky that his wife was coming downtown to meet him for lunch now his friend abe was sitting in the snack bar holding rebecca frannie across from him laughing at something frannies face her laughter still had the power to make him forget the bad things life could dish out it was more amazing to him that she could laugh at all only a little over a year before someone had shot her husband in the head leaving her a twentyfiveyearold pregnant widow drenched in the gall of that sorrow he stood a moment one step into the employees lunchroom and took in the sight frannies glowing face the life in it somehow hardy who had known his own tragedy when hed lost his infant son years before and frannie had gotten together and suddenly the backwardlooking emptiness had changed its direction and its essence now they were together they looked ahead hardy slid in next to frannie and kissed her john strout is a funny guy glitsky said i was just telling frannie when did you see our fine coroner i see him too much as it is but this morning i thought id do you a little legwork abe does a great southern accent frannie said wha thenk yall maam jest tryn ketch the good doctuhs flavuh so to speak abe switched back to his own voice you may have got him mad diz but he looked at the hand i figured it would be easier for me to ask about it than you just routine is it a likely homicide or not and whatd he say he said the guy might have done some karate maybe some board breaking there were calcium deposits on the knuckle of the middle finger and the little finger had two healed breaks oh and the pad opposite the thumb was a little thick that all thats a lot diz plus he did die recently rigor had come and gone but strout thought it was still a fresh hand i love it when you guys talk shop frannie said hardy took his wifes hand its a glamorous profession nothing else could have lured me back then to abe it wasnt a cadaver then glitsky shook his head strouts checked all the local med schools he looked at frannie every couple years some med students steal a body and play some games this doesnt look like one of them so its a homicide she said a homicides just an unnatural death abe said rebecca was starting to get restless and glitsky moved her onto his other leg bouncing her and we dont even have that officially until strout says it is and he wont say till hes positive which means more tests to see if the hand is really fresh which he thinks it is finally abe said even if its a homicide a homicide doth not a murder make much as our man dismas here might like to try one weve still got three options on cause of death suicide accident and natural causes before we get to murder rebecca began to squirm some more and suddenly let out a real cry here let me take her hardy said he reached across the table and abe passed the baby over immediately she snuggled up against his chest and closed her eyes the magic touch frannie said ill go get some lunch she got up and the two men watched her for a second as she headed toward the steam tables hardy stroked a finger along his babys cheek you want to do me another favor he asked no its not much hardy continued a phone call hardy cleared seven cases in the two hours after his lunch three duis with priors a shoplifting with priors lowered to a misdemeanor for a plea one possession of a loaded firearm by a felon and two aggravated assaults a purse snatching and a soccer father beating up his sons coach none of these cases would have to go to trial and further clog the court system and he was glad about that but this plea bargaining was demoralizing and tiring glitsky appeared in his doorway just as hardy finished taking care of the weapons charge his toughest case of the day if you were convicted of carrying a gun without a license in san francisco you went to jail so people facing time in the slammer tended to prefer a jury trial where they perceived theyd at least have a chance to get off but in this case hardy had persuaded the guys attorney to plead nolo contendere and take weekend jail time a sweet deal for both sides all things considered glitsky perched on the corner of the desk so who am i talking to he asked most of the prosecutors shared a room with one of their colleagues but since hardy had come on as an assistant da his roommate had been on maternity leave which suited him fine glitsky got up to close the door behind them and went and sat at the other desk hardy got through to farriss office then glitsky punched in so hardy could listen the receptionist told glitsky to hold and they waited through five of the beeps that signified the call was being recorded glitsky identified himself referred to hardys earlier call and told farris about the new information from the coroner as soon as glitsky said the word karate they knew they were onto something farris was silent a long moment then he quietly said shit mr farris again an interval im here give me a minute will you glitsky waited fingers drumming on the desk beep beep it might not be owen lots of men do karate when did you see him last friday around noon lunchtime he wasnt wearing a jade ring then just the wedding band at least i suppose he had the band on i would have noticed something different i think but mr nash did practice karate he was a black belt he started it a long time ago when we were in korea glitskys brows went up he glanced at hardy a bone in the little finger had been broken and healed twice he said farris swore again waited glitsky whistled soundlessly beep i think id better come up farris said hardy almost forgot his appointment to apologize to the police chief dan rigby glitsky was going down to strout to see if he would be amenable to having hardy around when ken farris arrived to inspect the hand frannie had called to tell him that at her next obgyn in a month they could expect to hear the new babys heartbeat and would hardy try to get the time off so he could go with her did he want to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl she wasnt so sure herself if she wanted to know also she was so young the doctor didnt recommend an amnio and she hadnt had one with rebecca and shed turned out fine what did he think hardy answering her questions enjoying her excitement idly flipped his calendar page and saw the note rigby it was he got to the chiefs office on the dot and waited outside for twentyfive minutes he didnt want farris to have come and gone by the time he got out but he couldnt really push things too much here the sergeant secretary had made it clear yesterday that he was not one of hardys fans and by extension neither was the chief the intercom finally buzzed on the sergeants desk he looked over at hardy and pointed a finger at the double doors dan rigby sat back in a leather chair still talking on the telephone he had a boxers face red and lined and gray hair that was nowhere longer than a quarter inch hardy knew he often wore a business suit but today he was in his officers uniform it was meant to be impressive hardy stood on the persian rug before his desk trying to hit on a suitable opening rigby listening into the telephone scrutinized him as he walked in hardy waited another minute then rigby hung up and squared his shoulders as though they caused him pain you used to be a cop didnt you yes sir i worked a beat about three years then went to the law right yes sir here it comes hardy thought rigby relaxed his shoulders sunk back into his chair i often wondered about going the same way though of course its worked out well enough i guess but getting away from the police end of it i suppose there just wasnt enough action anywhere else the laws not so bad hardy said rigby laughed hoarsely naw the laws all pleading and bullshit the difference is most of the time we all know we damn well know who did it but you gftys you lawyers have got to prove it us we know who did it we catch em our jobs over just about so i figure the thing about this incident yesterday you got your hats mixed up you get good training as a cop here and it sticks with you you think like a cop even when youre over on the law side lockes got a hair up because i called him and he does hate to be bothered with his department but you and i got no gripe you get a murder out of this or a suspect you just do us all a favor and keep us informed well go get the collar and then you can do your job the phone rang again rigby picked up the receiver and listened for a moment i dont care what his constituency is he does not get a police escort to rigby looked up surprised to see hardy still there he waved him out of the room and went back to his call ken farris stood next to the nearly leafless ficus by the window that looked out at the parking lot his hands crossed behind his back he had just come from the cold room looking at a barely recognizable thing that had four appendages the index finger was missing and he went instinctively to the window as though for air although the window was never opened farris was a broadshouldered slimwaisted sixty his light brown suit was perfectly tailored lined with tiny blue and gold pinstripes the light yellow silk shirt was custom made so was the tie the alligator cowboy boots added an unnecessary two inches to his height glitsky and hardy sat on the hard yellow plastic couch in the visitors room of the morgue john strout had pulled up a folding chair and sat slouched his long legs crossed farris turned around fighting himself still somewhat pale well that was a wasted exercise strout reached into his pocket and extracted a small plain cardboard box maybe this will jog something he held the box up and farris came over and took it it was a jade ring a snake biting its tail with a filigreed surface hardy leaned forward for a better look hed only seen it on the hand farris held it awhile then put it over the first knuckle of his ring finger this wouldnt have fit owen he said he had bigger hands than me the ring was on the pinky strout said farris moved the ring over and slid it down onto his little finger it was an easy fit he removed it just as quickly well that still doesnt make it owen no sir it doesnt strout was agreeable genial professional hardy sat forward arms resting on his knees abe glitsky sat back comfortably watching his legs crossed he shifted slightly enough to bring attention around to him you and owen mr nash were close is that right could we not say were just yet hes been missing before long enough for you to call the police once or twice i suppose but i didnt what made you do it this time farris shook his head i honestly dont know a feeling last time he ran off with no notice was maybe ten years ago that much time you figure a mans habits have changed i cant fathom his just taking off anymore back then i could where did he go that last time hardy spoke up whats all this running away farris looked around the room found another folding chair and moved it over next to strouts he put the ring in the box and handed it back to the coroner then he sat down heavily good questions you think he might have gone back to the same place he shook his head no no i dont think so once he went to the mardi gras in new orleans but it turns out that time he took his daughter celine so they were both gone and we figured theyd taken off somewhere together back then it was in character but not now hardy asked hes mellowed or i thought hed mellowed you know how it is glitsky was gentle why dont you tell us how you mean it farris sat back he took a deep breath and blew out a stream of air time was used to be every six months or so owen would do something to make you hate him or hate yourself he was like this this force where hed get a notion to go do something and goddamn if anything was going to stop him not his friends not his family not his responsibilities he had his devils so i never got inclined to try and stop him his wife eloise died in a fire in their house back in the fifties he couldnt get back in to save her barely pulled out their child farris paused remembering so he had this guilt over that from time to time he didnt feel worthy of all his success and hed duck out from under it leave it all for me to run other times just the opposite hed figure well goddamn here i am the great owen nash and if i want to go to bali for a month let the mortals handle it theyll appreciate me more when i get back but glitsky wanted to keep to his line of questioning so he went once to new orleans another time to bali but thats just it he didnt have a favorite place at least one that he ran to weve got this place together outside taos no phones no heat thats served us the last five or six years but i was up there flew up on friday night and he wasnt strout pulled his long legs in under him and sat up straighter scuse me he said quietly but it seems the only thing tyin this here hand to owen nash is the karate farris scanned the room if he was looking for comfort it was the wrong setting the yellow vinyl couch the institutional green walls a neardead plant and some artificial ones i dont know if he ever broke a finger i doubt hed say if he had you mean doing karate breaking a board something like that hardy asked farris nodded that circus stuff breaking boards thats owen if he was showing off for some woman hell for anybody he could break his whole hand and never mention it one of his conceits was he didnt feel pain like the rest of us hardy sat forward at the change of tone this guy might love owen nash but that wasnt all he felt the little finger on this hand has two obviously healed breaks strout said that were never set that sounds more like owen strout straightened up in his chair laced his fingers and stuck his arms out until his knuckles cracked well gentlemen he said this doesnt move me any further along in the line of identification we could run a dna scan but without a sample of what we know to be mr nashs tissue it wouldnt prove anything everyone sat in silence all but strout back in their seats farris still sat forward eyes turned inward trying to come up with something to settle the question there was a knock on the door and sixto poked his head in theres a celine nash out here to see mr farris the womans startling blue eyes were red and puffed dark circles under them as if she hadnt slept in several days her mascara had run over too much makeup in a black suit black nylons black gloves even black onyx earrings she was elegantly turned out but shed run her hands through her ashcolored hair too often and it straggled in uneven shanks to her shoulders she came forward and hugged farris choking back a sob and he held her for half a minute patting her back its okay honey its okay we still dont know she pulled back slightly took farriss pocket handkerchief out and dabbed at her eyes she briefly held herself to him again hardy saw her close her eyes as though gathering her strength then she turned to the other men is one of you the coroner strout stepped forward yes maam im sorry but i thought ken said she looked around as though lost i mean when i heard coroner i just assumed no maam we just dont know yet you might see if you recognize this strout proffered the small ring box celine stared at the ring for a moment what is this it was on the hand strout said she took it from the box looking at him quizzically but daddy didnt wear this ring ken daddy only wore moms ring didnt he i already told them that the handkerchief went back to her eyes she held it there a minute applying some pressure are you all right hardy asked he moved forward celine had gone a little pale she gave hardy a halfsmile but her eyes went back to strout well then this couldnt be my father glitsky in his softest voice asked her when the last time was she had seen her father her eyes narrowed for an instant and hardy thought he saw a flash of resistance perhaps even fear why im sorry but who are you farris broke in and introduced everyone after which glitsky explained he may have gotten the ring after youd seen him she nodded accepting that i dont remember exactly two weeks ago maybe but he didnt have this ring on then he wouldnt have worn it anyway this just isnt him farris up beside her looked at it again and shrugged he wasnt much of a jewelry person all right strout said it was worth a try thank yall for your time after hed escorted them to the door strout shambled back hands in his pockets to hardy and glitsky it might be owen nash he said simply off the record of course but it might be ill keep yall informed the garage had glitskys car repaired and ready to go for him so hardy found himself walking alone through the parking lot at ready to head for the little shamrock where he was meeting frannie the fog which had clung to downtown all day had lifted or moved west with the breeze off the bay the sky overhead was a cloudless evening blue most of the staff at the hall of justice had gotten off at five and the lot was about half empty two rows down from where hardy was parked ken farris sat in the drivers seat of a chrysler lebaron convertible with its top down hardy slowed down and finally stopped farris was staring into the distance arms crossed over his chest unmoving he might have been a statue hed left strouts office with celine nash nearly fortyfive minutes ago and he was still in the parking lot maybe she had stayed and they had talked awhile still hardy found it odd the man wasnt even blinking maybe he was sitting up dead hardy crossed a couple of rows of parking places he got to within ten feet of the lebaron before farris moved it was a slight shift but hardy knew he was in view now i saw you sitting here so still he said i wondered if you were all right the mask gave way to a selfdeprecating smile relative term all right i guess im all right hardy gave him half a wave and had started to walk away when farris called his name he came back to the car you know celine mentioned something i dont know it might be relevant hardy cocked his head you wouldnt be a lawyer would you mr farris a flash of teeth why would you think that well defining all right as a relative term something you might know as relevant those are lawyer words farris stuck out a hand good hunch call me ken would you stanford but i never practiced other than being counsel for owen fulltime job and then some now im coo of owen industries owens ceo electronics components looking into hdtv i dont know what that is hdtv highdefinition television more dots on the screen better picture the japanese are miles ahead of us on it but owen liked it so were moving ahead so whats your mayberelevant information celine just mentioned it to me owen had told her he was going out on the eloise the eloise owens sailboat he was supposedly going out saturday with may shintaka may shinn she calls herself his girlfriend farris made a face something like that more a mistress i guess youd say he kept her you mean people really do that farris laughed without much humor owen figured you paid for your women one way or the other cost of doin bizness wheel he called me wheel like ferris wheel spelled wrong of course cost of gettin laid same goddamn thing might as well pay for it up front no bullshit its an approach i guess hardy said mr hardy dismas then at the squinted question dismas the good thief on calvary okay dismas its not my approach ive been married to my betty twentyfive years but owen isnt like me or anybody else i know he loved eloise his wife and after she died he knew he wasnt going to love anybody else so he wasnt looking for love and wasnt going to kid around about it it might sound cold but it was pretty honest so this may shinn hes been pretty steady with her since january february around in there did she go out on owens boat saturday celine says he was planning on it thats all i know if he did our probabilities increase hardy said why do you say that oh i see do you have a way to reach her may shinn find out right now the shadows had lengthened the breeze had died farris dug into his wallet and pulled out a square of white paper emergency numbers i dont know why i never thought of may hardy walked back beside him as farris punched numbers into his car phone he squinted at the paper next to shinns name he had just enough light and distance to make out the numbers just enough time to memorize them he thought hed also have enough time to swing by the marina on his way out to the avenues it wasnt far out of the way and if he could prove owen had been on the ocean on saturday the day before a hand that might be his turned up inside a shark at the steinhart he thought hed be on his way to having a case may shintaka hadnt been home or she hadnt answered her telephone ken farris had gotten an answering machine and asked her to call him as soon as she could now at full dusk there was a traffic jam just outside the marina safeway hardy remembered it was wednesday the night the marina safeway turned into a meat market the yuppies picking up each other with clever lines about the freshness of the arugula or the relative merits of dried versus handmade pasta his suzuki samurai out of place in the row of beemers and miatas hardy waited in the line of traffic feeling old so much older than when hed been a father the time before he was really running late he ought to call frannie or moses at the shamrock let them know he was on his way or else forget about stopping at the marina what did he expect to find on or around the eloise that wouldnt be there in the morning except that he was already here hed call the shamrock from a pay phone frannie would be with her brother it wouldnt hurt the two of them to kill a little time together alone hed only be a minute or two looking at the boat the light changed and he got through it on the yellow after which it was only two blocks to the marina itself two hundred craft along four long pontoons behind a jetty the land side closed off with an eightfoot fence topped with barbed wire hardy sometimes thought he must have been a sailor in an earlier life he had a visceral reaction to anything nautical he loved to fish to scuba dive to walk sharks trying to will them to life as though he had a special bond with them now the briny scent of the air pumped him up locke and drysdale be damned he felt in his bones he was onto something and he was going to pursue it the guardhouse was set in a manicured square of grass at the entrance to the boat area hardy knocked on the open door and walked in the attendant was about nineteen dressed in a green uniform with a name tag that read tom he stood up at his desk behind a low counter help you to hardys right he could see the boats through the picture window four strings of white christmas lights glittered over the pontoons he showed the boy his das badge which was not issued by the office and not officially condoned hardy had gotten his at a uniform store down the peninsula and knew it could come in handy especially with people who perhaps couldnt read but understood a badge he asked the young man if they kept a log of boat departures we tried that he said but most of the people here like to come and go as they please still we generally have some idea whos out is the eloise here now sure tom looked out the window and pointed shes that low fortyfivefoot cruiser at the end of two in the fading light the sailboat looked beautiful last time she went out was saturday saturday did mr nash take her out tom shrugged i suppose so but i didnt see him she the eloise was out when i came on when was that around noon i work twelve to eight does somebody else come on then after eight no we close up till next morning at six whats all this about is mr nash in some trouble hardy gave him all he really had hes missing itd be helpful to know who saw him last tom bit his cheek thinking i dont think youll have much luck here josé the morning guy said she was already out when he came on at six in the morning tom shrugged wanting to be helpful hardy could tell he was wrestling with something sometimes joséll be a little late he said finally but when that happens he always stays late and makes up the time hardy fought down a shiver of frustration what time did he stay till on saturday tom got a little evasive i dont know exactly three threethirty around there so he wasnt here until seven or seventhirty another shrug i dont know for sure i wasnt here either hardy blew out a breath okay this isnt about josé anyway could i take a look on board the eloise grateful to abandon the discussion on josés tardiness tom bobbed his head sure its pretty slow now anyway on their way out to the boat hardy learned that security wasnt all it could be at the marina though tom had a ring of master keys for the boats and a key for the gate that opened through the fence the reality was that people slipped through with other parties all the time and owners forgot to close the gate behind them or even to lock their boats theft wasnt rampant by any means but neither was it unknown but what could the attendants do tom and josé tried but they had no real authority if the boat owners werent going to follow their own rules whose fault was that up close the eloise was even more impressive than it had looked from the guardhouse with a wide boom hardy thought maybe twelve to fourteen feet it was berthed perpendicular to the main pontoon too big to maneuver into any of the slips technically the boat was a ketch two poles one fore and one aft the steering wheel was sunk into the deck so the aft boom would clear the head of a standing pilot casting off under motor power even at only five knots hardy figured it wouldnt take three minutes on the straight shot to get out beyond the jetty you mind if we go aboard a minute it was already too dark to see much on the deck not that hardy was looking for anything specific tom meanwhile walked forward to the cabin door see this is what i mean hardy came up beside him they leave the door unlocked what are we supposed to do anything get taken maybe you should check it was so easy hardy almost felt guilty but not enough to stop himself from following tom down the ladder into the cabin the boy turned on the lights and stopped no everything looks okay he said hardy thought okay was a bit of an understatement they were in a stateroom that was easily as large as hardys living room a zebra rug graced the polished hardwood floor original art oils in heavy frames hung along the walls there was a black leather sofa and matching loveseat an eames chair or a good copy of one a builtin entertainment center along an entire wall two tvs large speakers vcr tape deck compact disc player being aboard seemed to make tom nervous he fidgeted from foot to foot maybe we better go back up huh doesnt look like anythings gone but hardy was moving forward might as well be sure he said lightly he was at the galley tile floor gas stove fullsize refrigerator a glimpse at the wet bar glenfiddich paradis cognac makers mark bourbon topshelf liquors he heard tom coming up behind him and kept walking forward to where the bulkhead came down a full bathroom far too big to let it go as the head the master bedroom up front was as large as rebeccas new room the queensize bed neatly made two desks one a rolltop an exercycle and some dumbbells more expensive knickknacks this is something hardy said tom stood mutely behind him are there rooms aft hardy ached to open a few drawers in the desks casually he moved to the desk on the beds right and pulled at the top drawer it appeared to have nothing useful paper clips pens standard desk stuff the drawer on top to the side contained what looked like sweat bands hardy reached in and felt around sweatbands nothing here he said lightly as he could closing the drawer then around the bed hoping tom would stay another minute the rolltop was closed up but the front drawer slid open same story nothing hardy pulled the side top drawer i dont know if we should tom said a quick glance down the drawer open a couple of inches inside some maps navigation stuff he pushed it closed with his hip and turned around youre right good point mr agreeable let the police get a warrant hardy turned around and walked quickly back through the galley and stateroom past the steps leading up to the deck past another bathroom off the aft hallway to the first guest bedroom double bed dresser television a floating holiday inn we really should go up tom said from the steps okay hardy casual but determined browsed the route back along the opposite hallway passing through the second room which was mirrored from floor to ceiling and equipped with most of a complete nautilus set a stairclimber more free weights owen nash took his workouts seriously up on the deck tom took a minute to carefully lock the cabin door hardy asked hows a boat like this sail tom locked the door doublechecked it well its not a hot rod its really for deep water could one man handle her they were walking back up the pontoon to the office tom leading oh sure the sails are on power if you need it mr nash went out alone a lot over to the farallons and back its harder in a smaller boat but he liked it whats at the farallons he asked about the small rock islands twenty miles off san franciscos coast i dont know tom said they say thats where the great whites breed you know the sharks maybe he was into them bad pun hardy thought they were at the purple yet wah out in the avenues on clement moses mcguire was sucking on a crab claw black bean sauce he said i believe with black bean sauce on dungeness crab we have reached the apex of modern civilization frannie was glaring at hardy who was looking down at his plate i hate it when you guys fight moses said here i am talking about cultural issues without which we would all soon be savages and why dont you tell your friend dismas that we had an understanding about telephones and being late she stood up and threw down her napkin excuse me im going to the bathroom hardy picked up his chopsticks i think ive already said i was sorry four times now five im sorry six sorry sorry sorry sorry hardy put down his chopsticks ten dont tell me moses said she thought you were dead she always thinks im dead or going to die there is some justification there there is no justification at all i have not come close to dying being late doesnt mean youve necessarily died moses rubbed his crab claw around in the sauce it did for eddie he held up his hand stopping hardys response uh uh uh heres an area where we could increase our sensitivity moses you could have called phones are nearly ubiquitous in our society mcguire was the majority owner in the shamrock bar but he also had a phd in philosophy from cal berkeley you too huh shes my sister im allowed to be on her side from time to time i was working on a case im a lawyer now remember i wasnt out running around with loose women i wasnt narrowly avoiding death i was working you had an appointment with me and frannie a simple oneminute phone call and all would have been well okay all right next time ill call big deal frannies worried its going to start happening all the time as you say youre a lawyer now well thats the way lawyers are lawyers arent any one way moses stabbed the last pot sticker and popped it into his mouth excuse the generalization but yes they are frannie wants you to be a daddy not to work all the time thats why the job looked so good remember regular hours interesting work i can hear your words in my memory even as we speak how late was i moses chewed one hour and fortyfive minutes which is plenty of time to work up a good head of worry its not frannies fault she worries she loves you diz shes carrying your baby its pretty natural dont you think well i love her too i am sure you do well well moses repeated there you are their white frame house was bracketed by two apartment buildings back in the mids hardy had been offered a sinful amount of money to sell to a developer so that a third fivestory anonymous unit could rise where now his sixtyfootdeep green lawn was bisected by a stone walkway a low picket fence and a doll house with a small front porch and a bay window before their marriage they had talked about moving starting over with a place they could equally call their own the problem was that although the house had been hardys for a decade frannie already loved it one of hardys first actions after the wedding was to transfer half the title to frannies name they didnt have a prenuptial agreement frannies quartermilliondollar insurance policy was both of theirs hardy figured the house put them on relatively equal footing street parking was often a problem with no garage driveway or back alley you either got your spot by six oclock or you had to walk now at tenfifteen they couldnt find a space within three blocks it was a mild still night with no fog and they strolled east on clement under the trees of lincoln park back toward their house frannie leaned into her husband her arm around his waist pinch me she said i know hardy tightened his arm across her shoulders would you have thought this i guess so its why i thought we ought to be married but still she stopped hardy took the cue and leaned over and kissed her what is it frannie asked nothing a little shiver how often do you notice when everything is perfect its a little scary i used to believe thats when things were most likely to go wrong i think thats why i was so upset tonight im just getting so i can accept that all this is happening that its not some dream im going to wake up from she looked up into hardys face and pulled herself close against him i dont want to wake up from this she said i want this to keep going on its going to frannie im not going to let anything get in the way of this promise frannie nudged him with her hip lets get home they paid the sitter looked in on the slumbering baby hardy fed his fish while frannie got ready for bed in his office his answering machine had calls from jane and from pico morales both of whom he could call in the morning he could hear the shower running in their bathroom he picked up his telephone and hit the numbers hed memorized earlier that night may shinns the phone rang four times then picked up just leave a number please and ill get right back to you that was the whole message no trace of a japanese accent a deep cultured voice hardy hung up after the beep his desk was cleared the greenshaded bankers lamp threw a soft pool of light around the room the dried blowfish pouted on the mantel of the office fireplace absently hardy crossed from the desk to the mantel straightened out the pipe rack unused for over a year and grabbed three darts from the bullseye of the dartboard where hed left them back at the line near his desk he began throwing his dart game was off in his first round none of the three darts landed in the where he was aiming a year before that couldnt have happened if anyone had asked him he would have said he was semiserious about darts he still carried his custom set of twentygram tungstens with him every day in his suit jackets inside pocket but the reality was that new priorities had taken over as he retrieved his first round he heard the water shut off in the bathroom he was back at the line near his desk now there you go then frannie was in the doorway barefoot wearing the purple silk babydolls hardy had bought her for christmas the ones she hadnt been able to wear until after rebecca was born a tiny dark spot marked where a drop of her milk had leaked from her nipple hardy crossed to her went to his knees and lifted the hem of the pyjamas burying his face against her financier missing in mystery hand case by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer the case of the mystery hand found sunday in the stomach of a great white shark at the steinhart aquarium took on a new dimension today as bay area financier owen nash was reported missing by ken farris counsel and chief operating officer of owen industries of south san francisco mr farris reported that nash was last seen thursday evening by members of his personal staff at his mansion in seacliff on friday mr nash failed to appear at a luncheon appointment on saturday nash reportedly was scheduled to go sailing with may shinn a friend neither nash or shinn has been heard from since then although nashs sailboat the eloise remains at its berth in the marina it is unclear at this writing whether or not the boat was taken out over the weekend the police will not speculate on the possibility of foul play although yesterday a representative of the district attorneys office gave strong credence to that possibility farris reported that nashs life had been threatened half a dozen times in the past five years over his mostly hostile takeover efforts of several silicon valley companies strengthening the bond between nash and the mystery hand is the fact that nash was a black belt in karate the hand has several unusual characteristics that can be associated with karate among them calcium deposits and a somewhat overdeveloped heel or pad at the side of the hand san francisco coroner john strout however had no comment on the likelihood of the hand being that of owen nash and dismissed any possible identification at this time as decidedly premature the boy bushwacked me farris said he was waiting at my houseboat when i got home had already charmed the skirts off of my betty hardy in his office at home was beginning to admire jeff elliots spunk the reporter was nobodys little lost boy hardy had thought hed scared him into some controllable space yesterday but evidently hed read that wrong hardy wasnt going to get jeff elliot off his story it didnt look like anybody was you never told me about the death threats i never took them seriously anyway people say things when they lose negotiations you know but you thought enough to mention them to jeff not really hardy heard a rustling noise ive got the paper here in front of me and i must admit it reads pretty dramatically but all i did was answer a straight question had anybody ever threatened owen i said sure half a dozen times but it wasnt anything at least until i saw it here in print you dont think it could be related i guess anythings possible but as i said this was all settled a long time ago i think the last man who got bitter owen took him and his wife to hawaii for a couple of weeks wined and dined them bought her a mercedes made him president of some division somewhere the man made out like a bandit course owen made out better who was that it wasnt any real threat ive told owen i was gonna kill him twenty times myself and half those times i meant it okay but if mr nash turns up dead somebodys going to want that name i still pray to god hes not dead hardy sat still a moment drumming his fingers on his desk trying to decide whether or not to tell farris what he knew hell the man had been forthcoming with him he said the eloise did go out on saturday he told him about his visit to the marina his tour of the boat but if the boat went out and now is back and the hand is owens those are big ifs but you see what that means it means may no may or someone else maybe not may at all or may and some third party farris was collecting himself youre right a boat like that its not unknown to get used once for drugs then abandoned drugs its more common in florida or down south in san diego but its happened here smugglers board the ship kill whoevers on it throw them overboard load up their cargo deliver it dump the boat back at its own slip im not saying its likely but the boat being back doesnt say much about anything ive got to find may farris said why dont you go by where she lives i dont know where she lives owen never told me that getting her phone number was a major concession how about if they just ran away like you were saying he might have done yesterday except that it was owen and may together not just him i hate to think were down to that why well i really think the running off its something owens outgrown i just dont see him doing that anymore if anything he was more settled less spontaneous since hes been with may she really calmed him down i mean for owen he seemed relatively at peace for the first time in his life since eloise anyway besides theyve gone away together before and told nobody except me but he did tell me and this time he didnt nothing hardy looked up as frannie walked by the door to his office holding rebecca singing quietly to her he missed farriss next sentence im sorry what was that i said its getting more unlikely every day anyhow hows that well im owens executor and ive also got power of attorney its thursday now and nobodys seen him in a week if he ran away even with may hed need money right and he never carried much cash so hed use a credit card and youd have found out about that right i checked all his accounts this morning so far theres been no activity hardy wished he could say something about not giving up hope until they had some more information something definite farris cut that thought off hes dead isnt he the answer to that a line from a comedy routine of the old nowdefunct committee a north beach comedy troupe was deader than hell bob hardy wasnt even tempted officer patrick resden was never going to make inspector he was never going to make sergeant he was fiftyone years old a big wheezy friendly dog of a cop who was twenty years on the same beat resden had taken the sergeants exam five times in the early s hardy had helped glitsky study for the sergeants exam around the same time but after a review of the first few chapters of the prep book those study sessions had become the boys night out jane and flo respectively staying home while their husbands improved their minds and careers what they had really improved was their tolerance for alcohol they knew theyd drunk enough on any given night when a question in the prep book any question stumped them hardy had known plant life and definitely some of his fish that were smart enough to pass the sergeants exam on the second try and resden had flunked the thing five times but this did not mean he didnt have a place on the police force he could follow simple instructions he did not abuse his gun or his badge resden was a good beat cop his heart was in the right place and he had a lot of experience helping people out pulling kittens out of trees busting neighborhood bullies one of whom the defendant in this case was named jesus samosa it seemed that about two months ago officer resden had had occasion to reprimand samosa when he caught him about to spraypaint a sidewalk in front of the mission street bart station instead of getting a hardon for him resden had simply confiscated the can of paint and let the boy go he was only eighteen with a warning two days later in the street in front of the same bart station samosa failed to stop at the sign on mission his maroon chevy got pulled over and resden was the citing officer this time resden gave samosa a ticket this was evidently very funny to the passengers in the chevy but again resden simply warned everyone and let them go their way now it turned out that jesus samosa worked at the doggie diner three blocks from the bart station about a week after the stopsign incident resden and his partner felice wong decided to take their lunch at this same doggie diner resden ordered his usual couple of double burgers double cheese a special order felice was grabbing some napkins with a clear view of the grill area when jesus to the delight of his broiler mate spit into the bun that he then placed on top of one of the double burgers felice drew her gun walked behind the counter confiscated the burger for lab analysis and bagged jesus samosa on the spot now this defendant hardy thought this guy is going down hardy gave a moments thought to ordering an hiv test if the guy tested positive they might be able to charge him with attempted murder on reflection though that might be a little extreme even if an elizabeth pullios might go for it as it was they had jesus on a couple of health and safetycode violations misdemeanor aggravated assault profane language and resisting arrest the maximum penalty if he got everything was fortyfive days in the county jail and fines totaling if the defendants attorney wanted to bargain hardy figured he would be a sport and knock the fines down to an even three grand after hed talked to ken farris hardy had taken his yellow legal pad from his top drawer and wrote notes on everything he could remember relating to owen nash it took him almost twenty minutes filling two pages he then called art drysdale at his home making it clear that he had taken no part in supplying jeff elliot with any information used in the chronicle story but just between you and me art my bones tell me the victim is owen nash and if may shinn is still alive we may be looking at my murder case once again drysdale counseled hardy to cool his jets and wait for the police investigation to catch up hardy replied that of course he would do that he dialed jane but she hadnt been home either out working early or spending the night in a strange place well hardy didnt know that and it was none of his business anyway hed left a message the morning light in hardys office at the hall of justice was especially flattering to elizabeth pullios she wore a blue leather miniskirt far enough down her leg by about an inch to still be professional if the term were loosely applied with a tailored robinsegg mans shirt made less conservative by the threebutton gap at the top a raisinsized ruby on a thin gold chain hung to where her cleavage began her chestnut hair was loosely tied at the back of her neck she knocked demurely at hardys door good work she said he invited her in and she closed the door behind her what is she placed her rear end on the corner of hardys desk and pushed herself back so she could sit back with her legs crossed showing and showing hardy pushed his chair back almost to the window put his own feet up on the desk crossed his hands behind his head and leaned against the glass what is he repeated the chronicle thing keeping it alive believe it or not that wasnt me but then he realized that it had in fact been him who had sent elliot on the mission that took him to missing persons not completely anyway she waved him off well whatever its still on the burner who killed him hardy spent a couple of minutes on owen nash farris may shinn the silicon valley connection the bottom line though is that we dont have an identified victim yet so theres nowhere to go i think were going to need a body well she leaned toward hardy both palms resting flat on hardys desk the ruby swinging out from the gap in her shirt not necessarily you remember the billionaire boys club case down in la they never found the body in that one and youve got part of a body get some good pathologist hardy laughed whoa i dont think were there yet what about the ring pullios shrugged mercifully straightening up the rings a detail maybe his friend farris was wrong or lying maybe nash only wore it sailing who knows hardy put his feet down and stood up thats just it if nobody knows she shook her head dismas this is too good youve got to grab these when they come around which believe me isnt often megarich victim corporate intrigue the papers already on it this could make a career hardy remained casual motioned to his stack of folders i think until i clear some of these my career is on hold she slid off the desk adjusting her skirt which entailed leaning over again if body language talked hardy thought this woman was yelling from the rooftops he didnt get it well its your decision she said it was that rare san francisco treasure a truly warm day hardy had decided to walk down to fifth and mission without calling first he wanted to be outside and going to see jeff elliot was an excuse more than anything else jane had reached hardy during the morning and the two of them were having lunch at noon at il fornaio hardy reasoned he could pass a pleasant hour until then putting in some nonbillable time now he stood in bright sunlight on the steps outside the chronicle building jeff elliot hadnt been at his desk and the guy who sat next to him told hardy he thought jeff had said something about going down to the marina and did hardy want to leave a message he did walking down howard toward the ferry building and the bay hands in his pockets and tie loosened hardy drank in the smells of truck fumes and pork bao of tar and roasting coffee whenever he passed an alley about every half block the heavy odors of urine and garbage would overlay the city smell but even these were in their own way mnemonic and pleasant paris when he was in college saigon later he found himself whistling marveling at the new skyline with the embarcadero torn down after the big one the world series quake he decided to keep walking along the waterfront gulls sat on guanostained pilings occasionally lifting off with a squawk three or four of the docks were unfenced and a few orientals squatted fishing with long poles the sausalito ferry came in with a deafening honk of its horn spewing out a carefree river of tourists hardy went with the current letting it carry him inland with the flow he turned uptown noticed the time and hailed a cab to take him the last ten blocks jane was in a banquette in the dining area behind the bar there was a tulip glass of champagne on the table in front of her she had cut her dark hair very short but jane always managed to look good as a buyer for i magnin she always hovered at or near the top of haute couture six weeks ahead of everybody else he leaned over and kissed her cheek ivoire de balmain he said it was the perfume hed always bought her on christmas he didnt think it was a coincidence she was wearing it now you have a good nose she kissed him again quickly on the lips its good to see you it is he admitted he ordered a club soda and found out jane was seeing a younger man an architect named chuck chuck chuck bobuck bonanobano bofu dismas she put a shushing finger to his lips ive always wanted to do that he said im sure you have she gave him an amused look hes a wonderful guy im sure he is its a wonderful song too you cant do it to dismas you know dismas dismas bobismas it just doesnt scan the club soda arrived club soda is a change jane said hardy sipped change is my life right now if i have my old usual couple of beers for lunch you can forget about the afternoon i tried it a few times bad idea she sipped her champagne so youre really back at prosecuting i am and you like it he lifted his shoulders sometimes its more bs than i remember but its all right they waded through another five minutes of small talk before they ordered calamari for hardy quattro formaggio calzone for jane hardy broke down and decided to have some wine so he and jane ordered a half bottle of pinot grigio when the waiter had gone hardy said so youve seen your dad she nodded you were right theres definitely something thats what i thought frannie says its a woman jane took that in sipped at her champagne why did she say that hardy told jane about the jade paperweight how andy had demanded he take it frannie said seeing it every day reminded him of his broken heart so he had to give it away he held up a hand her words shes more melodramatic than i am i also think shes right did he say that he didnt deny it i asked him point blank if he was all right if something was bothering him and whatd he say he said hed just become more aware of mortality lately that nothing lasts forever this is not exactly headline stuff jane i know it just seemed evasive the way daddys always been about his personal life so i asked if something specific had triggered all those feelings you know he said a friend of his had died and he just had to accept it i asked who and he said i didnt know him it didnt matter he said you didnt know him she shook her head but i dont think he meant that meant it was a man it occurred to hardy that impossible as it might seem andy fowler could be gay in san francisco you never knew but if thats what he said no there was a pause before he said that something anyway then he patted my hand and thanked me for being concerned but that he could work all this out himself he was a big boy the food came the wine ritual hardy dipped some fresh bread in a little bowl of olive oil on the table jane cut into her calzone and let the steam escape what i think she said is it might have been someone hes ashamed of being involved with maybe the wife of one of his friends something like that and she broke it off either that or he couldnt go on with it anymore cant you just hear one of them saying it well just pretend the other one died i can imagine daddy taking that tack yeah that flies its a problem when youve always been perfect you cant even let your daughter see anything else even when i told him that whatever it was id still love him you told him that of course i would no not that you would you told him you suspected it was something he might be ashamed of not in so many words hardy was thinking andy fowler didnt need so many words he was a subtle and intelligent man accustomed to dealing with nuance every day on the bench he could imagine janes forthright approach scaring him off driving him back further within himself if thats where he was hardy chewed on the delicious bread filled his mouth with wine and sloshed it around well whatever it is you think we can do anything to help him out he talked about a vacation jane half smiled sure daddys idea of a vacation is not bringing work home for the weekend you know any women he might like but she tossed the idea away no i can hardly see daddy allowing himself to be set up maybe its what he says awareness of mortality that can stop you jane scratched at the tablecloth with a perfect coral fingernail she and hardy didnt need reminders of the lessons of mortality every time she thought of their son michael whod died in a crib accident ten years before it stopped her again as it had stopped her life and hardys back then a tear came from one eye and she turned away seeing it or simply knowing he reached over and covered her hand lets leave it for now jane come back to it later he said well think of something he missed the stud the first time and figured it must have been the wine after lunch hed stopped at a sporting goods store on market and picked up the dart board hed promised himself back at his office hed banged on the wall opposite his desk listening for the hollow sound to give way to solid wood locating the stud or thinking he had the first stroke of the hammer drove the nail through drywall clear up to its head hardy was a good carpenter wood was one of his hobbies it wasnt like him to miss a stud he banged on the wall thought hed found the stud again and this time was right measuring off eight feet with a ruler from his desk he put some tape down on the floor just under where his chair would normally be then he moved the chair back up took out his leather case and fitted the blue flights onto the shafts of his darts he stood up at his tape line and threw two bullseyes and a leaving the darts in place he picked up his phone judge fowler had called in sick that was odd judges never called in sick their dockets were too full a sick day inconvenienced too many people hardy tried his home but no one was there either not even an answering machine he was tempted to call jane again but why worry her maybe andy was simply taking a mentalhealth day god knew he worked hard enough to deserve it maybe after seeing jane last night hed gotten drunk again and was hung over in any case if andy fowler wanted to take a day off hardy would not disturb him he looked at the stilllarge pile of case folders on the corner of his desk wondering what unknown thrills lay in store for him in that mountain of paper he considered going around to his darts and throwing a solo game of to keep his eye up he wondered if jeff elliot was back from the marina or wherever hed gone he should call frannie and see how rebecca was doing anything he thought but it wasnt a big enough room to pace in he pulled his chair up to the desk and sat down feeling lethargic and heavy the wine blame it on the wine elizabeth pullios was still wearing the gold chain with the ruby but that was all she was wearing christopher locke the district attorney was lying with his hands crossed behind his head he had a barrel chest covered with curls of black hair his stomach was beginning to bulge but it was a hard bulge he had a pretty good body for an older guy she thought and as long as he let her be on top his mobility wasnt much of an issue she could control things which was how she liked it she moved forward a little adjusting her position the da moaned with pleasure his black broadfeatured face broke into a grin my dont we look smug pullios said she tightened herself a little around him and he closed his eyes with the feel of it i feel smug locke said come down here she leaned down over him he took one breast in each hand and pulled her face up to his she took his tongue into her mouth and bit down on it gently then pulled away you are such a bitch he said still smiling she moved her hips again he tried to come up to meet her face but her hands were on his shoulders forcing him down grinning at him i know and you love it she came down and licked the bottom of his ear staying there beginning to rock rhythmically god pullios she pulled away halfway up her face now was set she had found her angle concentrating her hands cupped his head tighter he rose to meet her feeling it build not yet not yet she was breathing hard her teeth clenched okay okay she pounded down against him now straightening up arching her head thrown back now now now grinding down into him as he let himself go collapsing against his big chest a low chuckle escaping from deep in her throat turning south on highway hardy was thinking that fate could be a beautiful thing the dunes with their sedge grasses obscured the view of the ocean but with the top down on the suzuki hardy could hear and smell it the afternoon now well along was still warm dwarf cypresses on the east side of the road attested to the nearconstant wind off the ocean the evergreen branches flattened where they faced the beach as though giants walked the land stomping them to one side where the highway turned inland at fort funston near the olympic club golf course hanggliders filled the sky even on a windless cloudless day thermals up the cliffs at the shoreline provided decent lift hardy thought he might like to get into hanggliding sometime take the wife and kids soar the fate that had saved him from his files had come in the guise of a call from abe glitsky whod been called down to pacifica to view a body that had washed ashore calls from the sfpd to other local jurisdictions over the past few days had gotten the word out and when the call came in abe had been in the office and volunteered to go down and have a look hed called hardy from his squawk box patched in the turnoff was just north of devils slide a twomile stretch of highway where the curving roadways shoulder disappeared at the edge of a threehundredfoot cliff most of the time the area was shrouded in fog and it was the rare year that didnt see another verification of the fact that automobiles could not fly hardy wound back on a rutted and unpaved roadway toward the city glitskys car was parked in the dirt area at the bottom along with a couple of pacifica police cars as hardy was getting out of his car an ambulance appeared on the road hed just used the tide was out getting on four oclock there was still no wind at all no fog maybe hardy thought were going to have our three days of summer he nodded to the ambulance guys but was too anxious to wait for them crossing the soft sand he got to harder ground and broke into a trot the officials were knotted around a still green form about twenty yards from the line of surf hardy nodded to glitsky who introduced him around heres your victim he said the body lay covered with a tarp on its back hardy asked permission to look and one of the pacifica cops said go ahead he pulled the tarp away and involuntarily stepped back sand flies buzzed around the halfopen mouth the nose the empty eye sockets the thinning head of gray hair hardy was momentarily startled by the fact that the body wore jogging sweats identical to the pair he owned except that the bodys green sweatsuit had a large crescentshaped tear in the right torso there was also a ragged break in the lower left leg with flesh showing beneath it two small clean holes one in the chest and one just over the crotch spoke for themselves forcing himself to take it all in hardy noticed the wedding band on the left hand but by far the most arresting detail was the end of the right arm a jagged and torn mess of tendon bone and sickly greenish white flesh hardy knew what had happened to the hand the ambulance men had made their way across the beach with a stretcher hardy stepped away and let them move in you get an id he asked glitsky glitsky had a scar that ran through his lips top to bottom when he got thoughtful or tense it seemed sometimes to almost glow white in his dark face it was glowing now he wasnt saying anything looks about the right age for owen nash hardy said glitsky nodded still thinking looking off into the horizon thats why youre here he said shot twice hardy asked glitsky nodded again before the sharks got him small caliber one exit wound out of two like a dog shaking off water he came back to where they were once in the heart and whoever it was tried to shoot his dick off he thought another moment probably not in that order hardy felt his balls tighten suddenly glitsky spoke to the ambulance attendants who had opened the stretcher and were preparing to lift the body excuse me a minute he went over to the body got down on one knee and picked up the left hand im going to take off this ring he told the pacifica cops he looked at it briefly showed it to them then brought it over to hardy you see anything he asked it was a plain gold band on the flat inside surface there was a tiny stamp in the gold that said iok nothing else at first glance hardy faced away from the sun and held the ring up to catch the light turning it slowly here you go he said he brought it closer to his face worn down flush to the gold invisible except at one angle hardy could make out some initials en and some numbers something looks like fiftyone what was nashs wifes name hardy remembered mostly because of the boat eloise and fiftyone sounds like a wedding date doesnt it glitsky uttered an insincere absolutely brilliant and held out his hand hardy dropped the ring in it he put the ring in a ziploc evidence bag and stuck it in his pocket so i can either check the prints have strout do some dna testing this month at a cost of ten grand or call his attorney again how do you vote the body was on the stretcher and the ambulance attendants began carrying it over the beach hardy glitsky and the other men fell into a rough line behind them and the caravan trudged over the sand nobody said a word the eloise was out all day saturday jeff elliot was excited i knew that hardy said he was at home talking on the kitchen extension he lived fifteen blocks from the beach just north of geary and hed seen no point in going downtown for ten minutes so that he could turn around and drive back home twenty minutes after leaving devils slide he was cutting up some onions in his kitchen when the spaghetti sauce was made bubbling on the stove he opened himself a beer and called jeff elliot i thought you were keeping me up on the breaks in the case elliot said if you knew the boat had gone out we didnt even know it was owen nash so what difference could his boat make in fact i would tend to agree with our good dr strout hardy drawled that yo conclusions were desahdedly prematuah all we knew was that a man was missing and the hand might show that it was used in karate thats a long stretch for hard news there was silence on the other end then you got something dont you turns out hardy said laconically odds on you were right he told him about the body which was on its way or had just arrived at the morgue the hand bitten off and where the shots had gone he was shot somebody killed him you mean hardy thought of where glitsky thought the first bullet had gone he felt he could rule out suicide yeah he said somebody killed him god thats great elliot nearly shouted that is just great the guys dead hardy reminded him he took a sip of his beer thats not so great the story i meant the story i know what you meant listen if youve got a file picture on nash you might bring it down with you remove any doubt in case no ones identified him yet good idea oh and jeff if mr farris or celine nash owens daughter is down at the morgue try to rein in the enthusiasm a little would you i dont think theyre going to be as happy about it as you are no i understand that of course hardy rang off of course he said it was going to the front page in tomorrows edition jeffs first frontpage story not the main headline but lower right three columns his byline not too shabby not only that but the lead graphs had already gone out on the wire that night and jeff had received a followup call from the la times ladida and from drew bates over at krontv who wondered if he jeff had anything more to give out on the owen nash murder imagine tv coming to him the la timesl he had left his forwarding number at night reception and now sat in the bowels of the building where he worked checking the nexis listing on owen nash it was ninethirty at night and hed been up since six but he felt completely fresh parker whitelaw his editor christ the editor said hed give him a sidebar on nash theyd run with the pickup on the back page of the first section but he had to have it done by eleventhirty did jeff think he could do it jeff thought for a lead story and a sidebar he could stand on his head and spit nickels dance with nureyev run a tenflat hundred he looked at the mute reminder his crutches leaning on his right against the table well the hell with them he could get this done he had the raw data now it was just putting it together piece of cake though there was more than he would have thought and he had to get it down to three hundred words maximum well hit the high spots jeff had started the nexis search at quarter to seven after getting back from the morgue almost three hours close to two hundred articles some merely a mention at a society event a few substantial interviews a cover story in in business week owen nash from the evidence here had been a very major player hed been mentioned in one us publication or another on an average of once every six weeks or so for what seemed like the past twenty years jeff looked away from the orangetinted screen he was having a problem reconciling the owen nash in these articles to the body hed witnessed at the morgue hed gotten there as a limo had been pulling up ken farris and his wife had recognized him immediately from the previous night and while they didnt seem all that happy to see jeff they were also too distracted to make any real objection when the hawkfaced black inspector with the scar through his lips admitted them the other woman in the limo was celine nash owens daughter she was much older than jeff probably near forty but something about her even in grief made him react he didnt know if it was posture attitude or the shape of her but he couldnt take his eyes off her stupid really a cripple like him stood no chance with most women much less a beauty of her class and caliber if that powerful a sexual draw could be called beauty but he thought there couldnt be any harm in letting it wash over him until of course they saw owen nash at the sight of him everything else vanished the assistant coroner had pulled back enough of the sheet to show the face and there was no question of identification celine sobbed once farris hung his head and pulled his wife closer to him the inspector glitsky had asked the formal question and the assistant was pushing the body back when celine told him to stop she wanted to see her father one last time nobody moved the assistant coroner looked at glitsky who nodded and the sheet came off revealing owen nash naked and blue on the gurney first of course was the hand or the lack of hand the ragged stump without any cauterizing or sutures one pink tendon extending two inches beyond the rest jeff had seen pictures of the damage a shark bite could do to for example a surfboard but he found that it did not prepare him for the sight of nashs ribs opened by the slashing teeth the wedge taken out of his lower leg celine walked up to the body her eyes he noticed were dry in spite of the sob perhaps they glistened with shock the coroners assistant made a motion to come and steady her but something in her bearing stopped him the room became for an instant as silent and colorless as an old blackandwhite snapshot all the life not just owens leached out by the tension celine put a hand on the bodys chest another on the thigh it might have only been five seconds but it seemed she stood there forever unmoving taking it in now a tear did fall she leaned over and placed her lips against the center of his stomach suddenly it was over she nodded at the inspector then turned around and walked past them all to the door and on out without looking back in the lobby ken and betty thanked glitsky celine was already in the limo the evening light was startling jeff remembered walking out of matinees as a child how the saturdayafternoon light after the dark theater was so jarring so unexpected hed felt that way squinting against the setting sun he knew he should have asked someone more questions the assistant glitsky ken or betty but hed been too shaken by the time he recovered the limo had driven off glitsky had gone into the hall of justice he couldnt bring himself to go back into the morgue he shook himself pulling out of the memory the orange screen still hummed in front of him he looked at his watch and saw that hed wasted twenty minutes he had to get down to work there was first the business side in owen had borrowed from a gi loan program and put a down payment on a nearbankrupt television repair shop in south san francisco he began tinkering with used parts and within two years had perfected and patented an improved insulation technique for the hot tubes of early tv general electric picked it up and owen was on his way he diddled with vacuum tubes invested in copper wiring got into simple components before the microchip came along by the time silicon valley exploded he was ready for it shares of owen industries inc were trading on the new york exchange for a share and nash himself had controlled eight hundred thousand shares when he took the corporation public in figuring three or four stock splits minimum nashs personal worth on stocks alone at the time of the business week cover story was close to million his other assets were also substantial besides the eloise and his seacliff mansion he owned a house and more than a thousand acres of land in new mexico piedaterres in hong kong and tokyo a condominium in new york according to business week he also held part or controlling interest in three hotels ski resorts in lake tahoe and utah a restaurant on st barts in the caribbean his one failure as of five years ago had been an airline the waikiki express which had made two round trips daily between oahu and los angeles for sixteen months before it went bankrupt but the man hadnt spent all his time in boardrooms the first mention of owen nash in any publication had nothing to do with business in he was the first nonoriental to break more than six oneinch pine boards on top of one another in a sanctioned karate exhibition jeff was tempted to get up from his chair and see if archives had the picture referenced in the display but decided against it time was getting short in nashs house in burlingame had burned to the ground he managed to rescue his sixyearold daughter celine but had nearly died himself trying to get back inside to pull his wife eloise to safety after his wifes death he bought his first sailboat and took it around the world accompanied only by celine the papers picked up on the rugged outdoorsman life now for a year in the s he held the alltackle world record for a black marlin hed taken off the australian barrier reef as recently as last year he and celine and a crew of three college kids had sailed a rented ketch to runnerup in the newportcabo san lucas race his forays into biggame hunting stirred more and more controversy over the years jeff elliot thought the change of tone of the articles was interesting when nash bagged a polar bear in he was a mans man featured in field stream by taking a zebra in the congo got him onto the sierra clubs publicenemy list he didnt give a good goddamn forbes ten ceos comment on image sept about the public he was one of the only western industrialists to attend the coronation of bokassa the shah of iran reportedly stayed aboard the eloise in the caribbean while the us government was deciding how to handle him after he was deposed nash appalled the chronicle reporter covering his trip to china in by feasting with his hosts on the brains of monkeys who were brought live to the table he made whos who for the first time in he never remarried i wish i made more money pico morales said i wish i had more money anybody else they would have more money his wife angela put her hand over his english isnt even his first language she said but he sure can conjugate the dickens out of to have money they were in the hardys dining room sitting around the cherry table after the spaghetti and a jug of red wine frannie had brought out an apple pie and pico had put away half of it he is a man of many talents hardy said is there anything special about today and money frannie asked see thats what i mean pico had a knife in his hand and was reaching again for the pie we dont think i dont think like a rich person i think its genetic he thought sharks dying was genetic too hardy said no that was lack of family structure what would you do if you had money angela asked besides maybe eat more pico had no guilt about his size he patted his stomach and smiled at his wife what i would do given this news tonight about owen nash that the rest of the world doesnt know yet is go out and invest everything i owned in stock in his company hardy shook his head that stock is going to dive peek i know so you sell short make a shortterm bundle buy back in how do you know when its going to turn around so you buy back at the right time frannie asked you dont for sure pico said but thats the nature of stocks either that hon or they go the other way tomorrow and take off because nash was mismanaging his company and now they can fly then you lose everything angela patted his hand again like every other time we have had hot tips on the stock market have another piece of pie im interested in what you meant when you said anybody else would have had more money when hardy had pushed his chair onto its back legs and was leaning into them thumbs hooked in his front pockets today the last few days we should already have an agent be cooking up a book deal movie rights something were the ones who found the hand we should be famous by now fames an elusive thing hardy admitted okay laugh at me pico consoled himself with a mouthful of pie but you wait somebodys going to make a fortune off this somehow and then where will we be well be right here frannie said im kind of immobilized for a while anyway dont you like where you are peek i mean curator of the steinhart aquarium is not exactly an entrylevel position i just feel like were all missing an opportunity here probably hardy said angela agreed so did frannie pico ate some more pie may shinns apartment was on hyde directly across the street from a boutique french deli the cablecar tracks passed under the window but this time of night the cars werent running there was hardwood in the foyer an immediate sense of almost ascetic order a hint of sandalwood the streetlights outside threw into gauzy relief the one room where she sat in front of her corner shrine across the room from a low couch with a modern end table and a coffee table hardwood glistened around the sides of the throw rug along one wall was a high cabinet thin and elegant lines glass fronted another wall held japanese prints above a low chair and a futon the entranceway itself was an eightfoot circle older san francisco apartments often had turrets alcoves arches and moldings that no modern unit could afford another rug two feet wide was in the center of the circle a handcarved cherry bench the wood warm highly polished but not overlacquered hugged the side close to ten feet long it was built to the curve of the wall apparently and impossibly seamless it would cost a fortune and thats if you knew the artist if he could get the matched cherry if there was the time the wall in the foyer had an ivory ricepaper finish three john lennon lithographs which didnt look like prints hung at viewers height the light itself came in fivetrack beams from a central point overhead three of the beams were directed at the lennons the other two at ancient japanese woodcuts on either side of the door leading to the kitchen there was another longish block of cherry with a slight ridge down its middle on the floor by the open entrance to the living room may had bathed after forcing herself to eat some rice with cold fish left over from friday night she had combed back her long black hair and pinned it then sat on her hard low platform bed for a long while still undressed unaware of times passing when it was dark she began picking out what she would take with her not much two suitcases perhaps she had to decide would too little cause someone to notice what did business people take on a trip to japan on the other hand she didnt want to tip her hand that she was not coming back by taking too much she walked around the apartment taking things down then putting them back up unable to decide everything was expensive hard to replace precious to her shed designed her living space that way she went to her shrine and lit a candle it was not a shrine to any god particularly just a raised block of polished cherry with a pillow in front of it there was a white candle a soapstone incense burner a knife and tonight a plain white piece of bond paper five by seven inches with a mans scrawl on one side of it she had gotten out the piece of paper after reading the chronicle article about owen nash that mentioned her already tying her to him the paper was a further tie a handwritten addendum to owens will leaving million to may shintaka she didnt know if it was legal or not it was dated a month ago may and was written in ink and signed owen had told her thats all she needed maybe ill die on the way home hed told her before i get the wheel to get it done right this way even if its disputed after taxes you ought to get at least half a million shed told him she didnt want it and hed laughed his big laugh and said thats what was so great about it he knew she didnt want it but hed folded it once and put it in her jewelry box every time he came by he checked to make sure it was still there she wondered if he had told ken farris the mysterious wheel about it sometimes she wondered if the wheel really existed but there he was in the chronicle article today she wondered why owen had never had them meet no she didnt she knew why it came with her profession you didnt meet friends of your clients in fact what you did together couldnt survive outside of its strict boundaries although owen had promised her it could but it never had and now could she go and present this little scribbling to the wheel owens financial protector he would laugh at her or worse perhaps she would do it later but later might be too late all the money might be gone and none left for her but she had never expected the money had never wanted to believe any of owens promises hed even told her in other contexts a promise is just a tool shinn you need to promise something you promise later you need to not remember your promise you dont remember hed said that before hed changed of course before something had really happened between them and yet it broke her heart that heart shed hardened and decided to keep to herself forever she was kneeling back on the pillow and a tear fell and landed on her polished thigh should she pick up the knife should she burn the piece of paper what could she take with her to japan and where would she stay when she got there part ii elizabeth pullios found out about it first in jeff elliots chronicle story owen nash was a righteous homicide and probably she thought a murder also its position there on the front page changed her opinion about the case while dismas hardy was stirring up the kettle she had been all for him it never hurt for a rookie to get some heavy trial experience and there were only a few ways a new person ever got to try a homicide one was getting what they called a skull case an old murder with some new evidence another way was when one of the regulars like pullios herself would hand off a slamdunk conviction to one of the rising stars leaving herself time to try a more challenging case once in a while one of the regulars would go on vacation and everyone else would be full up so a case would fall to the next level but that was about it she had thought that hardys interest in the mystery hand fell more or less under the umbrella of skull cases interesting stuff maybe but not grist for her there were four and only four homicide assistant district attorneys in the city and county of san francisco none of these people would hand off a publicity case if hardy had hit the jackpot pullios felt as though hed done it by playing what was rightfully her dollar she dressed in her red power suit and sauntered into the homicide detail on the fourth floor at sevenfortyfive on friday morning no one sat at the outside desk and she walked through into the open area for the inspectors desks all twelve of them the lieutenants office was closed up dark inside over by the windows martin branstetter was doing some paperwork carl griffin and jerry block were having coffee and some donuts at griffins desk talking sports hi guys all the homicide cops liked pullios they liked her because when they went to the trouble to arrest a suspect and provide her with witnesses she generally saw to it the person went away and often for a long time anybody got a fuck for me her smile lit up the office branstetter looked up from his report when she was speaking to these guys she called all suspects fucks she knew as all of them knew that anybody who got all the way to arrested was guilty they had done something bad enough to eliminate them from society forever therefore she would start the process of making them nonpeople they were fucks starting here in homicide and fuck them slow night bets griffin put his donut down so whos got the nash thing she held up her folded newspaper frontpage stuff the cops looked at each other and shrugged sounds exciting griffin was most interested in his donut it wasnt his case end of story i must have missed it i think glitsky might have gone down there block said you can look on his desk it was on top of the stack of papers on the corner of abe glitskys desk there wasnt much more than the manila folder with the name nash in caps on the tab inside glitsky had started writing up the incident report but hadnt gotten far there were no photos yet either from the discovery scene or the coroners office pullios closed up the folder took a postit and wrote a note asking glitsky to call her as soon as he got in hardy awakened by rebecca at fivethirty had gone out running in the clear and already balmy dawn down geary out to the beach south to lincoln then inside golden gate park back to th and home a fourmile circle hed been trying to keep up since getting sedentary in march now near eight he sat in his green jogging suit taking his time over frannies great coffee she sat across the kitchen table from him glancing at sections of the paper when she wasnt fiddling with the baby who was strapped into a baby seat on the table between them and this was a baby shark he said imagine what a twentyfooter would do i think they made a movie about that hardy made a face at her as the doorbell rang followed by the sound of the front door opening dont get up commoners glitsky called out ill just let myself in the sergeant wore a white shirt and solid brown tie khaki slacks cordovan wing tips tan sports coat entering the kitchen he stopped taking fashion tips from dead guys hi abe frannie said hardy pointed to the stove waters hot glitsky knew where the tea was and got out a bag dropped it into a cup came over to the table he looked again at hardy oftentimes ill go see a body and the next day decide to wear exactly what it had on hardy shrugged it was next up in my drawer am i supposed to throw it away if anybody ever asks if your husband is superstitious frannie you should tell them no hardy explained it to her owen nash was found in some sweats just like these abe thinks the streets are infested with sharks that are going to start a feeding frenzy over people in green sweats hardy lifted the front of his sweatshirt away from his body besides this is different there aint any holes in this one major difference abe nodded and sipped his tea so tell me everything you know hardy and glitsky went back into the office where hardy had the notes hed taken after talking with ken farris abe sat at the desk while hardy threw darts whos this guy in santa clara silicon valley i dont know farris said hed tell me if we needed it i need it yeah i thought you would glitsky kept reading taking a couple of notes of his own he went out with this may shinn on saturday hardy pulled darts from the board two bullseyes and a he was throwing pretty well a good sign we dont know that for sure farris says he was planning on it but no ones talked to her right thats her number there at the bottom youre welcome to give her a try glitsky did he held the receiver for a minute then hung up hardy sat at the corner of the desk you didnt want to leave a message ask her to call you id love to but nobody answered no theres a machine i heard it glitsky thought a minute then dialed again okay last time was four ill give it ten the sun reflected off the hardwood floors onto the bookcase hardy walked over and opened the window a reasonable action only about ten days a year the view to his north up to twin peaks and the sutro tower was blocked from his office by rebeccas room but overhead the sky was clear hardy could see oakland easily the air smelled like grass even out here in the concrete avenues nope abe said behind him ten rings this listed wheres she live wheres your phone book she wasnt listed without going into it too closely hardy said hed gotten the number from farris so shes home id guess abe said at least she unplugged her machine in the last couple days right you going to work today dressed like that hardy allowed that he would probably take a shower and get dressed and moved toward his bedroom abe following you know he said i wouldnt get too red hot about this why not well the body turns up yesterday but nash was probably dead on sunday we go on that right yeah okay todays friday one week assuming he went down on saturday and after four days hardy knew what abe was saying understood the statistics if you didnt have a suspect within four days of a murder the odds were enormous that youd never get one all im saying is dont get your hopes up hardy stripped off his shirt okay he said but youve got mr silicon valley and you got may shinn if you can find her if she didnt go swimming with owen nash then who unplugged her answering machine i know i know im an investigator ill investigate i also thought wed check out the boat no the boats clean hardy told abe about his visit on wednesday night you brought along a forensic team did you hardy shut up and went to take his shower the case of the people v rane brown was not going to be an easy one back in late march at around ten at night two officers in a squad car cruising under the freeway heard a man calling for help turning into the lot they saw one man down on the ground and another man going through his pockets when he saw the cops the suspect took off the man on the ground was yelling stop him thats the guy the officers followed the running man as he turned into one alley then another a dead end getting out of their car they proceeded cautiously down the alley guns drawn flashlights out until they came upon a man crouched between two dumpsters this man turned out to be rane brown a pound nineteenyearold black male with four priors for mugging and purse snatching when apprehended by the officers he was wearing a black tank top and black pants that matched the clothes of the man whod run from the scene the officers found a smith wesson handgun under the dumpster next to rane the gun was registered to a denise watrous in san jose what made the case especially difficult was that when the officers returned to the scene the purported victim had disappeared having evidently decided that the hassle of pursuing justice in this imperfect world was simply not worth the trouble but there was rane brown in custody and the police didnt particularly want to let him go and mug someone else so hardy was in department with judge nancy fiedler this friday morning trying to prove a robbery and knowing that he didnt have a prayer of winning which is what transpired after a fairly stern lecture by judge fiedler on the advisability of producing some evidence before wasting the courts time on this minor and unprovable transgression she had granted the motion to dismiss and rane brown was a free man hardy and the two arresting officers had been waiting by the elevator when rane and his attorney came up and joined them everybody headed to the first floor and rane was in high spirits man you give me a turn when you walk in that courtroom he said to hardy whys that rane you know the man here he cocked his head toward his attorney he tole me you aint got no witnesses no victim like that so i be thinkin everythings cool and you walk in and i thinkin you the victim he smiled broken teeth in a pocked face i mean you get it you look just like the man i rob hardy stared at rane a moment letting it sink in he saw the two cops that had arrested him one on either side of him hardy allowed himself a small smile youre telling me i look like the victim you just got let off for rane was bobbing his head exactly man exactly he just couldnt believe the resemblance hardy looked from one officer to the other if im not mistaken he said we just got ourselves a confession the elevator door opened and hardy stepped out blocking the way take this guy back upstairs and book him the boat was out when you got in and what time was that josé and glitsky sat on hard plastic chairs by the doorway to the gateway marina guardhouse josé was about twentyfive years old thin and sinewy he wore new tennis shoes with his green uniform a shirt open at the neck the day had heated up even here right on the water it was over eighty degrees i got here sixthirty quarter to seven and the eloise she was already gone and nobody signed her out no they spose to but he shrugged were there any calls on the intercom anything like that you remember saturday it was like nothing maybe two boats three go out if anything had happen i remember josé stood up and got a logbook from the counter here look at this air temp fortyeight wind north northeast at thirtyfive small craft up from the night before so nobody was going out what about the other boats the ones that went out josé tapped the book these i write down he ran a finger over the page until he got where he wanted the wave dancer she goes out at tenthirty back at two then blue baby she just clear the jetty pronounced yetty then turn aroun and come back in like onefifteen rough rider leaves about the same as blue baby like onethirty they no come back in on my shift not bad glitsky thought every new witness didnt double his work it squared it here were only three boats to check and maybe he could leave out the blue baby possibly one of them had seen the eloise if saturday had been a day like today clear and calm he didnt want to think about it he started writing down names a uniformed officer appeared in the doorway sergeant the lab team is pulling up as soon as hed left hardys that morning glitsky had arranged to have the eloise placed under the guard of a couple of officers he stopped off downtown for an easily obtained search warrant not even dropping into his office after he and forensics had gone over the eloise a prospect about which he entertained no great hopes theyd cordon it off with crimescene tape but the boat was the place to start it was more than probable that nash had at the very least been dead on the boat and dumped from it from there hed see where the trails led josé was next to him as he greeted a team at the gate to the slips and the six men walked out in the glaring sun to the end of dock two josé opened the cabin for them then glitsky dismissed him abe went below taking a moment to let his eyes adjust to the relative darkness as the room became visible one of the forensic team on the ladder behind him whistled at the layout they went to work it was a tough call because they were looking for anything and nothing two men were on deck above starting at the bow and coming back glitsky and two other guys were below but there wasnt much evident there either no sign of any struggle glitsky started in the main cabin just poking around looking he wasnt a forensics man he would let them go over the fabrics and rugs and smooth surfaces whatever he was looking for would have to be obvious but not too obvious he thought or hardy would have seen it all of the cabinets were secured both in the main cabin and in the adjoining galley he opened each one moved a few things around closed it back up moseying back to the master suite he noted the made bed he considered calling back to remind his guys to bring the sheets in but thought better of it they would do that automatically to the right of the bed there was a wooden desk shaped to the bulkhead its surface cleared he tried one of the side drawers and found it locked the center drawer however slid open easily and with it open the other drawers came free but it was slim pickings the gutter to the center drawer contained pens and paper clips several books of matches from various restaurants a couple of keys on a ring that abe assumed fitted this desk rubberbands and a handball from the olympic club the flat back part of the drawer appeared to be completely empty but reaching his hand back glitsky found two stale crumbling cigars the top side drawer the slimmer one was filled with lots of different colored sweatbands which seemed to go with the exercycle and dumbbells on the other side of the bed the bottom side drawer was empty on the other side of the bed was a rolltop desk its cover down he rolled back the oak top there were probably twentyfive cubbyholes above the desks surface most of them containing pieces of paper some of them rolled up some folded over a general catchall glitsky pulled out a piece at random and found a shopping list eggs cheese spinach orange juice sunday brunch he decided another paper also at random read w re taosreschedule that was all glitsky put the two pages back where hed gotten them forensics would take them back downtown if they found any other evidence that nash had been killed here the center drawer looked much like the other one matches cigars pens and pencils junk he pulled open the upper right drawer expecting to find more headbands at first glance this looked to be another functional drawer but when glitsky pulled the drawer out a little further he saw a nickelplated beretta lying on top of what looked like a collection of foldedup navigational charts just then one of the forensics men on deck called below sergeant you want to get up here i think we got us some blood it was close to noon on what was already the hottest day of the year and naturally the air conditioners were on the blink there were no windows in the courtrooms in san franciscos hall of justice fans were set up on either side of the bench in judge andy fowlers courtroom department and they did move the air around unfortunately the temperature of the air getting moved was ninetyone degrees the whir of the fan blades also upped the decibel level nearly uniform in size twentyfive by forty feet with high ceilings and no soft surfaces except the minimal padding on the seats of jurors judges and witnesses courtrooms were under the best conditions loud and uncomfortable and today under far less than optimal conditions andy fowler was once again being forced reluctantly by the luck of the draw into a role he hated protector of suspects rights hed been a young man at the time of his appointment to the bench hed worked on pat browns second gubernatorial campaign against richard nixon more because he hated nixon than loved brown and persuaded a goodly amount of his olympic club confreres some of them republicans to donate to the cause at the time though not yet thirty hed already made partner in his firm and he had put the word out that he would accept a judgeship if one came around which in due course it did though his politics rarely came up and hadnt radically changed in thirty years this was the s in san francisco anywhere but in the hall of justice a kennedystyle liberal democrat was considered rightwing actual conservatives again excluding the hall were as rare in the city as a warm day political san francisco was a balkanized unit of special interests many on the socalled left homosexuals people of color middleclass white radicals so political survival in the city was in large part a matter of pleasing enough of these groups to form a majority coalition on whatever issue happened to be the days hot topic in reaction the denizens of the hall of justice the police department the das office judges had become a little balkan republic of their own it was tough they said to be for law and order to serve blind justice when first you had to take into account the trauma andor discrimination that had been visited on you and yours on account of skin color gender sexual preference religious orientation poor potty training whatever and in this climate until three years ago andy fowler had been a popular judge he knew it was true because prosecutors went out of their way to tell him they loved getting cases in his department why well he tried to be fair he wasnt a wiseguy he didnt throw things erasers pencils paper clips from the bench at attorneys bailiffs or suspects if someone needed waking up in the courtroom he would politely ask the bailiff to shake that person he had a sly humor and no political axe to grind he was knowledgeable about the law he was in short a good judge the first sign of change came in the case of the people v randy blakemore it seemed mr blakemore was hanging out on eddy street one evening and saw an apparently drunk tourist stumbling along in a nice suit randy noticed a rolex a fat bulge in the tourists back pocket the gold chain around his neck when the man fell into a doorway to rest randy moved in and had his hands on the rolex when two other homeless people appeared with badges and guns the tourist opened his eyes and uttered an extremely sober boo youre it and randy was taken downtown one of seventeen arrests in a police program to get the word out on the street that tourists were a valued business in san francisco and were not to be hassled six other cases had already come up for pxs preliminary hearings in other departments when blakemore came up in andy fowlers courtroom four of those men were awaiting trial and two had already been convicted and sent to jail andy fowler took a look at randy standing in the docket in his orange prison togs and told him it was his lucky day this was as clear a case of entrapment as judge fowler had ever seen and though he had no doubt that randy was a bad person who shouldnt be on the streets on this particular charge he was going to walk other judges reconsidered three of the four remaining prelims resulted the same way both of the felons already convicted were released on appeal the last suspect had also mugged the tourist and fought the arresting officers so he did go to trial although the jury didnt convict the other dozen or so arrestees had their charges dropped by an angry district attorney christopher locke so fowlers ruling had alienated locke the sixteen officers whod taken part in the operation chief of police dan rigby and the mayor in whose brain the original germ of the idea had hatched in the first place for a short while fowler became somewhat the darling of the media the sunday chronicles calendarstyle section did a piece on him further alienating the hall esquire liked his wardrobe rolling stone asked his opinion on roe v wade people had a little squib on him in endnotes calling him a crusading justice fowler laughed it off as his allotted twenty minutes of fame and most of it blew over after a while but it did leave a bitter residue especially on a young female da named elizabeth pullios who didnt like to lose and whod been prosecuting blakemore now on this sweltering morning fowler had listened to a halfhour of opening statements by chief assistant district attorney art drysdale making a rare personal appearance in a courtroom the case was the people v charles hendrix and drysdale was here because locke had asked him to be there were eight sitting judges in san francisco their cases assigned by one of their number a rotating calendar judge in department starting at ninethirty every monday morning when people v hendrix went to fowler locke knew he was in trouble hendrix was another entrapment in this case the sfpd had set up a phony fence a warehouse to receive stolen goods after word got out they had videotaped twenty to thirty suspects a day waiting for a big score or a connection to a major dope deal before theyd make some arrests this locke suspected wasnt going to fly in andy fowlers courtroom and i want to see prosecuting counsel in my chambers immediately fowler recovered from his illness of the previous day left the bench and had his robe off before he left the courtroom he told the bailiff to bring one of the fans into his office a minute later drysdale was knocking at his open door your honor the bailiff brushed by drysdale with the fan and plugged it in so it blew across fowlers desk how many of these turkeys are we likely to be seeing here come in art sit down hot enough drysdale crossed a leg with all respect your honor i think a flat dismissal is out of line as a matter of law fowlers eyes narrowed but drysdale ignored the obvious signs reaching into his briefcase ive got a brief here youve got a brief already before you knew my ruling mr locke had an intuition fowler did not smile ill bet he did he laced his fingers and brought them up to his mouth why dont you just give me the sense of it drysdale hadnt written a memorandum of points and authorities a paper laying out current law based on past decisions in other courts lawreview articles recognized lawbooks in about eight years and when locke asked him to figure out a way to get by fowler he thought this was as good a time as any to try one entrapment was generally frowned upon in the st district court of appeal san franciscos district but there was a lot of leeway granted police depending on how the sting was set up in this case hendrix and in the many others sure to follow from the phony warehouse the police were not arresting the suspect at the scene rather they were using information gathered by videotape at the scene to identify the suspect after which they tailed him to see what he was up to this approach had resulted in righteous convictions that held up under appeal in several states and drysdale laid it all out in a nutshell while fowler sat back in his chair eyes closed letting the fan blow over him when drysdale had finished fowler opened his eyes let me tell you a story art this kid is sitting on his front lawn minding his own business and one of his neighbors comes by and tells him theres a warehouse down the street paying top dollar for any goods brought to it no questions asked the neighbor shows him a roll he just got for a car stereo and two bicycles another neighbor comes by flashes another wad of dough this goes on for a week and pretty soon our boy is thinking hed be some kind of fool not to take advantage of this opportunity like all of his neighbors see theres two parts to stealing taking and fencing and both are risky but now one half the risk is eliminated so and this is important fowler leaned forward over his desk out of the flow of air from the fan it is the impetus of this sting operation that causes our boy to go and commit a crime excuse me your honor but these people are already committing crimes theyre going to fence them somewhere but by making it easy to fence them counselor we are encouraging them to steal more drysdale sat back he knew fowlers argument he just didnt agree with it but he was only the running footman mr locke doesnt agree with you judge neither does mr rigby fowler allowed himself a tight smile well now thats what makes this country great isnt it drysdale leaned forward himself the cops have put in a lot of time and money on this already judge so have we were taking these guys off the street shooting them would also take them off the street art and shooting them is also illegal this isnt illegal fowler finally sat back breaking the eye contact you know its funny but im the judge its my courtroom and if i say its illegal you and mr locke and mr rigby and anybody else will just have to live with it now drysdale sat back he realized that he was sweating and wiped a hand across his forehead id like to at least leave the brief he said fine leave the brief ill read it if i get the chance the son of a bitch the arrogant pompous liberal son of a bitch yes sir drysdale stood by the window in lockes office hands held behind his back the air conditioner seemed to be working better on the third floor this was a righteous bust we didnt take hendrix in dumping the goods we caught him in the act drysdale turned around an act he would not have been drawn to commit had we not set up our fence oh bullshit art shrugged its not my argument hendrix does this for a fucking living he steals things you know that as well as i do he breaks into your house or my house or his fucking honor andy fowlers house and takes things that arent fucking his he is not coerced into doing this by finding a good place to unload it yes sir i know the warehouse was an ongoing operation that had been in business for about four months the police department had already brought in over forty suspects and had collected some million worth of contraband a good portion of which they had returned to its owners it was a successful tool that they felt was working arrests were up convictions should follow and locke was damned if he was going to let some commie judge screw it up for everybody he sat down now played drums with a pencil on his desk shave and a haircut six bits shave and a haircut six bits whos on calendar this month maybe well get lucky in another department i think leo chomorros taken up permanent residence poor bastard art lifted his shoulders he asked for it if he rides with us maybe we can ease him out of there maybe hes ready find out would you find out if hell play keep any of these away from fowler rigbys going to have a shitfit yes sir art said locke looked at his watch god how could it be lunchtime already i just got here ive got an appointment in ten minutes art you want to fill rigby in no ill do it hes gonna shit what are we going to do about fowler drysdale shrugged hes a judge chris hes in for the duration im afraid locke was moving around his desk straightening his tie id like to get a crack at him ill tell you that son of a bitch could ruin my career drysdale whod been around and seen it all was about to tell his boss that andy fowler was an okay guy good on a lot of other issues it was just his interpretation of the law nothing personal but he bit his tongue he knew better it was personal if it didnt start personal it got that way in a hurry to the people who practiced it even a seasoned veteran like art drysdale everything about the law was personal there were egos careers and lives wrapped up in every yea or nay every objection sustained or overruled every conviction every reversal if you didnt take it personally you didnt belong there andy fowler wasnt just interpreting the law he was stepping on toes big toes although he was loyal to locke drysdale had always gotten along well with fowler and he hoped like hell the judge knew what he was doing if he slipped up he was going to get squished you love this dont you frannie asked hardy hadnt stopped grinning since hed told the cops in the elevator to rebook rane brown he had just told his wife the story it has its moments i must admit so who are you nailing this afternoon hardy looked at the folders on his desk still a formidable pile the afternoon looms large before me he said he noticed andy fowlers jade paperweight and picked it up cool and heavy in his hand maybe ill shoot some darts eat lunch his feet were up on his desk his tie loosened abe glitsky appeared in his doorway knocked once and sat down across the desk from him on the other hand im sure abe says hi he just walked in ill let you go then okay but guess what i know me too okay saying they loved each other in code glitsky had come directly to hardys office from the evidencelocker room the telephone receiver wasnt out of hardys hand yet when glitsky said as you astutely predicted diz the eloise was clean hardy was tossing the jade from hand to hand well i didnt think except for a gun a slug a bunch of blood some other stuff hardy put the jade down swinging his feet to the floor im listening glitsky filled him in he had bagged the beretta for evidence you could still smell the cordite he would bet a lot it was the murder weapon although ballistics would tell them for sure by monday on deck they had found what looked like blood on the railing where nash might have gone overboard whoever shot him whoever brought the boat back in must have washed down the deck but they missed the rail the gun registered im running it now well know by tonight any word on may shinn i was thinking you might have something there maybe farris hardy shook his head told him a little about how hed spent his morning about rane brown glitsky nodded you ever notice how just plain dumb these guys are it had crossed hardys mind so whats my excuse to talk to farris again maybe you want to talk to him till you give me a suspect im not really in it glitsky was firm youre in it diz you already know the guy tell him we need mr silicon and we havent located shinn see what hell tell you hes probably handling disposition of the body too although maybe the daughter no probably him im on it hardy said hardy passed on his lunch it was too nice a day to stay cooped up so hardy called got directions and made an appointment then drove with the top off his samurai around the army street curve down he got his first view of the bay as he passed candlestick park remarkably blue clear all the way down to san jose dotted with a few sailboats some tankers the bay bridge glittered silver a little behind him and the pencil line of the san mateo bridge ran over to hay ward you could see it every day hardy thought and the beauty still got to you he exited the freeway at south san francisco and drove north and west through the industrial section owen industries spread itself over nearly two acres of land at the foot of the san bruno mountains a bunch of white and green structures that looked like army barracks hardy was issued a guest pass at the guard station after hed had his appointment confirmed these folks were into security he drove a hundred yards between two rows of the low buildings then turned left as instructed and came upon the corporate offices which showed signs of an architects hand a wellkept lawn a cobbled walkway bounded by a low hedge a few mature pines relieved the drab institutional feel of the rest of the place a flag flew at halfmast the corporate office building itself was fronted in brick and glass it like the surrounding compound squatted at one story inside redtiled floors potted trees wide halls with modern art tastefully framed gave the place an air of muted elegance an attractive young receptionist took hardy back to farriss office and explained that he would be back in a moment and in the meantime hardy could wait here the door closed behind him and for a moment after turning around hardy was struck by an intimate familiarity the walls were painted lighter and the view outside the window was certainly different but otherwise farriss office was strikingly like hardys own at his house there was a fireplace with its mantel the seagoing knickknacks even a blowfish on the green blotter that covered the desk there was no greenshaded bankers lamp but the file cabinets were wooden the bookshelves contained business stuff but also some popular books finally there was a dart board studded with two sets of what hardy recognized as highquality custom darts there were differences of course this room was twice the size and altogether brighter than hardys the floor was of the same red tile that had been in the lobby partially covered by three navajo throw rugs and a couch hardy walked to the desk felt the grain of the wood moved to the bookshelves then to the dartboard he removed three of the darts and stepped back to the corner of the desk after throwing all six darts hardy sat on one of the stiffback wooden chairs crossed one knee over the other and waited in under a minute the door opened hardy dismas how are you sorry to keep you waiting something came up a somewhat forced smile in the handsome face again impeccable clothes a charcoal business suit with the personal touch of cowboy boots hardy thought he looked exhausted he went around his desk arranged some papers and sat down his eyes went around the room youve thrown my darts thats an impressive bit of observation farris brushed it off party trick he said like owen breaking boards he explained youre around owen you better have something you can do better than he can i got good at details he seemed to slump remembering something you all right hardy asked yeah ill live this is a bitch of a blow though im not much good at pretending it isnt you dont have to with you okay but out there he motioned toward the door hed just come through i set the tone people out there see me panic then it starts to spread right i just put the word out were closing up for today maybe thingsll look better on monday hardy gave it a minute then thought he might as well get down to it he briefed him on glitskys discoveries on the eloise which farris took in without comment then he got the name address and phone number of mr silicon austin brucker in los altos hills finally he got around to may shinn i wanted to be clear on may though wednesday when you called her you left a message farris nodded thats right you were right there yeah i know im a little confused though because sergeant glitsky tried to call her this morning and no one answered howd he get her number details hardy thought this guy is into details he lifted his shoulders an inch cops have access to unlisted numbers he hoped farris accepted that but the machine didnt answer ten rings no it picked up after two three for me he thought a minute maybe it got to the end of the tape youd still get her answering message wouldnt you i think you would the two men sat putting it together shes alive then farris said she unplugged it would she have had a reason to kill owen may somebody did farris shrugged again i dont know i didnt know her i wouldnt know her if she walked in here but did mr nash owen liked her he paused a lot more than a lot so how about if he stopped liking her so what so might she have gone off something like that farris shook his head i just dont have any idea the last i knew owen liked her but i mean the womans a prostitute right she kills a john over his dumping her even if its owen i dont see it and i dont think he was dumping her so where is she why hasnt she returned your call i dont know thats a good question hardy finally had to let it go what are you doing about the body he asked celine was going by the coroners this afternoon to sign some papers the autopsy was supposed to have been done this morning so they planned to have the cremation sunday morning scattering his ashes over the pacific that afternoon farris looked hard out the window he had a minimum view of the sun behind the low green buildings some grass a couple of pine trees he put his hand to his eyes and pushed against them then pinched the bridge of his nose hardy stood and thanked him for his time farris got up from his chair shook hands over the desk and apologized again he wasnt himself sorry thanks for coming by hardy turned back at the door farris had sat back down in his chair behind the wide expanse of the oak desk he was staring out again into the evening shadow cast over the lawns and pine trees the shade now reaching to his noview window a statue of grief the flight was on japan airlines at eightfifteen it was fourfifteen far too early to leave yet she had phoned for the cab what was she thinking of may knew she would go mad sitting out at the airport for three hours worrying that someone would stop her knowing that she had to leave here that this place maybe america itself was over for her her bags were by the front door she had decided to pack the lennons and the foyer looked bare without them the sun shone in through the turret windows which shed opened due to the heat the heat made her feel as though in some ways she was leaving a place shed never been she wore a dark blue linen suit with dark hose not the perfect outfit for this weather but she thought it made her look more businesslike her hair was in a tight bun her most severe look she didnt want people coming up and talking to her when the doorbell rang she was surprised normally the drivers would honk out on the street nevertheless she determined that she would tell the man shed made a mistake he could come back later if he wanted the fare or maybe she wouldnt through the peephole his looks scared her a lightskinned black man with a nastylooking scar through his lips top to bottom on the other hand she wanted someone who wouldnt talk to her and this man looked like that type she opened the door she was looking at a badge of some kind the man identifying himself as inspector abe glitsky of the san francisco police homicide she stepped back as he asked if she was may shintaka may i come in he sounded polite enough certainly he stood in the foyer there was nothing she could do to keep him from noting the newly empty walls obviously where the lennons had been taken down im here about owen nash a nod she turned and walked back into the living room now she was really hot and she took off her coat draping it across the arm of the couch she went to the turret window and heard the honk of the cab down below the sergeant took a few steps into the room but stopped near the foyer your shoes she said do you mind she motioned to a long polished and ridged board that began next to the door her own pair of darkblue pumps were already resting over the ridge abe stepped out of his wing tips and placed them on the board were you planning on going somewhere he motioned to the bags in the hallway she was coming back across the room he seemed to fill up where he stood even more than owen had and owen was a big man had been a big man thats my cab down there now she said but its too early anyway i should tell him abe was nervous about letting her go down but shed left her bags as well as the jacket of her suit she didnt take a purse if she got in the cab hed be able to call the dispatcher and possibly stop her before shed gone a mile the advantage was his now she had invited him into her apartment he hadnt needed to show a warrant which in any event he didnt have as soon as hed left hardy he decided he had to do some police work he had the phone company run a reverse list on mays phone number and got her address which was on his way home hed called back elizabeth pullios but she was out with a witness and wasnt due to return to her office until monday he finished up his paperwork on the nash incident report grabbed an afternoon cup of tea and some peanut m ms downstairs then went upstairs to the jail and interviewed a snitch who supposedly knew the name of the shooter in last weekends driveby the information was worth checking so he scheduled a videotape session for monday back at his desk now getting on four oclock he called records and got a registration on the beretta the gun belonged to may shintaka nashs autopsy showed that the bullets that killed him were caliber and glitsky figured he didnt have to wait for the formal ballistics report he had her address and for the moment at least may shinn was it she didnt hop in the cab and make a run for it he was standing in the turret watching her say something into the passenger window after she stepped back the cab took off with a squeal of rubber glitsky watched her close the door to the apartment gently holding the knob with one hand and fitting the door into the sill with the other the way mothers sometimes did when their children were sleeping in the room they were closing off seeing her dark blue lowheeled pumps and the tailored suit he had to remind himself that according to all the information he had this woman was a prostitute she was out of the shoes then turning away from the door she came back into the living room he found he couldnt make a guess as to her age and hit it within a decade she could be anywhere from twentyfive to fortyfive she had he thought a very unusual face the bones clearly defined the skin smooth and stretched tight with the hair pulled back she walked over to the low couch next to where shed laid her jacket and floated down onto it she made some motion that he took to be an invitation to sit which he did feeling like a clod in his brown socks and his american sports coat would you like some tea she asked please take off your coat its too warm so far as abe knew he was the only male tea drinker on the force he thought about declining then realized he would enjoy watching may shinn move around that would be nice he said he folded his coat over his end of the couch thinking if she kept this up hed be stripped before long she walked into the kitchen open from the living room and he watched her back the straight shoulders tiny waist womanly curve of her hips even barefoot her ankles tapered thin as a does she poured from a bottle of evian into a kettle owens dead she said yes maam somebody killed him he kept watching her closely she was taking down some cups placing them on a tray if her hands were shaking the cups would betray her but they didnt she stood by the stove turning full to face him i read that glitsky sat forward on the couch elbows on his knees the suitcases he said you were going somewhere japan on business she added spooning tea into the cups you have business over there she nodded i buy art i am a a broker for different friends of mine do you go over there a lot sometimes yes it depends glitsky would have time to pursue that if he had to he decided to move things along we found your gun on mr nashs boat on the eloise yes i kept it there were reasonably certain its the gun that was used to kill him she seemed to be waiting immobilized when was the last time you saw him ms shinn she turned back to the stove touched the side of the kettle with a finger and decided it wasnt ready yet friday night no saturday morning very early he stayed here in this apartment yes and then where did he go from here he said he was going sailing he sailed many weekends and did you go with him most times yes but not saturday why was that she tried the kettle again nodded then poured the two cups she brought the tray over and set it on the low table in front of them he had another appointment did he tell you who it was with she shook her head no or what it was about he didnt say he only said it was clearing the way for us what does that mean clearing the way for you i dont know i think he needed to be alone to think it out she seemed to be searching for words although not the way a foreigner would she appeared to be a native speaker of english but there was a hesitation a pause it threw abe off he couldnt decide when if she was editing when she was telling the truth we were going to be married you and owen nash were going to be married yes keeping it simple and unadorned the best kind of lie abe thought and this he was sure was a lie owen nash internationally acclaimed tycoon and business leader intimate of presidents and kings did not marry his professional and wellpaid love slave period had you set a date no she said she picked up one of the teacups and held it a second then put it back down it is still too hot she said we only decided finally last friday it was my ring the snake ring the one on his hand yes that one then youve known since monday that he was dead or since saturday when you shot him he was thinking why didnt you call the police she picked up the teacup again perhaps stalling when it doesnt burn the fingers it cant burn the mouth she said she handed him the cup it was strong excellent green tea abe sipped it not really understanding why you could drink hot tea on a hot day and feel cooler may why didnt you call us the police what could they do he was already dead i knew it was owen the rest didnt matter it was his fate it wasnt his natural fate may somebody shot him monday i didnt know that i only knew it was owens hand what about today did you read the paper today or yesterday yes glitsky waited just yes may shinn sipped at her own tea carefully she put the cup down what do you want me to say my instinct after all was not to call the police whoever killed owen will have to live with himself and that is punishment enough abe put his cup down and walked back to the turret window across the street was another apartment house the mirror image of this one a cable car clanged by below the sun was still fairly high slanting toward him there wasnt a cloud clear to the horizon from behind him am i a suspect sergeant glitsky turned around do you remember what you did last saturday during the day an alibi is that right i am a suspect then its an open field at this point but unless you have an alibi for saturday im afraid youre in it did you kill him just say no he thought i didnt do it but she said i was here saturday all day alone yes alone i was waiting for owen to come back a little short there exasperated deny you did it he thought again just say the words but she said i loved the man sergeant did you make any phone calls order out for pizza did anybody see you finally it was getting to her she sat on the front three inches of the couch ramrod straight i got up late around nine owen had left sometime around six i took a long bath i was nervous owen was doing something to make it so we could get married deciding i think that he was going to go through with it he thought best out on the water i waited i paced a lot when he wasnt back by dark i went to bed i couldnt face anybody i was crying i thought hed decided not to glitsky put his jacket over his knees i think you might want to put your trip on hold he said and maybe see about retaining a lawyer he thought about taking her downtown now but knew that hed be asking for repercussions if he did it was premature he really had no evidence it had been a week since the gun had been fired and even the most sophisticated laser analysis wouldnt show powder on the hands after that long what may had told him was plausible though pretty unlikely and there was still plenty of legwork to try and verify her alibi or not maybe neighbors hearing her walking around and so forth if she agreed to put off going to japan there wasnt any risk of imminent flight and he didnt really have any probable cause plus she being oriental and he being half black he didnt want to give anybody any ammunition to be able to accuse him of hassling her on racial grounds she had invited him without a warrant into her apartment it was bad luck to arrest somebody under those conditions now if she took flight it would be a different story but she was standing too all right she said i understand glitsky was picking up his shoes can you get a refund on that ticket if you cant we may be able to help you she shook her head they should refund it god knows i paid full price they should so shed bought the ticket recently abe thought probably since last saturday he hesitated strike two and a half tough call but he was still an invited guest in her house and shed promised to stay around hed really prefer to have an indictment before he decided to arrest somebody on a murder charge he thought hed bring his suspicions to hardy and hardy could decide whether they wanted to try to persuade the grand jury but he doubted there was enough yet two and a half strikes didnt make an out he said goodbye and she closed the door gently behind him abe didnt love himself for it but it was too close and he thought with a little patience he would at least not have to worry over the weekend he pulled his plymouth away from the curb and made a point of turning west at the corner under the turret window he drove three blocks turning north again on van ness left on geary and back up to union he parked at the far end of mays block on her side of the street even with the windows down in the shade it was hot fortunately he didnt have long to wait a cab pulled up in front of the corner apartment building and honked its horn twice glitsky waited as may came out of the building he let the driver load her suitcases into the trunk let may get settled into the back seat before he pulled out into the street as the cab rounded the first corner abe turned on his red light and hit his siren the cab directly in front of him pulled over immediately abe came up to the window and flashed his badge the driver asked what hed done abe had him get out of the car then asked him where this fare had asked to be taken down the airport he said goin to japan at eight oclock glitsky thanked the man then opened the back door and looked in at may im sorry he said but im afraid youre under arrest it was after five but yesterday hardy had gone home early after the beach so today he felt compelled to check in after his visit with farris instead of going directly home from the field he parked under the freeway and stopped for a moment to admire the huge hole in the ground that now after a year of political struggle was the beginning of the new county jail like everything else in san francisco government the decision to build a larger county jail had been arrived at after a fair and wideranging debate of other uses to which the alloted money should in a perfect world be put although the electorate had approved the bond measure that would provide the funds the board of supervisors had at first leaned toward using this money to buy electronic bracelets to keep track of prisoners hardy grinned involuntarily whenever the thought crossed his mind and using the remainder for aids research this enlightened plan was discussed by the mayor the board and various agencies for eleven months finally over the threatened resignations of both police chief dan rigby and county sheriff herbert montoya the jail had been approved hardy gazed down into the hole as the last of the workmen were wrapping it up for the day he had a vision of five gang members in an old ford cruising out to one of the projects to shoot whoever might be standing around each of them wearing a captain video wrist bracelet to keep him from committing crimes because see if the cops knew where you were at all times then it would be the same as being in jail wouldnt it the first time hed seen her shed had mascara running down her face hair witched out in shanks so hardy didnt immediately recognize celine nash who was coming out of the coroners office on hardys left thirty feet in front of him the ashen hair or was it blonde was thick and combed straight back to just below her shoulders looking like it had been professionally done about ten minutes before she wore a peacockblue leotard on top that disappeared into a pair of designer blue jeans cinched at the waist with a red scarf watching the body approach him from the side he was almost preternaturally aware of its substance the solid thereness of a splendid female the movement almost feline the rock of hip and jounce of breast he stopped breathing then she turned toward him and he recognized her ms nash he said she was still ten feet away when she halted hardy introduced himself again coming up to her im sorry she said theres been so many she let it trail off were you with the coroner hardy explained his connection that he would be handling the case when it got to the district attorney i just got back from seeing ken farris he told me you might be up here hes pretty broken up i imagine he is her eyes were light blue almost gray he thought he might as well be invisible the eyes looked past him then came back to him waiting im sorry about your father he said meaning it she nodded without any time for him or simply lost inside herself well im keeping you he took a step and she touched the sleeve of his jacket leaving her hand there her eyes following an instant later im sorry she said its all this keeping up appearances her hand was like a brand on his lower arm he felt it through the sleeve of his coat a grip like steel he caught her eyes still distant her face a mask he wondered if she might be in some kind of shock are you all right she took a deep breath then seemed to realize she had his arm a flush began at the top of her leotard she let go of hardy and brought her hand to her neck embarrassed its one of the main traumas death of a parent she said i guess im not prepared for it i dont think we get prepared for it hardy said thats the point i do things i dont know why letting go of her neck she brought the palm of her hand down across her breasts the flush was still on her chest like im just going through motions you know doing what has to be done but all this other stuff is going on inside me would you like to take a break come up to the office go get a drink somewhere i dont drink but it would be nice if we can go to my office then no you go ahead ill just well we could go to a bar thanks i could use the company lou the greeks would not have been an inspired choice under these conditions they were sitting on high stools around a small raised table at the front window of sophies which after eight turned into a dinner club for the young and hip but two blocks north of the hall if you wanted a quiet short one after work it wasnt a bad spot before the scene came alive celine wore expensive italian sandals and no socks she crossed her legs on the high stool showing off the pedicure the toenails a light pink the skin between her ankle and her jeans honeytoned warm and smooth she watched hardy take the first sip of his irish whiskey on the way over in the warm dusk she had again taken his arm they hadnt said ten words now she said thank you for what for taking this time thats all he didnt know what to say he lifted his drink clicked it against her glass of club soda and brought it to his lips he found it hard to believe that two days before hed been around this woman and had no reaction he felt pretty sure it wasnt anything she was doing purposely but he was acutely conscious of everywhere her skin showed at her feet above the leotard on her chest her arms and neck but why not it had been a broiling day he kind of wished he could be sitting there wearing a tank top instead of his shirt and tie hed folded his coat over another stool at the table ive got time he said at last thats all ive got now it seems its rough isnt it now her eyes met his what i was saying before thats the hardest part the stuff going on inside i know hardy said he couldnt exactly say why but he found himself telling her how after his son michael had died by falling out of his crib hardy had made the decision that he would be strong and deal with it the way adults dealt with things right it didnt work oh i made it maybe two months you know go to work come home eat drink wake up do it again hardy paused remembering youre not married are you no i was once i dont know if its better or not having someone there it broke me and my wife up celine didnt say anything for a long time the music in sophies changed or at least hardy became aware of it some automatic stuff that he hated the sun was almost down hitting the tops of the taller buildings north of market and a few up on nob hill i almost wish there were somebody to break up with she said at last take it out on somebody else but daddy was my only family so now what she tipped her glass and found it empty do you think i could have a drink now something with gin in it at the bar hardy ordered himself a second bushmills and celine a bombay on the rocks the bartender poured a three and a half count a solid shot close to a double hardy tipped him two bucks and asked him if he could lose the noise on the speakers celine sipped at the gin and made a face i havent had a drink in a couple of years she said daddy didnt like me to drink too much he didnt too much like you to drink or he didnt like you to drink too much she smiled small and tentative but there it was both i think her eyes settled on him again sometimes id get a little out of control you couldnt get a little out of control around daddy why not because if the daughter of owen nash is not in control that means hes not in control of me she took another sip of the gin and this time it went down smoothly and if owen nash is in the picture hes in control he was that way god what am i saying i loved my father i just miss him im so mad at him its okay hardy said it happens he was just such a i mean i was his only family too so it made sense he wanted me to be a good reflection of him he saw you as his reflection she shook her head putting more movement in it no not exactly you know what i mean she put her hand over his on the small table he wanted what was best for me always and that got to be a burden sometimes she admitted she took a drink im sorry i shouldnt get so worked up hardy found himself covering her hand now celine look this is one time you should be allowed to get worked up you can let it go once in a while or itll come out all at once and you dont want that but it wasnt so much of a burden look at all the good its done me im serious stuff i never would have done without daddy i believe you she shook her head he was just always so hard even when he was good he was hard he pushed people im surprised ken farris didnt tell you i mean look at us were perfect examples but it was worth it for what you got out of it which was what she took her hand away and hardy thought hed offended her the main thing was being close to him you got to be close to daddy which was the most alive you could be hardy swirled his drink in the bottom of his glass outside it was full dusk a couple more people had come into sophies you know what i think he said i think youre allowed to have some mixed feelings right now i wouldnt worry about it celine put her hand back over hardys im sorry i think i feel this gin already you want some cheap advice go get a bottle of it find somebody you can talk to and drink half of it theres nothing more natural than being mad at somebody close when they die i cant talk to anybody she said not about daddy youve just been talking about him to me for a half hour she tightened her hand over his one last time then released it youre the da this isnt personal for you its not the same thing its personal enough for me this is my job my case but thats what it is a case its also that celine somebody killed your father and maybe it was me right dont be silly youre investigating the murder and now you get me to tell you im mad at him celine well i was down in santa cruz the whole weekend i was staying in a house with three of my friends i couldnt have been up here hardy stood up and moved close in to her pulling her head tight against him the gin was hitting her the panic on the rise as it loosened her up stop it he whispered stop he felt her breathing slow down a bare arm came up to his shoulder and held him pulled him down to her a second passed five her grip relaxed and he lifted himself away from her her bluegray eyes had teared up im sorry she said im a mess youre okay he said come on lets get out of here she waited meekly by the door while he grabbed his coat then took her arm they walked out into the warm early night on the way back to the hall she told him about owens saturday appointment on the eloise with may shinn i know hardy said were looking into that he considered telling her about everything theyd found on board but there was still police work to be done there and all of that could wait what celine needed was some understanding and a little time to get used to her father having been murdered hardy didnt think an update on the investigation would do a thing for her piece of mind they got to her car a silver bmw i and she hugged hardy briefly apologizing again for her scene she told him he was a good man then she was in her car leaving him with the faint scent of gin a memory of her body against his and the feeling that without ever meaning to hed done something terribly wrong they were having pizza in the reporters room on the third floor of the hall of justice the same floor that contained the offices of the district attorney the room befitting the esteem with which the police held the medium of print journalism wasnt much there was a green blackboard that kept up a running total of murders in san francisco thus far that year sixtyeight there was a bulletin board tacked three deep with christmas cards the press guys had received from their friends in the building as well as the jails some of them had gone to reside in the surface area of all three desks combined did not equal the expanse of oak on ken farriss desk in south san francisco there was also an oldfashioned school desk jeff elliot sat in that one it wasnt bad pizza anchovies pepperoni sausage and mushroom cass weinberg an attractive gay woman of about thirty had ordered it she was with the bay guardian and didnt have much going on until later that friday night so she thought shed bring in an extra large and schmooze with whoever might be hanging holding down the second big desk was oscar franco from the spanishlanguage la hora then there was jim blanchard from the oakland tribune whod been worried for the past eighteen months about his job ending when the paper went bankrupt my theory he was saying is that elliot here did the guy himself otherwise hows he gonna get a story this good cass picked it up you used to be a sailor didnt you didnt you tell me that in college he did blanchard said at college in lake superior this was true before the multiple sclerosis had kicked in elliot had loved to sail spent his summers under the canvas hed covered the americas cup for his highschool newspaper as a special project not in lake superior on lake superior anchovy breath he said in on doesnt matter he finds out where nash keeps his boat scams his way aboard and kills the guy then i jump overboard and handfeed his hand to the shark blanchard popped pizza exactly thats the part that took guts cass was judicious it could have happened people nowadays do anything to get famous jeff was in heaven he would take all the razzing they were going to give him he was one of them now oscar franco rolled his bassett eyes around the room how long you guys been in the business an nobody even noticed the really big story today just me cass looked at blanchard thats the longest sentence hes ever said isnt it you laugh franco said the big story is in department twentyseven on the charles hendrix sting fowler threw out the case oh boy blanchard sat straight up that man is a mensch cass said what jeff elliot didnt like to miss a big story no matter whose it was judge fowler what did he do oscar explained it to him cass and blanchard sat listening for a moment then both of them asked him to slow up and start again while they took a few notes owen nash was a good story but this thing with fowler might be the opening sally in a protracted war they were still into it when jeff saw the cop glitsky that was it whod been at the coroners the night before going towards the elevator he left his pizza on the small desk grabbed his crutches and said he had to run hoping hed catch the guy before the elevator got to the third floor glitsky wasnt happy in the first place about having to stay around late on a friday night booking somebody for murder writing up a report on his conversation with her the reasons for his arrest when there wasnt the hint of an indictment but more hed finished all that closing in on eight oclock still a chance to get out and have a nice dinner with flo when he went to his car downstairs and found out that new tuneup or not it wouldnt start officer now there was this reporter again the elevators werent setting any land speed records and the temperature in the hallway was over eighty degrees elliot came right up next to him excuse me officer he repeated glitsky corrected him sergeant he said i look like im wearing a uniform sorry sergeant we met last night briefly jeff introduced himself again at the coroners owen nash thats right elliot pushed on well were on the third floor i thought you might be seeing the da about that about something breaking the one elevator in service after business hours arrived with a small ding glitsky stepped in and elliot stuck with him i just did an hourandahalfs worth of irs upstairs so somethings happening jeff thought this was a pretty scary man somethings always happening he said thats why theres time it keeps everything from happening at once the elevator doors closed finally as to the third floor thats where they give out keys to city vehicles and my goddamn plymouth has quit on me again and all the other cars are out for the weekend so im taking a cab home elliot didnt know it but glitsky swore about as often as he laughed out loud maybe twice a year where do you live jeff didnt miss a beat and though hed been planning on stopping back in at his office he said im heading home now i could drop you off glitsky said he lived out on lake and jeff only fibbed slightly saying it was right on his way the sergeant thawed a little thatd be nice where are you parked they had reached the ground floor and the door opened hitting them with a welcome shot of cooler air first slot out the back youre lucky abe said jeff grinned his winning grin no he said handicapped except for the green gauzy glow of the fish tank the lights were out the bedroom window facing east to the citys skyline was wide open but no air moved hardys wife was curled against him spoon fashion and he was inside her holding her to him at the waist they were both sweating at it now a long time hardy wanting to prove something diz he shushed her trying not to hear her and break his own spell hed started with his eyes closed she coming to him feeling a distance there after the quiet dinner the brooding in the living room diz he didnt want to hear her and buried his mouth into the back of her neck under her hair when he opened his eyes he could make out the shape of her back in the dim light only her back any back anyones he wanted it to be but he was closing in on it now feeling the thrust of her wanting to help him even if she was ready to quit reaching down for him arching herself backward he pulled at her waist up against him now feeling the air now between them closing the distance hard up in her wetness harder then pounding losing her as he felt himself starting finding it again and driving in again and again and again it was celines back an angry celine and hardy for some reason furious too feeling her grip the tight grip she had on him and now he heard her crying out after she thought it was over liking it rough and the sound of her cry starting something at the base of his backbone moving up he slapped her against him as hard as he could knowing he wasnt hurting her crying out himself his hands now up against celines breasts that were somehow wet crushing them to her crushing himself against frannies back she pumping him the sweet agony finished now he lay on his back breathing hard he felt the sweat cooling the lightest warm breeze through the window frannie was on her side leaning on her elbow all up against him she kissed his cheek i love you she said are you all right sorry she kissed him again theres nothing to be sorry about i liked that he pulled her to him and kissed her she put her head down against his shoulder and started breathing regularly in one minute she was asleep hardy lay with his eyes open listening to the gurgling of the fish tank for almost an hour he woke up refreshed his devils exorcised by spent lust and deep sleep in the light of day he thought it hadnt done him any harm to fantasize it was natural once in a while no need to whip himself over it now he wasnt fantasizing frannie was in his here and now he was cooking breakfast french toast and sausages in his black castiron pan the only artifact hed taken from his time with jane in the decade hed lived alone that pan had been one of the inviolate certainties in his world he cleaned the pan with salt and paper towels no water no soap after every use he put a drop or two of oil in it and rubbed it in no food stuck to that pan it was a joy taking a bite of a sausage link he turned a piece of sliced sourdough bread over in the mixture of egg milk and cinnamon dripping it only for a second so it wouldnt get soggy and forked it into the pan where it hit with a satisfying hiss outside the sun had come up hot again maybe theyd get an entire weekend of summer this year frannie was dressed in hiking boots with white socks khaki shorts and a giants tshirt ready for the historical expedition to martinez that she hardy and moses had planned for the day they were going to track down the elusive origin of the martini or is it the origin of the elusive martini moses had asked this had been last wednesday night at yet wan the martini itself is not elusive hardy had replied but the ideal martini can be elusive two bartenders jesus finally coming to an agreement frannie was smiling remembering she came back down the hall from the front door with the morning newspaper and laid it on the table in front of rebecca who was fingerpainting with baby food on the tray of her high chair standing opening to the front page she grabbed a sausage and took the mug of coffee hardy handed her this jeffrey elliots turning into a daily feature hardy came over and stood with his arm around her suspect arrested in owen nash murder by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer police yesterday arrested may shinn the alleged mistress of owen nash for the murder of the local financier according to the arresting officer sergeant abraham glitsky ms shinn had purchased a ticket to japan after the discovery of nashs body on thursday on a beach in pacifica and was attempting to leave the jurisdiction after she had agreed to remain in the city although glitsky refused to go into much detail regarding the evidence collected thus far he did acknowledge that a search of owen nashs sailboat the eloise had revealed traces of blood and acaliber beretta handgun registered to ms shinn additionally a slug imbedded in the wall of the boat was recovered the gun had been fired twice and nashs body contained two wounds the ballistics department has not yet conclusively identified the gun as the murder weapon although glitsky conceded he thought the possibility likely the article picked up on the back page but hardy was already at the telephone thats what i like he said when i follow the comings and goings of my dear friends and professional colleagues by reading about them in the newspaper what are you eating glitsky asked it sounds great hardy swallowed his sausage you forgot my phone number abe ill get it for you on friday night come on i got done talking to elliot around ninethirty ten i thought id call you this morning what were you doing talking to elliot my car went out again he was at the hall he gave me a lift home what a guy hardy said he seems like a good kid i know he does nicest guy in the world is she out of jail i doubt it i guess it depends who she calls a good lawyer might find a judge to set some bail get her out today and when do i talk to her did she do it after a minute glitsky answered i dont know she might have no alibi its her gun she was getting out of dodge and she bought her ticket to japan after nash was identified after the paper had it no alibi the famous iwashomealoneallday whens the last time you were home alone all day no phone calls no nothing i didnt want her going to japan you think i ought to go down and see her hey frannie gave him the eye martinez she whispered the elusive martini remember in the normal course of events there was a skeleton staff at the hall on weekends the das office was officially closed courtrooms were not in use of course there was still police work and people getting into and out of jail which occupied the top floors until the new one in the back lot was completed a clerk was on duty twentyfour hours a day to let people out if a bondsman met bail defense attorneys came and went there were visitors hardy had parked in his usual spot under the freeway promising an unhappy frannie hed be home by noon for their foray into history you didnt want to drink martinis before noon anyway he had told her she told him she wasnt going to drink martinis for seven or so months and in any event she had gone along with this idea just to be with her husband brother and daughter and have a relaxing time together which seemed to be becoming less of a priority for him day by day you thought you had trained yourself youd traveled far enough along your own rocky path to some inner peace that you had come to believe you couldnt go back events would never control you again then they took your clothes from you they gave you a yellow gown that smelled like lysol and put you in a small barred room with a sullen young black woman and a toilet with no seat the whole place beneath the disinfectant smelling like a sewer you threw away your phone calls on the man whod been your lovers attorney you ever need help i mean real help and im not around you just call on the wheel hes your man he would come down and get her out he was a lawyer and knew about these things but he wasnt at the number owen had given her no one had answered and now there was no one to call and she was alone you spent the night in fear waking up sweating in the still heat the smell of yourself of the other woman who didnt talk who sat on her mattress with her back against the wall a clanging wakeup and a meal of cold powdered eggs the regimented shower the indifference of the women guards she swore to herself that she would not let them take her so easily but it was difficult finding a mechanism to deal with it to keep the loss of herself under control she felt her will eroding and she knew thats what they wanted to turn her into a victim again shed really believed she was through with that for good if owen had done anything for her it was that she would not be a victim that was something she could control she sat crosslegged on her mattress and closed her eyes if she did not have a physical shrine she would create one inside herself even here she had been this close to despair before it was the day she had met owen alone in a darkened corner at nissho an exclusive japanese restaurant near the miyako hotel in japantown a thick winter fog out the windows she had sat contemplating her death she would use seconal and alcohol starting with a small bottle of sake after lunch she would walk slowly back up to her apartment and sit by her window watching the fog and drink the bottle of meursault she would disrobe and take a hot bath she would swallow the pills and draw the clean silk sheets up over her naked body and she would go to sleep that was where life after thirtyfour years had led her she could not have said precisely where she had failed or which failure had marked her rubicon should she have tried harder with her family tried to communicate more and break the icy bonds of reserve there had been two sisters and a brother living with her parents in a square and empty house under the flight path to moffatt field in sunnyvale passive remember we are japanese her father never able to get over his internment in arizona during world war ii when he was a boy snatched with his whole family from his home the excuse for his whole life we will never belong harboring the hatred and disappointment in who he was who they all were doling it out to her mother to his children to may starting college at berkeley glad to be rid of them letting the family fall away running out of money in the first semester taking a job selling shoes to gaijin with their huge feet marrying sam hoshida ten years older than she because his landscape work got her out of the shoe store another semester in college then with sam supporting her another year with a man who grew quiet and bitter as he came to know she was using him wearing better clothes becoming conscious of her beauty other men making her aware of it there was a teaching assistant then a halfjapanese phil oshida for whom she left sam for love they married and she miscarried three times in two years she could never have children he hated her for that felt pity and hate trying to disguise them as love she thought that was where the big fall had begun when the only person shed ever let herself care for gave up on her she got her meaningless degree in political science and her second divorce she was a shell empty and used up at twentyfour the first time it happened she hadnt planned it she had gone to hawaii for a oneweek vacation her first vacation from her meaningless job at the bank of america of course as always she was on a budget the package was a roundtrip ticket hotel and one meal a day she let a student on christmas break from usc buy her an ice cream near the beach he was big and built and blond and allamerican and told her he liked her bathing suit could he buy her dinner he had lots of money his parents lived on hilo next day he asked her if shed like to go with him over to his parents house he was straightforward he was going back to school in a week he had a girlfriend so no commitments but they could have a good time no actual money changed hands although he did pay for her rebooked return flight but the experience gave her the idea of what could be done she quit her job at the bank of america shortened her name to shinn and started to make a good living alone discreetly but there she was at nisshos still a shell carrying her fathers victimload around with her men had been doing what they wanted with her for ten years she couldnt be further debased or devalued she was still in demand but there was no may shintaka anymore not even she thought much of a may shinn and she didnt really care her usefulness if shed ever had any was at an end then owen nash had walked to her table he sat down uninvited she raised her eyes to look at him yes are you as alone as you look of the many men she had known she recognized something in owen nash that she thought she had given up on in her business it was inevitable you got to thinking all men were the same or similar enough that the small differences didnt matter here was a man though who on first meeting caught you in an aura swept you up in it he stood over her looking down giving off a sense of power with a massive muscular torso a square face and eyes that vibrated with life and halfhidden suffering she stared at him not wanting to acknowledge what she intuitively felt that this man already knew her knew what she was feeling are you as lonely as you look an old pickup line but this she felt wasnt just that he was telling her that they were connected somehow suddenly with nothing else holding her to her meaningless life she wanted to know how the connection worked and what it might mean he had reserved the private room in the back but had been watching her from the kitchen where he was helping prepare the side dishes to accompany his main course of fugu a blowfish delicacy in japan that killed you if you prepared it wrong after sharing the meal they both waited for the slight numbness on the tongue owen had brought a bottle of aged suntory whisky and they sipped it neat out of the sake cups during the meal he had gotten back some of what she would come to know as his usual garrulous persona now he ran with it laughing loud in the tiny room emptying his sake cup i think youre unhappy she said if the fish had been wrong it could have poisoned you he drank his whiskey theres risk in everything you do what you need to and you need to risk death why someone like you they were alone in the room sitting on the floor the table had been cleared only the suntory bottle and the two cups were left on the polished teak its a game he said not smiling its something i do thats all she shook her head this wasnt any game for him i think thats why you came over and talked to me you recognized me i am like you she told him she wanted him to follow her she would show him what wanting to die was really like they walked twenty blocks in the deep fog to her apartment he followed her up the stairs in the foyer she stepped out of her shoes and went into the bathroom where she turned on the bath she went to the refrigerator and got out the wine opened it it was as though he werent there she went to her dresser and took off her earrings her necklace unbuttoning the black silk blouse she felt him moving up close behind her but he didnt touch her didnt speak that was the understanding she continued to disrobe her brassiere her slacks the rest she finished the first glass of wine in a gulp and poured herself a second which she brought to the bathroom the bath was ready the mirror steamed he sat on the toilet seat watching her lather occasionally sipping from the suntory bottle hed carried with him she stood and rinsed under a hot shower then stepped out and over to the medicine cabinet where she took down the prescription bottle and poured the pills at least twenty of them into her hand she lifted her glass of wine threw back her head and emptied her hand into her mouth which is when owen moved knocking the glass out of her hand smashing it to the tiles grabbing her his fingers in her mouth forcing the pills out into the sink the toilet onto the floor that had been the beginning the shrine was gone in the clang of the bars the door opening shinn das here to see you move it remember who you are she told herself you are not what they think you are it wasnt quite eleven in the morning out the windows through the bars she saw the sun high in the sky the interview room was like a cell without toilet or bars it was furnished with an old pitted gray desk and three chairs she sat down across from the man casual in jeans and a rugby shirt he introduced himself mr hardy and some woman he called a da investigator he would be taping this interview he asked how they were treating her i need more phone calls she said i shouldnt be in here she was not stupid she was a citizen and she wasnt going to fall into the trap that had ensnared her father she had to believe that there was another reason she was arrested it was not because she was japanese she told hardy about her attempted call to ken farris i could call farris for you he tried to call you several times last week you know i didnt kill owen nash she said i wouldnt say anything you didnt want to hear repeated then why are you here i thought you might want to tell me what happened maybe we could both get lucky what happened when the man shrugged last night the arrest the last time you saw owen nash shouldnt i have a lawyer absolutely you have the right to one you dont have to say one word to me but she found she wanted to explain to talk im not sure i even understand why im here i think trying to leave the country was a bad idea but i knew she stopped herself dont you see see what she picked her words carefully slowly when i saw my name in the paper i knew id be suspected were you out on the boat with him no i told the officer that the one who arrested me then why would we suspect you im japanese no she told herself that was her fathers answer but it was too late to retract it now and its true she said you do suspect me with no reason who i am what i have done for a living she knew she should be quiet wait for an attorney but she couldnt the gun too your gun she nodded i knew it was on the boat thats where i left it i didnt want it in my apartment i couldnt even bring myself to load it owen thought i was silly so you kept it on the eloise in the desk by the bed the man frowned something bothering him you knew it was there when you went out on saturday yes but so you did go out on saturday no i didnt mean that i meant when owen went out i knew it was there all the time thats where i kept it did anyone else know it was there well owen of course there was something else she paused not quite saying it anyone could have anyone could have he repeated yes she was starting to panic to lose herself and hoped it didnt show in her voice she forced herself to breathe calmly if it were me why would i leave the gun on the boat after i shot him why wouldnt i have thrown it overboard i dont know may maybe you were in shock that youd actually done it and reverted to habit not thinking putting the gun where it belonged why dont you tell me i loved owen i told that to the sergeant you loved him flat monotone nobody else seems to think he was very lovable nobody else knew him a lot of people knew him he said the door to the room opened with a whoosh just what the hell is going on in here hardy looked then stood up can i help you the man wasnt six feet tall he had curly brown hair and sallow loose skin his shabby dark suit was badly tailored and poorly pressed there were tiny bloodstains on his white collar from shaving cuts nevertheless what he lacked in style he made up for in substance his brown eyes were clear and carried authority the anger seemed to spark off him yeah you can help me you can tell me what this is all about hardy didnt respond ideally on this onslaught maybe you can tell me what it is to you the two men glared at each other the guard who had admitted the second man was still standing at the door the woman investigator hardy had brought along as a witness checked her fingernails the guard asked you gentlemen have a problem with each other the shorter man turned you know who i am i dont hardy said he was ignored i am representing this woman and she is being harassed by the district attorney there is no harassment going on here save it for your appeal which youre going to need to say nothing of the lawsuit who the hell are you im david freeman ms shintakas attorney and you dont belong here like everyone else in the business of practicing law from either side of the courtroom hardy knew of david freeman and his presence stopped him momentarily freeman was a legend in the city a worldclass defense attorney in countless cases and here was dismas hardy novice prosecutor in a place he technically shouldnt be he didnt know how there came to be a connection between may shinn and david freeman but it was clear there was one now and it was hardly promising for hardys chances how did you freeman cut him off because fortunately for justices sake some judges are available on weekends now you get the hell out of here counselor or i swear to god ill move to have you disbarred may spoke up but he wasnt freeman held up an imperious hand dont say another word judge andy fowler watched his drive sail down the middle of the fairway starting low and getting wings up into the clear blue carrying in the warm dry air the ball finally dropped down he estimated at about two hundred and ten yards bouncing and rolling another forty leaving himself a short seveniron to the pin fowler picked up his tee with a swipe and walked to his cart grinning the man is on his game gary smythe was fowlers broker and today his match partner they were playing best ball at per hole and now on the fourteenth were up gary wasnt yet thirtyfive a secondgeneration member of the olympic club the other two guys both members of course were father and son ben and joe wyeth from the real estate company of the same name ben wyeth was close to fowlers age and looked ten years older he teed up i think the judge here ought to rethink his twelve handicap he swung and hit a decent drive out about two hundred yards with the roll on the right side of the fairway that he said is a proper drive for guys our age andy they got in their carts and headed down the fairway you are playing some golf today gary said andy was sucking on his tee he wore a white baseball hat with a marlin on the crest maroon slacks a polo shirt he followed the flight of a flock of swallows into one of the eucalyptus groves bordering the fairway i think golf must be gods game he said you get a day like this if this is gods game hes a sadist gary stopped the cart and got out to pick up his ball as had been the case most of the afternoon andys ball was best andy put his shot pin high four feet to its left garys shot landed on the front fringe bounced and almost hit the flagstick then rolled twelve feet past your ball again gary said as they waited on the green for ben and joe gary told andy he was happy to see him feeling better some of us were worried the last few months he said you didnt seem your old self ah old mans worries thats all andy lined up an imaginary putt you get lazy you get a few problems no worse than everybody else has and you forget you can just take some action and make them go away its just like golf you sit too long and stare at that ball pretty soon its making faces at you and before you know it hitting that ball becomes clean impossible the thing to do is just take your shot let the chips fall pardon the mixed metaphor at least then the games not playing you which is what i let creep up on me maybe you could let it creep back just a little give us young guys a chance andy lined up another imaginary putt and put the ball in the hole he looked up grinning no quarter he said to the victor goes the spoils hardy had had better weekends historical martinez turned out to be a bit of a dud since moses and hardy had practically lived at the little shamrock bar on th and lincoln in san franciscos cool and breezy sunset district for many years an hourandahalf road trip to check out some small bars in another windy town was at best they decided dumb they snagged a few notsoelusive martinis the gin first nagging at hardy then washing out the memory of the mornings disaster with may shinn and lawyer david freeman then frannie had driven them all home just in time to find out rebecca had developed roseola and a fever of degrees which was worth a trip to the emergency room when they got back at midnight hardy had been too exhausted to return the calls of art drysdale or abe glitsky but on sunday he wasnt he got an earful of rebuke from art and was intrigued to learn from glitsky whod worked yesterday that tom waddell the night guard at the marina had seen may leaving the place on thursday night probably coming back realizing shed left the gun did she have a key thats just it it appeared she couldnt get into the boat waddell was going to go help her when he finished whatever he was doing but she had gone maybe thats when she decided to buy the ticket to japan the timing fits hardy remembered that when hed first gone to the eloise the boat had been left unlocked may knowing that would have thought she could have just slipped aboard taken the gun and disappeared with nothing left to link her to the murder and theres another thing maybe nothing maybe a joke but it could be the whole ballgame hardy waited i got a warrant for her suitcases and we found what looks like a handwritten will of owen nashs leaving her two million dollars is it real we dont know were getting a sample of nashs handwriting we havent even mentioned it to her yet but lets assume nash just disappears and his body doesnt show up on a beach after hes declared dead may appears with a valid will nice retirement the same thought occurred to me a good cop following up leads building a case that hardy hoped he hadnt already lost on a technicality hardy spent most of the day inside worrying about rebecca giving her tepid baths every two or three hours frannie as she did hung tough but he could tell it was a strain on her to say nothing of his own feelings memories of another life and another baby one who hadnt made it chilling the warmth out of the evening a dinner of leftovers cold spaghetti soggy salad stale bread they were all in bed for the night before nine oclock family life with sick child excuse me pullios said there is no issue here then i will take the folder and leave it was ninethirty on monday morning and hardy was for the second time in a week in district attorney christopher lockes sanctum sanctorum with him in the second chair before the das desk was elizabeth pullios and standing by the window his back turned to the proceedings art drysdale pullios remained calm i am the homicide prosecutor here whats the issue the issue is art promised me this case hardy knew it sounded whiny but it was the truth and had to be said art was out of line there hardy locke could smile very nicely for the cameras but he was not smiling now he leaned forward hands clasped before him now you listen i appreciate your enthusiasm for your work but we work in a hierarchy and a bureaucracy he held up a hand stopping hardys reply i know we all hate the word but its a precise term and it applies to this office ms pullios here has a fine record trying murder cases and on saturday locke pointed a finger you seriously jeopardized this investigation the accused has an absolute right for an attorney to be present youre aware of that i didnt force her to say a word you shouldnt have been there at all is the point thank god you taped what you did get pullios swiveled on the leather seat of her chair freeman could still make a case for procedural error shit hardy said i beg your pardon if anyone was going to swear in lockes office it was going to be him hardy reflected on the better part of valor i dont think he can make a case there regardless pullios was calm but firm this should not be up for debate i am a homicide da is that right sir of course art come on elizabeth so i went up to homicide and picked up a folder from abe glitsky as i have done many times in the past it happened randomly to be this nash murder there is a suspect in custody at this very moment who was arrested while attempting to flee the jurisdiction this is the kind of case i do she wasnt yelling she didnt even seem particularly excited she had the cards hardy gave it a last shot elizabeth look i have put in some time on this thing i found the hand ive talked to the daughter the victims lawyer and best friend now im not on the case whats that going to do to their confidence in this office thats irrelevant pullios said more than that locke to whom public perception of the district attorneys office was always the primary issue spoke up its not for you two to haggle about hardy youve made a small but real point there i can see you think youve got a legitimate right to this case but so does elizabeth so heres what we do you hardy take second chair under elizabeths direction you keep contact with people youve already interviewed and you keep her informed at every step every single step when we bring this thing to trial elizabeth puts on the show and you get to watch a master perform close up the da crossed his hands on his desk and favored the room with his patented smile now lets cooperate and get this thing done were on the same team here as we all sometimes forget art hardy thanks for bringing this to my attention ive always got an open door thanks very much elizabeth could you stay behind a minute talk about seeing a master perform close up drysdale was juggling in his office my good friend chris locke tries to make sure everybody wins win my ass the baseballs kept flying pullios tries the case youre on it my authority in giving you the case is upheld the office looks good everybody wins who was it said another victory like this and were ruined pyrrhus i think ill remember that hardy shook his head i cant believe this she doesnt know anything about this case drysdale disagreed no she knows and i must say with some justification that once a perp is arrested for whatever it might be that perp is one guilty son of a bitch how about innocent until proven guilty hardy felt silly even saying it out loud he wasnt sure he believed it anymore after the tide of humanity that had washed across his desk in the past months all of them every one guilty of something even if it wasnt what they were accused of the temptation to get whoever it was for whatever they could regardless of whether it was something they did was something all the das faced the best of them rose above it some didnt find the exercise worthwhile that still didnt make it a good argument for drysdale lets tick it off he said she had a sexual relationship with the guy okay already were in mostlikelytosucceed territory two what did glitsky tell you this morning she maybe benefits to the tune of a couple million dollars if the guy dies this is a big number two this is not insignificant it may not even be true and elizabeth doesnt know about it in any event drysdale kissed the air a little clicking sound she will anyway next its her gun and a witness puts her at the crime scene and she doesnt have an alibi for the day in question finally she attempts to leave the country ten minutes after being warned to stay it is not what id call farfetched to think she did it i didnt say she didnt do it im saying theres no real evidence that she did not yet fortunately thats the jurys job and betsys and yours drysdale raised a finger and i wouldnt call her betsy am i glad to be back working here is that a question youve got your murder case quicker than most hardy straightened up in the doorway his name was being called over the hall loudspeaker he had a telephone call pyrrhus right he said before turning into the hall the snitch was named devon latrice wortherington and he certainly seemed to be enjoying the moments of relative freedom away from his cell devon had been picked up carrying an unlicensed firearm and a half pound of rock cocaine the previous thursday night outside a bar near hunters point and he had been in jail about twelve hours when suddenly he recalled his civic duty to assist the police if he knew anything that might help them in apprehending persons who had committed a crime in this case a driveby shooting that had left three people dead including a small boy who reminded glitsky of his son and seven wounded he seemed to like glitsky maybe he was just in a good mood in any event he couldnt seem to shut up what kind of name is glitsky he asked while they were setting up the videotape for the interview i never knew no glitsky its jewish abe said what you mean jewish i mean its a jewish name devon well how you get a jewish name howd you get the name wortherington from my father man well you telling me you got glitsky from your father howd he get glitsky abe was used to roomtemp iqs still he thought devon might be close to the range where he wouldnt be competent to stand trial but he could be patient when it suited him and now there wasnt much else to do my father he said got glitsky from being jewish no shit you shittin me glitsky felt devon eyeing him for some sign of duplicity he kept a straight face were just about ready sergeant the technician was a middleaged woman of no looks and no humor maybe she dated the jail warden whod accompanied devon down and who now stood inside by the interview rooms door my father isnt black abe said he saw devon take it in chew it around get it down hey i get it your father is jewish i mean he is a righteous hebe abe wondered about how his father nat would feel about being called a righteous hebe and decided hed ask him the next time they were together he sat down across the table from devon and asked the first questions name age place of birth okay devon lets get to it at about seven oclock on the night of sunday june twentyfirst you were standing at the corner of dedman court glitsky loved the name and cashmere lane in hunters point is that correct devon nodded and glitsky continued running down his mental list of questions establishing that devon had been standing in a group of neighborhood people when a green camaro drove up with two men in front and two in back at the first sight of the car someone at the corner yelled and a few people dropped to the ground devon had stayed up to see the barrels of guns poking out of the front and back windows another man appeared to be sitting in the backseat window leveling a rifle or a shotgun over the roof of the car you have identified the shooter as tremaine wilson yeah it was wilson glitsky was wondering how devon could have identified wilson since two other witnesses had said that the shooters had worn ski masks and he was firing from the passengerside front window right did anything obstruct your view of him no he was only like twenty feet away i seen him clear as i see you i hear he was wearing something over his face what do you mean you know a skimask a bandanna something over his face devon stopped his easy rhythm cut off it was wilson he said im not saying it wasnt devon im asking was there something covering his face what difference that make glitsky nodded to the technician and she stopped the videotape glitsky knew the tape recorder under the table was still going okay were off the machine devon was he wearing a mask or not hey look im telling you it was wilson i know it was wilson so i give him up and you let me go thats the deal glitsky shook his head the deal is you give us some evidence we can use in court he was wearing a mask wasnt he devon thought about it figuring his chances then shook his head no no way man no mask glitsky sighed then asked the technician to turn on the machine again okay devon for the record was the shooter youve identified as tremaine wilson wearing anything over his face i just told you no tell me again was the shooter wearing anything over his face no it was at this point no surprise still devon seemed to be telling the truth about knowing the shooter was wilson but if he couldnt testify that he actually saw him pulling the trigger it wasnt going to do anybody any good are you related to wilson devons face was a question mark cousin half brother like that no is he related to anyone you know again devon paused but this time glitsky didnt wait he turned to the technician shut that down he said okay devon how do you know wilson it took about a minute but it came out that tremaine wilson had recently moved in with the woman devon had lived with for the past two years the mother of devons child so devon figured he could cut himself a deal and put wilson away at the same time get his old lady back slick right très hardy had been sitting at glitskys desk cooling off after the altercation with locke and pullios but it came up wilson did it yeah sure devon thinks he was the target himself thats why he bought the gun we found him with on thursday wilson wanted to take him out but as they always do they miss who theyre actually shooting at and kill a few folks standing around so devons back upstairs no evidence no deal devons sure wilson was the shooter he probably was so big deal we know one of the shooters you want to try and sell devons id to a jury why dont you cut devon a deal let him back on the street give him back his gun he goes and shoots wilson then we pick him up again glitsky smiled his scar white through his lips its a beautiful thought he gave it a moments appreciation now how about you give me my chair hardy rose he took the folder hed been holding and dropped it in the center of glitskys desk while were giving things back hardy said glitsky spun the folder around facing him howd you get this i got a better one how did pullios get it i gave it to her you gave it to her sure happens all the time she comes in says hi abe what you got and i give her a homicide did it occur to you this might be my case i told her youd been working on it and she said she knew that and shed take care of it well she did that shes got the case you got the folder though i notice yeah i get to be her gofer i follow up glitsky leaned back his feet on his desk he dug a lifesaver from his coat pocket and put it in his mouth so whats the problem hardy could continue bitching about internal strife in the das office but it would be wasted breath and he knew it the best thing would be to do his job and wait for another chance he settled against the corner of abes desk theres no problem he said but i was going over the file and you say you found the gun in the rolltop desk right top right drawer maps and stuff like that thats it so so i looked in that drawer on wednesday and there wasnt any gun there glitsky took a breath chewed up his lifesaver then brought his feet down off his desk what hardy told him about his own search of the eloise but waddell the guard he was with you right hurrying you up a little yeah but i checked that drawer how close i opened it i looked in what do you want the gun was back a ways diz how far in did you look hardy remembered back remembered feeling pressure from tom the guard to stop going through things hed pulled that drawer out had seen the maps he was sure almost certain he would have seen a gun but to be honest he hadnt looked or felt around anywhere near the back of the drawer so you missed it glitsky said i wouldnt worry about it it happens thats why we have a team go and look the phone rang on the desk hardy got up grabbed his file and walked to the back window which overlooked the hole for the new jail and the freeway on about the same level four stories up as homicide traffic was stopped southbound the sun was still out in a pure sky day four of the hot spell glitsky came up beside him that was ken farris he said this morning when i got in i faxed him a copy of the will the alleged will two million dollars remember i figured hed be the quickest way to verify the handwriting and and he says it looks like nashs writing all right but it cant be real nash wouldnt have done that why not he just says he wouldnt have he let farris handle all his legal stuff but its his writing looks like could be forged of course no telling at this point its also if it is his a legal form for a will blank paper dated nothing else on it but legal or not ill tell you something whats that im glad i brought the shinn woman in she almost pulled it off hardy kept looking at the stalled traffic on the freeway the glare of the reflected sun he felt a stabbing pain behind his left eye and brought his hand up to rub it away almost he said almost hardy marveled at how busy abe must have been no wonder hed been working through the weekend smaller wonder still that hed been so reluctant to arrest may without a warrant or indictment on a nowarrant arrest as mays had been the arresting officer has fortyeight hours to bring all the paperwork on a case to the district attorneys office fortyeight hours was by sunday night last night by then he had to have a complaint any relevant incident reports witness interviews forensics ballistics if available enough evidence so the da wouldnt throw it out this morning a typist had worked like a dog to type up the complaint and transcripts then two copies of the folder were prepared the original stayed with the da one copy went to the clerk for putting it on a docket and one copy was saved for the defense attorney pullios not only had gotten to the folder first she had evidently convinced the clerk to get it on a docket for that day in the early afternoon rebeccas fever had broken at noon spots were showing all over her skin otherwise everything at home was fine frannie was planning on taking a nap catching up if she could on the sleep shed missed the night before hardy was back from lunch ribs at lous club soda he threw three games of twenty down at his dart board and by the third game was nailing two numbers a round sometimes all three for the tenth time he considered registering for the city championship tournament someday he really would he got a black threering binder and started filling in some tab labels police report inspectors chronological inspectors notes coroner autopsy witnesses the drill except for coroner and autopsy wasnt all that different from his prelims proof was proof a trial was a trial there was one definitely new tab here though in hardys own folder newspaper he had gone back and cut out all of jeff elliots stories to date most crimes in the big city didnt get any ink this one was already on the front page hardy figured hed see the name pullios in the paper within a day or so and he wanted to have a record of it he hadnt gotten far that morning on glitskys reports when the gun issue that he hadnt seen it on wednesday had stopped him cold hed been looking for an excuse to blow some steam anyway get out of the office well now hed done that hed checked in on his baby had a good lunch it was time to go to work he opened the folder again turned to the first witness interview the transcript unedited off the tape three two one this is inspector abraham glitsky star number i am currently at the office of the golden gate marina fort point drive with me is a gentleman identifying himself as thomas waddell caucasian male this interview is pursuant to an investigation of case number todays date is june saturday at hours in the pm hardy skimmed quickly through the preliminaries down to where abe had started talking about putting may at the crime scene q you remember locking up the eloise with mr hardy a thats right it wasnt locked before then q it was just left open a it happens all the time we notice it we lock em but we dont do a regular check like that q but you locked it when wednesday night a im not sure when the da guy came by after that q that was wednesday a okay q and did you see anybody else board the

shintaka do you recognize her a yeah thats her she was by like thursday night out on the float q what time was that a still light maybe seven seventhirty q what was she doing there did you talk to her a no i dont know she walked by the office when i was with some other people went out onto dock two by the eloise stayed a minute then when i got done and looked up she was gone q did she go aboard the boat a it was locked up q i know it was maybe she had a key a i dont know i guess she mightve i dont know i didnt see her again and later i went to check the boat and it was still locked up she wasnt in it q how do you know that a well the lock is outside you cant go in and lock the door from inside so if she was still inside it couldnt have been locked q but you didnt actually see her leave a no sir but i wasnt looking people are going by all the time i only put it together about mr nash after she was already out there hardy couldnt put his finger on it but he wasnt happy gathering these nails for mays coffin she wasnt his anymore maybe that was it she was elizabeth pullioss and the more he looked at it the more nails he seemed to find glitskys theory that may had gone back to the eloise to pick up her gun because it was the only physical evidence tying her to the crime was starting to look pretty good and certainly her idea that she and owen nash were going to be married was ridiculous he went around his desk and absently grabbed his darts again his door was closed and he threw not aiming not paying any attention he used his darts like greeks used worry beads thursday the twentyfifth had been the day of elliots story linking owen nash the eloise and may on that same day shed bought her ticket without a return to japan and gone down presumably to get her gun back and failed why did he so badly want her not to have done it he thought it might be that so many of the people hed been seeing on his other cases had been the kind youd expect to be doing bad things may shinn when hed gone up to see her in jail wasnt that type at all shed talked to him openly until freeman had shown up unconcerned about her rights the way innocent people might be expected to start out until they found out how the system worked hardy was willing to believe she was a liar but if she was she was very good at it hardy knew such people existed he just hadnt run across too many of them among the lowlifes liars sure good liars not often there was a knock on his door it opened and pullios was in watching him poised dart in hand ready to toss she grinned her sexy charming imyourbestfriend grin and leaned against the door jamb reviewing the shinn case she asked hardy wanted to put a dart in her forehead but thought hed have a hard time pleading accident it was one of the drawbacks of having talent as a matter of fact i am he said he threw the dart and sat down youre mad at me she actually pouted im not much at games elizabeth how do you want to play this she sat herself down the kitten disappearing as soon as it saw it wasnt going to get petted come on dismas were on the same team thats what locke said so it must be true look i know how you feel good he said thats a load off my mind the thing is i dont know how you feel so were not even i dont for example know why you let me jerk myself off on this case for most of a week before you showed any interest in it other than encouraging me to push for my rights beat the bureaucracy i meant it hardy studied her face elizabeth pullios he was coming to understand had a gift for sincerity it probably played well in front of juries but then it was a skull case and now its hot ink no what it is is a homicide and i do homicides ive worked my way up to there hardy looked longingly at his darts stuck in the board across the room in lieu of them he picked up his paperweight and leaned back in his chair passing it from hand to hand it might be unfair and it might be manure but it was a done deal and he didnt want to discuss it anymore farris says the will was nashs handwriting he said pullios was right with him definite until we get an expert but it looks like it thats great thats what we need what do we need its a hell of a motive dont you think two million dollars hardy couldnt help himself things were just falling too easily if pullios wanted this job she ought to do a little work for it it seems to me he said that if may were going to collect money on nashs death she wouldnt have dumped him in the ocean didnt she i mean it was pure luck he washed ashore how could she have known that so so if you were going to kill somebody for two million dollars wouldnt you want to make sure they found the body you dont get the money until hes dead right and hes not dead till theres a body unless you want to wait seven years or so but there is a body but she couldnt have known that he enjoyed watching her stew over that but it didnt last long ill be prepared for that argument she said its good you brought it up the great thing is the money angle the great thing murder for profit makes it a capital case a capital case absolutely pullios declared were going to ask the state of california to put may shinn to death hardy sat next to pullios in the courtroom randomly chosen by computer for department in municipal court which was where the arraignment in a nowarrant arrest even on a capital case was scheduled glitsky was there sitting next to jeff elliot in the mostly empty gallery seats david freeman looking more disheveled than he had on saturday came through the low gate and shook hands cordially with both pullios and hardy which was some surprise hardy found himself liking the guy and warned himself to watch it if he was good at trial he was by definition like pullios a good actor you could admire the technique but beware of the man the judge was michael barsotti an old gray bland fixture in his robes behind the desk barsotti had been in muni court forever and he wasnt known for moving things along the court reporter sat at a right angle to hardy midway between the defendants podium and the judge assorted functionaries milled about two or three bailiffs translators public defenders waiting to get clients assigned hardy leaned over the table organizing his binder now knowing what his role if any would be he wasnt prepared for his first sight of may shinn she looked so much smaller diminished the yellow jumpsuit hung on her he supposed shed been in her jail garb on saturday but his focus had been talking to her eye to eye concentrating on her face she walked up with the bailiff hands cuffed and stood at the podium next to pullios giving no indication shed ever seen hardy before or anyone else the gravity of a murder case was underscored by the judges first words even barsotti gained a measure of authority casting off his boredom caught up in the drama of the formal indictment being pronounced the courtroom getting still may shintaka judge barsotti intoned you are charged by a complaint filed herein with a felony to wit a violation of section of the penal code in that you did in the city and county of san francisco state of california on or about the twentieth day of june willfully unlawfully and with malice aforethought murder owen simpson nash a human being how do you plead barsotti asked not guilty your honor freeman spoke for may after freemans booming oratorio in the interview room on saturday hardy was struck by the modulation of his voice he was matteroffact conversational but there was a fist under the glove suddenly he put on his trial voice your honor before we continue with this charade id like to move to have all charges against my client dismissed due to procedural error on a murder charge mr freeman and already mr hardy of the district attorneys office interrogated my client on saturday morning without informing her i object your honor elizabeth pullios was up from the das desk where shed appeared during the recess mr hardy informed ms shintaka that she had the right to have an attorney present and ms shintaka waived that right the prosecution has a tape recording of that meeting i think we can establish coercion barsotti tapped his gavel he sighed mr freeman he said save it for the hearing in the meantime well move on to bail he adjusted his glasses and doublechecked the computer sheet in front of him the handwritten notation next to the computer line read no bail the prosecution asks that no bail be granted he asked pullios this is a capital murder case your honor freeman turned and looked directly at pullios youre not serious barsotti tapped his gavel again mr freeman please direct your remarks to the bench excuse me your honor i am shocked and dismayed by this mention of capital murder i can see that this is alleged as a specialcircumstances case but i cant believe that the state is asking for death pullios stood up murder for profit your honor i assume you have some evidence to substantiate this claim ms pullios we do your honor your honor ms shintaka poses no threat to society no threat she killed somebody last week the sound of the gavel exploded in the room ms pullios thats enough of that both of you hold your press conferences outside this courtroom hardy was impressed barsotti might be a bland functionary but he was in control here freeman had recovered his cool your honor my client has never before been accused of a crime much less convicted pullios wasnt slowed down by the rebuke your honor the defendant was attempting to leave the jurisdiction when she was arrested mr freeman was your client attempting to flee she was going to japan on business your honor its our contention the arresting officer overreacted she was intending to come back there had been no warrant issued she was going about her normal life which included a previously planned trip to japan shed only bought the ticket the day before your honor and she didnt buy a return shed also packed many personal effects and shed left many more she wasnt fleeing the jurisdiction she was going on a trip she will gladly surrender her passport to the court there is no risk of flight here pullios started to say something more but barsotti held up a hand im going to set bail at five hundred thousand dollars pullios leaned over and whispered to hardy close enough a half million dollars is a lot of money your honor i believe thats the point mr freeman well set the preliminary hearing for your honor freeman again even hardy the novice knew what was next although the defendant had an absolute right to a preliminary hearing within ten court days or sixty calendar days of arraignment no defense lawyer in his right mind would agree to go to prelim that soon at least until hed gotten a chance to see what kind of evidence the prosecution had gathered the defense would request three weeks for discovery and to set will the defendant waive time which meant that in exchange for this threeweek delay may would give up her right to a preliminary hearing within ten days yes your honor barsotti scratched his chin three weeks hmm he looked down at his desk moved some papers around will counsel approach the bench pullios hardy and freeman moved around their respective tables and up before the judge barsottis eyes were milkwatery the drama hadnt lasted long were getting ourselves into the beginning of vacation season here would there be any objection to say the day after labor day none here your honor freeman said your honor labor day is over two months away the defendant has a right to a speedy trial but the people have no less a right to speedy justice i dont need a lecture counselor of course not your honor but the prosecution is ready to proceed in ten days two months is a rather lengthy delay this was not close to true and everyone knew it barsotti looked at pullios over his glasses not for this time of year it isnt we got a full docket and you know as well as i do it can go six months a year before we get a hearing barsotti clearly didnt expect to get any argument and it put his back up he shuffled some papers looked down at something on his desk well schedule the prelim for wednesday september sixth ninethirty am in this department thank you your honor freeman said pullios had her jaw set thatd be fine your honor thats all now he brushed all counsel away and looked over to the bailiff call the next line he said prelim courtrooms were on the first and second floors the hallway outside the courtrooms on both floors was about twenty feet wide the ceilings fifteen feet high the floors linoleum but except for the sound of falling pins it had all the ambience volume and charm of a lowrent bowling alley during the hours court was in session there were seldom less than two hundred people moving to and fro witnesses lawyers clerks spectators families and friends people chatted on the floors against the walls mothers breastfed their babies folks ate lunch kissed cried cut deals on monday and thursday mornings after the janitors had cleaned up the hallway smelled like the first day of school by now seven hours into the workday it just smelled hardy glitsky and jeff elliot stood in a knot outside department all of them were watching pullioss rear end as it disappeared around the corner down near the elevators good thing justice is blind glitsky said or freeman wouldnt have a chance i dont know elliot said hes got may yeah her dress though that baggy yellow thing doesnt show it off like old betsy hardy liked calling her betsy he knew he was going to get used to it and slip someday he kind of looked forward to it he pointed at elliot that was off the record jeff was happy to be included again of course just making sure so what do you think glitsky asked christmas for the trial next easter hardy said he didnt know how long freeman could delay if he wasnt going to make bail he wouldnt want to leave may in jail for a year awaiting trial i dont know maybe shell make bail glitsky said hows she gonna make bail elliot asked half a million dollars how much does david freeman charge half a million dollars if it goes a year it could easily come to that howd she get freeman anyway hardy asked glitsky shrugged if we only knew an investigative reporter or something shes got to have some money whats her house look like hardy asked apartment glitsky answered small nice but small maybe freeman is one of her clients elliot clearly liked the idea was warming to it thats it freeman is one of her clients nash was another glitsky held down his enthusiasm and the will is collateral on the come after he gets her off what will glitsky stopped short he took a beat then smiled down at the reporter did i say will i dont think i said will hardy shook his head no im sure i wouldve heard it i was right here and i didnt hear anything like will are we on the record here or what elliot leaned into his crutches come on guys hardy glanced at abe what do you think its gonna come out anyway abe said but it would be sort of nice to find out how freeman got connected to may pullios is really going for capital hardy nodded you heard her glitsky laid it out for jeff the million will the profit motive farris tentatively authenticating the handwriting well theres the money if he gets her off elliot said glitsky looked at hardy this guy must not know any defense attorneys he said then explaining jeff listen if theres one thing all defense attorneys do they get their money up front think about it hardy said youre found guilty you dont pay your attorney cause he didnt do the job youre not guilty you dont pay him cause you dont need him anymore either way your attorney is stiffed maybe youre grateful but not a half million dollars grateful maybe he just gets the rights up front for the book deal maybe thats his fee pico was telling me that we him and me ought to go for a book deal we found the hand after all hey rare for him glitsky got into it i arrested may i ought to get the book deal elliot said somebody is paying freeman you still dont think maybe hes one of her clients glitsky put a look on jeff a half million dollars worth of ass not including bail hardy put in glitsky said if she makes bail i dont know hardy said ive got a feeling here freemans going for delay he doesnt want delay if shes cooling her heels upstairs which means she makes bail i think youre innocent thats why this was not close to true david freemans words were tools to produce the effect he desired thats all they were may shinn was drinking chardonnay in a booth at tadichs grill david freeman her rumpled genius sat across from her before the arraignment hed gone down to her bank with power of attorney and withdrawn just about cleaning out her life savings hed known exactly the amount theyd set bail for hed gotten the clothes theyd taken from her and got them pressed before they gave them back to her hed bought her new makeup hed followed the story in the newspaper when he read of her arrest on saturday morning he knew he had to help her that she would need an attorney that a japanese mistress of a wellknown and powerful man was going to have a very difficult time making a defense against the arrayed powers now having talked to her he also had the advantage of believing she was innocent but i am unable to pay he lifted his shoulders sipped lugubriously at his own wine the curtain was pulled across the booth they had been through this before he had started by trying to convince her that he was taking her case pro bono once in a while he had told her you just had to do something because it was the right thing to do which had caused her to smile if i cant lie to you you should not lie to me may why would i lie she put her glass down twirled it around kept her eyes on him finally he cracked laughing at himself okay he said okay but its not a terrifically flattering motive its not been a very flattering few days she said no i guess not freeman drank some wine then took a breath and began until about ten years ago attorneys werent allowed to advertise did you know that she nodded and even now when its technically legal its still not particularly good for business unless youre doing divorce or dui or ambulance chasing i mean it kind of puts you in the lowrent market good attorneys dont advertise because they dont need to and if they do need to theyre not good he had a good smile a strong face sincere brown eyes a full head of dark hair its a vicious circle and i am advertising ive got seven associates left i had to let three go in the last twelve months business is terrible this is a highprofile case owen nash was a wellknown man it didnt surprise her she was to the point where she thought nothing could surprise her at least she knew but at the mention of owens name a shadow fell within her she didnt want to be sitting here drinking wine enjoying food i didnt kill him david he patted her hand across the table of course you didnt he didnt believe her hed told her saturday before theyd even talked before hed reviewed any of the prosecutions evidence that it was irrelevant whether or not shed killed nash he was going to get her off but i didnt he shushed her gently index finger to his lips i must say there is very little evidence that you did what about the will he brushed that away the will does the will put you on the boat did it give you the opportunity to kill owen did it give you the means you were home werent you she nodded all right then we will prove you were home the will like the rest of the socalled evidence is completely irrelevant what do they have the will the ticket to japan i thought the police would of course naturally he emptied the bottle into their glasses and continued with the litany there is nothing physically tying you to the gun no proof you pulled the trigger he held up a finger stopping her uh uh no more denials they dont matter you see there is nothing that could prove you did it i dont even see a case that will get to trial at the preliminary hearing we point out the racial discrimination mixed in with your profession its really not going anywhere there is simply no hard evidence may shinn was back in her apartment david freeman had driven her home then walked up and made sure she was safe inside her door she ran a bath and sank into the hot water letting the memories wash over her she thought it might have been the closeness to death that brought her and owen back to life the first couple of weeks they were inseparable she canceled her appointments with all her clients she didnt know who owen was then didnt know that he had money all she knew was he made her feel things that there was some connection between her mind and her body that shed lost touch with long before and now while it was back for however short a time she was going to keep it there was strange behavior they tied each other up blindfolded each other tried every position and every orifice they went outside at two in the morning and did it on the sidewalk they shaved each other bare he ate her with honey and chocolate and once garlic which burned hotter and longer than spanish fly owen had his appetites the man was also in fantastic shape big barrelchested hard everywhere he drank scotch and wine and brandy and took pills to get to sleep gradually she became aware that he was doing business from her house phone calls in the middle of whatever they were doing mention of the wheel taking care of his daughters problems he had a real life somewhere out there but it wasnt coming between them she didnt understand it exactly she just knew that in some unspoken way they were in this together finding something out something essential for them both to go on it wasnt the sex or at least it wasnt only the sex shed made her living from sex for fifteen years and none of it had seriously touched her her life even her professional life had evolved into something remote she made love with her clients but not every time she saw them when they needed it predictably missionary after the first few times then she was there often they couldnt make it more often they wanted to hug lie there afterward and talk she made them dinners too scampi in brandy raw oysters rare filet and cabernet shed turned into a great cook she sang for them played piano while they sat with their bourbon or gin gave them the companionship or escape or a kind of romance they didnt find in their homes owen though owen wasnt like anyone else and not just his hungers he didnt live a life of quiet desperation he wasnt looking for respite or peace or a sheen of culture laid on top of the vulgarity of the world hed seen it for what it was or more hed seen himself for what he was no games and she was with him the oblivion the sex the sex was the only way they both knew anymore to get to it to get underneath the crust something was cooking inside each of them threatening to blow if it didnt get some release get through the crust it was morning early before dawn the sky was gray in the east and still dark over the ocean may shinn had been out of bed for an hour walking naked in the dark she moved away from her turret windows and went back through the kitchen to the bedroom stopping to pick up her razorsharp boning knife owen slept on the bed breathing regularly on his back she put the edge of the knife up under his throat sitting watching him breathe the bedroom was darker than the rest of the apartment finally she laid the blade down across his collarbone and kissed him owen he woke up like no one else he simply opened his eyes and was all the way there what she moved the edge of the blade back up so it touched the skin above his adams apple do you feel this would this be a bad time to nod do you want me to kill you he closed his eyes again took a couple of breaths thats where were going isnt it he didnt move owen what are we doing he took a moment perhaps he didnt know either maybe they both knew and it scared them too much what are we doing she asked again were showing each other each other he swallowed she could feel the blade move over his skin i dont know what i feel you love me and as soon as he said it she knew it was true she felt her eyes tearing and tightened her hand on the knife and i love you he said but i dont want you to put your hopes in me im not saving your life may im what you want though thats right youre what i want but i play fair im telling you straight the best way i know how im a whore owen im nothing but i play fair too you know me i dont know how long ive loathed what i am i dont want to care about you but youre my last great chance owen had closed his eyes again she pulled the knife away from his throat ive warned you she said and ive warned you he pulled her down and kissed her held her against his chest the next morning pullios was sitting in hardys office when he walked in at she held the morning chronicle folded in her lap nice story she said she opened the paper to the frontpage article in its now familiar spot lower right state to seek death penalty in nash murder and under it da claims special circumstances murder for profit in tycoons death he came around the desk opened his briefcase started removing the work hed taken home and ignored some stuff hed let slide while concentrating on may shinn moses had come over worried about rebecca and about frannie and probably hardy too and had stayed to eat with them and hang out i read it he said im surprised elliot didnt get the news about the bail hardy stopped fiddling she made bail i had a feeling shed make bail freeman put it up pullios closed the paper placed it back down on her lap i dont know we can subpoena her financial records if we can convince a judge that we think she got it illegally not barsotti no i gathered that well look around how about prostitution last time i checked that was illegal maybe its a thought we should check it out she recrossed her legs look she said i came by to apologize again i was out of line it should have been your case im sorry hardy shrugged therell be other cases thank you she didnt try her smile or her pout cause were going to be busy i dont know hardy said weve got two months now and ive let all this stuff back up he motioned around his office now she was smiling but he didnt get the feeling it was for any effect you believe were going out on a prelim in two months i got that general impression pullios shook her head were not letting that happen theres no way freeman and barsotti are putting this thing off until next year i talked to locke after the arraignment and he okayed it were taking this sucker to the grand jury on thursday get an indictment there take it into superior court and blindside the shit out of the slow brothers can we do that we can do anything we want she said were the good guys remember i dont want to rain on this parade but isnt there some risk here what if the grand jury doesnt indict pullios rolled her eyes after youre here awhile youll understand that if the da wants the grand jury will indict a ham sandwich besides the grand jury always indicts for me weve got everything glitsky had which ought to be enough but if it isnt ballistics says the gun is the murder weapon but one thing okay but just one she smiled again they seemed to be getting along no leaks on this this is an ambush david freeman knew his major character flaw he could not delegate he couldnt even have his secretary type for him hed let janice answer the telephones okay put stamps on letters if they were in the united states and less than three pages more than that he had to weigh them himself and make sure there was enough postage he did his own filing his own typing he ran his own errands he was after melvin belli probably the bestknown lawyer in the city he had seven associates but no partners none of the associates worked for him recession or no for more than four years he burned em out they d come to him for trial experience but if you were a client and came to david freeman to keep you from going to jail he wasnt about to leave that up to phyllis or jon or brian or keiko he was going to be there inside the rail himself his big schlumpy presence personally making the judge and jury believe that you didnt do it his deepest conviction was that nobody anywhere was as good as he was at trial and if you hired the firm of david freeman associates what you got was david freeman and you got your trial prepared somewhat by associates at an hour when david got to the plate and he personally reviewed every brief every motion every deposition the price went up to and trial time was per hour it was his pride and he knew he carried it to extremes this was why private investigators existed to do legwork but no one did legwork as well as he did one time when hed just started out hed hired a private investigator to talk to all possible witnesses in a neighborhood where a woman had supposedly killed her husband the woman bettina allred had contended shed had a fight with her husband kevin all right shed even fired a shot into the wall terrified of herself and her own anger shed run from the apartment to go out to cool off while she was gone she said someone had come in and shot her husband with his own gun so the private investigator david hired had talked to everybody in the apartment and theyd all heard the fighting and shed obviously done it except the pi hadnt talked to wayne the thirteenyearold son who hadnt even been home during the relevant time when freeman doubledchecked as he always did he decided to be thorough as he always was and found that wayne had been hiding terrified in the closet and when mommy had run out hed taken the gun and shot his daddy hed had enough of daddy beating up on him and mommy since then freeman had done his own legwork though it was his precious time he only charged his clients the an hour he would have paid a private eye it was he thought one of the best bargains in the business no one in mays building had seen or heard her on saturday now he was going up the other side of the street ringing doorbells talking to people you see the turreted apartment on the corner up on the top over there anything at all shades going up blinds being pulled how about a shadow yes well its confidential but it has to do with a murder investigation jesus dont tell my boss i shouldnt have said anything the french deli across the street the cleaners on the opposite corner nada nada nada if may had been home as she claimed she had been invisible of course he didnt believe shed been home but as hed told her what he believed was irrelevant he was on the fourth and last floor of the building directly across the street from mays his feet hurt he was considering rashing his billing rate for this work up to an hour he rang the bell and listened to it gong for a moment no one answered there was one other door down the hall and it opened mr strauss isnt in can i help you mrs streletski was a welldressed elderly woman and he gave her his spiel she invited him in and forced him to drink a cup of horrible coffee she was sorry she couldnt really help him shed been out of her apartment for the last ten days in fact shed just gotten back from visiting over in rossmoor she was considering moving into rossmoor with hal they did so much there it was an active place even if you were a little elderly no one treated you like you were old there were lots of classes movies lectures it was a fun place a young place mrs streletski showed freeman that you couldnt see anything of mays building from her window he thanked her for the coffee and left his card so that mr strauss who lived alone next door could call him when he got in if he had the time hes not home very often im afraid she said he travels a lot hes always working he got divorced last year and i think hes very lonely weve played scrabble a few times and i tried to get him to go out with hal and me but i think he misses his wife and his boys well if you could have him call me he might have been home remember something she said she would he thanked her and started walking down the steps thinking that even when you didnt get anything this was probably worth more than call it an hour two months before you even set a date for a preliminary hearing hardy was biting his tongue held to the stricture not to leak anything about elizabeths upcoming appointment with the grand jury ken farris in the interview room down by the evidence lockers wasnt happy and hardy wondered how far he could go to make him feel better were working on something lame he knew lets hope so and meanwhile shes out walking around thats how it works farris shook his head hardy thought hed get away from it so how are things down in south city getting any better farris didnt look better there were bags under his eyes his shoulders slumped he sat kittycorner to hardy at a graytopped metal table his arms halfcupped protectively around the original of owens will mays gun was also bagged on the table the snake ring farris shrugged the stocks went down then back up weve got contracts people have work and life goes on he looked back down at the piece of paper in front of him this though this is unbelievable what was he doing whos that owen two million dollars christ celine told me she talked to you the man was jumping around trying to find a foothold hardy still wasnt comfortable talking about celine hed been able to put her out of his mind but if something came up that put her back in she tended to stay he didnt really understand it when did you see her sunday the cremation the cremation farris and celine they were both coming off that too theyd had a rocky week hows she holding up farris seemed to be studying the will some more what oh shes pretty fragile right now a little fixated on may i talked her out of going to court for the arraignment good idea whats she say about may she wonders why we waste all the time with arraignments and hearings and trials and then therell be appeals somebody ought to go and just kill her celine says shed do it herself try to talk her out of that too would you it would be frowned on youre sure she did it huh that woke farris up youre not whoa i didnt say that we just cant put her on the eloise its kind of a major detail well ive got her on the eloise celine told me owen was meeting her on the eloise hardy nodded she told me that too well well what its hearsay inadmissible bullshit she was on the boat i didnt say she wasnt were trying her for murder okay sorry farris looked down again tapped the paper this is definitely owen why didnt he tell me about it maybe he thought it would never come up how couldnt it come up if he didnt die hows that maybe it was a goof maybe he wrote the thing drunk she might have dared him or something the point is its here and its a damn good reason to kill somebody another one farris said what do you mean another one farris frowned as though surprised hed been caught saying anything out loud he rose from the chair pushing the physical evidence back toward hardy nothing he said figure of speech jeff elliot went blind in maury carters office it had started he guessed on the night after hed gone to the morgue the tension of those moments coupled with his first frontpage article and the background stuff had produced too much stress and there had always been and his doctors agreed a correlation between stress and the onset of his attacks but ms was a sneaky thing it wasnt like it came up and wopped you upside the head with his legs it had begun with pins and needles one morning his left leg just felt a little bit like it was asleep like a lowvoltage current was passing through it then over the course of a couple of weeks the feeling not only didnt go away it got worse and his leg became a weight he dragged around which was when hed gone to the doctor and the bomb dropped the right leg had gone two years later but since then hed had five good years three on prednisone and then because he hated the steroid trying to get along without it and he had come to think successfully so successfully that he hadnt really related it to the ms when he woke up with slightly blurred vision he ignored it if he wasnt looking directly at something it was nothing this morning though hed noticed it a lot the right eye didnt seem to focus at all and there was a brown smudge over half of what he could see through his left eye he should go to the doctor but this was the chance hed worked so hard for he was the man of the hour once he got a few more things tied up here hed go see about his vision maury carter did business out of a building about two blocks from the hall there was a blackandwhite fourfootsquare sign above the doorway outside bolted up against the old brick that read bail bondsman inside a desk for maurys secretary took up the big front window behind that desk were file cabinets and acoustic baffling that served to separate maurys private office from the street it was tuesday afternoon jeff had spent most of the morning following up on what hed missed the day before mays bail it wasnt a stopthepresses story anyway people even murder suspects made bail all the time but it bothered him that hed found it out on television he had to keep concentrating on his story not worry about his eyes and the real story now if it existed and he could get it was the shinnfreeman connection along with the fact that may had made bail hed discovered freemans billing rates so hardy and glitsky must have been right there was a source of money somewhere but dorothy maurys secretary said she wasnt supposed to talk about their clients but we can talk about anything else maurys over at the hall do you want to wait i can get you some coffee jeff thought she was about the nicest girl hed met in san francisco she wore a print dress and her skin was fair with a few freckles it occurred to jeff that she might even think he was okay in spite of his crutches she too was from the midwest ohio and had been out here for four months living with a girlfriend in the haight which wasnt anything like shed expected it to be she was going back to school to get her nursing degree shed already majored in bio so it shouldnt be too hard but she was going to be doing it at night and until then this job paid the bills jeff could have listened all day was even starting to feel comfortable telling her a little about himself he found himself looking around the growing brown smudge willing it away in the vision of her but then maury came in whod actually put up the bond and the reason jeff was here came back maury wasnt going to tell him though it was confidential information they were back in maurys part of the office now behind the partition but we know how much the bail was maury had a shiny deep forehead with white steelwool for eyebrows on the map of his face his nose was a small continent his ears stuck out and his jowls hung he leaned back in his chair feet on his desk and brought his cigar to his purplish lips he seemed to be enjoying himself blowing out a line of blue smoke he chewed reflectively on his tongue then what can i tell you may shinn put up fifty thousand dollars as you say you know how much the bail is jeff was fighting a kind of ringing panic attack he looked down at his notepad and found he couldnt make out what hed written there bail was half a million he persisted it was the stress this circular discussion he should end it and get out of here the room was closing in the cigar smoke the funny light lets be hypothetical he said your normal fee suppose im a client now is ten percent right maury threw him a bone and nodded blowing more smoke so if ive got bail of half a million i give you fifty thousand maury nodded that would be the fee yes was the smoke getting thicker the light worse maybe he was just getting dizzy he squirmed in his chair got the blood flowing a little then you pay that to the court it still wasnt clear jeff knew or thought he knew this stuff but suddenly it wasnt making any sense no i pay the court the half million all of it not the fifty thousand the full half mil maury pulled his feet down and pulled himself up to the desk look i keep the fifty no matter what thats my fee for incurring the risk lets face it these guys my clients call a spade a spade they got lousy credit hey are you okay jeff heard maurys chair move back it was funny it felt as though he just closed his eyes a minute then hed opened them again but if his eyes were open how come he couldnt see anything he guessed he was moving his head trying to scan the room and find a flicker of light the panic was taking over he had to get out of here he went to reach for where his crutches were but missed and knocked them to the ground now grabbing wildly at nothing pushing himself from the chair falling falling over the ringing that filled his head he heard maury yelling dorothy dorothy get in here after farris left hardy had put in what he thought was a pretty good afternoons work he pleaded out three assaults a purse snatching and two robberies a couple of dope cases were going to prelim a teenage gang member had tagged graffitied six police cars doing worth of damage hardy was moving toward the opinion that possession of a can of spray paint ought to be punishable like carrying a concealed weapon by mandatory jail time at fourthirty he left the office and went down to the youth guidance center where he talked a pregnant sixteenyearold girl into giving up the name of her thirtyyearold boyfriend who was letting her take the fall for a little friendly welfare fraud but like to a hole in a tooth hardy kept coming back to owen and may shinn the drive back home from the ygc top down on the samurai was over twin peaks down stanyan street and other sorrows by the shamrock then the aquarium golden gate park out arguello through the avenues it gave him enough time to worry it the motive thing was a real problem if they couldnt sell it to a jury they didnt have capital murder and hardy couldnt think of a rebuttal to his own argument if may had killed owen for the money did it make sense for her to leave it to chance that his body would be found he thought the answer had to be no resonantly obviously absolutely no so the strategic issue became whether they could keep freeman from asking the question he didnt see how but more immediately and this was what occupied him as he ran the red light on th once that initial chink in the motive worked its way around would the jury start losing faith in mays guilt altogether he heard the siren and pulled over to the right it was not yet six oclock a glorious night the warm spell miraculously hanging on he was surprised when the patrol car pulled in behind him and the cop got out how you doin hardy asked the cop nodded may i see your license and registration please hardy reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet he opened it to where he had his das badge pinned in across from his drivers license he was reaching across into the glove box to get his registration when he felt the cops hand on his arm sorry to bother you sir but you ran a red light back there hardy halfturned he must have he didnt even remember seeing it he apologized besides he had no intention of failing the attitude test the cop handed him his wallet eyes on the road huh gotcha he waited until the cop was back in his car then started up again getting into the traffic with a nice signal turning right off geary at his first opportunity hardy pulled up in front of his house still feeling foolish and a little guilty it was the first time hed experienced that particular professional courtesy getting a break on a ticket and he wasnt sure how he felt about it rebecca was in her stroller next to frannie who was sitting on the frontporch steps wearing sandals dolphin shorts and a tank top the sun hit her hair just right like a burning halo around her you ought to get prettier hardy said coming through the gate its hell coming home to an ugly woman and try to look a little younger while youre at it he was almost to her when she jumped with an animal growl she hit him high wrapping her legs around his waist her arms around his neck kissing him then biting his ear hard he held her marveling at her tininess her smell her fit to him okay okay i guess you dont have to look younger she clung to him wet willie she said hardy bore up under the torture see youre making the baby cry he took the last step to the porch and made a face at the baby its all right beck your mothers just a little bit insane im sure its not hereditary rebecca kept crying and hardy kissed frannie then let her down and reached into the stroller ill carry this neglected child he said you push the stroller they walked east on clement past the safeway and the little russian piroshki houses and oriental restaurants the antique shops rebecca now happy in the baby seat frannies arm through hardys his coat hung over the strollers handles they caught up on everything rebeccas spots mostly gone now the decision about the second car they were considering buying as soon as the shamrock profit payment came in which ought to be when the fiscal year closed this week picos weight which led to frannies own weight gain monitored daily the fourth of july picnic this weekend the pregnancy was going smoothly boys names girls names the ticket hardy almost got for running a red light they walked as far as park presidio over a mile before they turned around and started back home hardy told frannie about pullios and her decision to get an indictment before the grand jury move the proceedings to superior court why does she want to do that whats the problem with a delay i thought all trials took forever hardy walked on a few steps strolling really relaxed squinting into the sun this is a hot story shes not going to let it cool off jeff elliot frannie said exactly but weve got a real problem hardy briefed her on it moving on to what had concerned him when hed gotten pulled over the thing is once you start asking about the motive you open another can of worms if she did it for the money why did she dump the body but if she didnt do it for the money why didnt she burn the will or something right they walked along pondering it the sun had gotten behind the buildings it was not cold but there was a nip in the shade and hardy stopped and tucked his jacket around rebecca another thing too he said although i hate to mention it what the ring mays ring what about it he was wearing it owen was wearing it does that mean something i dont know what it means but it could mean that he put it on that he left it on that they had a relationship that he wasnt leaving her and if thats the case and if she wasnt killing him for money byebye motive thats a lot of ifs true but they dont start with an if he was wearing the ring couldnt they just have had a fight got to arguing the gun was there if that was it its not firstdegree murder its definitely not capital murder frannie hugged herself closer to hardy i feel sorry for the woman id hate to have you going after me i did go after you see she beamed at him thats what i mean there were things about the job glitsky would never love one of them was the reality of subpoenas and arrests the way you got people where you wanted them was to go out to their houses early in the am and knock on their doors astoundingly nobody expected to get arrested in the morning so it was the best time to make an arrest but hed been out last night on this driveby again they had received a tip probably from a rival gang but you took your leads where you could that the shooters car with a cache of weapons in the trunk was in a warehouse out in the fillmore so glitsky and a couple of stakeout officers had gone down there letting the warm evening dissipate into a bitter foggy cold as they sat drinking tea and eating pretzels in his unmarked car and waited for someone to come and open the warehouse which had happened and they found the guns tonights suspect coked out of his mind and scared to death had admitted that hed driven the car but theyd forced him man and he hadnt done any shooting that was tremaine wilson he was the shooter wilson this witness unlike devon latrice wortherington could actually put wilson in the car with a gun in his hand and if he didnt go sideways which he probably would when he straightened out glitsky might be able to make a case against wilson so now four hours of sleep later the dark not yet completely gone and the fog just as cold as when hed left it glitsky found himself once again in the projects the path to the door was a cracked cement strip that bisected a littered and wellpacked rectangle of earth that might as well have been concrete except for the stalk of a tree that had made it to about one foot before someone whacked it off now the bare twig struggling out of the ground maybe an inch thick struck glitsky as an example of what happened to anything that dared to try to grow up here as always they were going to try to do it neat and quick sometimes it worked sometimes not just in case though three uniformed officers had gone to cover the back door of the duplex glitsky had two other guys guns out behind him on the walkway and another team in the street out of their car and using it for cover on the not impossible chance that the frameless picture window would suddenly explode in gunfire it seemed a miracle that one of the streetlights still worked the halflife of a streetlight in any of the projects could be measured in minutes after nightfall before some sharpshooter put it out in the light from this one it was easy to make out the closed drapes in the front window the screen door hung open framed by a riot of graffiti glitsky looked at his watch the back entrance should be covered by now he turned around and gestured at the guys huddled behind the car out in the street they gave him the thumbs up the place was in theory secured now there was no fog and no cold and no darkness there was only his pounding heart and dry mouth it happened every time and the door to be knocked on three light taps he had his gun out and heard shuffling inside the rattle of chains and he was looking at a fouryearold boy shirt off feet in his pyjama bottoms rubbing his eyes with sleep whos at a womans voice behind him and the boy backed away leaving the door open glitsky didnt like the boy between him and his perp hed seen guys strung out on drugs or not take their own children hostage their wives mothers anybody who happened to be around glitsky didnt wait he had a warrant and tremaine wilson was wanted for specialcircumstances murder tremaine wasnt going to be getting himself any slick lawyer to bust him out on the technicality of illegal entry the boy had opened the door that was going to have to do he pushed the door the rest of the way open and stepped between the boy and his mother police he said so shed be clear it wasnt just another gang hit wheres tremaine one of the guys behind him hit the lights and a bare overhead came on the woman was probably twenty she had a swollen lower lip short cowlicked hair giant frightened eyes shed been sleeping in a mans plaid shirt that didnt quite make it down to her hips she made no effort to cover herself below but stood blinking in the light separated from her boy by this tall black man with a gun she made up her mind quickly pointing down a hallway and moving to clutch her son as soon as glitsky stepped aside the door to the room was open the light from the hallway didnt make it back this far one of glitskys men had stayed behind with the woman and her child so glitsky and his remaining backup moved quickly down the hallway the sergeant went through the open door his partner crouched in the dark hall gun pointed in there might have been a bed but he couldnt see it he flicked on the light another bare overhead there it was the bed against the other wall the only furniture besides a salvation army dresser the man stirred in the bed pulled the thin blanket over him cmon shit he said get that light glitsky was at the bedside pulling the sheet all the way down and off the bed at the same time putting the barrel of his gun against the mans temple wilson naked except for a pair of red bikini underpants blinked in the harsh light dont blink any harder tremaine glitsky said this thing might go off youre under arrest glitskys partner had his cuffs out was flipping wilson over snapping them in place glitsky went to the doorway and turned the light on and off the signal that everything was all right he heard the cops from outside come to the door he went out to the front room where the woman sat on the floor in the corner holding her son he lowered himself onto the green vinyl couch letting his adrenaline subside the domicile looked the same as all the others no rug no pictures on the walls stains here and there a lingering odor of grease musk marijuana holes in the drywall tremaine wilson untied shoes and no socks pants and shirt thrown on was led out at least it had been an easy arrest small favors now nine oclock tremaine booked glitsky was at the marina and he was cold july and cold again the past few days of warmth were already a dim memory he thought maybe he ought to start keeping a log of certain dates maybe the first of every month he could see it year after year a microcosm of san franciscos cute little boutique microclimate january cold february cold march april may cold and windy june and july foggy and guess what august chilly possibility of fog september and october nice not warm but not cold november december see january etc josé was out doing something with one of the lunatics who was taking a yacht out this morning onto the choppy bay glitsky stood over a portable electric heater behind the counter wondering what he was supposed to be doing here when hed gotten back to his desk from booking there had been a message to call pullios he found out she was taking the nash murder to the grand jury top secret and he should clear his calendar because he glitsky was going to appear tomorrow as a witness before the grand jury and explain that he arrested may shinn because he was sure she was trying to flee the jurisdiction to avoid her inevitable trial for murder and by the way did he think he could take another shot at a few witnesses before tomorrow and see if he could dig up any more evidence sure hed told her no problem always here to help except what witnesses the case was pretty characterized by lack of witnesses the only true interrogation hed written up was the night guard at the marina tom waddell and that he thought hadnt provided squat in the way of convictable testimony but you kept at this long enough you got a feeling about these things some cases were light on eyewitness testimony didnt mean they werent any good prosecutors were always wanting a little more a look under one more rock for that fabled smoking gun pullios had asked him how he really felt about the case against shinn and he told her he thought it was tight as a frogs ass watertight but not airtight airtight would be better she said so here he was and here was josé the morning guard back from the pontoons going straight to the coffee machine normally tea was glitskys drink but on less than four hours sleep he thought a little java wouldnt hurt him this was going to be another formal interview another report and he got josé comfortable sitting at his desk while he loaded a fresh tape into his recorder three two one he said he stopped smiled sipped at his coffee and listened to it play back okay this is inspector abraham glitsky star number i am currently at the office of the golden gate marina fort point drive with me is a gentleman identifying himself as josé ochorio hispanic male this interview is pursuant to an investigation of case number todays date is july wednesday at am q you have said that

the note from tom hed locked the boat which was wednesday right so i go check it its still locked thursday im sure si thursday i need to see you hardy felt his palms get hot he leaned back in his chair at his desk without thought he reached for his paperweight cradled the phone in his neck started passing the jade from hand to hand there was no mistaking celines husky voice ken says you dont think may did it im sorry i gave him that impression i do think may did it i just dont think its going to be easy to prove what do you need what do you mean what do i need i mean what could make it more obvious its obvious enough to me celine but our job is to sell that to a jury your job she said flatly its not our job its your job yes right she was breathing heavily even over the phone she might as well have been in the room with him it could be she was still worked up just off the phone from farris there was no avoiding it the principals the victims circle tended to talk among themselves what more do you need she repeated hardy temporized weve got more since i talked to ken weve got ballistics now mays gun did kill your father well of course it did weve known that all along he didnt know how to tell her they hadnt known it theyd just assumed it that the assumption turned out right was fine for them but it hadnt made the theory any more or less true before the ballistics report came in and her prints are on it and no one elses silence celine i need to see you i need your help im worried im afraid shes out on bail what if she comes after me why would she do that celine why did she kill my father to keep me from testifying i dont know but she might so far as i know celine were not having you testify at least not about that but i know she was on the boat how do you know that my father told me he was going out with her thats not evidence he heard her breathing again almost labored it is evidence he told me your father might have intended to go out on saturday with may but that doesnt mean he was actually out with her but he was how do you argue with this he thought the woman is struggling with her grief frightened frustrated by the systems slow routine he couldnt really expect a descartes here celine listen he filled a couple of minutes with glitskys saga of tremaine wilson how the first witness had known he was in the car holding a gun using the gun but he hadnt actually seen his face he knew it was tremaine hed recognized him skimask and all but there was no way to even bring that evidence to a jury because it wasnt evidence it was assumption it wasnt until the next witness showed up and could connect the car the murder weapon and undoubtedly tremaine that theyd been able to make an arrest its a little the same thing here celine she was unimpressed with the analogy she didnt want an analogy i need to see you she said for the third time she was fixating on him he didnt need this he didnt need any of it common though it might be his reaction to her was too unprofessional maybe on some level she knew that was reacting to it using it in her own desperation im here all day my doors always open not in your office my office is where i work celine that bar the last time that wasnt your office hardy was starting to know how people got to be tightasses it really was true that you gave people an inch and they took a mile they expected a mile you didnt give em the full mile and they felt betrayed her voice softened suddenly without the hint of a demand dismas please would you please see me he sighed he might know how people evolved into tightasses but that didnt mean he wanted to become one himself wheres a good place where are you now it was threethirty now and she was just going to change and then work out she would be at hardbodies near broadway and van ness until around six if he pushed it a little he could tell himself it was right on his way home jeff didnt have a private room but he had the window and the other bed was empty so it was just as good he was at the kaiser hospital near masonic and his window looked north the red spires of the golden gate poking through the cloud barrier beyond the green swath of the presidio closer in the fog had lifted and the sun was bathing the little boxes along the avenues jeff elliot wouldnt have cared if there had been a monsoon blowing out there over a slag heap at least he could see it his vision coaxed by the prednisone had begun to slide back furtive as a thief sometime early in the morning a dim lighter shadow amid all the darkness he was afraid to believe it this disease didnt give back it took away and kept what it took first his legs now his sight and besides there really wasnt anything to see some shapes but dark he could press his hands into his eyes and hold the pressure for a minute and there would be little explosions of light purple green white that seemed to take place inside his brain he didnt know if real blind people experienced that the stimulus though didnt come from outside light he was sure of that could it be his optic nerve was still working by morning there was no doubt at least he wouldnt thank god be stoneblind and all during the day between naps it had gotten better until now he could see not perfectly still fuzzy but enough dorothy burgess from maurys office had been in before shed gone to work that morning just to see if he was all right bringing flowers now she was coming through the door again visitors hours smiling concerned the most lovely sight he had ever seen she sat down how are you feeling he pushed himself up half sitting now much better i can see you he hadnt called his parents back in wisconsin he didnt want to worry them he thought hed call them when the attack was over when they could assess the latest damage after hed been admitted last night hed made a call to the chronicle but nobody from there had been in to visit he didnt know what to say to dorothy before the ms he hadnt done much dating to speak of and since losing the use of his legs his confidence in that area had dipped to zero hed concentrated on his career but he was doing all right he wasnt asking for anything more if you were crippled you couldnt expect women to be crawling all over you except the pitygroupies and he didnt want any part of them he knew he was probably the last midtwenties virgin in san francisco if not the known world and it was okay he could live with it at least he was alive you had to keep your priorities straight dorothy moved her chair against the bed and rested her arm down by his legs her hair was the color of wheat just before it was harvested the white blouse had a scoop neck a scalloped row of blue cornflowers that perfectly matched her eyes freckles on a tan bosom he found he couldnt stop taking her in like the air he breathed im staring she laughed more sunlight id stare too if id been blind yesterday im sorry he said he always felt apologetic about this damn disease i didnt mean to get anybody involved in all this dont feel like you have to come visit im okay it is a terrible inconvenience was she teasing him i was just saying to maury today i guess ive got to go visit that awful jeff elliot again he is really making my life difficult going blind in our office like that i was just saying i know what you were saying and its silly she patted his leg are they feeding you all right here he tried to remember i guess so i must have had something it doesnt matter ill be out tomorrow anyway they just wanted to observe me for the day kaiser she said keep those beds empty you never know when someone might need one its okay he repeated all i need is steroids i dont need to be in the hospital you need food i guess so i never really thought about it you never think about food i think about food all the time his eyes traveled down over her slim body where do you put it dont worry she said i put it now whos picking you up when you leave here how are you getting home he hadnt thought about that either he supposed hed take a cab he hoped his car was still parked in one of the handicapped stalls behind the hall of justice okay its settled then im coming by tomorrow taking you home and cooking you a meal after that youve just got to stop bothering me she stood up leaned over and kissed him dont get fresh she said then was gone hardy reflected not for the first time that he was too much in touch with himself wouldnt it be nice to sometimes be able to truly fool yourself not know every motive you had down to about six levels he wanted to see celine and not in his office that was the problem he had simply decided last week as soon as it had come up that he was not going to do anything about it it was too risky for him for frannie for the new life that was making him more content than hed ever thought possible it seemed to him that sometimes you met people who were immediately recognizable as having an almost chemical power to insinuate themselves into your life those people men or women could power your engines if you werent yet settled down but if you had a career and a family and a rhythm to your life a blast like that could only destroy things if you wanted to keep your orbit you avoided that extra juice simple as that hardy could control himself that wasnt it but celine was fire and the best way to avoid getting burned even if you were careful was to avoid the fire dumb he said pausing a moment before pushing open the semiopaque glass doors of hardbodies he was greeted by twenty reflections of himself mirrors mirrors on the wall can i help you the name tag said chris and chris hardy thought was the bionic man muscles on his muscles green hardbodies headband yellow hardbodies tshirt black spandex shorts wristbands on both wrists perfect shiny black beatlelength hair behind the long counter he could see three girls and four guys all from the same mold as chris im meeting somebody he said sure no problem chris said we got a pager at the desk here he heard her name called while he waited on a padded stool there werent any chairs only stools and little mushroom tables with magazines on them city sports triathloner maximum steel the competitive edge there was music playing heavybeat stuff he heard what sounded like a lot of basketballs getting dribbled on a wooden floor the place already seemed packed and people were filing by him as though they were giving away money in the back room suddenly though he jogged four or five days a week he felt old and flabby everybody in here was under thirty except for the ones who were fifty and looked better than hardy figured he had at twenty and celine who wasnt anywhere near fifty and looked better than any of the twenties even with a good sweat up especially perhaps with a good sweat up a blue sweatband held her hair back a towel was draped around her neck she wore a fluorescent blue spandex halter top soaked dark between her breasts the bare skin of her stomach gleamed wet and hard the leotard bottoms rose over her hips at the sides and dipped well below her navel in the front a spandex bikini bottom matched her top white reeboks he was standing almost before he was aware of it they were shaking hands hers wet and powdery she brushed his cheek with her lips then wiped the slight moisture from the side of his mouth sorry thank you for coming down hardy stood wanting to rub the spot on his cheek fire burns i feel a little funny here he said im afraid this isnt my natural environment especially dressed like this she took him in you look fine is there someplace to talk celine told him there was a juice bar on the second floor would that be all right hardy followed her up a wide banistered granite staircase to the upstairs lobby the entire space bordered by hitech metallic instruments of torture exercycles climbmasters rowing machines treadmills each was in use you couldnt avoid the panting the noise of thirty sets of whirring gears occasionally a moan or a grunt beyond the machines the glass wall to the outside showed off another of the citys famous views alcatraz angel island marin county you could see where the fog abruptly ended a mile or so inside the golden gate the juice bar was about as intimate as a railroad station but at least the noise level was lower the aerobic music wasnt pumped in here although it did leak from the lobby celine ordered some type of a shake that the perfect specimen behind the bar poured a bunch of powders into hardy thought hed stick with some bottled water he paid for the two drinks they sat at a low table in the corner of the room where the glass wall met brick do you come here a lot hardy asked sometimes its like i live here then since daddy she sipped her shake it works it off i dont know what else to do to fill up the time what did you do before what do you mean before your father died sometimes the best thing you can do is go back to your routines what you were used to a tanker that appeared through the fog bank on the bay seemed to take her attention for a minute but i didnt really do anything routinely she said i mean i dont work or anything i just lived now she let it trail off went back to staring did you see your father every day well not every when he wanted to see me i had to be there i mean i know that sounds weird but hed get hurt hed get hurt if you didnt drop everything to see him well not everything i had my own life too thats what i was talking about getting back to your own life she was shaking her head but its like theres no point to it now dont you see its like the centers fallen out yeah he said thats how it feels but it hasnt really youve got your own center you do you just have to find it again but he seemed to keep losing her again her eyes were out toward the evening sky celine he brought his hand up and laid it over hers exerting a little pressure she came back to him you mind if i ask you how old you are no i dont mind you can ask anything you want she met his eyes solemn then suddenly broke into a smile thirtynine she said almost got you didnt i hardy nodded smiling himself almost so what about thirtynine im just thinking thats not too young to stop being dependent on your father he felt the shift in her tension just before she pulled her hand out from under his i wasnt dependent on my father i loved my father of course im not saying anything else but well isnt thirtynine a little old to be at his beck and call i wasnt at his beck and call but he made you feel guilty if you werent there when he wanted to see you thats pretty classic parental control it just hurt his feelings i didnt want to hurt his feelings thats all hardy knew he was digging a hole but thought he might get all the way through to china and see some light remember when we were talking the other day what you said about being so mad at him maybe thats why im not mad at him kens the same way hardy leaned back slowing down wanting to make the point and not get in a fight over it your father controlled people celine ken too maybe thats why he was so successful my father did not control me she clearly didnt want to hear it time to back off okay okay and who are you to talk what makes you such an expert hardy help up a hand trying to slow her down whoa i didnt say i know what you were saying that my daddy was this control freak who was ruining my life because he loved his daughter and wanted to see her well thats all it was we loved each other we had the best times you didnt know him we loved each other she was starting to cry now punctuating her speech by punching her glass into the table other people were looking over at the commotion celine just go away i dont need your help go away leave me alone hardy leaned forward in the chair put his hand again on the table celine she slammed her glass down onto the table the drink spilling out over her hands over the glass get out of here now get out of here i think shes nuts shes bereaved diz the girls father dies you dont pick that moment to point out to her he was a prick i didnt say he was a prick i was trying to give her something to help her break away give her a little insight insight comes in its own sweet time thats beautiful mose ill remember that give me another hit would you hardy was drinking bushmills at the shamrock it was wednesday date night and he was meeting frannie at seven in another half hour there werent more than twenty patrons in the place and only two others at the bar nursing beers the little shamrock had been in existence since moses mcguire had bought it in and pretty much left it the way it had been the place was only fifteen feet wide wall to wall and about fortyfive feet deep the bar itself mahogany extended halfway to the back along the left side twelve tables with four chairs each filled the area in front of the bar on the linoleum floor over that area hung an assortment of bricabrac bicycles antique fishing rods an upsidedown sailfish and the pièce de résistance a clock that had stopped ticking during the great earthquake of the back of the place had an old walltowall maroon berber carpet and several couches armchairs coffee tables a fireplace it wasnt designed to seat the maximum amount of bodies but to make it comfortable for what bodies there were the bathrooms had stained glass in the doors there were two dart boards against the side wall in the back by an oldfashioned jukebox the entire front of the bar was comprised of two picture windows and a set of swinging doors out the windows was lincoln boulevard across the street was golden gate park evergreen and eucalyptus three years ago after working as a bartender there for nearly a decade hardy had acquired a quarterinterest in the place it was almost as much his home as his house was mcguire walked down to the taps and came back with a pint of stout and what i am supposed to do with this i see you come through the door i start a guinness its automatic so now i got a guinness poured and tonight youre drinking irish its that element of surprise that makes me such a fascinating guy to know tonight i needed a real drink my father told me that the secret to controlling alcohol is never to take a drink when you feel like you need one those are noble words hardy said aphorism night has come to the shamrock hit me again though would you moses sighed turned and grabbed the bushmills from the back bar and poured were never heeded in our own countries you know its the tragedy of genius leave the guinness hardy said ill drink it too moses pulled over his stool hardy had often said that mosess face probably resembled the way gods would look after he got old his brotherinlaw was only a few years older than hardy but they had been heavyweather years he had long brown hair with some gray ponytailed in the back an oftbroken nose there were character lines everywhere laugh lines worry lines crowsfeet he was cleanshaven this month although that varied so whyd she want to see you in the first place celine hardy shrugged hold her hand i dont know she seemed to be hurting i thought i might be able to help her out now im thinking we ought to get some protection for may shinn you dont really think shed do anything to her do you i dont know what shell do i dont think she knows what shell do moses took a sip of his own scotch a fixture in the bars gutter shes upset cant exactly blame her she probably wont do anything he said its the probably that worries me he took his dart case out of his jacket pocket and started fitting his handtooled flights into the shafts i think ill go shoot a few bullseyes he said do something im good at david freeman picked up his telephone it was after work hours but he was still at his desk back after dinner to the place he loved best he didnt have any particular work to do so he was doing some light reading catching up on recent california appellate court decisions for fun mr freeman this is nick strauss i got your card from a neighbor of mine mrs streletski how can i help you mr strauss its good of you to call as mrs streletski may have mentioned im working for a client who needs to establish what she was doing during the daytime on saturday june twentieth the woman in question happens to live directly across the street from you on the same level that other turreted apartment sure i know it but i cant say id know any particular person who lives there shes an oriental woman quite attractive id like to meet her i could use a little attractive in my life a little manly chuckle then strauss was quiet a moment sorry june twentieth you say thats the date i know its a while ago now no its not that normally i probably wouldnt remember its just thats the day i picked up my kids theyd been traveling in europe with their mother were divorced and i picked them up at the crack of dawn at the airport and they didnt mention anything seeing anything i dont know how they could theyd slept on the plane and were ready to go so we just stopped in to have a bite and drop their luggage then we took off exploring the city it was a great day really theyre good kids im sure but you saw nothing no sorry what did she do this attractive oriental woman shes being charged with killing someone although the case is weak if anyone saw her at home during that day we can make a case that there is no case ill talk to the boys doublecheck but i really doubt it whod she kill by the way freeman kept himself in check this was the natural question she didnt kill anyone mr strauss oh yeah thats right sorry its all right thanks for the call sure freeman sat back with his hands crossed behind his head so the alibi wouldnt hold up it was no great surprise the grand jury convened at ten am thursday july it was hardys first appearance there he wore a brandnew dark suit with nearlyinvisible maroon pinstripes a maroon silk tie black shoes when pullios saw him outside the grandjury room door she whistled looked him up and down youll do hardy thought she didnt look so bad herself in a tailored red suit of conservative cut instead of a briefcase she carried a black sling purse no notes she tapped her temple right here at her knock the door was opened by a uniformed policeman this was light years from the bustling informality of one of the municipal or superior court courtrooms the grand jury was a deck so heavily stacked in favor of the prosecution that hardy thought a case could be made against its constitutionality the fact that no one had brought such an appeal was probably a reflection of the reality that nobody representing the accused was allowed in the room he thought the prosecution winning on an indictment before the grand jury was kind of like a buick winning the buick economy run hardy sat next to pullios at the prosecution desk and studied the faces of the twenty jurors arranged in three ascending rows behind long tables he couldnt remember ever having seen such a balanced jury of twelve these twenty were comprised of ten men and ten women three of them two women and a man were probably over sixty four more two and two were he guessed under twentyfive there were six blacks two orientals he thought two hispanics most were decently dressed sports coats and a few ties for the men dresses or skirts for the women but one of the white guys looked like a biker short sleeves tattoos on his forearms long unkempt hair one woman was knitting three people were reading paperbacks and one of the young women appeared to be reading a comic book the room wasnt large it smelled like coffee at what would have been the defense table if there had been one was a large box full of donuts and sweet rolls that about half the jurors had dipped into the grand jury wasnt chosen like a regular jury if a trial jury was a time commitment and minor inconvenience for the average taxpayer selection to the grand jury was more like a vocation you sat one day a week for six months essentially cloistered and the only kinds of crimes you discussed were felonies and if you mentioned anything about the proceedings outside of this room you were committing a felony yourself there were stories impossible to verify that das had come in and said off the record i dont believe our eyewitness either weve got no credible evidence at this time but ive been doing homicides now for twenty years and i tell you unequivocally that john doe on the afternoon of whatever it is did kill four jane does now weve got to get this guy off the street before he kills someone else and he will ladies and gentlemen he will you can count on it i will stake my reputation and career upon a conviction but weve got to get this man indicted and behind bars and weve got to do it now of course they were only stories whatever the grand jury was a cornerstone of the criminal system and it behooved prosecutors to take it seriously which elizabeth did in spite of her ham sandwich rhetoric she stood up greeted the jurors pleasantly and began her attack ladies and gentleman of the jury this morning the people of the state of california present the most serious charge in the matter of the capital murder of owen nash you may have read in the newspapers something about this case and specifically you may be aware that the defendant may shintaka has already been scheduled for a preliminary hearing in municipal court in this jurisdiction however the delay proposed by the municipal court is in the opinion of the district attorney terribly excessive no doubt many of you are aware of the legal axiom that justice delayed is justice denied it is the contention of the people in this instance that the proposed delay would in fact constitute a denial of justice for this most heinous crime the crime of coldblooded premeditated murder for financial gain a crime that calls for the death penalty in the state of california pullios paused and walked stonefaced back toward hardy to where he sat at the table she picked up a glass of water took a small sip her eyes were bright she was flying immediately she was back to business hardy couldnt help but admire the show so in a sense she said the indictment the people seek today is simply an administrative strategem to move the trial for this crime to superior court where it can be heard in a timely fashion but in a greater sense an indictment before this body will reinforce the states contention that based on real and true evidence there is indeed just cause for issuance of a warrant for the arrest of may shintaka and a compelling need for a fair and speedy trial in pursuance of the interests of the people of this state hardy thought it was getting a little thick but he also realized that elizabeth pullios looking like she did and fired up as she was could probably read the telephone book to these people and keep their attention she went on to describe the witnesses she would call glitsky strout the cab driver the ballistics expert the two guards from the marina a handwriting analyst then she got to celine nash hardy remembered the other giant lapse in evidentiary rules before the grand jury hearsay was technically inadmissible but there was no judge or defense lawyer there to keep it out how could celine not have mentioned to him yesterday that she was testifying today well they hadnt had much time to get to it before she went off on him it could have been that the initial reason she called him was nerves over this appearance today testifying against shinn shed even said something about it hardy found himself unhappy in a hurry wishing hed reviewed the witness list before theyd come down here he still did have a lot to learn pullios had been doing her homework while hardy pursued his own agenda they were going to nail may shinn six ways from sunday then at lunch pullios told him she wanted him to take celine nash no way elizabeth shes mad at me he explained and she thought it over for a moment then overruled him no youre better just get her confidence back youve already got her confidence no i dont ive never met her personally but sergeant glitsky tells me shes stunning i guess pullios shook her head then its not a good match the jurors will see something between us it might even be there whats to see what are they looking for this will maybe sound arrogant but its true that people dont identify with two attractive women on the same side right now ive got the jury on my side our side if celine comes in human nature is going to tell the jurors that we she and i are natural enemies somebodys credibility is going to suffer whoevers its bad for our side if you question her theres no conflict its only natural shed want to cooperate especially looking all spiffy like you do today hardy shrugged pullios put her straw in her mouth and sucked up some iced tea youd better believe those jurors are a fairly good representation of the average man or average woman i couldnt care less if i sound enlightened or liberated or anything else im playing to win and im telling you that if i depose celine nash its a weak move we can probably afford a weak move okay but its a bad tactic you dont give anything away even to grand juries you still take your best chance every time and youre our best chance with celine she whispered she was sorry more mouthed it as soon as she sat down she was elegant in cool blue shed put on extra eyeshadow and hardy wondered if shed slept last night or cried it wasnt supposed to be lengthy all he was supposed to do was nail down what owen had said to her about going out with may on the day he was killed it had been the tuesday before the sixteenth in the morning she had called him at his office celine had intended to go away the upcoming weekend and wanted to make sure her father hadnt made plans that included her dont you think thirtynines a little old to be at his beck and call i wasnt at his beck and call my father didnt control me he put that out of his mind that was last night this was today he had a limited role and hed better keep to it and ms nash tell us what your father said regarding the day in question june twentieth she kept trying to catch his eye give him a look that promised forgiveness but he kept himself focused on individual jurors he would look at her as she answered questions he said he was planning on going over to the farralons on saturday with his girlfriend with may had he told you of such plans in the past yes all the time and in your experience did your father tend to follow through on these types of things this was shooting fish in a barrel he kept expecting to hear somebody object to the nature and thrust of his questions but since there was neither a defense attorney nor a judge in the room he could ask what he liked always if daddy said he was going to do something he did it all right but just for the sake of argument what if for example ms shinn had gotten sick saturday morning daddy would have done something else he wouldnt have wasted a day he wouldnt have done that he wouldnt have gone out alone perhaps since hed already made those plans celine gave it a moment chewing on her thumbnail no i dont think so he wasnt a solitary man besides we know he didnt go out alone dont we youre right ms nash we do indeed we do it took until threethirty but they got the indictment there was no immediate flurry of activity the bail was still in effect there would be no immediate arrest of may shinn but the fur would really begin to fly when david freeman got the news which would be very soon meanwhile hardy packed his briefcase hoping that celine nash had decided not to wait around until the jury adjourned celine fell in beside him just outside the door i am sorry she said she linked an arm through his and he felt the heat of her body where they came together its okay people get upset it happens i dont know what happened i didnt mean for anything like that to happen its all right forget it well just move ahead on the trial it ought to go pretty quickly now he had stopped walking waiting by the elevators she was standing too close and his heart was beating enough that he felt it what do you want me to do celine i just dont want you to be mad at me im not mad at you i was out of line it wasnt exactly professional i dont care about professional thats our relationship he said clearly as he could say it then it doesnt matter it does it does matter do you know what it is to be completely alone not a professional question the elevators opened jammed as usual hardy got in celine cramming next to him thigh to thigh arm in his he smelled the powder she used the same powder shed left on him as shed greeted him with a kiss at hardbodies last night that hed scrubbed off in the shamrock before frannie had come in for date night he didnt press the button for his floor and they rode it all the way down to the street level in silence everyone else chattering away they went outside the front doors turned east on bryant away from the bright sun a cool wind was up off the bay they went two blocks before hardy said he did know what it was to be alone celine took that with no response then you must think im crazy he grinned tightly people do crazy things it doesnt necessarily mean theyre crazy it doesnt hardy walked a couple more steps i dont know maybe it does it was a little cuban coffee shop unnamed dark as a cave the table was of finished plywood there were seven such tables four with people at them a spanish television station whispered from the back corner the good smell had stopped their walk and brought them inside they were drinking café con leche made with heated carnation evaporated milk sweet if you walked in and saw them sitting across from one another aside from knowing they didnt belong here in their anglo clothes and complexions you would assume many true things about them though they didnt know each other very well there was a powerful attraction between them they had to control it by putting the table between them they werent lovers if they were theyd have moved together well maybe they were in the middle of a fight but they werent acting angry no the first call was right they were getting to something the man was leaning forward hands clenched around the wide deep coffee cup he was more than leaning in fact more like hunched over rapt mesmerized she seemed more controlled but there were giveaways invitations she sat sideways to him very well put together her dark suit was muted but a lot of her excellent legs showed tightly crossed and curled back under her chair she held her cup lightly in one hand her other extended out subtle enough toward him there if he wanted it if he dared take it she was doing most of the talking you would think this might be the day they would do it from here theyd go to one of their places or maybe a motel you could feel it even halfway across the room after dorothy had gone jeff elliot called parker whitelaw at the chronicle and told him his sight had returned hed be back at work the next day this wasnt completely true but parker wouldnt have to know it most people were ignorant about how ms worked they could see the results the weakened limbs weight loss lack of coordination but they had no clue about the way the disease progressed jeff thought this was just as well it was actually to his advantage if parker thought that whatever had laid him up for a day had now completely passed and he could go back to being the ace reporter hed been before in reality his sight was still very poor yesterday which had begun in total blackness had heartened him as some sight then quite a bit had returned but testing it he found the left eye still all but worthless the brown smudge blotting all but its extreme periphery the right eye was a little better the range of vision was wider though all of it was fuzzy but he thought that he could get by he didnt particularly think it would be wise to try and drive but he could fake the rest the doctor had told him that since there had been some almost immediate remission in the total blindness there was a small chance he could expect gradual improvement with continual steroid treatment he might even regain normal sight maybe this morning he called maury carters office and told dorothy he really had to go in to work but he would like to see her tonight as theyd planned well how are you getting to work ill just take a cab she wouldnt hear of him taking a cab she told him she could take some time off maury feels terrible about this too hes a nice man underneath and be down there by lunchtime would he please wait for her you dont have to do this of course i dont who said i did they let him take a shower and shave he still had his clothes from two days before but they were okay better by far than the gown dorothy was there by twelvethirty and pushed him in a wheelchair out to her car the morning fog out in the avenues hadnt burned off and the daylight glared she put his crutches in the trunk and he got himself settled on the passenger side in the front seat his legs werent completely dead yet they had sandwiches at tommys joynt and he got to the office close to four she left him at the chronicles front door and said shed be back at six hed better be there shed kissed him again he had a message from an elizabeth pullios at the district attorneys office and the memo line said it was regarding owen nash it brought everything back the bail question hardy and glitsky freemans strategy he hoped he hadnt missed much in his day away he returned the call to pullios and scanned the last two days newspapers turning up his desk light squinting at the blurry print after the little blurb on page nine that may had made bail the story disappeared of course theyd dropped it nothing had happened the courts decision to schedule the prelim at the end of the summer had taken the wind out of those sails it was frustrating unless he found something about the freemanshinn connection he was going to have to get himself another story another scoop he loved being on a hot story it changed his whole view of the job the world people cared about him asked his opinion included him in their jokes he wasnt just that crippled guy anymore the phone rang and it was pullios she didnt know if hed heard from hardy or anyone else but the grand jury had just indicted may shinn the case was going to superior court she just thought hed like to know the grandjury story was written and submitted parker had come by impressed by the line on the grand jury parker said it was good to see a reporter hustling working his connections it might be oldfashioned reporting but it got the best results by the way how were the eyes fine the eyes were fine dorothy was at the curb at six sharp the door opened and waiting for him he saw flowers in the backseat a brown grocery bag with a loaf of french bread sticking out the top he lived in a firstfloor studio apartment on gough street where it leveled off at the top of one of san franciscos famous hills my isnt this cheery she said the room featured sconced lighting hardwood floors and a mattress on the floor in one corner in the other corner there was a stack of old san francisco chronicles about three feet high the white walls were bare except for one blackandwhite poster of albert einstein daily reminding jeff that great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds the rest of the furniture consisted of a stool pushed under the overhang of the bar that separated the cooking area from the rest of the room dorothy picked up the mail that was lying on the floor and put it on the bar along with her bag of groceries she held up the flowers any old vase will do she said dont break out the steuben he loved the way she talked not mean but squeezing out the drop of humor in situations like his apartment he hadnt wanted to come here but shed teased him into it didnt get time to call your girlfriend huh afraid shell be mad theres no girlfriend dorothy well see about that now here they were she cut the top off a milk carton and poured out the four ounces of sour milk that was left in it its so neat you make your own yogurt and arranged the flowers a mixed bouquet of daisies california poppies and daffodils sitting them at the end of the bar she made him chicken breasts with onions and peppers and mushrooms and some kind of wine sauce that they poured over rice they ate on the floor their places laid on a blanket from the bed folded over when theyd finished dorothy pulled herself up and leaned against the wall she patted her lap why dont you put your head here his eyes hurt and he couldnt see her clearly the only light theyd eaten by was cast by the tiny bulb over the stove he put his head down on her thigh and felt her lingers smoothing his hair can i ask you something he asked im sorry im afraid not then her finger ran along his cheek she flicked his chin lightly youre a bit of a bozo anybody ever tell you that no people dont kid with me people are missing out she said what did you want to ask me there was no avoiding it he had to know why are you doing this being nice to me oh i get four units for it its a class project now she took his cheek and gave him a hard squeeze havent you ever had any girl like you sure well not since what your legs he shrugged you know the whole thing i dont know what whole thing your personality get deformed or something its just a lot to ask somebody to deal with it seems like it might just be a good crutch no pun intended i mean nobodys perfect you get involved with somebody youre going to have to deal with their imperfections yeah but romance doesnt exactly bloom when you see them right out front sometimes it does she said less gets hidden it might even be better its definitely better than being fooled and finding out later i dont see too many of yours imperfections i mean well thats just a fluke it so happens i am the one person who doesnt have imperfections her fingers were back in his hair pulling it except i warn you now i am pretty typea i like a clean house if you squeeze the toothpaste in the middle i go insane i need to fill up ice trays immediately nothing makes me madder than a halfempty ice tray also im impatient and outspoken although i have to say im not really bitchy but im very organized too organized those are not exactly major imperfections im also pushy and pretty selfish i think of myself first a lot what i want i havent seen any sign of that not with me at least yes you have she dipped her finger into her wineglass and traced his lips with it if you think about it for example i am in a highly selfish mode right now hardy was back where it started at the shark tank at the steinhart aquarium he sat on the gurney listening to the vague bubblings and vibrations emanating from the walls around him although he knew the water in it wasnt even remotely warm a thin veil of steam rose from the circular pool in the center of the room the walls were shiny with distillation the light dim and somehow greentinged hed let himself in with his own key after dinner frannie had been tired and hed felt flabby and soft so he changed into some sweats and told her he was going for a run why didnt she turn in early now it was close to ninethirty he hadnt done much running more a forced walk to no destination in any event it had taken him here hed worked up a light sweat and he sat his elbows on his knees his hands intertwined in front of him do you know what it is to be completely alone he certainly did he was there now his family was at home some of his friends undoubtedly were a quarter mile away at the shamrock he could call glitsky or pico go out and drink a few brewskis shoot some darts but he knew somehow that none of that would make a difference he was completely alone knocked out of his orbit trying to feel the pull of the other bodies the old familiar gravity he couldnt get it couldnt get to it the thing to do he thought was to go into drysdales office tomorrow morning and resign just stop shut down the rockets go back and ask moses for his old shift at the shamrock and go back to that earlier life he didnt need the money he could walk out on the law right now and the world would keep right on turning may shinn would still go to trial pullios would get another notch in whatever it was she notched stiffly he pushed himself up off the gurney and walked up to the side of the pool a concrete ring four feet deep he had his hands in the front pockets of his sweatshirt felt his keys on the right side there was only one other person in his orbit right now and she he believed was completely alone too yesterday hed thought maybe she was crazy today he saw it differently celine was barely holding herself together her father had been her life whether or not you liked or admired owen nash whether their relationship was good or bad control or no control she was left with a gaping hole if shed broken down around hardy it had been because she was strung too tightly holding it all back thats why the long workouts to loosen the coil but it wasnt working not yet anyway she was trying and shed get there she knew what she needed she needed some surcease from the emptiness the loneliness the pain of the fresh wound she was trying she just needed time and one other thing face it she needed him for whatever reason he was the lifeline like shed said she didnt care about their professional relationship he was connected to her which was exactly why he should quit this wasnt his job it wasnt his concern it couldnt be in his life but she was he tried to tell himself it was the level he had to control he could not allow himself to do anything to threaten frannie she too depended on him and so did rebecca and the unborn child if he had any view of himself at all it was he hoped as a man of some honor and hed given frannie his absolute vow and he loved frannie his life satisfied him his own endless emptiness seemed to have vanished over the last year thanks to her she was his rock and he knew he had to get back to her orbit his own salvation he knew lay there with her but he also knew he wasnt going to quit either the law or the case and he knew why he hoped normally he didnt pray but he prayed he wasnt going to do anything about the attraction the connection he told himself again that he could keep the level under control but if celine had to see him again he would see her he would have to see her beware of what you wish for you just might get it judge leo chomorro had heard it a thousand times from his father it had always struck him as misguided advice the way you got things was to wish for them focus on them it had gotten him everything he had today a judgeship by forty a beautiful wife three intelligent children a home in st francis wood but lately he was beginning to think that his fathers advice might have had something to it after all he had wished and wished that someday he could get out from under the burden of being a good administrator which was itself something to be proud of leo had always been an organizer a team player intelligent enough to be a leader but a subscriber to the theory that a good leader must first know how to be a good follower and his talents had gotten him out of modesto and his fathers auto shop he always thought it was his study habits more than his brains that had pulled him through san josé state and then gotten him into hastings law school in san francisco at hastings he hadnt made law review hadnt been in the top ten percent hadnt been rushed by the big firms but hed gotten through passed the bar on the second try got a job as a clerk for the state attorney general he worked hard no one could say he wasnt a loyal and diligent staffer and when the attorney general finally made it to the state house leo was a top aide on budgetary issues he was the organization man efficient and objective guys werent doing their jobs fire them they got families tough they should have worked harder seen the ax coming the numbers of the budget game appealed to him it was pretty simple you had so much money to spend first you looked around at who had been good to you then you factored in services you needed and you cut where you had to or wanted to make a point where the system wasnt working efficiently and then you made the numbers balance for an organized guy like leo it was a cakewalk for example during some budget committee meetings leo had made a big stink about liberal judges especially in san francisco getting paid a lot to do nothing letting off people caught in stings like that clip clip cut back on salary adjustments do away with judicial raises of course to survive yourself you didnt make too many friends you really couldnt afford to you had allies instead the attorney generalturnedgovernor for example was a damn good one leos wife also gina brilliant much smarter than he was and attractive a santa barbara republican shed been a staffer too but after theyd had leo jr all thought of politics left her head now she was an ally she was loyal and did her jobs that was life right and then according to plan leo got what hed wish for on his way out of office his mentor the governor had rewarded him for his sixteen years of loyal service by appointing him to a judgeship in san francisco except that now that he was here he found the job had all the glamor of a stockyard except the cattle were human before leo chomorro had arrived eighteen months before calendar judges in the city and county of san francisco were rotated every six months the work was so dull that no one could be expected to keep at it longer than that but leos budgetary philosophy when hed been with the governor combined with his lack of belief in personal friendships had created for himself a cloud of political resentment and san franciscos judges wasted no time putting him in his place which was calendar where he had remained and remained it was ironic leo was a judge who believed there was justice in the world or should be he had believed that if you worked hard and did a good job people came to value you you got promoted you moved up ha today tuesday july leo chomorro sat sweating under his robes in department overseeing work he wouldnt have assigned to his clerk the calendar was a necessary evil in all larger jurisdictions there had to be some mechanism to decide which suspects went to what courtroom whether or not cases were ready for trial all of the administrative work that went along with keeping eight courtrooms and their staffs reasonably efficient so the criminal justice system could keep grinding along it was the kind of work for which leo was suited by experience and temperament he thought hed never get out of it and it was driving him mad okay trial calendar line six what have we got here this morning was never going to end the bailiff brought in line six all the cases were given line numbers off the huge computer printout that had to be processed every monday except monday had been a holiday so the list was longer he forced himself to look up line six was a guy about leos age and like leo an hispanic although leo couldnt have cared less about his race line six shuffled behind the bailiff to the podium in front of the bench mr zapata was represented by the public defender ms rogan chomorro looked down at the list for the next available judge fowler department he intoned the name and department excuse me your honor leo looked up any interruption any change in the deadly routine was welcome it was the summer clerk whod been quietly monitoring proceedings at the das table all morning may i approach the bench the boy reminded leo of himself when hed been a student dark serious intent fighting down his nerves he whispered mr drysdale would like to ask you to reconsider your assignment of mr zapata to a different department leo chomorro cast his eyes around the courtroom he and art drysdale went over the calendar on disposition of cases every friday night and hed mentioned nothing about zapata at that time well maybe something new had come up but art wasnt in the courtroom where is mr drysdale hes in his office your honor he asked if youd grant a recess when did he do that if hes not here thats all hes asked me to say your honor if you could grant a recess and call him leo frowned he wanted to keep things moving but felt empathy for the kid and drysdale made up the calendar with him every week in a world full of no friends art was as close to one as he had he looked up at the defendant mr zapata sit down well take a tenminute recess its pretty unusual art its circumvention i know it is drysdale wasnt going to sugarcoat anything this was lockes call and he was delivering a message that was all he was sitting back comfortable in the leather chair in front of chomorros desk we dont want zapata going to fowlers department he threw out the last one i know i read about that zapatas another sting case art nodded i just plain missed him on friday or i would have mentioned it then chomorro was moving things on his desk ive already assigned it art rogan might make a stink hed called out department fowlers courtroom if the defense attorney hed appointed was on top of things shed know fowlers position on these kinds of cases from rogans perspective fowler was a winner for her client hed throw out the case any other judge probably would not art leaned forward were ready to lose one like that what we dont want is fowler getting any more of these start another landslide and screw up this program chomorro shuffled more paper his life was shuffling paper he didnt believe he could do what art was suggesting it was at the very least close to unethical the da or the defendant could challenge one judge on any case a judge could be recused from a case because of conflicts of interest because he or she knew the defendant for no reason at all but such a public challenge always involved a political fight that both sides lost usually such problems were settled privately in the chambers of the master calendar department certain cases just never happened to be assigned to certain judges but here mr zapatas case had been publicly assigned for trial i dont think i can do it art drysdale wasnt surprised he nodded then leaned forward forearms on knees and settled in leo your honor how long have you been on calendar here it took chomorro a minute a subtle shift in posture like arts own his mouth creased up year and a half maybe any talk of you getting off chomorro shrugged somebodys got to retire soon die im the low man art leaned back the job used to rotate leo you know that again a tight smile id heard that rumor but if somebody carries a grudge around maybe a little superior attitude doesnt make any friends do any favors art held up a hand im not talking illegal im talking little things amenities things could change thats all im saying chris locke is pals with some of your colleagues so is rigby they both like this program the one that got zapata and no one not even fowler is denying these guys are stealing theyve still got to be found guilty by a jury they get a fair trial were not circumventing justice here maybe just finetuning the bureaucracy chomorro did not for a moment buy drysdales argument that they werent circumventing justice of course they were but chomorro was not a newcomer to politics deals he knew a deal when he heard one and assuming you were going to play it wasnt smart to leave things up in the air labor day he said im off calendar by labor day art drysdale stood up reached his hand over the desk done he said line six mr zapata was back up at the podium im sorry there was a scheduling conflict my mistake the trial will be in department he looked down again making sure twentyfour judge thomasino leo watched line six being led out in his yellow jumpsuit time was standing still it wasnt yet noon and hed just had a recess his blood was rushing well it was done it was possible that ms rogan would never understand the significance of the change of department art would make sure he would be forewarned on any other zapatas and the whole thing would never have to come up again still he shook himself chilled in the hot room on the arraignment calendar line one thirtyseven the clerk intoned penal code section murder suddenly the chill was gone something about murder cases got your attention even when you were already familiar with them this was the one he and elizabeth pullios had discussed after the indictment on thursday owen nash they were dragging their feet over in muni and the da wasnt going to stand for it on friday art drysdale told chomorro it would hit this morning and they were going to move ahead if not with haste then with dispatch send a little message to the junior circuit line may shintaka had surrendered on the grandjury indictment and bailed again she was in the gallery chomorro had noticed her earlier this morning the one flower in a field of weeds this was line he raised his eyebrows then looked back down now she stood unbowed at the podium next to her was david freeman about the best defense attorney in the city the defendant and her rumpled attorney were a study in contrasts leo theorized that freemans sloppy dress was a conscious ploy to appeal to juries as a common man one of them regular folks but regular folks didnt make half a million or so a year mr freeman he said how are you doing today freeman nodded fine thank you your honor during his recess with art elizabeth pullios had come into the courtroom and sat at the prosecution table with her second chair one of the new men he nodded to them is the prosecution ready to proceed i object your honor freeman wasting no time we are your honor simultaneously from pullios grounds freemans voice rose as your honor knows municipal court continued proceedings on this matter until after labor day well youre in superior court now mr freeman whats the point there is no evidence to support freeman stopped started again the preliminary hearing would have revealed insufficient evidence to proceed to trial your honor evidently the grand jury doesnt agree with you they issued an indictment your honor pullios was standing the people chomorro brought down his gavel excuse me ms pullios i understand the peoples position here mr freeman were not going to debate the evidence at this time thats for a jury to decide perhaps a request for a shorter continuance in municipal court could have avoided this problem your honor my client should not be subjected to the expense of a trial on this charge im going to move for remand back to municipal court chomorro smiled freeman was pulling out the stops early im afraid that option is foreclosed mr freeman defense counsel didnt seem to take a breath this hurryup show trial is clearly motivated by states counsel enjoying the publicity of this high profile your honor i object chomorro nodded to pullios i think i would too freeman kept right on to say nothing of the blatant racial and class discrimination evidenced by mr freeman enough i remind you that this court operates under the grandjury system i will not tolerate these outbursts the prosecution says it is ready for trial if their evidence is weak it seems to me that should be to your advantage all right then chomorro didnt even have to look down to see where the next trial was going it sounds like there will be extensive motion work in this case im sending the whole matter arraignment motions pretrial and trial to department twentyseven judge fowler forthwith you can fight it out down there he brought his gavel down again allowed himself a small smile goodbye counsel now it wasnt a long walk down the hallway so there wasnt much time for hardy to tell pullios about his relationship with fowler it doesnt matter she said have you discussed the case with him outside the office no no place in fact then i wouldnt worry about it it was another opportunity to remind him of their respective positions so she took it besides youre not the attorney of record here i am youre assisting me i think if freeman even gets a whiff of it though hell move to dismiss freeman moves to dismiss if the bailiff has a runny nose so what so im a little worried about it she stopped and faced him dismas look hes not your fatherinlaw anymore is he no so essentially it boils down to the fact that youve met the judge socially well ive met the judge socially and we get along like pickles and milk i wouldnt be surprised if freemans met him socially hell theyre both in the rich mens club they probably play poker together maybe they trade stock tips its irrelevant judge fowler and you are not related legally or otherwise its not an issue pullios hardy thought was good on things that werent issues she was good on everything it got to you pullios got to the doors of department and held one of them open for hardy age before beauty she said the orbits had aligned themselves friday had been a busy day a couple of prelims some plea bargaining a lunch with four of the office gang nobody even thinking about homicides frannie and hardy had made love twice over the long fourth of july weekend the first time friday night intense and silent then the closeness body to body lying there talking until after midnight saturday was the picnic with moses his current girlfriend susan all the glitskys and pico with angela and their kids and rebecca was healthy again finally her jolly gurgling wonderful little self baseball beer and barbeque americas birthday party on another miracle of a warm day then sunday morning they went out for brunch and shared the best paella in the city afterward back home frannie telling hardy it was okay rebecca might remember that her parents had laughed and wrestled a lot when shed been a baby but it probably wouldnt damage her psyche on monday the sixth back on his own center again hardy and frannie had spent the morning stenciling some pastel horses and dolphins onto the wall in rebeccas room in the afternoon he did a little work in his office asking if abe could get hold of may shinns phone records for the day owen nash had been killed he realized that if she had made a call on that day their case was in trouble and as far as he knew no one had checked those records he asked abe if they could pinpoint flurries of gas or water use electricity anything that might indicate somebody had been home and abe had told him no those utilities werent monitored that way celine wasnt clouding things hardy knew that pullios in a hurry was not the imperial wizard of detail and after his oversights on thursday with the grand jury he was simply doublechecking himself jeff elliot hissed at him from the gallery side of the rail in department he must have also been in for calendar though hardy his mind on other things hadnt seen him in fact come to think of it hardy hadnt seen jeff for a few days and now he didnt look so good his face was puffy and he was wearing dark glasses even here inside the courtroom still he was smiling his usual highenergy self and why not his story was back in the fast lane jeff was motioning him back toward the rail he nudged pullios thats elliot back there he said the reporter you wanted to meet him oh she said good she was putting down some papers starting to turn hardy waiting when the bailiff called out hear ye hear ye department of the superior court of the city and county of san francisco is now in session judge andrew fowler presiding all please rise the judge appeared in his robes from chambers elliot would have to wait seeing andy hardy felt a twinge of guilt he hadnt followed up worth a damn on seeing how the judge was doing whatever it was that had been bothering him he should have called and set up a squash date something he hadnt heard from his exwife jane either maybe the crisis if there had been one had passed certainly up on the bench andy looked as he always did magisterial and commanding he gave hardy a friendly nod his eyes rested on the defense table for a moment may shinn was looking directly at him meeting his gaze she was one tough lady although antagonizing a judge wasnt recommended defense strategy freeman was busy emptying his briefcase he seemed to miss the exchange of glances fowler broke first his eyes drifting back to pullios then hardy again he arranged some work in front of him while the bailiff read the indictment again section murder the gallery had filled up already it was so unlikely as to be impossible that the trial would begin today normally the earliest trial date would be sixty calendar days from the arraignment but setting that date would be up to fowler it was his courtroom nevertheless a murder trial especially this one was news after the indictment on thursday hardy had heard that locke had gotten calls from newsweek time all the big ones they couldnt escape it fowler welcomed counsel to his courtroom he barely got a word in before freeman predictably requested his continuance the district attorney was using this as a publicity vehicle there was racial discrimination hardy heard it with half an ear fowler listened to most of it nodded sympathetically then touched his gavel to its block well set a date now mr freeman and before that if there is good cause for continuance you can make a motion he smiled that was the end of that story the trial would begin about when the municipal court would have held the preliminary hearing this was a good sign the judge adjusted his robes and addressed the courtroom mr freeman he said did you have the opportunity to exercise a challenge in department twentytwo defense counsel had a onetime right to challenge the judge to which the trial had been assigned on no grounds whatever if freeman didnt like andy fowler for any reason on earth he just had to say so and they would go back to calendar for another department but freeman barely rose to answer the question no challenges your honor fowler paused a minute his face darkening mr freeman freeman was still fiddling with his binders laying out papers whispering to may i said no challenge your honor the judge seemed to be moving things around behind the rim of his desk he leaned back in the high chair arms straight out before him his frown was pronounced the instant passed would defense counsel approach the bench please hardy became aware of a growing stillness in the courtroom as freeman pushed his chair back patted may on the shoulder and stepped up before the judge fowler leaned over and there was the briefest of whispered exchanges after which he straightened up hit his gavel and announced a recess he would see mr freeman in his chambers what the hell is going on pullios asked hardy i dont have a clue maybe theyre trading stock tips again jim blanchard from the tribune came up and touched elliot on the shoulder you got a call upstairs some girl jeff had been trying to get hardys attention since the recess was called he knew there was an element of cheating in it but he had to get caught up since he hadnt given five minutes of thought to anything but dorothy burgess since thursday night he thought he would use hardy to catch up grab back the inside track he seemed to have lost to both the local and national media over the long weekend and now it looked as though something between freeman and fowler was happening right here at the outset he wanted to be here when the judge returned to court see if an explanation would present itself but dorothy it had to be dorothy was the priority there would be other stories he would not have traded the last four days for anything not for his job not even for the use of his legs hardy and pullios appeared to be in some kind of argument he wasnt going to get anything out of them so he grabbed his crutches and awkwardly crabwalked out of his row in the gallery then out the doors in the reporters room he picked up the telephone this is jeff elliot he said mr elliot she said this is ivana trump youve got to stop pestering me jeff lowered himself into the school desk dorothys voice got lower jeff youve got to get over here youre not going to believe what i found what im not sure what it means but maurys been out all morning and i finally got to typing up the paperwork on that story you were working on the may shintaka bail yeah youve got to come see this the collateral on the bail loan you said you needed a paper trail someplace to start this looks like the trailhead but you realize youre going to have to pay for this information of course it wont be cheap he smiled remembering the bartering system theyd developed over the weekend to pry secrets from each other secrets they couldnt wait to tell ill be ready he said andy fowler sat back down banged his gavel and continued the trial until september at ninethirty your honor pullios was up counsel permission to approach the bench the judge nodded and motioned her forward she walked firmly with none of her usual sway what is it elizabeth your honor with respect the state would be interested in the substance of your conference with defense counsel fowler gravitas intact glared down from his elevated position there was no love lost between these two with respect counsel what i do in my chambers is none of your business but he leaned forward with his hands folded in front of him but youre right we must avoid even the appearance of impropriety you think defense counsel and i are colluding no of course not your honor i but you think it may look like that to others i appreciate your concern do you read the newspapers elizabeth watch television pullios stared at him yes your honor occasionally you might have noticed that this owen nash murder has attracted more than a modicum of publicity yes your honor well in keeping up with this story over the past week or so it occurred to me that a fair trial might be hard to obtain in san francisco i was quite certain defense counsel would move for change of venue and as youve no doubt noticed mr freeman made no such motion i wanted to make it clear to him that this strategic decision if it backfires could not be used later on as grounds for a mistrial hows that thats very fine your honor thank you no disrespect intended fowler allowed himself a chilly smile of course not counsel an honest question after fowler left the bench pullios stomped out of the courtroom leaving hardy to gather their papers and eventually follow along freeman came over to the prosecution table and told hardy he hoped there were no hard feelings about their initial meeting in the visitors room at the jail none at all you know if you wouldnt mind a little free advice i wouldnt recommend using my clients little slip about being on the eloise she really wasnt there hardy smiled that seems debatable doesnt it freeman had his hands in his pockets his leg thrown casually over the corner of hardys table ive listened to the tape several times the way you phrased it it will come out as a trick question it will only cast the prosecution in a poor light make the playing field uneven well we wouldnt want that hardy finished picking up the papers closed the briefcase thanks for the tip he said ill pass it along hardy was beginning to get used to it these trial attorneys played a nolimit game and didnt go about it according to hoyle how could freeman get the balls to offer such advice did he think he was so green hed be taken in by so transparent a bluff but the more hardy thought about that the more it made no sense at all so maybe it wasnt a bluff it was a double reverse which made it a very effective bluff if it was one slick he thought walking along the hall back to his office you had to admire it what did freeman really want he wanted to win in a circumstantial case like this if he could cause the prosecution to have doubts about bringing up any evidence whatever it could only help the defense on the other hand on the surface his advice was sound hardy hadnt planned to bring up mays slip of the tongue which had seemed to imply shed been on board the eloise because not only was it in itself unconvincing hardy didnt want to introduce into the record his impropriety in visiting may in jail without her attorney present but now freeman had told hardy it wouldnt be a good idea to bring it up certainly freeman wasnt actually trying to be a nice guy help out the new kid but his advice was something hardy had intended to do anyway which meant what so why are we continuing until tomorrow whats the point of that it had been less than five minutes since pullios left the courtroom and now she sat in her office door closed hardy entering had been shocked to see tears in her eyes he started to tell her it was all right he didnt mean she stopped him and pointed to her eyes with both index fingers this is anger hardy dont confuse this with having my feelings hurt that bastard hardy had thought hed discuss freeman and strategy but that clearly wasnt going to be on the agenda hes probably continuing it so he can read the file he just found out he had the case this morning hardy said theres no excuse for that tone hardy put her briefcase on the desk and sat down across from her maybe he resented having his own motives questioned she didnt buy that you wouldnt have asked him i dont know i was curious sure when youre curious ask its one of the rules i didnt think there were any rules she looked straight at him her eyes still glittered there arent she said it had turned into this owen nash stood on a balcony twentythree floors above las vegas his skin still damp from his shower a towel was tucked under his protruding stomach a fresh cigar remained unlit in his mouth he liked the desert especially now at twilight it was still hot and dry after the scorching day but the water evaporating from his skin kept him cool he fixed his eyes beyond the city the mountains on the horizon had turned a faint purple from far below street noises carried up to him softly more immediately he heard may turn the shower off in the bathroom he leaned heavily with both hands on the railing sucking reflectively on the cigar he felt rather than heard the soft tread of her bare feet crossing the rug behind him he sighed again started to say something but may hushed him she opened her kimono and pressed herself against him then she led him silently back into the room and pushed him onto the bed lie down she ordered youre getting a back rub she started kneading his shoulders the muscles were knotted tightly but may was in no hurry she knew what she was doing gradually the stiffness began to work itself out he began breathing deeply regularly for a moment she thought he might have fallen asleep but then he groaned quietly as she moved to a new knot outside the twilight had deepened may stretched out on top of him ran her hand up along his side pretty tense you know that he nodded you want to talk about it he didnt answer immediately just lay with his eyes closed breathing heavily weve got dinner he said it was to be their first public appearance together he thought it was important to her may didnt push she lay quietly in the growing dark ill decide in a minute he said even in the dimness may could make out the lines in his face his high and broad forehead showed a lifetime of living his thin lips were tight i dont know he said his voice strangely flat i dont know what i think things may be getting a little out of hand may stiffened shed been trying to let herself believe that shed never hear this kind of thing from him with us he laughed pulling her tight against him shinn please well maybe it is us but not the way you mean you tell me you know the bitch about life is you cant do everything you take one road and it means you cant take another and either way youre going to miss something are you afraid of missing something he laughed dryly tm afraid of missing anything i never felt i had to i never made any commitment that way it just wasnt in my life now im thinking about it it scares the shit out of me i keep thinking youre going to find out find out what what i am what ive been she pressed herself long against him havent we been through that what do you think ive been i dont care what youve been shinn i dont care what youve been nash are you worried about those other roads what youre going to miss not so much its making the change nobodys forcing you youre wrong shinn youre forcing me but its okay its what i want its the only thing i want anymore she tried to believe him freeman chewed on a pencil looking out the sliding glass doors to the little courtyard enclosed on the other three sides by the bricks of the surrounding buildings a pigeon pecked on the cobbles may was sitting next to him at the marble table in the conference room there was a fresh spray of flowers in the center of the table the room smelled faintly like a walkin humidor did you ever go out he asked what do you mean i mean that night you said it was supposed to be your first public appearance i just wondered how it went she seemed to gather inside herself as shed done before freeman wasnt sure hed call it a visible withdrawal but it was somehow palpable he would have to try and define it better get her trained not to do it whatever it was in front of a jury no she said finally no we never met any of his friends she raised her eyes seeing how he took that perhaps emboldened she added he we never needed to we were enough for each other hardy reached a hand out over his desk those the phone things glitsky held what looked like a small booklet of yellow paper he passed it across the desk i think some clerk got carried away i just asked for june twentieth i think they gave us the whole year well hows the twentieth look good for us not so good for shintaka hardy intended to merely glance at the printout he had his binder open ready to put it in given it was half a year there werent all that many calls maybe fifteen pages each of them five inches long he began flipping through quickly look at this he said glitsky nodded i noticed no calls to japan hardy looked up glitsky he knew rarely missed a trick youre no fun you know that if may did business in japan it made sense she would at least occasionally need to call there especially if she were planning a trip even if she did most of her work by fax hardy thought he could reasonably expect one or two calls well it cant hurt you check any of these hardy was scanning the pages turning them backward now on march no i checked the twentieth i just happened to notice japan you want i can assign a guy no ill suddenly hardys eyes narrowed he stopped flipping what glitsky asked nothing he closed the pages and put them on his desk i just remembered ive got to pick up some stuff for the beck youre a good daddy i know i amaze myself he tapped the pages back to business ill go through this stuff thanks glitsky stood up thank you that is not my idea of a good time hardy kept it loose god they say is in the details wise men still seek him want me to get the door please he hoped he was wrong but he didnt think so hardy wasnt great at math but he had a natural affinity for numbers especially telephone numbers he hadnt called the number on the march listing recently but as soon as he saw it he knew that at one time hed known it he grabbed the pages and looked back to the beginning the number appeared in february too more frequently twice a week in january eighteen total calls maybe the number had changed but hardy didnt think so he picked up the telephone on his desk and dialed the number there were three rings this is please leave your name and number and ill get back to you hardys mouth had gone dry his left hand gripped the paperweight so tightly his knuckles were white the paperweight he thought of owen nashs jade ring the distinctive filigree the animal motif frannies early theory for a second he couldnt think of what to say the tape hissed blankly in his ear he forced himself to speak into the home answeringmachine of superior court judge andrew b fowler andy hardy said this is dismas weve got to talk im going by your office now but if i havent reached you by the time you get this please call me immediately its urgent its extremely urgent part iii casually as he could muster hardy put the paperweight into his pocket and walked out past the other suites in the das office thinking not now he saw jeff elliot coming out of the elevator and turned to duck into the criminal investigations room just outside the das door he wasnt quick enough though he heard his name called and stopped caught hands in his pockets for a reporter jeff had a knack of seeming to be sensitive even reasonable maybe hardy thought it was the crutches that and the grin to say nothing of todays puffiness the indoor sunglasses you wanted to help the guy bad time hardy nodded a little you go ahead then ill talk to ms pullios there was a perverse satisfaction in elizabeth now being the attorney of record naturally she would be a valuable source but hardy felt that at the very least he ought to have some control over the flow of information to the chronicle this wasnt in the office hierarchy and he didnt want to give her a freebie on what she most craved ink ive got a minute jeff what can i do for you can we talk somewhere i need to go off the record they walked back into the das hallway and hardy unlocked one of the waiting rooms provided for the families of victims witnesses the odd conference there was a yellow couch the city favored green and yellow and matching armchair a picture of the golden gate bridge in a special limited edition of three and a half million livened up the wall space jeff lowered himself into the chair where have you been lately you dont look too well just some new medication makes me puff up and get light sensitive prednisone steroids jeff smiled thats what they use its okay i wasnt going for the olympics anyway hardy liked him no getting around it okay so whats off the record he pointed a finger and it is off the record did hardy remember last week after the municipal court arraignment standing in the hallway with elliot and glitsky talking about the bail the money connection sure of course what about it you find something the reporter shook his head no not yet maybe but you guys said didnt you there were ways to subpoena the bail bondsman for his records hardy shook his head not in this case only if we think the money for the bail came from criminal activity well how would may shinn get half a million dollars what half a million she only needed fifty thousand for a fee jeff elliot shook his head i thought that at first too she still needs collateral on the loan hardy nodded yeah weve gone over that he chewed it around again i dont know investments maybe she inherited it we dont have any sign of anything drugs like that how about prostitution thats illegal isnt it it was something to wonder about but that too had already been discussed maybe technically but theres no judge going to give us a warrant to seize records on that he shrugged maybe the bondsman accepted owen nashs will even if she killed him could she collect on that that hardy said is another legal battle fortunately its not mine whichever way it goes even if she gets the whole two million lawyers will wind up with most of it what do you have thats so off the record elliot leaned forward and took off his sunglasses there was something clearly unfocused there dark rings in sockets deepened by swelling hardy couldnt conceal his reaction and interrupted jeffs response are you sure youre okay jeff smiled and the bags seemed to lift a bit it looks worse than it is actually im feeling much better he put on the glasses again the chipmunk cheeks go away after a while you getting any sleep now the grin was wide not enough then slyly proud im seeing somebody first time he lifted his shoulders with exaggerated nonchalance sleeps not a big issue you dog yes well suddenly jeff didnt want to be talking about it reducing it bragging as though it were some casual victory this wasnt a conquest it was dorothy anyway about the bail i dont have any names yet nothing i can print but before i even move ahead at all i want to protect my source so how do you do that i provide a plausible explanation of how i came to look at some records maybe i shouldnt tell you this hardy passed over that have you seen some records no jeff leaned forward hardy thought if he took off his glasses he was lying but he didnt really no okay and im the leak unnamed of course off the record hardy found himself reminded of freemans advice to him in the courtroom of pullioss insistence that there were no rules this was highstakes poker and if jeff could provide hardy oops the prosecution with the source of mays bail it would only help his their case if anything comes out of this and i cant explain how i got my information my source loses her job so i thought id cover that up front but were not subpoenaing the records i know but that doesnt matter i just need an answer if the question comes up im not giving you an answer to anything jeff im just telling you a procedure you got that the way the da would do it if certain criteria were met which they have not been i got it clearly clearly hardy picked up a tall pile of blue chips and dropped them into the pot okay then hardy thought he might be getting paranoid but he took the file home with him anyway in it was everything they had to date including the phone records on may shinn he stopped out by arguello and geary and spent fortyfive minutes copying it he couldnt have said exactly why it seemed like such a good idea pullios might be taking it away from him maybe he wanted to be able to check up on her in the privacy of his office maybe he was trying to protect andy fowler no there was a fine line between the backstabbing gamesmanship and duplicity that seemed to be the norm and downright unethical conduct he was going to find out about andy fowlers relationship with may shinn then he would deal with it he thought but first and in the meanwhile what he didnt want was some das investigator spurred on by pullioss zeal to discover this apparent connection and ruin andys life and in fact there might be no connection or an innocent one although hardy couldnt imagine what it might be nevertheless the boy scout in him deemed it best to be prepared he copied the file david freeman thought it had been a long day but not without its rewards the trial falling to andy fowler had been a godsend one that he freeman had never given up hope on but one which he couldnt possibly have counted on he had finished a decent meal and a couple of solid drinks at the buena vista bar not the birthplace but the american foster home of irish coffee and was taking the cable car up toward nob hill named for the nobs who had originally claimed it as their own leland stanford mark hopkins charles crocker and collis p huntington freeman lived there himself in a penthouse apartment a block from the fairmont hotel just above the rue lepic one of his favorite restaurants but tonight he didnt want to go straight home it was full dark surprisingly warm again he sat on the cable cars hard bench cantered against the steep grade rocking with the motion surrounded by the tourists it was all right he was a man of the people and yet somehow above the people he looked on them tolerantly with few illusions they were capable of anything thirtyfive years practicing criminal law had shown him that but there was something he sometimes felt in a bustling rush of humanity that brought him back to himself to who he was he remembered why he had chosen defense work and there hadnt been much glamor and even less money in the beginning the field had attracted him because he knew that everyone made mistakes everyone was guilty of something what the world needed what people needed was forgiveness and understanding at least to have their side heard he described himself to himself as a cynical romantic and he had to admit he was seldom bored he dismounted the cable car at the fairmont and decided to prolong the night and the mood take a walk reflect may shinn was constantly referring to owen nash and always managed to mention his cigars freeman found it had given him the taste for one and he stopped in at the smoke shop and picked up a macanudo outside while he was lighting up by the valet station a welldressed man tried to sell him a genuine rolex presidential watch for three hundred dollars freeman declined he strolled west over the crest of the hill craving another sight of the bay at night the cigar was fullflavored delicious after the conference hed had today with andy fowler he was sure he was going to win fowler shouldnt have gotten the trial certainly when hed hired freeman that couldnt have been contemplated may was in municipal court and there was no possible way it could wind up in andys courtroom even after the grandjury indictment had moved it into superior court the odds were still six to one against fowler getting it but even at those odds fowler should have gone to leo chomorro spoken to him privately and taken himself out of the line except that feelings between andy fowler and leo chomorro were strained to say the least forgetting their philosophical differences and they were substantial on a personal level fowler had been one of the few judges singled out by name in chomorros report to the governor on the candyass nature of the san francisco bench fowler in turn had been an outspoken critic of chomorros appointment to the court more freeman knew through legal community scuttlebutt that fowler was the man most responsible for chomorros extended sojourn on calendar so for any and all of these reasons fowler hadnt gone to chomorro and thats when hed cut himself off at the pass because hed gone on the assumption that he had a fallback failsafe position even if the trial came up in his department freeman smiled thinking of it not unkindly it was consistent with his view of the folly of man even judges fowler had thought that of course without a doubt there was no question that if the shinn trial came to his courtroom david freeman defense counsel would exercise his option to challenge the presiding judge not having to give a reason and that would be the end of that the trial would go to another judge but freeman hadnt challenged which of course was what had prompted the conference fowler arms crossed stood just inside the door to his chambers david what the hell are you doing im defending my client thats what you hired me to do i certainly didnt think she would get to this courtroom no neither did i well you have to challenge i cant hear this case freeman hadnt answered his hands were in his pockets he knew he looked rumpled mournful sympathetic two weeks before hed been andy fowlers savior now he was his enemy he loved the drama of it fowler had turned walking to the window what am i supposed to do david you could recuse yourself cite conflict i cant do that now freeman knew he couldnt i cant have my relationship with her come out chomorro even fowlers allies would eat him alive for that it was bad form for judges to go with prostitutes but sometimes the best argument was silence freeman walked up to the judges desk and straightened some pencils david youve got to challenge freeman shook his head you hired me to do the best job defending my client a trial in your courtroom is clearly to her advantage im sorry if it is inconvenient to you inconvenient this is a disaster its totally unethical i cant let this happen that judge is your decision he was matteroffact if its any consolation i have no intention of betraying your confidence fowlers eyes seemed glazed does may know id bet against it i told her it was free advertising for me it seemed to go down jesus he ran a hand through his hair suddenly he looked haggard and old jesus christ he walked around in little circles then stopped do you think i could give her a fair trial david there it was the rationality kicking in thats what people did freeman knew they made their own actions however wrong somehow justified fowler continued if it ever comes out im truly ruined would she say anything why would she especially since im going to get her off it wouldnt be to her advantage now or ever youre going to get her off of course theres no evidence andy the judge lowered his voice but she did it david no one can prove my client killed anybody if the prosecution can be kept from sexual innuendo and racial slurs she will be acquitted it will be essential to control the tone in the courtroom the cigar had gone out and he chewed happily on the butt it had been a satisfying performance its outcome so sweet he almost wanted to dance a little jig when he left chambers of course on the downside andy fowler with whom hed always gotten along had his neck on the block andy couldnt recuse himself without admitting his relationship with may and he wasnt going to do that he was right it would end his career and the revelation at this late date in the proceedings would be particularly damning but hed gotten himself in this position you made your own luck good or bad andy was a big boy he should have known better the walk had taken freeman across the top of nob hill and back down its north side he became subliminally aware that his steps were leading him somewhere and he let them slowly no hurry he still chewed the cigar by night the corner that may lived on was quiet the cable cars had stopped running the surrounding hills were steep and people heading for north beach or back out to the avenues would take one of the larger thoroughfares broadway or van ness gough or geary he crossed the street and stood leaning against the window of the french deli looking up there was a light on in what he knew to be mays kitchen the front of the apartment the turreted window was dark across the street in mrs streletskis building shadows danced across the turret and suddenly freeman remembered a fourteenyearold boy named wayne allred whod been hiding in a closet when his mother ran from their apartment whod come out to shoot his father dead he threw his cigar butt into the gutter he wasnt quite disgusted with himself for being less than completely thorough earlier it had been the end of another long day and he hadnt been holding out any hope that may was innocent in fact he still didnt but his feet his subconscious something had taken him here and now he knew why he crossed the street and rang the bell to number strauss the speaker squawked by his ear who is it freeman apologized and explained briefly its ten oclock at night cant this wait until morning he apologized again and for a moment it appeared that he was going to strike out but then the buzzer sounded and he was quietly climbing the carpeted steps the door stood ajar and nick strauss leaned against the jamb wearing white socks and a terrycloth robe he was a big man far bigger than freeman his black hair still wet from the shower im sorry freeman repeated but a persons life is at stake here could i see some id the lawyer smiled of course it was the standard first line of protection as foolish freeman thought as most human endeavor as if were he a burglar or a murderer possession of a drivers license would make him any safer as if all ids werent routinely expertly forged or altered but he took out his wallet and offered it he had a business card in his jacket breast pocket and he gave strauss one of those too the man opened the door further freeman saw two boys teenagers or a little younger sitting together on the couch trying to get a look at him he gave them a little friendly wave and strauss said to come on in but ive already told you we didnt see anything well mr strauss actually you told me you didnt see anything you said youd ask the boys and get back to me if they saw anything what dad just a second nick im talking to this man this is mr freeman guys these are my boys alex the big guy and nick the big little guy arent you nick the younger boy nick seemed an echo not only of his fathers name but of the attitude cautious watchful freeman kept his hands in his pockets the supplicant i dont mean to push people forget these things all the time its just so terribly important strauss made some motion that freeman took for acquiescence he looked to the boys then back to strauss would you guys like to show me your room if its okay with your dad the older boy alex said sure and jumped up this was an adventure how about you nick naw ill just wait here freeman said fine but alex was all over him come on you wimp chickenliver baby alex but that did it nick got up its all right dad alex is such a nerd then to his brother you jerkoff remembering the last time he had seen the chinese woman through the telescope nick strauss loved his dads apartment at the corner of hyde and union especially after the month of traveling with his mom and alex staying in those tiny stuffy rooms in europe first of all dads place was humongous twice the size of his moms in van nuys ricketyrackety pink stucco with peeling paint and cars parked all over the place where there should have been grass then at dads nobody was above them no mrs cutler and her two sons and the bass and drums coming down through the ceiling all day and night like in the valley no adjoining hotel rooms with people staying up all the time plus the cable cars it was a snap to get on and off without paying and hills for skateboarding like you couldnt believe and no damn palm trees in fact no trees and finally this glassedin turret in the front upstairs corner of the apartment which was part of his and alexs bedroom when they came to visit on saturday and this time since theyd been with mom so steadily with school and then europe and all they were staying three weeks so after the lights went out you could take out the telescope and spy on anybody in the neighborhood nobody noticing a thing or in the daytime just drawing the drapes and making it all dark in there looking all around checking it all out and since theyd gotten here checking her out alex saw her first across the street upstairs just like them probably figuring nobody could see her it was supremely worth the fifty cents nick had to pay for the first look he wondered what chinese custom it was to walk around your house naked but he wasnt complaining except for mom and she didnt count anyway hed never seen a live naked woman even playboy was hard to get when you were eleven and he thought this woman looked as good at least as anybody in playboy except for the smaller boobs and being chinese was a little funny at first he kind of wished she was a regular american he wondered if it really counted as seeing a naked woman if she was chinese but he asked alex and alex said it sure counted for him and he was thirteen so he ought to know she hadnt been there for a few days the last time had been a couple nights ago it had been almost eleven oclock he couldnt get his weenie to go down and he couldnt get to sleep he also didnt want to waste a minute when her lights were on he put his eye to the telescope it looked like she was doing some kind of exercise taking things down off shelves reaching up then bending over she turned toward him her face so full in the telescope he almost jumped back it looked like she was crying and that made him feel guilty spying on her and all see anything alex had whispered darn nick thought alex had been asleep he quickly stuffed a blanket down over his hard little weenie he took a last look thinking about the way boobs changed shapes when women moved around leaned over stretched up his brother had called him a boob man last week well he guessed he was if thats what interested him and he wore that knowledge like a badge of honor a man not a boy he pulled the drapes closed in front of the telescope hed keep the crying a secret between just him and her naw he had told alex i think she went to sleep david freeman nick alex and their father walked through the living room mr strauss saying he was sorry about his sons language referring to nick calling alex a jerkoff their mother wasnt very strict with them and the language thing was impossible to correct in the six weeks or so he had them every year you had to pick your fights freeman saw the telescope as soon as he entered the room and walked over to it this is pretty cool he said this looks like a real telescope it is a real telescope alex said freeman put his eye to the glass what can you see through it what he was looking at what it had been set on was the turret across the street the room beyond he saw may at her kitchen table drinking something so close he could see the steam rising off her cup there was a knack to putting a little twinkle in your eye to sounding conspiratorial and friendly you ever spy on people alex answered quickly too quickly no way how about you nick nick pulled himself further behind his fathers robe big nick broke in what are you getting at here take a look freeman moved aside and big nick came over and lowered his eye to the eyepiece he stayed that way a minute thats her freeman said my client big nick was angry turning on his boys you guys have got to mr strauss please just a minute the stentorian voice stopped everything the boys stood transfixed freeman muted it sat on the bed and gave them gentle and soothing you guys are not in trouble no matter what i guarantee it he explained the situation then slowly calmly no judgments he told them what their father had said about the saturday theyd first come here that theyd only changed and had lunch and then gone out for the day he just wanted to know if that was all theyd done and were they sure he didnt want to lead them the two boys looked at each other i think so nick said alex his eyes went back to his brother to his father its all right alex just tell the truth well you know the telescope was up so i started looking around a little just looking at things and did you see anything anything interesting or unusual maybe across the street there alex looked at nick shrugged and gave it up she was naked she was walking around naked when was that alex just before we had to go when dad called us just before lunchtime and youre sure it was that day the very first day you were here the saturday the boys checked each other again both of them nodded and said yeah it was hardy picked up the phone on the kitchen wall on the third ring hed gotten out of his warm bed from deep sleep dismas this is andy fowler did i wake you up the kitchen clock said thats okay andy i just got your message whats so urgent hardy was coming out of his fog but he wasnt yet awake enough to beat around the bush may shinn a pause since youre on the case diz i dont think we should discuss it as bluffs went hardy thought except for the pause it wasnt too bad i think we have to andy i think you know what im talking about in the silence hardy thought he could hear fowlers breathing get heavier then he said where can i meet you they met at a fern bar on fillmore half a mile from andy fowlers house on clay near embassy row when it was not happy hour it was the local watering hole for doctors and nurses at the local medical center it wasnt hardys type of bar but he wasnt here for the ambience he was wearing his prelawyer clothes an old corduroy sports jacket over a misshapen white fishermans sweater jeans hiking boots and felt better for it at a place like this at this time of night those clothes put out the message that he wasnt a yuppie looking to get laid with the accepted props of elegant threads and the attitude that went with them the music was some new age stuff that was supposed to make you believe real people played it bass pops synthesized everything music that eliminated the strain of having to listen to words or follow a melody it was just there like the ubiquitous television blaring in the corner like the national enquirer at checkout stands like mcdonalds surprised that the judge hadnt arrived yet he pulled up a stool at the corner of the bar in the back he ordered a guinness which they didnt have on tap so he went with anchor porter an excellent second choice maybe it was being awakened from a good sleep but he realized he was in a foul humor andy fowlers appearance didnt pick him up any the judge hadnt changed out of his tuxedo he had his trim body his thick hair his guileless smile so different from hardys weathered one these goodlooking older guys who were they trying to kid suddenly he saw a different man than the andy fowler hed known vainer and shallower the august presence and appearance not so much a reflection of an enviable and confident character as a costume that concealed the insecure man within coming back through the bar the judge checked himself in the mirror a man who checked his hair in a burning building had his priorities all wrong hardy gave a small wave and andy brought up the stool next to him ordering an anejo rum in a heated snifter there was a moment of cheerful greeting ritual for them both but it subsided quickly hardy reached into his pocket took out the paperweight and laid it on the bar between them he gave it a little spin there it was andys fowlers whole world in an orb of jade there was no more avoiding it may shinn gave this to you didnt she fowler had his hands cupped around the amber liquid there was no point in denial anymore howd you find out phone records he told him how hed made the discovery put the jade jewelry his paperweight nashs ring together anyway there were a dozen calls to your number maybe more that many did he seem pleased whats happening here andy you cant be on this case its going to come out now isnt it i dont see how it cant who else knows but you hardy sipped his porter it wasnt the direction hed expected what do you mean i mean whos put it together diz he brought his hand down on the bar a gavel of flesh goddamn it what do you think i mean who else knows about this hardy stared into the space between them they were the first harsh words the judge had ever directed at him immediately fowler put his hand over hardys im sorry diz i didnt mean that but it was done all right he was stressed out hardy could let it go forget it almost fowler raised his snifter took a sip put it down his voice was under control again i guess what im asking is what happens now id say that depends on whats happened before fowler nodded so nobody else knows i didnt say that yes you did everybody was a poker player it was all check bet raise okay why dont you tell me about it well go from there the bartender was coming down the bar toward them double it up here would you fowler said and give my friend another pint they were at a large corner booth nobody else within twenty feet at right angles from each other almost knee to knee the older goodlooking man in a tuxedo and the other one maybe a construction worker probably the mans son definitely they werent lovers in san francisco two men alone were always suspect but the body language was all wrong for that they were close involved in something and it was putting a strain between them it was at one of the galleries down by union square id had lunch at the clift and the sun was out so i thought id walk a little of it off maybe drop in at magnins and visit jane i so rarely get to see downtown in the daylight the place was empty except for the saleswoman she turned out to be the owner and may i dont know what made me stop they were showing some erotica i guess thats what got me to look but then i saw this japanese woman standing there her face in profile and i walked in we got to talking probably talked for half an hour analyzing all this stuff it was erotic i admit discussing all these positions and anatomies alone with a beautiful woman you had just met so you picked her up if only it had been that simple i hadnt done anything like that in thirty years diz when youre a judge hardy drank his porter waited so what happened she left said it was nice meeting me but she had to go i stayed around a little longer and thought that was that he paused but it wasnt i found i couldnt get her out of my mind kept picturing her in some of the positions sorry i know its not my image hardy shrugged everybody needs love andy that sounds good enough when you say it try denying it though try burying it under your work and your image and your public life until you really believe you dont need it anymore i did it after michael and jane so you know you tell yourself your life is just as good just as full its not like you dont do things but youre so alone nothing resonates andy got quiet and stared outside at the empty street so a couple of days later the judge went on i came back to the gallery and asked the owner if she remembered the woman id spoken with she said she was a regular client so she does deal in art who may no she collects some but i wouldnt say she deals in it anyway the owner knew her but she wouldnt tell me her name even after i told her who i was not that i blame her as we know there are a lot of nuts out there even among my colleagues so i gave her my card asked her to have this lady call me she said she would so you got together no not yet she didnt call he swirled his rum put it back on the table untouched but i wanted her i didnt know her at all and i didnt care i had to see her again i dont know what it was the vision of celine nash danced up before hardys eyes and he drowned it in porter okay what i gave it a week then i went back in and bought one of the woodcuts fortyfive hundred dollars and told the owner to send it to may thatll eliminate the riffraff element the money wasnt important ive got money in any event it got her to call and thank me and i told her i wanted to see her and she still said no she couldnt do that i asked her why was she married engaged not interested in men no at least tell me why so she agreed to meet me for dinner and she told me her profession what she did yes she was scared me being a judge that id bust her he laughed clipped and short i had to promise her immunity up front i did want her diz what she had done made no difference to me i told her i wasnt interested in that kind of relationship paying her i liked her i wanted to see her take her out legitimately she laughed she didnt do that so i asked if i could see her at all under any conditions jesus andy no it wasnt like that i wasnt groveling it was more goodnatured negotiating so whatd the negotiating get to the judge focused across the room three thousand dollars hardy swallowed took a long drink swallowed again three thousand dollars for one time no per month you paid may shinn three thousand dollars a month yes lord lord lord after the first couple of months i would have paid anything dont laugh i fell in love with her diz i still love her andy you dont pay somebody you love the money was never discussed after that first night i thought she was coming around to what what could she be coming around to to loving me it was so simple so basic so incredibly misguided hardy didnt know what to say what about her other clients she dropped them all almost immediately that was one of the things that gave me some hope that she would love you i suppose and then what you marry her and have a happy little family fowler shook his head no i never thought wed get married she made me happy that was all she was there for me she filled up that space i thought i was doing the same for her but you werent for a while im sure i was she started cooking me meals making special dishes giving me presents the paperweight for example things like that then four or five months ago it just ended she called and said we couldnt go on owen nash i assume so i didnt know it then she said to just make believe she had died but she was happy i shouldnt worry i shouldnt worry hardy sat back into the leather of the booth all this tracked with andys malaise over the past months his explanation to jane about a friend dying frannie and jane had both independently been right a woman had broken a mans heart the oldest story in the world but now that story told the judge had to move on he took a gulp of his rum so thats it diz now you know i dont want to know thats what eve said after she ate the apple it was too late then too hardy leaned forward again arms on the table you cant be on the case andy i just dont understand how it could have gotten this far the answer the same one that fowler had given freeman earlier in the day was that it had come a step at a time the municourt arraignment with no chance of getting to fowlers courtroom anyway then the grandjury indictment leaving only one chance in six it would come to him then his decision not to go and beg off privately to leo chomorro because that hispanic nazi would use the fowlershinn relationship as political ammunition against fowler andy didnt mention the aceinthehole that hadnt worked freeman challenging out of his courtroom he didnt have any intention of opening that can of worms so far no one else knew he had hired freeman and he intended to keep things that way so then i figured if after all that it dropped in my lap well then it was fate you know theres going to be prejudice against her being japanese her profession at least i could give her an even playing field i could have helped her she might have come back to me there was no reason it had to come out there isnt now i wouldnt obstruct justice diz i just wouldnt do it hardy wanted to tell him he already had instead he said the rationalization maybe moves it out of disbarment range andy but you and i both know its still unethical you know the defendant hell youve been intimate with the defendant if thats not a conflict what could he say andy knew this as well as he did youve got to take yourself off the case if i did id have to give a reason and i cant do that hardys drink was gone he picked up the glass tried it put it down you could retire right now without notice the trial isnt tomorrow andy theres plenty of time itll get reassigned the phone records in the file arent strictly relevant to the murder the police only asked for june twentieth the rest doesnt have to be there this was not ethical either and hardy wasnt sure he could do it the file was the public record tampering with it suppressing potential evidence even if its relevance hadnt been demonstrated was a felony still he wasnt telling andy hed take the earlier phone records out not in so many words and if he didnt say it explicitly he didnt say it at all that was this game and andy fowler played it too hardy with the problem of where to draw the line between personal loyalty and the public trust knew he had to get fowler off the case and he didnt want to blow the whistle on him if a white lie could accomplish both results he thought it might be worth telling he also thought it might not be how many venial sins make a mortal sin how many angels can dance on the head of a pin dismas im only sixtytwo im not ready to retire you know andy youve got to cut your losses and youre going to have em at least youll still have your reputation maybe youll get a call to the federal bench they both got a wry smile at that they were making last call the lights coming up the music going down hardy had to push it ive got to know by the morning andy im real sorry fowler patted his shoulder im sorry i put you through this dismas although im glad it was you who found out anybody else andy weve been friends a long time but in this case i am anybody else im just giving you one day to correct an oversight but its got to get corrected one way or the other i want to be clear on that the judge was relaxed again the situation worked out its clear diz its clear dont you worry david freeman had a tradition hed carried over from his days in law school whenever he scored what he considered a clearcut victory he would celebrate it immediately his theory was that you never knew when or if youd get another one and youd better savor every drop of satisfaction from the one in hand before it was swept away into the river of your past so tuesday night after hed arranged to have the boys and their father meet him at onethirty the next day for a press conference in his office hed called a cab and taken it back to the fairmont after booking a room there he took the outside elevator to the crown room and ordered a bottle of paradis cognac which went by the snifter at the bottle set him back but he could save it and take it home a trophy for the job well done he arrived at the crown room just after ten and stayed until it closed at two putting about a sixinch dent in the bottle sitting at one of the northfacing windows watching his city sparkle beneath him a nob in his own castle which explained why he wasnt up anywhere near ninethirty if he had been if hed somehow gotten to chris locke and let him know that the may shinn case couldnt go to trial that her alibi was rock solid then he might have saved superior court judge andrew bryan fowler the trouble of announcing his early retirement effective september in a computerized age jeff elliot considered this manual search for title to a piece of property the most unnecessarily tedious job hed ever done yesterday after only two hours at it his blurred vision had forced him to give it up now three hours into it again not yet noon he was having second thoughts wondering if it could really matter hed thought of all sorts of plausible reasons to talk himself out of the search not the least of which was that may shinn herself might easily have accumulated enough for a down payment on worth of real estate he remembered stories in playboy and penthouse when hed been in college about coeds whod turned to hooking and pulled in a month even allowing for the hyperbole of the publications he knew it was possible for a highclass girl to make a night plus all her normal living expenses so a smart one could save a month a year a little administrative acumen could provide a shelter for tax purposes interior design importexport licensed sexual therapist hed seen may shinn in court in her tailored suit it required no leap of faith to think she had the collateral for her own bail shed had the cash to pay maury after all why not the rest of it but what if she didnt and as always it was that possibility that pulled him along the chance that under the obvious and the plausible there might lurk the secret the hidden the dangerous the story the title clerks could have been more helpful but they were busy with their own work with realtors they saw more often he was a nosy crippled guy who didnt even know what to ask for so like good bureaucrats everywhere the clerks volunteered nothing but the learning curve was kicking in even if you knew the city and jeff wasnt yet up to speed even there the search took some getting used to there were huge grid books that divided the land into areas that seemed to bear little relation to current neighborhoods at first glance street names were useless in determining which grid book out of more than a hundred held your property but he felt he was closing in the collateral was a sixunit apartment building three blocks up powell from washington square after his frustrating search of records the day before jeff had come up with the idea that he could just stop by the place and ask one of the tenants who owned the building and he and dorothy had tried that the one person whod been home a mime artist who was preparing to go out and work the streets whiteface and all told them she sent her rent checks to a management company jeff thought it unlikely that hed befriend another secretary who would divulge private records to him and decided that if he wanted the story hed have to work for it like always he estimated the books weighed fifteen pounds each up close they smelled like wet newspaper he had to wait in line return his previous request using only one crutch holding the title book in his other hand hed gone through twentysix books so far but the closest plot in the last book ended a couple of blocks north of his site why couldnt you just type an address into a computer and push a button hed never figure it out jane was furious you didnt have to tell anybody daddys whole life is the bench how could you do that to him it was close to one oclock jane had had her own early lunch with her father and hed told her all about it hardy wasnt too thrilled to learn that the judge had told his daughter since he himself had elected to treat the entire sensitive subject on a needtoknow basis hoping no one would frannie hadnt liked it either you cant tell me what do you mean you cant tell me im your wife we tell each other things remember i can tell you it has nothing to do with us you go out in the middle of the night and stay out until god knows when and i dont even get a hint of an explanation frannie no it doesnt have to do with us its confidential attorneyclient well la di da and whose attorney are you i thought you worked for the city she had him there but he had made his decision he had all sorts of conflicting loyalties this job is changing you she said maybe life changed people big deal live with it but he wasnt stupid enough to say that instead hed gone off to work with the stomachache he got every time they fought and now andy fowler had told his daughter or shed wheedled it out of him but either way here was another person and not the soul of discretion who knew i didnt do anything to him jane if anything he did it to himself you didnt have to tell anybody i didnt tell anybody i havent told anybody at least not yet i hope i wont have to have to my arent we getting sanctimonious here hardys door was open he told jane to hang on and he got up to close it pullios was coming down the hallway deep in conference with chris locke his stomach tightened further and he shut the door before they saw him back at the phone he asked jane if big chuck hed taken to thinking of her new boyfriend as big chuck if big chuck had been there too when andy had told her whats that supposed to mean i think it means i dont have to take any abuse from you so leave me alone he hung up there were lots of ways to do it and freeman naturally chose the most flamboyant well perhaps not altogether naturally the inclination to do things with flair while meshing well with his personality had been drummed out of him in law school but over the years of private practice he had put it back in in the first years of his practice he would have taken evidence he had dug up such as the strauss boys corroboration of mays alibi and brought it into the das office where it would be discussed and some decision would be made about whether it eliminated the need for a trial but over the long run he had found that this cooperative attitude did little for him prosecutors often disbelieved what he brought them doubted its truth or relevance impugning his motives while they were at it he had found that if he did it only sparingly when his findings were unambiguous and as in this case critical a public airing of evidence had a way of getting more action out of the da than any attempt at amity goodwill and cooperation district attorneys he had found were acutely sensitive to public perception more so often than to justice a news conference made hairs stand up in the hall made young lawyers and even a few old ones fear you a force who dared go outside the system if he had to theyd call him a loose cannon and watch out guys loose cannons go boom he stood now in the lobby of his office surrounded by a totally unnecessary phalanx of some of his associates hed sent home earlier to put on their best threads he himself was as rumpled as usual in an old brown tweed and scuffed wing tips in front of him was a makeshift podium with several microphones opposite the podium facing him stood a knot of some fifteen reporters which was a pretty fair showing considering the short lead time hed given them there were three sound trucks doubleparked in the street outside which meant hed be on television kgo radio was represented so hed get some sound bites on the most popular talk station may was a good sport about it he told her it was time to collect on his advertising fee hed come to admire her quite a bit especially after finding out she had probably been telling him the truth the whole time now she was standing next to him not yet daring to smile flawlessly turned out as usual his fingers did a little tap dance over the microphones and he smiled gosh he wasnt used to all of this regular old working stiff that he was were these things on he spoke extemporaneously ladies and gentlemen id like to thank you all for coming here today and i wont take much of your very valuable time as you know a couple of weeks ago owen nash one of the giants of american business was felled by a gunshot no one would deny that mr nash was a powerful and fascinating man he glanced at may shinn and got another bonus at the mention of nashs name a tear had sprung from her eyes and was rolling down her cheek dont wipe it he thought to himself a couple of bulbs flashed freeman took her hand gave it a squeeze in cases like this there seems to be a natural inclination to fasten guilt on somebody to lay the blame somewhere who can say why it could be it satisfies societys need for order maybe our outrage is so great we crave any action that seems to redress the great wrong that murder represents how many of us in our heart of hearts blame jack ruby for killing lee harvey oswald no when the king falls the kings killer must in turn be killed of course im not comparing owen nash to our martyred president like dan quayle owen nash was no jack kennedy he waited for the laughter stole a glance at may and squeezed her hand again but owen nash was in his own way a titan and there was that same rush to judgment unfortunately in this case that rush centered upon the person who now stands here on my right may shinn a natural american citizen a woman with no criminal record of any kind a woman whose sole fault if it is one was to become involved with to fall in love with owen nash in a perfect world the district attorney would never have even condoned the kind of public vigilantism that has been the earmark of this case from the beginning it is however a sad fact that this is not a perfect world and that our own district attorneys office was from the beginning in the forefront of the racist witchhunt that brought this young woman to the dock without a shred of physical evidence that could implicate her in this horrible deed he stopped enjoying a minute of eye contact with the journalists and reporters he had them from the beginning ms shinn has contended that on the day owen nash was brutally murdered she stayed home waiting for his return she did not use the telephone she did not go out to buy a newspaper she did not play the piano or hammer nails in her wall or sing in the shower i submit to you all that this is not criminal behavior and yet ladies and gentlemen and let me make this very clear this was the sum total of the peoples case against may shinn that she did nothing to make anyone notice she was home imagine that time was when that would have been the mark of a good citizen an ideal neighbor but because she is of japanese descent because she dared have a relationship with a powerful man he lowered his voice because she was in fact a woman powerless to defend herself against the might of the state she was the perfect scapegoat she spent a quiet day at home and she is suspected indeed accused of murder id like now to introduce you to two young men nick and alex strauss who happen to live directly across the street from ms shinns apartment he nodded to one of his associates who went into the adjoining room and brought out the two boys and their father if the district attorney had been interested in the truth he too could have found the strauss boys they got back from a trip to europe on june twentieth the day owen nash was killed youll never guess what they saw he was getting a diet coke in the lounge when one of the guys two doors down constantino stuck his head in hardy you better get to drysdales he said it was five minutes to three drysdale had gotten a tip from one of his connections at kron and now pullios chris locke himself and a third of the rest of the staff were gathered in front of the television set hardy squeezed himself into the doorway reminded of other gatherings like this the day dan white had killed harvey milk and mayor moscone at city hall the reagan assassination attempt he wondered whod been shot somebody called out okay okay its on turn it up the room went quiet except for the anchors voice talking about an exceptional development in the owen nash murder case and in a minute there was david freeman on the screen in front of a bunch of microphones may shinn beside him hes paying those kids or the father its a setup pullios didnt believe it or she was pretending she didnt believe it two kids drysdale shook his head what about the naked part he wouldnt have made that up locke was silent standing by the window looking out it is for sure going to play hardy said everyone else had gone ironically the room seemed smaller with only four of them in it how could they be sure it was the same day said pullios drysdale picked up his baseballs and began to juggle would you please not do that the exasperation of elizabeth pullios hardy didnt mind seeing it thought shed earned it it was after all her case sorry drysdale said he caught the balls and palmed them all in one hand i think they covered that pretty well it was the day they came back from europe theyd just gotten off the plane its pretty solid documentation maybe theyre just plain lying hes paying them pretty risky crossexam would kill them and freeman knows it i want to interview them i would think so said drysdale she stood flatfooted in front of his desk she kept looking over at lockes back but he wasnt turning around freemans hammering of christopher locke wasnt lost on any of them locke was the district attorney they werent so far as the public was concerned christopher locke personally had screwed this one up he a black man was a racist he had picked on a woman an ethnic it was a disaster goddamn it pullios said drysdale nodded yes maam he said when jeff elliot discovered at the title office that the owner of the collateralized apartment was superior court judge andrew fowler he was pretty sure he had hit the jackpot then finding out hed missed freemans press conference why didnt somebody call me he saw it all slip away finally hearing the news about fowlers retirement he knew he had himself the story of his career there was only one person who held in his hand all the elements to this thing and he was it to glitsky it meant something else entirely hed arrested the wrong person and they still had a live homicide he was in the office of his lieutenant frank batiste after five chewing on the ice that was left in his styrofoam cup though one outranked the other the two men had come up together and knew that politics outside of either of their control had dictated batistes promotion they still viewed themselves more as partners than anything else youre lucky the grand jury indicted batiste said it takes the heat off ill probably still get sued glitsky found a spot for his cup on batistes cluttered desk lets see false arrest sex discrimination race discrimination i might as well give you my badge now it wasnt funny but they both were smiling cop humor maybe locke wont drop it batiste looked hard at him maybe itll snow tomorrow the kids could be mistaken there could be peace in our time you know frank you are solace to a troubled soul i try to be batiste had his feet up on his desk a legal pad on his lap he started doodling so what do you think weve got here the perfect crime i hope not because ive got a feeling this one isnt going to go away anybody else could have done it maybe nobody looks near as good as shinn did glitsky told his lieutenant that hed take another look at the business side mr silicon valley somebody else who might benefit but the evidence was slim and none if it wasnt shinn he flicked ice into his mouth and chewed you know this one time i thought i might have a case with you know witnesses who werent already in jail maybe a motive aside from lack of imagination maybe next year batiste said and in the meantime we still have a very important dead person hardy called celine after he returned from drysdales office he told himself that she at least deserved to be among the first to know that her fathers killer was still on the streets he reached her at hardbodies where shed been working out again after he told her he listened to the background noise in the phone the throbbing music the torture machines finally she asked him what he meant i mean mays alibi checks out she wasnt out on the eloise with your father but what does that mean it means she didnt kill him celine he waited not pushing for another minute celine okay he thought youve done your duty now tell her youll keep her informed of developments and hang up just hang up go home and have a date night with frannie so what do we do now celine asked him quietly shock in her voice can i see you no im busy how about coming by the office tomorrow all right he said he met her at perrys on union a meat market in the classic sense fine food big drinks good vibes though her hair was still damp pulled back by a turquoise band shed found time to make herself up but somehow hardy found her physical presence not quite so overpowering as before it was the first time hed seen her since their original meeting that the contours of her body under the baggy purple sweater the black and blousy pants werent immediately evident he was grateful for that it was early dusk but the place was already jammed she was standing near the entrance which was on the side down an alley an orange juice in her hand talking to another man who was about hardys age though taller broader and better dressed when hardy came in her face lit up and she moved to him kissing him briefly on the lips she took his hand and turned the man had already started for the bar i told him my boyfriend was on his way she said but you know this place a woman alone is fair game she didnt let go of his hand come lets see if we can get a table i cant eat celine im just on my way home she stopped pulling him along still didnt let go of his hand you mean youre going to leave me here alone i wont last five minutes oh you will if you decide to another side of her a little more humanity a trace of humor she did have a real life he knew nothing about a couple vacated their table two feet from them and hardy let go of celines hand and guided her to it a waitress appeared and he ordered a club soda he could feel the heat of her thigh where it pressed against his are you always alone hardy asked her every time i see you youre alone wrong every time you see me im with you she leaned away from him why do you want to know youre married yes i am he said i just wonder she accepted that not right now does this have to do with my father he tried and failed to find some connection no i dont suppose so she reached for her orange juice took a sip and cradled the glass in both hands in her lap i was married one time i was twentyone going through one of my rebellious phases he was a musician a good player he finally made a couple of albums heavy metal which now i truly hate i think i despised it then and i know daddy did did your father and he get along she started to laugh then stopped herself no daddy hated everything about him is that why you broke up no not really he was a jerk which i suppose i knew all along but daddy had him followed when he was on the road and he didnt act like he was married so she continued shrugging we had it annulled its ancient history now but it kind of soured me on men for a long while plus theres being rich you know its hard to find people you believe guys try to pick you up first its your looks then if they find out youve got money hardys club soda arrived he held it staring out the window it seemed to not be getting any darker outside what are you thinking she asked i dont know exactly that theres more than the pickup scene i mean didnt you meet anybody in your regular life she shook her head sometimes once in a while but my regular life always had daddy in it i think this is where our problem started last time she reached over and took his hand again were not going to do that again i cant explain to people about me and daddy it was all right we did everything together but he seemed to have a personal life i mean women friends and you apparently werent allowed to how can that have been fair how was it living with that i dont know how to say it or explain it but it was okay you did things with daddy you felt a certain way ask ken but it couldnt be the same with him hes married hes got a life she tightened her hold on his hand ive got a life dismas dont worry about me i guess i do he said i dont know why but i do i know she let him go and moved her palm up and down over his thigh you are a very good man mr hardy i wish she didnt finish what she was saying she didnt have to they never got around to mentioning the name of may shinn hardy got home just at seven rebecca was in bed asleep one of their regular babysitters was in the living room talking to frannie and frannie was dressed up ready to go out he was in the house for less than five minutes he wanted to peek in on the beck to feed the fish pit stop they walked out to the car parked two blocks away on clement holding hands are we still fighting he asked i wasnt fighting with you neither were you singing my praises i didnt agree with you i dont agree with you i think your job is taking too much of your time and is threatening you and me and our family and i dont like you not telling me what youre doing and where youre going youve got to learn to speak out frannie express yourself a little more clearly not funny they walked on another half block without talking so if you cant make a joke out of it youre not going to say anything she asked im going to say something the last of the chivalrous men hardy held the door for her then went around to his side the sun had at last gone down he put the sides up on the samurai it was warm with the breeze off the ocean when when what when are you going to say something hardy turned in his seat confidentiality obviously meant little to andy fowler since jane knew then certainly by now chuck chuck bobuck was in on it and hardy had never promised andy he would keep it private hed only promised himself hed only promised himself he liked that this was how it started he thought this was the kind of rationalizing that people everywhere seemed to be so good at and once it was okay to break a promise to yourself then it wasnt all that big a step to break one to anyone else just so you could end a fight or maybe tell a little white lie to keep from getting into a fight in the first place all he had to do was give in tell frannie about andy and they would have a pleasant and welldeserved date and hardys supposed private integrity would only be slightly diminished he could make it up on the weekend do some good works did you hear about the may shinn thing today he asked her she hadnt yet and he filled her in on it she listened and when hed finished she told him that it was interesting but that it wasnt what their fight had been about did he want to tell her where hed been last night or not i went out to meet a guy whos got a legal problem which i cant discuss period if you want to be mad at me about that its up to you she was biting her lip not so much angry he thought as worried what about the other stuff she said these hours at work getting home when its dark leaving in the middle of the night whats that doing to us the two front seats in the samurai were separated by a well and he reached for her and put his arms around her she leaned into him were not being threatened he said the job is not threatening us i love you frannie okay she nodded against him her arms around his neck her reserve broke she started to cry when they got home there were calls from ken farris jane apologizing and abe glitsky wondering about the direction the da was going with this thing hardy went into his office while frannie drove the babysitter home and began rereading the file on the nowdead case at least it was dead so far as may shinn was concerned he didnt know what the da was going to do but he thought he personally was going to go back to doing his prelims earn his stripes win a lot of cases and eventually move up the ladder to where he might get a couple of righteous homicides there was nothing else he could do he wasnt an investigator he knew glitsky after the false arrest would be supercautious he wasnt inclined to stir things up with pullios anymore frannie had been right he was putting in too many hours not having enough fun he was becoming a lawyer and if he wanted to do that he could get some corporate work and bill sixty hours a week for five or six years and make some money while he did it hed left celine at perrys thinking what a good man am i he thought she might be a little in love with him although he knew he was infatuated with her on some level he wasnt going to pursue it hed made his choice and not only was he going to live with it he was going to be happy with it that settled he decided to close up the binder and file it away in the cabinets next to his desk he arranged the yellow sheets from his own private notes at the beginning of the investigation his initial talks with ken farris impressions from strout and so on and laid them on top of the copies hed made of the official file his office was quiet from the bedroom the bubbling of the fish tank registered subliminally not really looking for anything waiting for frannies arrival back home he reread the early notes all of this seemed so long ago so distant in time and experience he flipped pages the police reports glitskys interviews killing time elliots articles and then the bubbling fish tank was gone there was nothing in his world but a nagging halfrecognized contradiction he flipped back to one of jeff elliots first articles ken farris had told him that hed last seen owen nash on friday around lunchtime after lunch the article quoting farris as the source said nash had last been seen by his household staff on thursday night he looked back at his notes friday around lunchtime after lunch elliots article thursday night thursday night was not friday near lunchtime he shook his head rubbing his eyes what was he thinking of farris wasnt any kind of suspect in this he had been owen nashs best friend all right so he effectively inherited the business when owen died that wasnt or was it but all he had done was tell hardy one day and jeff elliot another the stress of those first days after nashs death had undoubtedly played some havoc with his shortterm memory but farris was a detail man ridiculous he shook his head again frannie was in the doorway to the office he hadnt heard her come in or close the front door or walk down the long hallway she had turned on the light in the bedroom and it hadnt registered you look like youve just seen a ghost he came out of his trance shook himself more of this madness he said i thought you were done with it it was as tantalizing as that last cognac where you knew if you had it you were going to hurt tomorrow he would perhaps mention it to glitsky it wasnt his job i am he said closing the file i was just waiting for you to get home judge guarantees bond in nash murder case but defense attorney verifies may shinns alibi da to drop charges by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer in a startling series of developments surrounding the murder trial of financier owen nash yesterday superior court judge andrew b fowler resigned just hours before it was discovered that an apartment he owns had collateralized the halfmilliondollar bail for defendant may shinn according to sources in the district attorneys office investigators may subpoena a defendants financial records if there is probable cause that the money used for bail or for paying a defense attorney is the result of criminal activity such as drug dealing or in this case prostitution ms shinn has admitted that she has been a highly paid call girl in a related story however ms shinns attorney david freeman produced two young boys as witnesses who have testified that using a telescope they saw ms shinn in her home during the time the district attorney had contended she was aboard owen nashs sailboat the eloise district attorney christopher locke last night personally interviewed the two boys and announced that all charges against ms shinn related to the murder would be dropped two eyewitnesses confirm her alibi locke said so there is no case but remember her gun was the murder weapon we believed we had a solid motive but we are dealing with a very clearly defined window of time in this case and if ms shinn was in her apartment on saturday afternoon she could not have killed owen nash this office is of course distressed by implications of racism used against ms shinn and we intend to investigate those charges and take disciplinary action if appropriate the relationship between judge fowler and ms shinn remains unclear the judge has reportedly left the city but california supreme court justice marshall brinkman who serves on the states committee on judicial ethics stated that he is deeply concerned over reports of judge fowlers purported involvement with the defendant where there is any relationship however tangential between a judge and a defendant the judge must immediately recuse himself from the case brinkman said any failure in this area is gross judicial misconduct at the very least its a disbarment issue david freeman refused to comment on judge fowler although he certainly knew the details of the bail arrangement citing the attorneyclient privilege he also defended ms shinns right to her privacy my client has been through enough he said she did not commit this murder she is an innocent woman falsely accused wrongly charged wow frannie said yeah hardy was on his third cup of coffee he had read the article twice he was astounded that andy had essentially put up bail for may shinn and hadnt felt compelled to mention that fact to him during his soulbaring two nights ago the sun was coming through the skylight over the stove shining off the pots and pans hanging from the opposite wall rebecca was breastfeeding im sure this has nothing to do with a friend of yours who is in legal trouble that you cant say anything about the shifting sands of the moral high ground hardy smiled at it had some more coffee where do you think he is she asked i think hes probably home holed up not answering the phone how much more do you know about this a little not much i dont know how you can keep this in how long have you known about it he pulled the paper back in front of him this stuff about fifteen minutes the relationship a little longer so what was the relationship what do you think frannie frannie was still in her bathrobe she had a diaper over her shoulder the baby against it patting her gently rebecca let out a long satisfied burp thats a girl she said let me hold her hardy took frannies daughter his daughter into his arms and made a face that was rewarded with a delighted gurgle are you my big girl am i not spending enough time with you he put his face down on hers breathing in her scent rubbing his cheek against hers frannie came around the table and pressed herself against him looking over his shoulder were the lucky ones she said i know but the newspaper kept drawing them both back frannie reached down and turned it back to the front page whats going to happen to him now diz i dont know since may shinn didnt kill nash the whole thing might just blow over couple of days of bad press you were right by the way remember his paperweight she gave it to him hardy nodded reminded him of his broken heart so he gave it to me she dumped him for owen nash so they werent together anymore andy fowler and shinn no i mean that was kind of the point so then why would he put up her bail why would he be the judge on her trial i dont know if he helped her out maybe he could get her back eventually that never happens frannie said what doesnt you dont dump somebody for someone else then go back to the first one if youre the one dumped okay you might but if your heart goes cold on somebody she shrugged it just doesnt happen i dont know if it was mays heart that went cold frannie the woman is a hooker maybe she really fell for nash but it was probably just a better financial deal with him so andy helped her out with the bail it might have just been him putting out the word that he had money too and hed spend it on her hell half a million thats serious goodfaith money and hed be satisfied with that i dont know i guess so anyway thats what he had before she was rubbing his back rocking back and forth against him nope she said he loved her and however she felt about him he had to believe she loved him too the paperweight remember thats a special gift thats a message so so what was it after she left him i dont believe he really thought he was buying her back by then he had to realize she didnt love him even if hed made himself believe it before so there must have been another reason hardy shook his head and leaned back into frannies body well until you get it figured out at least youll know why this thing has kept me up nights he stood and shifted the beck over his shoulder but its not going to anymore i just feel sorry for andy i mean if the shinn woman really is innocent then he just gave up everything for nothing thats right hardy said people do that all the time he stopped by glitskys before going to his own office but the sergeant wasnt in he wrote him a short note about the discrepancy in ken farriss recollection of when nash had last been seen and figured that was the end of his active involvement with owen nash then taped to the center of his desk he read the summons from drysdale to see him as soon as he got in and to bring all of his binders on the nash matter it was getting to be a habit the walk down to lockes office although this time with the bulging special lawyers briefcase hardy sat in the anteroom listening to muffled sounds through the closed door the secretary seemed unusually preoccupied typing away filing the intercom buzzed and she punched it and said yes he was out here another few minutes and hardy sat back relaxed crossed his legs and picked up the sports page from the low end table next to his chair in the days latest bob lurie was trying to move the giants to either sacramento san jose or portland although he mentioned honolulu the great baseball tradition in hawaii talk about a homeless problem he thought this is the team nobody wants to take home he turned to the standings halfway through the year nine games out third place not terrible not great how could they have traded kevin mitchell the door opened and elizabeth pullios came out she didnt appear to be in any particular hurry yet she walked by hardy ignoring his greeting as if shed never seen him before have a nice day he said to her back drysdale was at the door gesturing with his forefinger why do i get the feeling this isnt a hundredpercent social hardy asked locke got down to it immediately did you tell this reporter elliot that our office subpoenaed andy fowlers financial records no somebody tell you i did weve had a discussion about leaks and so on before right yes sir somebody tell you i was the leak did we subpoena his records i want you to tell me everything you know about andy fowler was it pullios if it was shes a liar drysdale whod been standing halfway behind hardy hands in his pockets stepped forward weve got a problem diz a real problem youve got a problem fowler locke didnt want to leave the issue how is fowler my problem you were seen entering the witnesss waiting room the other day with jeff elliot can i ask who saw me or rather who thought it was important to tell you its irrelevant locke said whats relevant is that you knew something critical to a murder case and withheld it from us hardy found himself getting pretty hot like hell its irrelevant you accuse me of something and you dont let me face my accuser i thought perhaps in an office practicing law wed give a nod to the niceties of getting to the truth we already know the truth fowler was your fatherinlaw wasnt he that came from pullios deny it i dont have to deny anything pullios unlike you is a damn good lawyer oh thats right she really did a great job with may shinn locked her up tight drysdale tried to slow it down guys if elizabeth knew that andy fowler had gone the bail for may shinn she would have come to me with it not the newspaper well isnt she the nice little gestapet drysdale butted in when did you know about fowler diz hardy stopped and took a breath you know art its funny but i dont believe weve established that i did know about fowler yet we have some unnamed source finking me into a room with jeff elliot although im beginning to suspect that in mr lockes little fiefdom here if youre accused youre guilty the district attorney was on his feet dont get any smarter with me hardy its too late for that he paused then added chris from what ive seen im already smarter than you what you are is out of a job and what you are chris hardy slowed down pulling out of it he looked him in the eye what you are chris is a total flaming asshole he thought about it at lous over his third blackandtan theyd planned to fire him all along they didnt want any new information out of him anything incriminating that had been a front figure it out before theyd asked him question one theyd told him to bring all the nash files down to the office they were planning on taking them from him which theyd done ha guys guess what the funny thing was he had withheld information from them but he really hadnt leaked the news about fowler and bail hed only found that out this morning when hed read the newspaper jeff elliot had discovered it and used the information hardy had given him about subpoena policy to make it appear it had been a da leak he was a clever guy jeff elliot and hed cost hardy his job though at the moment hardy was thinking that fell more into the category of a favor so maybe locke and drysdale had had grounds to fire him after all he had known about andy fowlers relationship with may shinn and hadnt come forward with it immediately that wasnt being a team player but he told himself even if they had reasons they didnt have the right reasons it still wasnt noon he thought hed call frannie see if she was home take her and the beck out for a nice lunch of the three men ada elizabeth pullios slept with on a fairly regular basis two were married and two worked in the district attorneys office there was district attorney chris locke who called her pullios she had him for the rush and the control intimacy with your superior might be a doubleedged sword but so far it had cut only one way actually in this case locke was the one who had most to lose if it came out she knew not only the law on workplace harassment but the implications if played right and she knew how to play them if a strong man who happened to be your boss had a relationship with you it was his problem you were the employee he was the boss and he could and often did fire you if you werent cooperative the true vulnerability of many women in the workplace was something that played into the hands of someone like pullios further the odds of a backlash were long in her favor for example the way she had pushed and manipulated to get may shinn indicted after lifting the file from another prosecutor most any other assistant da would have been stripped and flayed by locke instead since locke knew pullios was a damn good prosecutor as well as one helluva squeeze diverting his gaze and rage to a junior scapegoat like hardy had been so easy it was almost unfair except that nothing was unfair if you won fairness was a concept that didnt apply her second lover was brian powell to whom she was elizabeth brian had been her boyfriend for three years fortyfive handsome politically correct he was a divorced childless stockbroker who made six figures and did not hassle her he understood when she was busy she considered getting engaged to him he hadnt asked yet but she could lead him to it if she wanted when it was time to run for da and a mate would be helpful until then he was someone pleasant to be with and be seen with the other man in the office and in some ways the only one personally dangerous to her called her molly that was peter struler married and the father of three he gave her the impression that he could take her or leave her though hed been taking her with some regularity for the past four or five months with a law degree from duke and three years in the fbi struler was both brainsmart and streetsmart he was also irreverent and funny as an investigator for the district attorneys office he worked under a separate jurisdiction from both the sfpd and the sheriffs department it was the private police arm of the district attorneys office and was used to protect attorneys going out to see witnesses in bad areas to deliver subpoenas and occasionally to carry on its own investigations the danger of peter struler was that elizabeth pullios liked him a lot she had met him when he had escorted her in his official capacity on an interview with some lowlifes she had needed to put away even lower lifeforms after she had been her very efficient self talking to witnesses hiding behind their drawn curtains she had come out into the sunlight to see struler playing basketball shirt off with eight black highschool dudes on a glassstrewn court a little boy having the time of his life she had fallen for him gotten uncharacteristically shy and made excuses for them to get together officially until he called her on it and she told him driving out to another site that she thought maybe she was in love with him he didnt have to worry about it though she added quickly she would get over it and she didnt want to hurt his marriage my marriage is solid he had said pulling the car over nothing is going to threaten my marriage but i think we ought to get something straight between us and they did right there in the car now they sat again in his city car eating chinese takeout at a parking lot at the presidio there were whitecaps on the bay and you could see halfway to alaska struler was quoting from the front of his chopsticks wrapper welcome to chinese restaurant please try your nice chinese food with chopsticks the traditional and typical of chinese glorious history and culture she nodded its a wonderful view too now look at this struler said if this is true why did they have to invent cranes cranes you know derricks cranes if whats true struler read learn how to use your chopsticks tuck under thumb and hold firmly add second chopstick hold it as you hold a pencil hold first chopstick in original position move the second one up and down now you can pick up anything he tried to lift the briefcase its just not true how can they get by with that i cant even lift this thing i bet theres no way you could even pick up a dog a dog he pointed at the paper it says anything now you can pick up anything youre missing a bet here molly youre the lawyer i smell a major lawsuit class action false advertising big bucks she let him rave it was one of the things she liked best about him his capacity to run with essentially nothing plus their punctuation is really weak they dont use periods did you ever notice that she reached over and grabbed the briefcase herself placing it on her lap snapping open the clasps why do i sense you dont share my fascination with this topic the future is the orient mark my words she kissed him on the cheek business before pleasure he put his hand between her legs who made that up some lawyer i bet youre a lawyer mr struler no i just went to law school i never took the class on business before pleasure come to think of it thats probably why i flunked the bar he moved his hand a little actually i never took the bar did i peter he made a face molly but he put his hands in his own lap okay what this is a twoweekold murder my favorite my point is the police have already embarrassed themselves over it the owen nash thing abe glitsky has been handling the case and he made the original bust lucky guy right hes not going to do it again theres very little evidence plus the guy who got fired today hardy theyre at least pretty good friends anyway the police cooperation is going to slow down for a while and you turn to me i am touched id just like you to take a fresh look at it thats all this is an important case and i dont want it to go away i made a big pitch for this one to locke whoever killed this guy theyve made me look pretty bad struler thought a moment then took some papers out of the briefcase and glanced at them is this all of it she nodded thats all the paper theres some other evidence logged the murder weapon stuff like that but its been pretty well gone over so what do you want me to do start over we need a new theory and its in here somewhere somebody killed owen nash if you tell me you dont have any ideas who that would be a fib wouldnt it and then id have to spank you she leaned toward him and licked his ear i dont have any ideas in spite of elizabeth pullioss belief that the police were going to let it lie glitsky jumped on hardys discrepancy there was nothing better than a suspect who told a lie it opened up all the doors and windows let some new air in of course he didnt know for a fact that farris had lied he could have simply made a mistake remembered incorrectly but he was on the record glitsky had been in on the conversation he remembered it as having said white was white one time and then white was black the next it deserved reflection glitskys own reports revealed that farris had been at taos during the weekend of the murder what was at taos hadnt he said it was a place with no phones no electricity had anyone else seen him there were there records of his plane flight a hotel rental car he took some notes placed a call to the albuquerque police then reached farris at his office at owen industries in south san francisco sergeant what can i do for you a busy man sounding like it you know weve got an open case again sir it looks like may shinn wasnt on the eloise and if thats true she didnt kill mr nash of course i read that im not sure i think its true well yes sir but the da seems to think it is and while thats the case we have to go on with the investigation there was one of those infernal beeps again glitsky had forgotten about them just a minute would you he sat on hold for twenty seconds keeping time with a pencil on his blotter sergeant sorry about that its still crazy here i know i tried to call the da this morning but they told me some nonsense that your man hardy wasnt working there anymore and nobodys gotten back to me they said hardy didnt work there anymore thats what they said glitsky shook his head well thats ridiculous ill give him your message but im calling to clear up a little inconsistency were kind of starting over here so i apologize its all right but whats this story on this judge knowing may thats really a shock were looking into that too but what im wondering is when you last saw mr nash alive he did not explain about the apparent conflict in farriss testimony i remember distinctly we had lunch down at the angus yes sir and you told us it was on friday beep i did i dont remember which day it was if i said friday i must have been mistaken this was the weekend you went to taos i remember what weekend it was i always fly out to taos in the morning which would have been friday so the lunch must have been thursday i could call the restaurant and doublecheck that would be helpful you want to hold i can do it right now he came back in about a minute saying that the restaurant still had the reservation records and it had been thursday there was no way to make this next question sound innocuous but if the answer was yes it would save glitsky a lot of footwork mr farris is there staff at the place where you stay in taos you didnt have to draw a map he didnt answer right away glitsky heard him take a breath on either side of the recording beep owen nash was my best friend sergeant i dont benefit in any conceivable way from his death to the contrary im personally devastated and professionally handicapped in ways you cant imagine by owens death im sure theres a substantial paper record of my comings and goings that weekend and if you decide its your duty to look into it you go right ahead if i were you sergeant id first spend some time on this judge but thats up to you and now if youll excuse me ive got a full load here the connection went dead in glitskys hand he tapped his pencil on his blotter farriss reaction was not unusual folks were generally unappreciative when told they were under suspicion but glitsky couldnt help but notice he didnt say that anybody had seen him in taos or anywhere else could be an oversight like thursday or friday or whatever day it had been when hed last laid eyes on his best friend could be it was the kind of thing though that glitsky thought hed remember the nap helped a little but not much after the three blackandtans in the morning hardy and frannie and rebecca had shared some outstanding gambas at sol y luna also because frannie wasnt drinking at all hed had a bottle of a light white rioja hell he was celebrating hed broken the news about his job and she took it in very much the same vein as he had himself they had most of a quarter million dollars in the bank the profit check on hardys percentage of the shamrock was coming in this week money wasnt the biggest problem in the world and she didnt like what practicing law had been doing to him which called for a little fundador after lunch frannie drove home and hardy got his shirt off before he crashed to sleep waking up to rebeccas wails and a thundering head he walked into the back room and picked up the baby patting her gently holding her against him she tried to fasten herself onto his nipple and cried all the more at the lack of result frannie was coming through the kitchen were really having another one of these baby things he said she didnt have the lunch you did she doesnt have the head ive got either he held rebecca in front of his face look he said i know for a fact i feel worse than you and im not crying the logic didnt have any effect he handed her off to her mother and in seconds she was suckling thats an excellent trick hardy said he was changing into his running clothes his green jogging suit next up in the drawer you mind if i run a little of this off he took the fourmile circular route out to the beach along the hard sand south to lincoln the air was clear the temperature was in the low seventies and got a little nippier with the wind off the breakers here he was unemployed during a major depression and he smiled as he ran the headache gone in the first twenty minutes down the beach back along the park up the avenues to his home he was sitting on his porch cooling down the sun still up but hidden now behind the buildings across the street on the backhalf of his run he had decided that with his calendar suddenly free the hardy family should book a flight to hawaii and disappear for a couple of weeks he was daydreaming about some serious beach time rum drinks jimmy buffett riffs on a balmy breeze from hardys porch the sixstory apartment buildings on either side blocked his vision both up and down the street so there was no warning when celine nash appeared on the other side of his picket fence stonewashed jeans sandals magenta silk blouse he might have expected something like this to happen perhaps he should have called her farris even glitsky with the news of his termination was she coming to offer her condolences ask what happened get news about who would now be handling the case how did she get his address he stood up deciding he was going to change his phone number and have it unlisted get his address out of the new book he should have done it he now realized when he had been rehired at the district attorneys office last february but with the new marriage new job new baby other things had filled his mind he took a couple of steps off the porch celine saw him and stopped in her tracks he came down toward her and he realized her face was frozen had something else happened she stood stockstill as though in shock celine are you all right he took a few more steps toward her stopping just before the gate there was a long moment she stared at him with a look that seemed to combine horror and loss hardy heard the front door open heard frannie say diz celines eyes went behind him to frannie fastened back first it seemed hopefully then almost in panic on him im sorry she said starting to back away im sorry this is a mistake celine whats the matter she shook her head looking him up and down everything between him and celine had always been too personal now seeing his house and his wife she couldnt ignore the reality not only was he a good man he had a life that didnt include her on any level she backed further away then stopped and seemed to regain some control im sorry dismas i dont know what i was thinking its all right what is it she shook her head nothing its a mistake she was backing away again turning she lifted a hand a diffident wave and walked away who was that frannie was up next to him arm in his celine nash owen nashs daughter god shes beautiful isnt she hardy tightened his arm around her youre beautiful she bumped her hip against him what did she want he shrugged i dont know maybe she heard i got dumped she was getting in her car parked halfway down the street they both watched her so why didnt she stay shes been sort of unstable since the loss of her father they were going back to the porch he told frannie about celines explosion at him the other day her mood swings he neglected to mention the afterhours meeting at hardbodies i know after eddie i was a bat case hardy tightened his hand around her waist you were a mensch hardy said shes not holding up so well you shouldnt be too hard on her hardy kissed his wife im not going to be anything on her im fired remember all thats over part iv hardy did take frannie and rebecca to hawaii where they stayed for two weeks in san francisco the owen nash case fell out of the headlines during august and september there was no outward sign of activity although peter struler not abe glitsky kept himself very busy on the case that elizabeth pullios didnt want to close the police department and abe had moved along to other more pressing crimes now it had been over three months since hardy had been fired and struler and pullios had put together their case when they did finally move they moved very quickly the sealed indictment was passed down by the grand jury on the morning of tuesday october superior court judge marian braun read the indictment and decreed that there would be no bail on the bench warrant in an unusual move the warrant itself was handdelivered by the district attorney himself christopher locke accompanied by assistant da elizabeth pullios and police chief dan rigby to lieutenant frank batiste of the homicide division at am reading it batiste sucked in a breath had this case gone to the grand jury in the normal way after an investigation by an assigned police officer service of the warrant would have been assigned to that officer in this case inspector sergeant abraham glitsky but glitsky along with the rest of homicide was unaware of peter strulers work on behalf of the das office so the service was assigned to marcel lanier who was lounging around the office waiting for something to happen judge fowler had weathered a cyclone of vitriol and criticism gossip and embarrassment but like all storms this one had passed the reprimand he received from the ethics committee due to his long and distinguished career stopped far short of having teeth and the bar association told him that had the may shinn trial gone on it would have seriously considered suspension or even disbarment but in the end three months later he was back in the business of the law with a spacious corner office at embarcadero one a partner in the firm of strand worke luzinski when wanda buzzed him and told him officer marcel lanier was waiting to see him he said of course he knew marcel send him on in fowler hadnt been completely ostracized at the hall a lot of the attorneys and staff saw his side of things the human side his colleagues on the bench were less understanding but hed expected that there was nothing he could do about it to the cops the shinn fiasco had been the district attorneys screwup not fowlers it hadnt gone down as a loss for the police department except for the false arrest but the grandjury indictment had de facto corroborated glitskys judgment anyway so even that wasnt an issue fowler came around his desk and extended his hand to lanier how are you doing marcel social call how can i help you lanier remained standing no not a social call judge andy please judge he took the warrant out of his coat pocket i dont know how to say this but ive got a warrant here for your arrest for my arrest thats right sir andy tried to smile marcel lanier wasnt smiling is this some kind of joke no sir the grand jury issued an indictment against you this morning on the murder of owen nash fowler found he needed to put his weight back against the corner of his desk the grand jury he repeated he had gone pale poleaxed owen nash lanier stood mute wanda was buzzing again and fowler punched the intercom button its your daughter judge lunch just hold her a second but jane had already opened the door hi dad oops sorry wanda didnt say you had a meeting seeing him so pale she stopped dad whats going on jane hon why dont you wait outside a minute are you all right whats happening im fine scoot now go the door closed behind her reluctant retreat this is ridiculous marcel its locke isnt it payback time all i know sir is ive got to bring you in sure i know i understand of course its not you what in the world do they think they have sir i have to tell you that you have the right to remain silent and anything you do say marcel please fowler said holding up a hand you have my word i wont plead miranda its got to be pure harassment locke swore a thousand times hed crucify me now he thinks hes got the chance the crumbs of a hero sandwich littered david freemans desk the last few bites had been interrupted by andy fowlers telephone call from the hall of justice fowler hadnt spoken to him since hed refused to challenge his department that day last july in the may shinn matter but now in trouble himself he had called again what fowler was saying made little sense to freeman christopher locke might in fact hate fowlers guts but he wasnt going to take another hit being wrong on a highprofile murder like owen nash they must have found some real evidence and freeman knew fowler had more motive to kill owen nash than had ever been even imputed to may shinn listen andy im not sure i can take this one what do you mean youre not sure what would be the problem well two come to mind im not saying no just yet andy but im going to have to consider it number one im still representing may shinn in some civil work id want to avoid the appearance of any conflict there i cant see how that would apply david may and i are totally separate yes well the other one is our collusion collusion thats what it was andy so damn close to conspiracy i still get nightmares and i believe you know it there was absolutely nothing illegal about that relationship and you know it well be that as it may im having a little trouble envisioning the two of us together at a defense table and getting anything like reasonable treatment from the bench so well file for change of venue freeman leaned back in his chair and took another bite of his sandwich again he didnt agree with andy change of venue was called for when you didnt think you could get a fair trial in a certain locality because of pretrial media coverage or other excessive public awareness of the purported facts in a case but it presumed that the prejudice youd encounter would be on the jury what fowler was ignoring and what freeman knew to be true was that there wasnt a judge in the state perhaps in the country who didnt know what hed done and wouldnt be prejudiced against him for it he was this years legal benedict arnold any judge of freemans acquaintance and he knew most of them would be far tougher on one of their own on an andy fowler than they would on other miscreants all other things being equal andy fowler had in their official view befouled their collective cave and david freeman understood that it would be this side of a miracle if fowler could get a fair trial anywhere and with freeman his colluder beside him the chances became more remote venue is an issue all right andy but ill really have to give this some consideration meanwhile david what do you recommend freeman was surprised to hear the note of anger in the judges voice there was nothing personal here and fowler must know that i could recommend an interim counsel andy several in fact what did they set bail at fowler clipped it theres no bail on the bench warrant they want to be sure im here for the arraignment look david my two minutes are about up and i need some representation here ill see what i can do freeman put down the receiver and popped the last bite of his sandwich there must be something in the san francisco air he thought dry salami mortadella sourdough bread any food that sat and fermented picked up something from it some essence that enhanced its flavor he put his feet up chewing he figured fowlers bail would be at least a million if he got it at all he could guarantee offhand that three judges out of the six on superior court would let the judge rot in jail just to express their displeasure and it would all be impartial impersonal within the bounds of their prerogatives institutionalized pettiness perfectly legal the law was a manysplendored thing jane fowler walked into the little shamrock and back to the dart boards where dismas hardy was playing for money she let him finish his round let him turn and see her they hadnt spoken in three months since shed yelled at him about forcing her father to retire he hadnt returned her phone calls four of them altogether one about every three weeks after seeing her father led from his office wearing handcuffs that was the drill she didnt care what he thought about it she was going to see him so shed driven out to his house frannie obviously pregnant again had about six other infants and a few other women in their house had they opened a daycare center or what no this was their playgroup other new mothers supporting each other there was a pang this hadnt been a feature in janes life during the months she and hardy had been new parents frannie had been as always polite and had told her where she could find dismas who always left the house on tuesday afternoons she explained that dismas was good around one infant or perhaps even two but when the number got to four plus their mothers he reached his critical mass and tended to want to disappear he was undoubtedly playing darts at the little shamrock she should try there seeing jane hardy lit up briefly then frowned whats the matter he asked she told him in about twenty seconds hardys dart opponent had finished his turn hardy he said he told jane to give him a minute went to the chalk line and threw three darts a twenty a seventeen and a double six the other man swore and took out his wallet hardy was already pulling the flights from his darts putting the shafts back in his leather case double or nothing the other man asked hardy shook his head cant do it he pocketed the mans bill and led jane up to the bar what do you want me to do jane i want you to see him i want you to help him how she didnt know hardy had been unemployed for three months he had put on thirteen pounds under the guise of improving his dart game and preparing to play in some big tournaments he was drinking about six guinnesses every day between one when the shamrock opened and about five when he went home the latest guinness arrived daddy needs you jane said its ridiculous he wouldnt kill anybody dismas you know that hardy said nothing he didnt know that nobody knew that come on she said what am i supposed to do youll think of something youre the lawyer sos he so are all his friends hardy shook his head hed think of something he liked that im sure hes already got a lawyer but he needs somebody he can count on not just somebody hes paying im not a lawyer anymore and even if i were im not a defense lawyer ive never defended anybody in my life look im only asking you to see him hes done you favors more than one you owe him in a way maybe so he still felt bad justified but bad nonetheless about andys early retirement guilty that hed forced it so quickly when the whole thing had proved unnecessary since their meeting at the fern bar hardy and andy hadnt spoken i didnt leak it jane jane narrowed her eyes but you were the only one who knew about him and may it had to be you hardy shook his head from the phone records i didnt know anything about the bail the chronicle guy the reporter hes the one that found the bail story daddy thought it was you well it wasnt and if he did why would he want to see me now he didnt exactly say he did im saying it i think it would be good for him for both of you hardy sighed jane wasnt going to go away besides he wasnt doing anything else how could it hurt hardy followed jane in his own car it was a warm october day indian summer in san francisco the top was down and there was plenty of time to ponder he found it nearly impossible to imagine that they had arrested andy fowler for the murder of owen nash he knew that locke personally disliked the man and that pullios was capable of carrying a grudge of impressive proportions but all that aside you needed evidence to indict a man a former judge for murder even more to convict hardy hadnt heard about any new evidence turning up and he was sure he would have he still saw glitsky once a week or so talked to him every few days by the time he and frannie had gotten back from hawaii the nash case had faded from the newspapers but glitsky had come by the house filling hardy in apparently ken farris had made an honest mistake about the last time he had seen nash in fact it had been on thursday people made mistakes he had flown to taos on friday ate out in restaurants in taos on both friday and saturday nights flown back monday morning austin brucker mr silicon valley had vacated the presidency of the company owen nash had set him up in and started a new venture of his own something to do with ceramic fibers down in san josé with a staff of five engineers hed been in his shop all day every day for the months of april may and june and according to all sources would remain there until next groundhog day at the earliest glitsky being thorough had even looked into celine her fingerprints had been all over the eloise which was to be expected she said that she had often gone sailing with her father the friends she had visited in santa cruz were an unlikely trio of two gay bodybuilders and one of their mothers all of whom verified that celine had spent the weekend with them helping with the remodeling of their old victorian house the one surprise was that celines fingerprints had shown up in the arrest database if you had never been arrested your fingerprints might be on file with the department of motor vehicles but by far the most accessible record to the police and thus the first place they looked was the database of people who had been arrested celine was arrested twice shoplifting when she was twenty reduced to reckless trespass dismissed and prostitution prostitution i know like she needed the money right anyway it was fifteen years ago i questioned her on it its not what you would call one of her favorite memories she says it was a misunderstanding she also says it was just after her first marriage ended and she was having a bad time which was it a bad time or a misunderstanding i know that was a little iffy either way it never got charged when your fathers owen nash money keeps talking doesnt it hardy had said and glitsky said he believed it did so with farris brucker and celine accounted for only one righteous suspect was left and that was andy fowler but and what had plagued this case from every angle since it began glitsky could find no evidence linking him to owen nash or to the eloise andy had been out of town hiking in the sierras though apparently he had seen no one but he hadnt known owen nash there was no record of their having met while hardy was in hawaii it had come out that andy fowler had had a longterm relationship with may shinn but that it had ended about the time she met nash i dont think that was a coincidence abe no i dont either so what fowler swears he never heard of nash until he read about him in the papers do you believe that theres nothing to contradict it nothing to put him on the boat whats the motive eliminate a rival get her back oldest one in the world youve got to understand diz people do think fowler might have done it locke wants his ass in a big way but if he did do it he did it right theres no way locke or rigby or anybody else is going to make a move until weve got more than we had with shinn which we sure as hell do not so is he fowler seeing shinn again no sign of it and believe me people are looking she seems to be lying low trying to collect her money suing me and the city and county freemans bill must be approaching the national debt those had been glitskys facts to satisfy his own curiosity hardy had done some checking himself he had the telephone records andy fowler might have convinced himself that before owen nash came along he had may shinn all to himself but her telephone records included three other numbers called with about the same regularity as those to andy fowler hardy tried all three numbers one was to a switchboard of the main office of the timberline group a timberlobby consulting firm with an address on bay street hardy thought it unlikely that may shinn was doing a lot of lumber work when a woman answered at the second number hardy feeling a little foolish pretended to be taking a demographic survey for the neilson ratings the woman said that she and her husband who worked out of the house he was in software were both in their midfifties she didnt want to be too specific but their income was in the low six figures he let it go the third number was to the private office of an affable millionaire in the garment district so it seemed may had three other clients before owen nash came along four including andy fowler and from the phone record shed dropped them all around the beginning of february did nash pay her more or had she as she contended truly fallen in love with nash of course he knew nothing that tied any of these men to owen nash not yet hardy spent a day wondering if he should mention them to glitsky then decided against it he had promised andy he wouldnt bring up the phone records if he didnt have to the originals were there in the file downtown if anybody wanted to look at them it wasnt hardys job anymore but it didnt take immense reserves of gray matter to realize this discovery would open things up again if the motive they had all ascribed to fowler killing a rival applied then it applied as well to mays other three clientslovers but then the das office wasnt arrayed in a vendetta against any of these guys as it was against fowler still andy must have made a mistake some evidence must have turned up but where did they get it hardy was sure glitsky would have called him with anything at all so it hadnt been him and if glitsky didnt have it who did he was the investigating officer it didnt make sense hardy hadnt set foot in the hall of justice since the day after he was fired when he went in to pick up his personal effects his dart board the paperweight now coming up the front steps with jane he found it hard to believe that hed been talked into returning the false accusations the unnamed informer the politics of the lifers the gut reaction still kicked in he and jane rode in the crowded elevator up to booking he didnt have much of an idea what he was going to do it was late in the afternoon and he thought at least hed get the lay of the land at the desk the sergeant looked up and nodded hey hardy taking the day off it took him a minute hardy was in casual clothes the sergeant thought he was still working there where you been on vacation or something or something listen you got andy fowler processed yet yeah i think so ill check can you believe that the judge he got up from his chair and disappeared for two minutes during which hardy devoutly hoped no one would recognize him when he came out again he pointed to his right and told hardy he could go on in theyd be bringing the judge down he and jane were admitted then ushered into interview room a the same room where he had first seen may shinn jane sat comfortably howd we get in here i think under false pretenses now listen when your father gets in here be cool in front of the guard dont jump up and yell or anything since they think im working here lets let them think youre my assistant okay but it wasnt so easy her father just didnt look the same in a yellow jumpsuit four hours before in his pinstripes andys handcuffs had been the ultimate indignity now jane realized she hadnt known the half of it the judge played the game entered cooperatively nodded at both of them and sat down across the table hardy thanked the guard and told him to wait outside as soon as the door closed her father said good how did this happen dismas inclined his head a fraction his hand to his mouth i cheated how are you doing andy badly how about you all right the two men tried not to look at each other jane wasnt going to let this go bad or worse dismas didnt leak your story daddy about you and may her father didnt look beaten in fact he looked ready to fight you didnt directly at dismas i said i wouldnt i didnt he shrugged i figured you had other things on your mind so did i i got fired over it for example i heard about that more waiting jane realized she was squeezing her fingernails into her palms she didnt understand this silence the two men whod been closest to her jockeying for something i guess i just got a little tired explaining how i didnt do whatever it was somebody thought i did it gets old id imagine it would her father was inside himself settling something sorry diz i just assumed janes exhusband had his hands folded on the table he opened them i lived through it what are you doing here somebody thinks i killed owen nash i know that but whos representing you you ought to be out of here already a tight smile youd think so wouldnt you one of lockes little object lessons no bail until the arraignment he paused at least that locke hes a swell guy fowler kept on i called david freeman he thought it might not be wise for him to represent me because of may he intimated hed put out the word meanwhile it appears that im to stay locked up another tight smile lousy pun daddy they cant do that they can honey how many times have i had a defense lawyer tell me his client had to get out of jail wouldnt survive one night there it was life and death and i told them it would have to wait until the morning judicial process we cant let this happen you cant stay here dismas can do something hardy nodded i could try andy why would you want to do that what would you try i dont know i got me and jane in here to see you didnt i i could try walking you downstairs and out the door her father pulled at the jumpsuit dont you think the outfits a little conspicuous goddamn it jane said will you two cut it out youre right ill have to think of something else the judge got serious youd really do something why hardy shrugged at least until one of freemans wonders shows up at least youd be represented i could pass it off after you decided who you wanted hardy straightened in his chair not to mention i wouldnt mind getting in the face of a few of these people here they seem to have pissed me off can you get him out tonight dismas on bail or something jane looked at her father you cannot stay here overnight fowler reached out and patted her hand its all right honey i spent a night in jail once before voluntarily i admit and it wasnt so bad i wanted to see what we were putting people through ill survive i promise you besides i might as well get used to it it could be longer than that if bail is denied they couldnt do that her father and hardy shared a glance the guard outside the door gave a knock ill call freeman keep him on it hardy said and ill be there tomorrow you sure you want me representing you even temporarily andy appeared for really the first time to consider it maybe more than that why andy the judge looked around the tiny room then at his daughter as though looking for verification of something he knew hed written hardy off too easily before when he thought he had betrayed his trust there had been a mistake he knew hardy and he hadnt blown any whistle on andy fowler hardy didnt betray trusts and he didnt give up the devil you know he said smiling he left jane at the fourth floor getting out of the elevator he walked down the hallway and turned into homicide if glitsky was in maybe they could stop in at lous for old times sake but he wasnt around hardy leaned over his desk and was writing him a note when he heard some heels on the tiles and looked up pullios stopped in the door hi bets hardy said getting any exciting cases her smile was glacial how are you dismas great he said im writing my memoirs she didnt react her eyes searched the back of the open room anybody seen lanier she asked one of the guys said he thought he was downstairs having some coffee with a witness she came back to hardy well take care of yourself she started to turn and hardy spoke i hear judge fowlers been arrested she stopped my news travels fast tribal drums were kind of family oh yes thats right you really think he killed owen nash the grand jury thought there was enough evidence to issue the indictment hardy folded his arms leaning back against glitskys desk i have it on good authority that if the da wanted the grand jury would indict a ham sandwich pullios nodded well its been nice talking to you hardy caught up with her out in the hallway he turned conversational i guess theres some new evidence huh pullios stopped are you representing fowler im merely a curious citizen who wonders what youve got new since shinn quite a bit im sure itll be in the newspaper she started walking again hardy found himself planted to the floor with roots of rage it just came up over him his stomach turned over and he heard his blood pulsing in his ears dont do it he told himself dont say any more dont chase her through the halls nothing to be gained he watched her elegant figure disappear around the corner of the elevator lobby where had the air gone feeling as though hed stopped breathing he sucked a strained lungful he needed a drink or four or five on top of the three guinnesses he had had before jane had arrived at the shamrock he had the first couple of irish whiskeys at lous but then the guys started showing up guys that knew him that wanted to know what he was doing how he was getting along yeah he was busy working on stuff was looking into opening a second bar maybe even a restaurant no he didnt want to go into private practice wind up defending a bunch of scum leaving lous he remembered that he had forgotten to call david freeman hed call him from the next place and frannie too he couldnt forget to call frannie she would worry shed been worried for a couple of months now worried about him about them their future their baby the pregnancy everything their wavelengths had ceased to coincide somehow it worried him too made him doubt himself sometimes he thought it was making him sick drinking seemed to cure it entertaining the possibility that he should cut down on his intake and forgetting his own oftuttered advice that beer on whiskey was mighty risky he stopped at a place down seventh street and ordered a rainier ale the bar didnt have a pay phone he brought the bottle of green death over to a small table next to the door and stared up at the television screen broadcasting the evening news the financier the judge and the prostitute again he moved to the other side of the table where he didnt have to look at the damned set white noise theyd enjoyed the vacation the two weeks had been good for them theyd come back refreshed reinvigorated reconnected theyd purposely put off discussing his career plans there would be plenty of time for that instead they talked about babies and childbirth about whether moses and susan were an item about food and their past lives eddie and jane and if they should move to a bigger house before or after the next child came along hardy had run daily on the beach a couple of days of rum drinks then hed surprised himself by going on the wagon for the rest of the trip he was tan and lean and liked it then the first week home catching up with abe about owen nash and may shinn and andy fowler cleaning out some tanks at the steinhart with pico pouring a few shifts at the shamrock to keep his hand in at first it was a nagging unease a touch of insomnia he hadnt wanted to admit how much hed invested how great had been the risk when hed given up bartending right after christmas to go back to the law but now in the long and formless days stretching before him he was starting to come to the numbing realization that hed failed in one of the fundamental decisions of his life hed been fired his services were not wanted it wasnt that the people he worked for were so honorable or talented or better at their jobs than he was at least he didnt think so but the fact that hed been judged by those people and found unacceptably wanting never mind their standards he was out they were in it got to him he found himself internalizing the rejection more he couldnt seem to get it out of him who was he at forty anyway a castoff a reject he had told frannie what the hell he didnt want to be underfoot all day hed go out and interview a few places get some work try to get some feeling back that he was doing something worthwhile that maybe he was worthwhile people were nice men and women lawyers and office managers in business suits like he was wearing but they didnt hire him theyd call him back it was just a slow time maybe he could try the public defenders he thought he was a logical man and logic was telling him that in terms of the marketplace he was worthless well shit he wasnt going to accept that hed lived a pretty good life thank you and it damn sure wasnt over yet the hell with the rest of you then he made his big mistake frannie was a rock at home telling him not to push it time would take care of it something would come up she loved him but once you started thinking people didnt want you it was easy to start believing nobody wanted you for anything you were just a burden a drag plain and simple not able to carry your own weight he thought he could feel frannie pulling away she swore it wasnt true she wasnt she was with him but he found he couldnt talk with her anymore he could tell it was making her lose confidence in him and that was too much to ask her to carry she needed him to be strong especially now building a family so he resolved to put on a happy face lots of laughs long silences between he idly thought of finding someone he could talk to where he wasnt constantly reminded of his situation of course he wasnt going to but wouldnt it be nice to be around someone who thought you were okay not aware of any of the baggage hed taken to stopping by the shamrock after his interviews and having a round or two it was more time that he didnt have to face her he stopped working out hed been home from hawaii a month now six weeks he told himself enough was enough it was time to beat this thing not let the bastards get him down the first step he told himself was physical get back in shape stop drinking tighten up he stood behind celine nash as she pumped up and down on the stairmaster her hair was fixed back with a hot pink headband a patch of darker pink showed where she was sweating between her shoulder blades her ass was a phenomenal pumping machine up and down step step step sweat was pouring off her he thought about turning around and walking out it was okay he told himself he was here to work out and hed chosen hardbodies because hed already been in the place and it had the machines he was looking for he hadnt seen her since shed stopped in front of his house before the vacation when shed realized she couldnt be in his life well he wasnt putting her back into his life now enough time had gone by since then he wasnt starting anything by showing up here he climbed onto the machine next to hers yo he said they were sitting together in the steam room he was on a towel leaning back against the cedar wall in gym shorts and a tshirt shed gone to the locker room after her workout gotten rid of her leggings and changed into a onepiece black bathing suit the talking wound down she was doing all right she said keeping busy he wished he was well at least he was exercising that was doing something yes the temperature was near a hundred and twenty the room was tiny cramped perhaps five by seven feet with a furnace near the floor which was covered with rocks celine got up and poured more water from a pitcher over the rocks and a cloud of steam lifted and hovered she went to sit down on the wood where shed been then jumped and said ouch here hardy moved enough towel out from under him to give her room he could feel his heart pounding through his tshirt their legs were together she leaned back next to him and took his hand putting it high on her thigh celine shh her shoulder came up against him ive been coming here for six months and have never seen another soul in this room she lifted the elastic on her nylon suit and guided his hand under it feel me she said she was shaved bare the skin smooth as though it had been oiled already wet where she was moving him oh god she said oh dear god one hand held him in place against her and the other lifted his shirt found the band of his shorts and reached under them for him silk and oil honey and salt that proved he had been right he was no better than anyone else and worse than most he tried to tell himself once that he hadnt been technically unfaithful there had been no penetration therefore he hadnt really made love to her feeble beneath contempt more honest if he had now he had proved that the worlds assessment of him was valid he wouldnt hire himself to do anything he could barely look at himself in the mirror he started practicing darts putting away gallons of guinness avoiding frannie avoiding himself putting on weight thank god celine hadnt tried to follow up that at least seemed to be over but he resided in a deep cave in total darkness it was tenthirty there were four bottles of rainier ale on the table now a rocks glass with mostly water in the bottom a faint taste of irish to it he blinked wondering where he had been and tried to focus on the clock over the bar no use he stood uncertainly jesus outside the night had turned cold and the street came up at him forcing him against the outer stucco of the building for support seventh street stretched empty for what seemed like miles shining as though it were wet was his car parked up at the hall of justice even if it was how could he get it home he tried moving along but everything suddenly seemed to hurt to throb his shoulder where hed been wounded in vietnam the foot hed hurt last year in acapulco there were noises behind him laughter then a skipping leather on concrete it finally registered coming toward him he straightened up turned around saw an arm something a blur that hit him in the forehead knocked him to one side he heard another dull thud was that him and his head cracked back against the stucco and he went down there were images the gagging jolt of smelling salts a light behind his eyes something sticky under his hand the cold concrete lets take him down wait a minute is this him hardy forced his eyes open the flashlight hit him again and he winced shadows emerged recognizable cops a lucky break one of them had found his wallet less cash in the curb hardy had never given his badge back to locke if he wanted it he could come and ask for it are you dismas hardy one of them asked he supposed he nodded grunted something he as drunk as he smells another whiff of the salts hardy brought his hand up to his face felt a crust he looked down his white sweater was matted dark im hardy he said they got him up pain nausea watch out guys he staggered a step or two away and vomited bile and beer he leaned against the building sorry they stood back a couple of yards he caught his breath spat a few times tried to see what time it was but his watch was gone if they could do it he told them hed rather go home than the hospital he didnt think anything was broken he might have a concussion his head felt like an anvil attached to his neck by some twopound test and someone kept swinging the smiths hammer they put him in the rear seat he rested his head back lights passing overhead the freeway overpass he closed his eyes nothing to see it was almost midnight and moses had been there for a half hour to her brother frannie looked particularly vulnerable she was now five months pregnant and showing it her arms looked thin he thought her face was too hollow maybe it was the contrast with the fullness of her belly and breasts there were circles under her eyes she sat forward on the low livingroom couch her elbows on her knees her hands crossed under the bulge of her stomach moses was telling her that the best thing to do was wait hed turn up moses had had his own lost weekends or nights this isnt a lost weekend mose she hesitated hes with jane i know hes with jane moses shook his head theres no way frannie she came here today asking for him jane did he mulled that what did she want she wanted dismas she always wants dismas hes gone back to her before frannie come on he wasnt with you then he wasnt with anybody it probably had to do with her father being arrested he and diz were friends right are i think well why hadnt she thought of that these raging hormones were making her crazy he probably went down to get him out help get him out whatever they do down there lost track of the time diz never loses track of the time what if he got janes father out and then they all went out somewhere to celebrate and then her father left them together what if he was snatched by invading space creatures and dissected alive in the name of intergalactic research i dont want to kid about it i dont want to play what if hes probably just hung up it happens they sat for a long moment its just hes been so unhappy lately like hes lost moses cricked his back got up slowly and crossed over to the mantel he rearranged the herd of elephants something he did differently with every visit you know frannie i just dont think anybodys ever prepared us guys like me and diz for how tough real life is he tried to make a semijoke of it but he was serious and she knew it life with me isnt tough moses im not saying with you im saying you know life in general she got up and moved some elephants back the way theyd been youre just getting old brother moses grabbed her gently and pulled at her hair he was older than hardy he had raised his sister from the time she was eight of the ten things he cared about most in the world he liked to say that eight of them were frannie the other two were closely guarded secrets facing the bay window moses saw the police car pull up in front here he is anyway he said see he mustve been doing something with the cops there was fog everywhere in his head out the bedroom window i dont deserve this frannie had been up awhile had taken a shower and gotten dressed she sat across the room by the door to the nursery in her rocking chair i am very sad that this happened but it wouldnt have if youd come home frannie she stopped him pressing on she wasnt crying but her cheeks were wet i know this is a hard time for you although im not sure why and you dont have to try and tell me but i dont deserve you treating me this way not calling letting me sit and worry all night i wont have it in my life hardy had a walnutsized lump over his hairline his left ear was raw and there was a gash in the scalp above it they must have kicked him when he was down his ribs jabbed at him his headache was mammoth his tongue bitten in several places he still tasted blood im sorry of course youre sorry so am i who wouldnt be sorry what do you want dismas what do you want if you dont want me im out of here babies and all i mean it he didnt doubt her frannie wasnt a poker player and this wasnt a bluff i do want you he said he saw her take a breath a miracle he thought she still wanted him she was as mad as hed ever seen her but at least it wasnt over between them i know ive been a shit i cant tell you the things she held up a hand no litany i just dont want to live miserable i dont want that for any of us this family doesnt deserve it including you hardy held his head in his hands so why do i feel like thats exactly what i do deserve i dont know youve somehow let those idiots make you feel theyre better than you are which is ridiculous whats so hot about them what have they done why does it matter what they think of you okay but what if theyre right they might be right damn it dismas theyre not right youre not a loser why because im smart and i wouldnt have married a loser dont let them do this to you to me if you do they will have won why couldnt she see it hed been going around proving it for a couple of months you have to admit frannie im not exactly on a winning streak her eyes flashed now thanks a lot what am i whats this house and the beck she gestured down to her stomach whats this new guy anyway doesnt this count as winning something i dont mean that well then she slammed a tiny fist hard into her leg and raised her voice goddamn it dont say it then she stood up turned into the nursery the rocking chair creaked on the hardwood after a while he heard her talking to rebecca its okay its not you sweetie back to sleep now hardy sore and nauseous forced himself out of bed hurting everywhere he stood by the nursery door stopped the creaking rocker with his foot she turned around look she said whatever it is just put it behind you you cant undo it lets just move on okay weve got a good life here but youve got to respect me and youve got to respect you end of sermon she crossed the room to him touched his arm lightly go take another shower she said a hot one ill make breakfast hardy sat on the megahard bench in the gallery of department marian brauns courtroom elizabeth pullios in her power redandblue never gave him a glance from the prosecution table hardy recognized several welldressed lawyers hanging around probably sent over by david freeman for fowler to choose among he guessed one of them would wind up representing andy jane came and slid in beside him what happened to you hardy was wearing a threepiece suit white shirt one of his best conservative ties hed gotten his shoes shined downstairs he looked proper except for the bandage across the top of his forehead the swelling around his eye he told her it was a long story janes favorite kind but didnt get to go into it because the judge was coming in and they all rose braun had had chambers next to andy fowler for something like a decade that she had been the presiding judge for the superior court and so the recipient of the grand jurys indictment had been a matter of timing since leo chomorro had moved up to fill andy fowlers seat upon his retirement the duties of presiding judge were again being rotated what was ominous was that braun who had known andy well and might be considered to be one of his few allies had accepted da chris lockes recommendation and decreed that there would be no bail in the normal course of events for a typical defendant bail would not be set before arraignment in a murder case because the court wanted to guarantee at least one appearance at the arraignment of the accused in this case though there would have been little fear that andy fowler would not show up the withholding of bail was a clear signal that there would be no professional courtesies andy fowler was out of the club at least they werent making him wait all morning he was the first line called after the judge sat down the bailiff escorted him in wearing the yellow jumpsuit his protestations that jail wouldnt kill him might have been valid but the stay overnight hadnt done him any visible good his skin looked gray his lions mane of hair hung heavy and wetlooking he stood at attention alone at the podium in front of the bench hardy glanced at the jury box none of the men was rising to stand by their client as once again the formula was carried out the indictment for murder read out in full i presume mr fowler so the honorific wouldnt be used either andy wasnt going to be called judge if marian braun was any barometer hardy decided andy was in for some very rough weather braun asked if he had an attorney present i do your honor he half turned dismas hardy a murmur ran through the courtroom hardy barely heard it standing and moving by jane but he hadnt reached the aisle before elizabeth pullios was on her feet your honor i object mr hardy was a member of the prosecution on this case aside from that obvious conflict he has had access to material that falls under the attorneyclient privilege he cannot represent the defendant here hardy found himself talking if the court pleases he got ignored braun pulled her glasses down to the end of her nose then took them off completely write me a motion on that counselor and have it on my desk by tomorrow morning she scribbled something in front of her and raised her eyes mr hardy would you care to join us on this side of the bar hardy came up the aisle and through the gate your honor id like to request a short recess id like a few words with the judge here i am the only judge in this courtroom mr hardy clear yes your honor weve barely begun and ive got an exceptionally full docket today so lets forgo the recesses and try to keep things moving is that all right with everybody clearly it was going to have to be all right mr hardy braun was saying you might save ms pullios a long night if you feel theres a conflict with you representing the defendant hardy wasnt inclined to save pullios a long night it was a small bonus no your honor i dont have a conflict pullios got up again mr hardy assembled the files on this case that wasnt this case your honor ms pullios perhaps has them confused because its the same victim mr fowler wasnt the defendant i dont have anything confused your honor mr hardy was all over that file if it please the court hardy said enjoying this as ms pullios knows full well she was the peoples attorney of record the last time a defendant was before the court for killing owen nash i was specifically denied an official role brauns gavel came down all right all right ill read your motion ms pullios tomorrow morning she put her glasses back on seemed to be deciding something good work fowler whispered what happened to your head braun continued meanwhile lets keep to the business at hand shall we youve got a plea mr fowler hardy would have preferred to leave andy to his permanent representation at this time one of the suits in the jury box but after the runin with pullios thought it would be better to go ahead your honor before entering a plea the defense would like some time say two weeks to review the file in this case pullios started to object again but braun tapped her gavel shaking her head i dont think youll need two weeks to decide what to plead well continue this arrangement and take defendants plea next week thank you your honor now on the matter of bail yes bail the state has requested no bail in this case hardy asked permission to approach the bench braun waved both counsel forward your honor hardy said isnt no bail a little unusual this is an unusual case mr hardy granted judge but the last time the state brought a person to trial here for killing owen nash we had a riskofflight defendant and even she was given bail theres no risk of flight here the judge isnt going anywhere pullios started to argue but braun responded quietly mr fowler has given us an ample indication of the contempt in which he holds the judicial process i have no faith that he will appear once or if he is released judge please you know thats ridiculous braun sucked in a breath youd better brush up on your etiquette mr hardy if i hear again that my judgments are ridiculous youll spend some ridiculous nights in jail for contempt hardy studied the floor a moment i apologize your honor but i would respectfully ask you to reconsider walking back to where fowler stood hardy shook his head then plead now fowler whispered not guilty hardy met fowlers eyes feeling embarrassed but having to say it i dont know youre not guilty andy enter the plea fowler snapped does your conscience also require you waste the week it was a good point and hardy made the plea the judge canceled the continuance and took hardys plea of not guilty the case was set for calendar the next monday october at am in the same department he wasnt even going to go and request the evidence files from the da what he planned to do was meet andy upstairs right away and discuss his choice for another attorney he stood in the hallway with jane head throbbing hardy dismas excuse me it was jeff elliot smiling his smile remember me jeff leaned on one crutch and hardy introduced him to jane the judges daughter id love a minute with you if you could watch this guy it was hardys escape line where are you going jeff asked he stopped halfturned after a brief career he said im retiring from defense work dont do that jeff said you were great in there thank you now if youll all excuse me elizabeth pullios emerged from the courtroom she was accompanied by a young male assistant da whom hardy didnt know pullios touched her assistants arm stopping him and walked over to hardys group locke wont release any files to you until braun rules on my motion she said to him theres no way you can do this hardy smiled i like your red tie he said it kind of matches your eyes she stared at him you know i almost hope im overruled she said why is that hardy asked if youre doing the defense it makes the case a slam dunk hardy didnt go directly upstairs to see andy fowler instead he left jane and jeff elliot then carried his pounding head out to the parking lot under the freeway it was cold but the chill suited him pullios thought his involvement would make it a slam dunk did she it was tempting to find out he forced himself to consider andy fowler in a new light he could help him for a day some mixture of appeasing jane doing a favor for a man whod done him a few but this was not to be confused with actually defending him for murder he kept telling himself he wasnt a defense lawyer there was a different attitude an orientation he didnt have hed been a cop he didnt believe many people got arrested when they hadnt done something may shinn had been an exception but to think it could happen twice with the same victim stretched things pretty thin hardy hadnt seen the new evidence theyd gathered on andy but it must be pretty damning even if every judge da and police officer in the city and county hated andy chris locke would never allow pullios to go for another indictment on owen nash if he wasnt convinced he was going to get a conviction still there was the decidedly unusual if not unprecedented nature of the investigation whatever had gone on since may shinns release seemed to have circumvented the police department glitsky would have told hardy if they had found anything implicating andy as a matter of personal interest if nothing else and they didnt replace an experienced homicide investigator like abe glitsky with another guy from the homicide team without any notice abe was still in charge of the police investigation and he hadnt found anything yet somehow there had been enough new evidence for a grand jury well where had it come from what had they whoever they were found or invented the traffic throbbed on the overpass above him he put his seat back and groaned as his sore ribs tried to find a way to come to rest he closed his eyes for a minute what the hell else was he doing anyway the events of last night if he was listening ought to be telling him something okay hed gotten fired sure no one else wanted his services yes hed really screwed up on frannie hed also taken some pretty shabby advantage of celine in the steam room celine if his own curiosity and the lack of evidence were two strikes for taking up andys defense then celine by herself was two strikes against it if he stayed involved he would have to see her see her a lot and now from the wrong side of the case he would be the man defending her fathers killer alleged killer dismas remember that would the distinction matter to her probably not he tried to imagine her behind him in the gallery as he tried to present his case for the defense how effective could he be with that going on but then there was pullios and there was locke and drysdale there was the setup that had gotten him fired set in motion his own personal tailspin the injustice of that the score to be settled if he got andy off it would show them and wouldnt that be sweet hardy thought he just might beat pullios hed gotten under her skin somehow there was no other explanation for her challenge today he could hammer there let more of her anger or whatever it was come out let the jury see it make them see it and if she lost her cool what about her arguments he could beat her he was smiling to himself and it hurt but so what what else was new you pushed through the pain and you got healed thats how it worked fowler sat across the table from him in visitors room a ive more or less reached the conclusion youre my best shot diz when did you decide that i think when i saw that line of vultures sitting in the jury box ive seen em all work diz and none of them approach david freeman neither do i i couldnt even get you bail remember fowler tried to smile i dont think abe lincoln could have gotten me bail but you handled pullios just fine plus you got in here last night and with jane that was impressive that was luck better lucky than smart besides people make their own luck hardy touched his bandage gingerly lucky people do tend to say that dont they i dont believe it you think im lucky id say youve had a good run the face clouded im sixtytwo my reputation is shattered the woman i love wont see me lets talk about the woman you love does that mean youre with me hardy shook his head i dont know andy i dont know what theyve got i dont know how brauns going to rule on my involvement fowler waved that off file a brief before you even see what pullios has your oral argument was persuasive as it was i am entitled to the counsel i want and regardless of what locke may say i dont see a conflict i dont think braun will either you werent states counsel for may right every time that came up hardy liked it better absolutely not then forget that write your brief lets talk defense but before they did andy wanted to talk money an issue hardy most unlawyerlike had never once considered after chiding him for that andy offered a retainer against a anhour billing rate for preparation and a day for trial which he explained would represent a cut in the hourly rate since ten hours on a trial day would be a rockbottom minimum hardy listened to the figures he supposed he would get used to them and when andy had finished said they sounded all right to him so much for being unemployable he thought feeling better andy hadnt seen any of the file theyd gathered on him and didnt know whod put it together he assumed theyd gone over his life with a finetooth comb but he had little or no idea about what exactly they might have found to tie him to owen nash he had never met the man he said hardy in fact wasnt sure of that what he was sure of was that if andy fowler felt about may the way his actions never mind his words indicated he had a solid motive for killing owen nash still there were facts to establish and he might as well start here and i take it then youve never been on the eloise thats the same thing as asking if i killed him isnt it hardy said that maybe it was he waited whats the point of talking about that diz weve pleaded not guilty every defendant in the world tells his lawyer he didnt do it but lets not muddy the waters okay the issue is whether theyve got evidence tying me to that boat i say they cant have there isnt any how about my peace of mind andy how about if its important to me that my cause is just hardy grinned realizing he sounded pompous but it was important to him your cause counselor is getting me off so humor me hardy said tell me one time did you kill owen nash or not fowler shook his head not he said hardy on defense glitsky said how can you do that pullios says i cant they were at lous where the lunch special was hotandsour lamb riblets with couscous hardy was filling in abe on the pullios theory of his conflict of interest she may be right diz although she is not my favorite person this week abe understood that whatever investigation had taken place it had been behind his back simple courtesy would have dictated that he be kept informed of any developments but pullios had gone around him and glitsky was angry he crunched the end of a rib bone and chewed pensively you think maybe he did it hardy sipped some water hed stopped eating because eating hurt id like to see what theyve got he didnt deny it hardy wagged a hand back and forth oh he denied it sort of sort of do me a favor abe said if you find out he did it dont get him off hardy moved his hotandsour around it was also greasy and congealed you know why dogs lick their balls abe why because they can abe shook his head you want to identify with the dogs you go right ahead im just saying its the professional approach hardy tried to shrug but again it hurt for your own peace of mind and mine i wont stay with it if the file convicts him which is what worries me they must have something this isnt just an administrative vendetta theyre trying andy fowler for murder and he says he never met the man never went near the boat hadnt seen may in four or five months glitsky sucked a lamb bone thats about what i found but obviously somebody found something else hardy put his hands to his face moved them to the sides rubbed at his temples he knew that if andy fowler had told him hed killed owen nash he couldnt have let himself take the case even to beat pullios and locke even if the investigation hadnt been strictly kosher but as glitsky said they must have found something important that pointed to andys guilt which didnt mean he was guilty he said he wasnt which didnt mean he wasnt okay hardy thats why there are trials and juries hed gone from lous back to his car then decided that headache or no he had more business downtown he got to the chronicle building at about one and stretched out on a cracked black leather couch beside jeff elliots desk where he was left alone for almost two hours elliot shook him awake what happened to you he asked you owe me hardy said he described to jeff how he had come to lose his job the misunderstanding with judge fowler and jane every other real and imagined consequence he could invent relating to jeffs story on may shinns bail leading up to last nights drunk and the beating he took basically hardy conveyed to jeff that his article had ruined everything in his life for the last three or four months okay elliot said so i owe you im sorry about your problems but the article never mentioned your name that wasnt worth a rebuttal hardy turned straightforward i may need some investigative help down the line jeff leaned over his desk talking softly i work here i cant do anything like that if i can leak to you why cant you leak to me plus what you find for me youve got the stories theres something here maybe i can point you at something you might miss help out both of us id have to protect my sources jeff said naturally jeff was mulling it over but hardy could tell he had him it was he thought a nice turnaround usually the deep throat went to the reporter now he would if he needed it have himself a personal investigator with the ideal cover he loved the idea of pullios leaking to jeff who would in turn keep him on the inside track so did you have a nice talk with jane hardy asked do you know she knew owen nash hardy was sitting on the couch beside jeffs desk drinking tepid coffee from a styrofoam cup he tried to keep his voice calm what jane the judges daughter the reporter kept typing away your exwife right she knew owen nash yeah just a sec he finished whatever he was working on then spun a quarterturn in his chair are you all right hardy was sitting back on the couch his hand to his head how did she know owen nash in hong kong last year she was over there on some buying thing just social stuff a cocktail party for americans abroad but small world huh he remembered janes trip to hong kong it was before he and frannie had gotten together or more precisely it was during the time he and frannie had connected when jane had left for hong kong she and hardy had been more or less together trying it out again after the divorce and eight years of true separation where they had not so much as run into one another in the relatively small town that was san francisco while she was over there while dismas and frannie were falling in love jane had confessed to hardy that she had had her own small infidelity hardy knew a lot about jane and a few things about owen nash jane was right around mays age both she and nash liked excitement both were given to spontaneous action but hong kong was a crowded place there was no reason to think that because jane had met up with owen nash that shed slept with him but there was also no reason to think she couldnt have and if she did driving home another truly perverse thought occurred to him his friend abe glitsky was unhappy with elizabeth pullios for building a homicide case outside the framework of the police department abe had even mentioned considering bringing obstructionofjustice charges against the district attorneys office and wouldnt that be a wonder to behold of course it would never happen but it indicated abes state of mind now hardy thought wouldnt it be sweet if abe discredited pullioss investigation by pursuing one of his own teach her and her boss the da a lesson in interdepartmental protocol which would mean that abe in effect would be doing police work for the defense smiling still hurt he sat with his arm around frannie on the top deck of the ferry to jack london square in oakland there were still another two weeks of daylight savings time and the sun hadnt yet set the bay was calm and as they approached alameda it seemed to grow warmer though only twelve miles separated the cities it wasnt unknown to find twenty degrees of difference between the temperatures in oakland and san francisco this was a wednesday and headache or not date night was a sacred tradition he pulled her in closer to him you can hang in there he said it might be a while i can handle a while even a long time just keep me included will you were on the same side promise he said and while youre making promises i need one more he nodded this baby is getting itself born in four months and trial or no trial i want you there with me just like with rebecca hopefully not just like rebecca rebecca had been thirty hours of grueling labor you know what i mean his wife was leaning into him she looked up god she was beautiful hardy and frannie had come together when shed been about five months pregnant with rebecca five months like now hardy thought it had to be the most attractive time in a womans life after this morning the agonies had been put aside for both of them they were moving forward theyd gotten through a bad time thats what for better or worse meant didnt it that you had some worse he kissed her i know what you mean he said so you promise promise they were back home by ninethirty and hardy began working on his conflictofinterest brief in his office typing it himself without a law library at hand he had to make do in a couple of places but he had several rows of lawbooks and periodicals on his shelves and anyway the gist of his argument was the one he had presented orally in court the closest thing to a precedent against him had been in a case where an assistant district attorney had been in the midst of trying a case against a hells angel when hed been hired away from the district attorneys office by the firm representing the defendant there the judge had prohibited the representation and hardy agreed that there clearly a conflict existed he was sure that pullios would try to draw a parallel to this case but hardy was certain that the differences here far outweighed the similarities he had not been the counsel of record for may shinn andy fowler hadnt been the defendant all they had was the same victim and the evidence against may shinn in that earlier case was part of the public record hardy believed he knew nothing officially that a concerned layman couldnt have discovered of course he knew about the phone records but that wasnt official also he didnt know whether anyone in the das office knew about the phone records he finished at one am and called an allnight messenger service the brief would be at judge brauns office when she arrived at her office in the morning there was nothing to do but wait for braun to read both briefs and make her decision he slept in until ninethirty and went for his first run in weeks the fourmile circle his ribs were unhappy with that decision but he ran through the stitch in both sides if he was going to do this he would be in shape for it frannie went to visit her motherinlaw down in the sunset and hardy got out his black castiron pan and turned the heat up to high under it now he cut up half an onion threw in a couple of cloves of garlic diced a small potato opened the refrigerator and found two leftover porkchops and cut them up he was humming some dire straits and stirring when the telephone rang it was marian brauns clerk saying the judge had ruled in his favor he would have to play it very close he surely didnt want abe to think that hed been obstructing justice himself abes fuse was getting justifiably short around that issue hardy leaned across glitskys desk youve still got them he said and by you i mean the prosecution theyre still in the file what do you know about them the phone records almost nothing not true i checked fowlers calls to shinn but i just wonder if there might have been others if she had other clients who might have had a motive glitsky took a minute diz the states got a defendant its not like im bored in my job this citys got more murders than cabot cove and im on five of them right now the nash homicide from our perspective is a closed case hardy shuffled through some papers on glitskys desk well you do what you want but im going to clear fowler and this case is going back to open status and if fowlers not guilty then someone else is right if you found something it might be interesting to let pullios know where it came from were talking justice here abe also lots of ifs diz plus lots of legwork isnt that what you do abe legwork itd have to be on my spare time whatever hardy said ive just got a feeling im going to find a few stones unturned here locke wants to get fowler that message comes down people might start thinking they see things that arent there there arent any trails diz ive looked what if i find you some what if these phone calls turn into something what if what if its up to you hardy said it was onethirty and hardy had read most of the file he was in visitors room b the mirror image of a fowler entered upbeat as soon as the guard had gone back outside he stuck out his hand congratulations he said welcome counselor hardy ignored the hand and cut to it andy i cant represent you if you lie to me what are you talking about im talking about this file which im about twothirds of the way through the euphoria of his first win faded almost as soon as hed picked up his copy of the file from reception in the das office he had taken it downstairs sitting on a bench in the hallway he was immediately caught up in the grandjury testimony of a prosecution witness named emmet turkel whose name jumped out at him because hed never heard it before this is peter struler badge number investigator for the district attorney of san francisco the date is july at in the pm no case number is assigned i am interviewing a gentleman who identifies himself as emmet turkel a resident of the state of new york with a business address at w th street in manhattan q mr turkel what is your occupation a i am a private investigator q in your capacity as a private investigator have you had occasion to work for a man named andrew bryan fowler a yes mr fowler is a judge in san francisco q and he retained you a correct q to do what a well the judge was upset because a woman he knew may shinn had stopped seeing him he wanted to know why q hadnt she told him why a well yes i suppose what i mean to say is that shed told him why that she was seeing someone else the judge wanted to know who it was q the person she was seeing now a yes q she didnt tell him who it was a no she said she was seeing someone else and that they she and fowler had to break up that was his word break up i make that point because the relationship wasnt exactly typical q in what way a i mean you dont say youre breaking up with someone if youre being paid by them q and the judge was paying ms shinn a thats my understanding yes q for sex a sex companionship whatever she was his mistress q and what did you discover a i discovered the man was owen nash q and what did you do with that discovery a i reported it to my client judge fowler q and when was this a oh middle of march thereabouts i could give you the exact date q thats all right maybe later i have one more question did you find it unusual that someone from california would come to you here in new york and offer you a job out there a not really it happens when you want to keep things closed up i knew the judge from work id done for other clients over the years id testified in his courtroom a couple of times like that so he knew to look me up and then he didnt want anybody in town in san francisco even a pi to know about his relationship with shinn i guess he figured it would look bad so he came to me fowler crossed his hands in front of him on the table his face was serious how did they find turkel i dont know andy but thats not the issue if im representing you youve got to tell me everything how do you explain this behind turkels deposition testimony in the notebook were a couple of xeroxed pages from fowlers desk calendar on the page for march the name owen nash was written circled underlined on may a note read on tonight the eloise i thought you didnt know owen nash hardys tone was more a prosecutors so be it if fowler was guilty and lying on top of it he wanted nothing to do with it i said id never met him diz i knew who he was hardy stood up walked to the window looked out at the high clouds and shook his head not true andy you said you only found out it had been owen seeing may after he turned up dead the judge didnt seem too shaken did i i dont remember hardy sat back down across the table andy look youve got to remember did you tell anyone else you didnt know nash hadnt met nash whatever it was i dont know probably while they were questioning me about the bond id have to say yes jesus hardy said he was flipping through the binder there were tabbed sections with other names he hadnt looked at yet he was starting to get the feeling most of them would be impugning the judges character they were going to sling mud and andy had given them the shovel i never thought theyd dig up turkel diz and when you tell a lie youd better stick with it it doesnt look good i know but it doesnt mean hardy waved him off so whyd you tell the lie in the first place fowler held up his palms for the same reason i went to new york for turkel diz it looked terrible embarrassing i knew damn well how it would look if it came out and thats so important isnt it how it looks but andy fowler hadnt been a judge most of his life for nothing his jaw hardened you dont give it all up at once diz you conserve what youve still got so what do you still have andy you tell me ive got nothing putting me on the boat why would i volunteer something that would tie me to owen nash how about because you had to lie to evade it innocent people dont lie dont give me that diz of course they do innocent people lie all the time and you know it hardy knew he was right all right andy but youll agree it gives the appearance of guilt and appearance is going to matter to the jury fowler nodded it was one consistent lie the fact that i told it several times is explainable i wanted to hide an embarrassing truth but as i tried to say it doesnt mean i killed anybody andy were not talking embarrassment here anymore i know ive accepted that the judge stared out the window looked back to the closed door they do like to bring down the mighty dont they thats not the issue either andy fowler pointed a finger dont kid yourself diz thats the issue lets get back to the facts andy so where did these notes come from fowler pulled the binder over in front of him thats my calendar my desk at the office here he thought a moment the day i retired when the story about mays bail came out i stayed away from the office to let things blow over remember hardy remembered they must have moved awfully fast i went in and cleaned out my stuff the next week somebody must have had an idea back then id killed nash pullios hardy said sounds like her get a theory and find the evidence to back it up somebody ought to tell her shes doing it backward hardy pulled the binder back in front of him getting an idea this means they went into your office without your permission maybe without a warrant fowler shook his head this was familiar ground for him dont get your hopes up diz its probably admissible in california employers own their offices in my case the city and county had a right to enter my room in the hall of justice at any time thats why i had my own desk brought in its my personal property if i lock it they need a warrant to get inside but anything on top of it is fair game he brightened up its not a disaster diz we can make the point i didnt take anything with me i had nothing to hide hardy knew the prosecution could counter that the judge was so arrogant he thought no one would dare look in his office though it was technically public property but he didnt say that so assuming its admitted what does it mean andy on tonight the eloise a guy at the club he began what club the olympic one of the guys said he was invited to this fundraiser on nashs eloise this was back around march or april sometime i think hardy checked may sixteenth just about a month before the murder the proximity didnt faze fowler okay may anyway i thought i might go along see the famous son of a bitch he shook his head i decided against it why im not sure a mix of things i suppose i thought may might be there and i didnt think i could handle seeing her with him hardy went back to the window under the fluorescent glare at the table his head had started to throb again he stood there a minute then turned back andy this might offend you but i want you to take a polygraph the judge pursed his lips the request clearly annoyed him polygraphs dont work diz theyre inadmissible i know that the silence built hardy stood by the window fowler leaned back in his chair i told you i didnt kill him i know you did and you dont believe me hardy let his silence talk the judge pushed its that one lie isnt it not knowing nash i told you about that i didnt think you or anyone else needed to know i didnt think it would come out well its out now and its not needtoknow anymore ive got to know everything and ill decide what to hold back you want me to defend you i do that or i do nothing and you need a polygraph for that to tear a page from the pullios notebook one lie speaks to the defendants character your honor you think ill agree to take a polygraph hardy drummed his fingers a moment looked around at the walls the barred window you know andy im afraid this isnt a request diz theyre inadmissible fowler repeated he took a beat slowing down you know why theyre inadmissible because they dont work they dont prove a damn thing hardy nodded i know that in a courtroom at least they were certainly suspect fowler stared at him then why hardy found himself biting back the words out loud they would sound priggish selfrighteous because the reason was that he wanted something that would let him for his own consciences sake continue defending andy something that if it didnt clear him at least left open the probability that in spite of his untruths and peccadillos he wasnt guilty for many legal professionals this would be irrelevant the issue wasnt the fact it was whether the fact could be proven but hardy used to be a cop then a prosecutor his mindset was getting the bad guy and he wanted no part of defending a guilty man even an old friend like andy fowler ive got my reasons he said at last and you either accept them or get yourself a new lawyer andy fowlers gaze was firm composed i didnt kill him diz hardy spread his hands then it ought to be no problem right finally the judge nodded all right dismas i dont like it but all right glitsky was wearing green khakis hiking boots a leather flight jacket he stood about sixfoottwoandahalf and weighed in at a little over pounds his black hair was short almost marine cut when he was younger partially to hide the top of his scar he sported a fu manchu but hed been clean shaven now for six years elizabeth pullios had worked with him on at least fourteen cases since shed become a homicide prosecutor three years earlier their relationship had been mostly cordial and open they were on the same side it shouldnt therefore have filled her with any foreboding when abes substantial form appeared in her doorway but it did he didnt say anything shed been reviewing testimony for a case she was taking to trial in two months memorizing as she liked to do and then he was there she had no idea for how long hi abe she said she closed the binder and flashed him some teeth whats up glitsky was leaning against the door hands in his jacket pocket as though changing his mind about whatever it was he shrugged himself off the jamb and inside jamie jackson her office mate had gone home an hour ago glitsky closed the door behind him he didnt sit down and pullios pushed her chair back slightly to get a better angle how long you been a da abe asked pullios still tried to smile the charm that worked so well youre upset with me and i cant say i blame you glitsky really wasnt much of a smiler hed seen too many cons and too much phoniness introduced by the glad hand and the ivory grin smiling set his teeth on edge about what six seven years he was a trained interrogator and what you did was you zeroed in you ignored the smoke until you got the answer to your question since you got here pullios nodded about that abe just over seven you know how long i been a cop it wasnt a question weve worked together a long time and i dont think you know anything about me at all she was still staring up at him he was wearing the face he used on suspects it was a look i did four years at san josé state on a football scholarship tight end actually it was before they called it tight end it was just plain old end back then but i wasnt just a dumb jock mostly because i was smart enough to realize i was a step too slow for the pros so i kind of studied and pulled a threepointfour gradepoint average my counselor told me i could get into law school with that now his mouth stretched a caricature of a smile that stretched the wide scar that ran through his upper and lower lips imagine that he went on law school abe he didnt acknowledge her but i was recruited into the academy yeah they did that then after i graduated and i thought it looked like more fun more action than the law you know i was twentythree then im fortyone now eighteen years and the last seven ive been on homicides he stopped somewhere in another office a phone was ringing outside the window an orange and pink dusk was settling pullios had to struggle for breath for control there were a lot of reasons abe she said he didnt reply just loomed there like a malevolent statue hands in his jacket pockets feet planted flat she swirled in her chair to get out from under his gaze the way the shinn matter went down the false arrest she cathedraled her hands in front of her mouth staring out to the bay bridge i know hardys your friend i guess i just thought it wouldnt have your full attention my work gets my full attention come on abe you know what i mean it would all be warmed over she kept at it and nobody took you off it you know if youd found anything we would have used it peter struler just happened to find it he just happened to go search fowlers office a lot of times ill do that spice up a slow day and go and toss some judges chambers well i had a theory and mentioned it to him even a dumb jock like me could figure that out elizabeth traditionally though theories get told to the investigating officer which happened in this case to be me i know that abe contrite she stood up it was a mistake abe im sorry yeah well sorry is a big help look at the evidence struler got and then why dont you explain to my bosses how it was that i didnt find any of it like by the time i hit fowlers office after clearing it with my lieutenant because i thought it might be a touch sensitive why there wasnt anything left to find it wasnt only in his office glitskys voice went real low almost a whisper you know elizabeth i dont care if it was in the amazon rain forest weve got a homicide team upstairs that works on homicides we get you your evidence without which you dont have a job anymore you got a new protocol fine you go for it but its a twoway street i understand that look abe ive apologized it wont happen again im really sorry glitsky nodded sometimes you let them have the last word let them think its all settled and forgotten just tell me you didnt sleep with him thats none of your business its my business hardy lowered his voice into the telephone especially if it was last september and you know it he was in his office halfway through the file he remembered jane he imagined her in her kitchen at her house their old house on jackson street sitting on the stool maybe a glass of white wine nearby hearing forty twice divorced and suffering through the apparent decline in her market value that came as such a shock jane was still very attractive also intelligent selfreliant why was it men didnt see it if they were her age they wanted a relationship and went as hardy had and she had pointed it out to him for the younger women the tighter the firmer the more fun they could dream again with the young ones pretend they were younger too build a new life halfway through their old one the older men knew youd been around you didnt have to play games everybody had sex it was an itch to be scratched dinner cognac orgasm thanks a lot youre a great kid or the young guys who dug the experience of an older woman but never a thought of settling down with one hardy had heard and read about all the stages jane had to be lonely as hell most of the time even with chuck chuck bobuck the latest but not he hoped please not with owen nash jane it wasnt anything she said it was one night her voice sounded dead he had filled twenty pages of yellow legal pad it was nearly midnight and he rubbed his eyes the swelling around them having turned a faint purple now the throbbing continuous but bearable he had been letting his mind go jumping from issue to issue and following the flow tearing out sticking tabs and placing them on pages by subject venue bail evidence theory jury he thought he had to take another shot at getting andy out on bail even if they set it for a million dollars he couldnt let him stay in the clink he knew he could ask the court of appeal to force braun to set some reasonable bail and eventually they would do it drysdale would know that too maybe he could talk to him and get some concessions without the procedural hassles after that the first thing he would do would be to make a motion for judicial review of the evidence which now that hed reviewed most of the file still struck him as very light everything was circumstantial perhaps bolstered by andys unsupported alibi his lies or one lie told many times and the enormity of the risk hed taken in defense of may the evidence still didnt put him on the boat without that hardy didnt see how anyone could vote to convict juries had been known to do almost anything but he thought an impartial judge if he could find one would throw this thing out as a turkey pullios and her personal grand jury notwithstanding the system at least tacitly contemplated abuse of the indictment procedure and so authorized a judicial review of the indictment to insure there was sufficient evidence to go to trial it was not after all in the systems own selfinterest to bring a case to trial where there was no evidence hardy thought maybe he could get andy off there it at least was worth a try if that didnt work he thought he would try to get out of san francisco his own file from the time of the original chronicle blurb when he and pico had found owen nashs hand contained over sixtyfive articles from both local and national publications on the case nash shinn himself freeman fowler and it was the kind of story people tended to read and remember or stop what they were doing to listen to on the radio or watch on television at least he was coming to the theory he would use in defense you needed a defense theory hed done enough prosecuting to know that those defense lawyers who just refuted his evidence who debated his conclusions got themselves beaten what you needed was your own affirmative defense come out fighting the voice of outrage at unfair accusation it had come to him today and he thought it had some real legs it also appealed to him because it gave things a personal edge pullios had done her job backward the way it was supposed to work he would argue was that evidence is fairly gathered from all quarters by the police investigating the crime when that evidence reaches some critical mass an indictment is sought and an arrest warrant is issued none of that had happened in fowlers case hardy thought he could make a case to the jury that someone locke or pullios or whoever had fastened on andy fowler out of personal animus out of anger at his professional lapses it was a political vendetta based on his conduct on the bench but not because the evidence pointed at him hardy had never before called glitsky as a witness for the prosecution on any of his cases but now he wrote his name under a new tab the investigating officer of record as a witness for the defense that ought to jolt old betsy and he knew there was a further step he had to take if he believed the judge was innocent for that he was ready to use jeff elliot and abe glitsky and anyone else someone had killed owen nash but juries were imperfect they could make a mistake and convict andy hardys best hope of getting andy off was to find out who had done it a tall order that since evidently it hadnt been any of the suspects so far shinn farris mr silicon valley but there was an x out there jane impossible a onenight stand shed said shed said no he knew jane she couldnt kill anybody besides why would she have told jeff elliot shed met nash that once if shed seen him since and it was an affair why open that door unless she figured it would come out anyway and she wanted to look like she had nothing to hide no ridiculous jane had no motive farris he was numero uno with nash gone or in a position to be the power behind the new man in charge all his show of grief notwithstanding he sat back in his chair and stretched enough already picking at straws abe hadnt even looked yet at mays other clients the three men hardy had discovered through the phone records there was a whole universe of potential suspects one of them someone had to have made a mistake but he wasnt likely to discover it practicing this sort of armchair reverie he had to get someone moving on it he lifted the last dart from his desk and pegged it at his board where it stuck four inches below the bullseye jane had andy known about jane and owen could that have been reason another reason for andy to have killed nash it might have been the last straw andy broken up over nash the famous son of a bitch stealing his may and then hes almost over that maybe when five months later he finds out the guy had also fucked his daughter and boom over the edge youre playing devils advocate hardy andy didnt do it the polygraph hed managed to schedule for the next morning technically flawed as it might be should eliminate any last doubts not that he had many left andy resenting sure but also quickly agreeing to take the test was in his favor wasnt it he had read nearly everything in the file he thought he was being fairly objective and still had no idea what new evidence pullios had found to convince her to proceed certainly on the evidence presented in the transcripts hed been reviewing she hadnt put it in before the grand jury pullios could have talked herself blue in the face sweet and convincing as she could be about what an immoral man andy was what a lousy judge how he didnt have an alibi the fact that hed written owen nashs name in his calendar he was involved with may shinn hed thrown away his career and reputation had been secretive and unethical but so what what did all that prove about making him a murderer there had to be something else or the case wouldnt have gotten this far but winning an indictment wasnt winning a jury trial he was getting tired now but thought hed take another pass at the stuff he thought he was already familiar with the paper load had grown in one day to three binders and a couple of legal pads he scanned glitskys interviews with the two guards at the marina not much there from his own notes he reviewed the previous may shinn grandjury testimony of strout abe celine and the rest so there wouldnt be any surprises he reviewed the physicalevidence list the prosecution was planning to enter as exhibits it was with the additions from fowlers calendars and the deletion of the twomilliondollar handwritten will pretty much as he expected and there still wasnt much the autopsy photos of owen nash the gun the phone records establishing andys relationship with may papers on the bail situation he closed the binders time to sleep on it there were stacks of papers on mays kitchen table under david freemans guidance she had been it seemed suing most of the western world for what it had done to her there were lawsuits against the officer who had arrested her his superiors the district attorneys office and the city and county of san francisco freeman was citing a smorgasbord of offenses ranging from false arrest through various civilrights violations defamation of character libel and slander separately they had been negotiating for the return of the many personal items clothes makeup and so forth that shed kept stowed aboard the eloise four months after the murder the boat was still sealed and winter was coming on there were special things owen had given her she and david had made up a list and david thought she ought to have all of it back shoes rain slickers her beautiful down coat a siberian babushka glass and jade pieces shed kept in his rolltop some exercise stuff she had to laugh at the last one she hadnt done a thing with her body since june by far most of the legal work had involved the will at first she hadnt cared about the money or thought she hadnt but gradually practicality and principle merged why should the estate which didnt need it get it or his daughter who had so much anyway she may was the one who had loved him and he had wanted her to have it she stood holding her cup of tea looking down at the stacks of papers wearing a blackandred silk kimono cinched at the waist the midoctober day had come up clear and sunny the peace shed found or thought shed found with owen had been shattered by her time in jail the craziness surrounding her arrest david freeman a dear man had seen the hopelessness start to rise in her again and wisely had proceeded to involve her with these distractions the lawsuits and for a time it had kept away the nothingness she had been busy the way an ant was busy going round piling up little things until they made a bigger thing you dont stop because the busyness was the end in itself now there was something new a written request not a subpoena that she appear as a states witness against andy fowler she walked over to her turret and looked down on the street the people going into the deli that cute little cable car she tried to conjure up some image of the way shed felt or remembered feeling with owen the unity the two of them had discovered but it wasnt there anymore shed had a family that had never loved her that had been too afraid of life to try living it two barren marriages liaisons without meaning day after day going through motions hoping for someone she could admire who could admire her then thinking shed found it and having it all smashed and now all those papers she supposed she owed it to david to keep at them what did she owe andy fowler who was that dorothy woke up happy every morning the mattress on the floor was lifted onto a sturdy platform with a modern pine headboard there was floral wallpaper along one wall with some degas and monet prints drymounted and covered with glass einstein still counseled them about mediocre minds new drapes a large bright throw rug a rattan loveseat end table coffee table three modern lamps it was a different place jeff was even walking better able to cross from the bar to his bed without his crutches he didnt believe it would last forever but hed take it while it was here maybe the prednisone for his eyes had done something for his legs there was no predicting these symptoms so when a little good came along you didnt question it he pushed himself back onto the bed that was hardy the attorney i told you about for the defense this time gloriously immodest she lifted her naked body against a reading pillow and pulled him back against her pulling the blankets over them rubbing her hands up and down his chest and what does mr hardy want fowlers taking a polygraph today he wanted me to know why he leaned his head against her if he passes it its news its not evidence but its news and he figures it helps him what if he doesnt pass it thats news too either way its good for me but hardy must think hes going to do okay or he wouldnt have told me it seems a little risky hardys got to take some risk they both win if fowler is innocent do you think he is innocent you mean she nodded nope the gun pullios and struler clever devils hardy knew it would be unwise to file his penal code motion for dismissal before hed gone over every word of the file carefully most of it as hed noticed last night was stuff hed seen before and the temptation was to skim it the discovery process tried to eliminate surprises in the courtroom the perry mason lastminute rabbitfromthehat conclusions were really the stuff of fiction long before anybody went to trial attorneys for the prosecution had to disclose everything they had in terms of evidence proposed witnesses expert testimony in theory the point was not to sandbag your opponent although if you could it was a nice bonus but to lay out the evidence and its relevance before a jury if glitsky or somebody else should chance upon some relevant evidence during the trial then hardy could introduce it at that time but that would be a rare event most of the time the parties knew the cards against them the skill was in how they were played which didnt mean that pullios having given hardy everything she was supposed to then had to sit him down and show him how to use it so hardy was being thorough there was no surprise in the gun being presented as an exhibit it was after all the murder weapon what he did not expect was that andy fowlers fingerprints were on the clip so much for his motion for judicial review of the evidence with the latest hardy realized there was at least enough evidence against andy fowler to warrant a trial how could that happen how could no one have seen that before that puts him on the boat and if he was on the boat no jury in the world will believe he didnt kill him hardy had caught glitsky on the phone at his desk before he started driving downtown and now they were eating hamburgers far from the hall of justice glitsky understandably didnt want to be seen being buddybuddy with a defense attorney friends or no friends a new reality had kicked in glitsky chewed ice which he did every chance he got it drove hardy crazy not necessarily what do you mean not necessarily the gun was on the boat and fowlers fingerprints were on the gun they could have been on the gun before it got to the boat well thats damn sure going to be my argument but it doesnt exactly strengthen my case how could he not tell me about that how could he not know glitsky had a bite of burger he lied thanks abe swallowed took a drink of coke chewed ice youre welcome how did we miss them last time the prints abe rubbed his face two ways maybe one nobody looked at the clip shinns prints were on the barrel she was the suspect end of search two abe held up two fingers they got a print they couldnt match then once they knew they were looking for fowler they ran it against his that would have come up long ago nope his prints werent in the right databank we run a print we find on the gun through known criminals and nothing comes up what are we supposed to do check every fingerprint file in the universe glitsky shrugged it hurts me to say it but these things sometimes slip through the cracks hardy swore glitsky nodded again probably some combination of both abe i forced myself to play devils advocate but the truth is i cant believe he did it that he wouldnt lie about after a moments baleful stare glitsky rubbed a finger into his ear as though hed heard something wrong excuse me he said i thought i heard you say a perp wouldnt lie to you this is not any old perp abe this is my exfatherinlaw i know him or at least he thought he did a superior court judge for christs sake abe reached over and grabbed the rest of hardys burger i can tell youre not going to eat this you said youve got a polygraph for today right thatll tell you maybe and maybe not abe smiled his awful smile the polygraph technician ron reynolds a tall thin man in a gray suit white shirt blueandblack tie was waiting for him in the secondfloor visitors lounge of his office near the civic center after introductions they got right down to business are you going to stipulate for admissibility reynolds asked im not doing it for admissibility im doing it for me this wasnt the first time reynolds had heard an attorney say that occasionally though not so very often they wanted to believe their clients hardy went on also though i thought the fact my client was willing to take the test might have a positive effect on the jury if you can get that admitted which i doubt well i can try hardy took out a pad of notes and they started to go over them he had twentyodd yes and no questions fowler could answer that related to owen nash and may shinn reynolds had tenorso more for what he called calibration youll go over all of these with him before the test no surprises right sure are you planning on being there outside close by reynolds thought that was the right answer its better without interruptions he said but before he had andy fowler take the test hardy needed some answers of his own they were again in visitors room a the guard was still holding the judge by the arm when hardy whod been pacing by the table started you want to tell me how your fingerprints got on the inside of the murder weapon on the clip fowler stopped dead the guard didnt move either hardy stared at his client for a moment then recovered he pointedly thanked the guard and waited until he withdrew and closed the door behind him andy had recovered are you kidding dont give me that andy my fingerprints hardy was angry every day brought him more into the case more committed to getting andy off but that was mostly because he kept telling himself that the judge was innocent hed told himself that he would only stay with andys defense if he had a reasonable certainty that he wasnt guilty of course no one but the murderer andy or not would ever be onehundredpercent sure of what had happened on the eloise but hardy wasnt a hired gun he wouldnt have gone on he wouldnt go on if he knew andy had done it fowler swore softly behind him and hardy turned around i loaded the gun for her diz this is unbelievable it was months ago it never even occurred to me diz i swear to god you loaded the gun for her he nodded she was afraid to touch the thing one of her earlier someone had given it to her and shed never even loaded it it was in the headboard of her bed i told her there was no point in keeping a gun for protection if it wasnt loaded so i loaded it it wasnt on the headboard of her bed andy it was on the eloise she told me she didnt want it in the house she hated it i couldnt take it i couldnt take a gun registered to another person because you were a judge and didnt want to break any laws fowler tried to smile before my little problem with the shinn trial thats how i was diz hardy slammed the table between them goddamn it andy that wasnt a little problem at the shinn trial thats the whole reason were here i understand that diz said quietly well then how do you expect me to sell a jury on the idea that you were such a paragon of virtue that you wouldnt take mays gun to your house when six months later he checked himself yelling at his client wasnt going to do either of them any good he turned away its a good point dismas but it happens to be the truth so maybe when may started seeing nash he didnt have your scruples and let her store the gun on his boat hardy was back at the window andy fowler had an answer for everything all right but it was easier to listen without having to see what he was doing with his face he felt for a moment like he was in gone with the wind hed think about it tomorrow for today at least he had an explanation for this latest revelation tomorrow hed decide if he could believe it theyd gone over the polygraph questions one at a time fowler advised hardy to try and get pullios to stipulate to the admissibility of the results of the test he told him that if before either of them knew how it came out hardy offered to permit her to use the results no matter what they were she might agree to let them be entered as evidence of course she might not andys suggestion did have the effect of moving hardy back toward thinking his client might be telling the truth but of course andy would know that circles within circles in any event hardy didnt hold out much hope pullios would go for it sticking with polygraph inadmissibility was the smarter course from her perspective shed figure her case didnt need it and a good showing on the polygraph by fowler could only hurt her unlike defense attorneys who only had a duty to their clients the job of prosecutor included not just presenting states evidence but ensuring that the defendant got a fair trial the defendant was a citizen of the state one of the people the prosecutor was sworn to help protect except hardy knew pullios and this nicety was he believed lost on her which led him to his bold unorthodox strategy hows jail treating you fowler shrugged its like a good hotel only bad why i dont want you mistreated this bail situation is intolerable i am a little surprised at marian fowler was a little surprised at marian at judge marian bruan hardy couldnt get over andys seemingly ingrained sangfroid like marie antoinette apologizing to her executioner for stepping on his toe fowler too was unfailingly polite refined even selfeffacing it wore well in the world but here in jail in his prison garb it was somehow at once incongruous and pitiable it was going to be next to impossible to choose a jury resembling this mans peers well marian notwithstanding judge better get out of that habit diz not judge mister fowler remember marian made the point hardy pressed on marian notwithstanding andy i think if you can live with your situation for a while we can use it to our advantage hardys theory involved doing away with many of the timehonored traditions of the superior court but he didnt think he or fowler could make any new enemies if they tried all the available ones were taken his primary defense of course would be that the prosecution had failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt the evidence did not prove that andy fowler had killed owen nash there was probably motive or purported motive but motive alone should not be enough to convict so he had a defense a passive defense he wasnt sure it would be enough pullios he was certain was going to use all of the physical evidence she had but she would probably build her case around a consciousness of guilt theory by which a defendants actions such as flight resisting arrest lying to interrogators and so on were admissible evidence showing the defendant to be conscious of guilt even with little other evidence those actions could as a matter of law be sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt there might not be a smoking gun here hardy knew but fowlers unethical behavior while on the bench rang sang and went sissboombang with consciousness of guilt so he needed something else if he wanted to get andy out of jail and the court had steered him in the right direction beginning with pullios as she proceeded backward from suspect to investigation on through marian brauns decision to deny bail this case he could argue had been riddled with demonstrable prejudice against andy fowler hardy thinking it likely they couldnt get a fair trial on account of prosecutorial and judicial prejudice in san francisco had at first considered trying for a change in venue but then the other thought the strategy occurred to him in san francisco it was likely they would get a judge hostile to andy possibly even to himself they would in fact further antagonize both the judge and pullios by demanding a trial immediately as was their right in the shinn matter pullios had wanted to proceed to trial quickly and had gotten hurt by it now that she was slowly building what she thought was a strong case shed be opposed to rushing it through hardy would argue that so long as his innocent client was being held without bail it was unreasonable to ask him to suffer any delay he was innocent until proven guilty and he was rotting in jail hardy figured this approach could prevail in more ways than one first the presiding judge might reconsider bail if that didnt happen then scheduling an immediate trial would he hoped maybe disconcert pullios hed seen how the swirling events with may shinn had led even pullios to slip on some details such as checking the phone records she also could get testy personal which could hurt her credibility in front of a jury he hoped at least if he could keep her covering her fronts he figured he would cut down on her efficiency her effectiveness finally in the event they went to trial with andy still in jail with a hostile judge and pullios got the conviction hardy could make the argument on appeal that there had been a de facto conspiracy against fowler to obstruct justice and due process from investigation to incarceration to trial fowler heard out hardys argument im not too thrilled with the idea of setting a mistrial in motion to win on appeal its a last resort andy granted but wed be foolish not to think of it now it would cut pullioss prep time by twothirds and ours hardy nodded true but the evidence isnt going to do it andy its who slings it better and i believe shell feel rushed i know her how about you hardy let himself grin i thrive under pressure it gives us less time to find out who really killed him hardy had been sitting on the hard wooden chair his ribs black and blue and yellow under his shirt stabbed at him as he shifted now grimacing he stared across the table are you all right fowler asked him yeah you know what thats the first thing ive heard you say that really sounds like youre not guilty exjudge andrew fowlers polygraph results inconclusive in owen nash murder case by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer former superior court judge andrew b fowler yesterday was not cleared in a polygraph test the results of socalled lie detector tests are not admissible as evidence in california courts but fowlers failure to clear himself was characterized by the district attorneys office yesterday as a blow to the defense fowlers attorney former prosecutor dismas hardy put the results in a more positive light the test did not say that judge fowler was not telling the truth the judge volunteered to take the test would he have done that if he were guilty ron reynolds a university of san francisco psychology professor trained in polygraphy and the man who administered the test agreed with hardy the reason polygraphs are inadmissible in the first place is because they can have a wide degree of variability of accuracy according to the subjects mood his familiarity with the testing procedure his understanding of the questions judge fowler seemed to be extremely uncomfortable with the entire process we could not even get a good calibration on him in four passes hardy added there was no indication whatsoever that judge fowler was not telling the truth mr drysdale replied there was also no indication whatsoever that the judge was not lying in a related development the chronicle learned from a reliable courthouse source yesterday that judge fowlers fingerprints have been found on the loading chamber of the murder weapon acaliber beretta semiautomatic handgun registered to may shinn who had been the lover of both owen nash and former judge fowler the case will be scheduled for trial on monday morning hardy had to learn to hold his comments in front of the jailhouse guards even though they might be known to the prosecution he knew who the reliable courthouse source must have been about the fingerprints his good statements to the press notwithstanding the polygraph was a blow it was all well and good to tell jeff elliot that there had been nothing that showed andy was lying but the test from hardys perspective had brought up his old doubts about andys innocence on the other hand he reminded himself andys nervousness could have been real after all everything about his predicament in jail was strange and scary and what about andys position that his best shot at proving he didnt kill nash was to find out who did but outside of glitsky and maybe jeff who owed him where did he go for finding that out and even with them a few tenuous leads some serendipitous snooping by jeff none of these were too hopeful he stood in front of his desk and threw darts round after round there were household noises frannie was doing some vacuuming rebecca got hungry and cried garth brooks serenaded a cds worth from the living room the sun got higher he was due in master calendar in two days based on the presumption that his client was innocent and being held without bail he planned to push for an immediate trial he would not waive time and this would anger pullios and whatever judge they got they would not challenge the judge whoever it might be the newspapers were already leaning toward fowlers guilt and hardy thought it would be easier to find a heterosexual on castro street than to find a prospective jury member in this city who didnt already have an opinion on andy fowler and owen nash risks too many leaving out the biggest if andy had in fact done it hardys doubts came and went he just didnt know not yet anyway personally hardys own blackness had lifted it was gone vanished like a virulent flu that had done its damage and moved on he could think of no better place to be than where he was now defending andy fowler since he had discovered owen nashs hand last june this case had been central to his life his marriage his career his view of himself he would by god see it through if he had to wring it from some collective necks he would get to the truth superior court judge marian braun gavelled the room to order hardy had been sitting in the jury box to brauns right twenty minutes before elizabeth pullios had come in with her entourage the same assistant da shed had last time and what looked to be a law studentclerk she sat at the prosecution table busily conferring ignoring hardy completely they had called six of the earlier lines and the various defendants had been paraded before the bench two of them had been assigned to courtrooms three were continued and defense attorneys assigned one was pled out then and there and ordered to pay a fine hardy tried not to look at the gallery celine was there dressed in black sitting next to ken farris in the second row he hadnt seen her since the day at the steam room in hardbodies he noticed jeff elliot sitting among what hardy assumed to be a group of other reporters jane of course was in the front row opposite celine art drysdale came through the main doors and stood arms folded against the back wall he and andy had discussed it yesterday sunday and decided what he would wear in court andy didnt own a suit that cost less than so hardy had asked jane the i magnin buyer to hit a few lowerprice racks and find something in andys size with a little more of a common feel he wanted andy to look good if a jury thought you looked like a criminal you were starting off on the wrong foot but not too good andy fowler exjudge was going to have a problem with the jury empathizing with him in any event as the bailiff was reading in the charge again hardy got up from the jury box and met andy at the podium fifteen feet in front of where marian braun sat he heard activity behind him turning he saw that the door was open and a larger knot of reporters was pushing in braun brought down her gavel lets get seated out there while im at it i want to tell you all that i will not allow pictures to be taken in this courtroom i want order this isnt going to take long note that fowler whispered this is not going to take long hardy nodded to fowler then addressed the court your honor mr hardy on the matter of bail bail has been decided yes your honor but i understood that you would reconsider your position braun glared down at him what made you understand that what could i have said that brought you to that conclusion hardy had expected hostility but on a pro forma request such as this one brauns response still took him aback your honor mr fowler is a respected jurist was mr hardy presently he is a defendant in a murder trial it is not unusual to deny bail in such cases i thought id made that perfectly clear ms pullios was that clear to you yes your honor mr hardy somehow understood that i would reconsider no answer was called for the courtroom was quiet marian braun stared at her former colleague she looked at the computer sheet in front of her bail will be set at one million dollars part v it was a cold and clear monday morning the fiftyfirst anniversary of pearl harbor out in the hallway in front of department hardy turned from the group that had gathered around ken farris and celine nash he pretended to lean down and tie his shoe wanting to hear what she was saying her husky voice cut through the hubbub im here and im going to be here every day to remind the jury that owen nash was a real person not just a statistic not a quote superrich financier unquote but my father a living and breathing person whom i loved and whom i mourn every day jane was next to him chomorro she said isnt that the worst hardy hadnt spoken to his exwife since finding out shed slept once only one night with owen nash hi jane he stood up he hadnt seen any reason to burden her with his strategy of the antagonistic bench in that light he considered chomorro was one of the best judges who could have come up are we going to challenge him hardy thought hed move along down the hallway away from celine and farris he saw jeff elliot having a few words with pullios over to his right they had about fifteen minutes before chomorro would call the court to order chomorro no youre kidding hardy thought he might as well practice for the newspapers why would i want to challenge him jane this is his first murder trial your dad wouldnt go to him to recuse himself on the may shinn matter because andy thought chomorro couldnt keep it confidential no your dad and i have discussed it chomorros ideal because hes got so much to prove hes going to lean over backward to give a fair trial to someone who had perceived him as an enemy its a chance for him to make his good name in that context hes probably the best judge we could have drawn except for the last line hardy didnt believe a word of it but he was pleased to discover that it flowed smoothly off his tongue they were inside department fowlers old courtroom hardy turned around and checked the gallery jane farris jeff elliot glitsky made it a point to come down hardy was glad to see him hed looked into one of the may shinn phone calls with no results abe wasnt to be pushed but for the time being he was the only investigator hardy had and even if he was technically working for the prosecution hardy was glad something about the manner in which this case had been brought to trial gnawed at him at the least it was good to have him involved he went to celine he couldnt define exactly what he saw in her eyes but they held his for a moment he wondered what he could say to her when inevitably they spoke again that he was sorry that hed been floundering and confused and hadnt meant to lead her on if thats what hed done in her expression he read nothing and in that nothing saw anger betrayal disgust he looked away as the bailiff announced that department of the superior court of the city and county of san francisco was now in session judge leo chomorro presiding chomorro looked young fit and feisty his wasnt the physique of lean good health seen in advertisements he gave more an impression of heavy solidity a lack of fat on a heavy frame like an oldfashioned fullback his face had a light olive cast his eyes were dark with brows that nearly met the razorstyled hair was short without a trace of gray when he had gotten settled at the bench the clerk of the court raised her voice calling criminal case number section felony murder the state of california versus andrew bryan fowler because of the passage of proposition after june of lawyers in california for both the prosecution and the defense were no longer permitted to conduct voir dire on prospective jurors now the judge did it this didnt mean that lawyers had no say anymore in who eventually got on a jury they still got their peremptory and other challenges but the judge ran the show now he or she asked the questions and gave instructions to prospective jurors and people like hardy and pullios had to make do as best they could on some combination of information instinct and luck hardy had asked chomorro if he could at least ask pertinent questions during the process and the judge had denied the request hardy then submitted a list of questions that he hoped chomorro would ask but he entertained little to no hope that the judge would go along the juryselection process could take hours or it could take weeks under the new and improved rules it tended to go faster than it had in the past indeed that had been the intention of proposition andy fowlers jury would consist of twelve jurors and two alternates and chomorro had told both hardy and pullios that he would be very disappointed if they didnt have a panel sworn in by the end of the first day the predicted mob materialized in the gallery in the past two months besides preparing his defense hardy had given no fewer than a dozen interviews on the case television magazines newspapers now with the impending trial coming up on center stage the first four rows of the gallery behind pullios filled with the media on the other side hed already seen jane he knew celine would be in and probably farris since there was no telling how long jury selection would take pullios had arranged to have a couple of her witnesses be on hand in the event it moved swiftly hardy thought he recognized the two guards from the marina sitting together john strout could be summoned from the coroners office in a matter of minutes the waiting was nearly over fowler after his milliondollar bail had finally been granted had resumed a semblance of a normal life he went into his office every day maybe had lunch with some senior partners maybe even played a little golf and tennis hardy would meet him either at the embarcadero center or at the olympic club and they would hash out their strategy the affirmative defense that they were beginning to have some confidence in it shouldnt have surprised hardy but somehow it did that fowler was turning into a real help in his own defense he still acted removed from the process as though it involved someone else entirely but that was his personal style and once hed been released from jail on his own refined turf it wasnt so grating andy had a copy of all of hardys files witnesses interrogations the evidence list newspaper articles and he took notes almost daily with ideas that might either weaken the prosecutions case or help to locate x in fact his insistence that there was an x did a lot to keep hardys confidence up about andys innocence nothing had panned out with hardys other investigators glitsky still professed an interest in helping him out but he had other active cases and so far every road hed followed on owen nash had led to a dead end all of mays other clients had had solid alibis and no particular motive anyway all had been cooperative just so long as abe wouldnt disclose the liaison with may shinn to their wivesfriendsbusiness associates jeff elliot had kept in touch but there hadnt been anything close to a scoop since fowlers polygraph and even that hadnt been much from jeffs perspective he was one of the people to whom hardy had given his new telephone number and last week hed called with renewed interest now that the case was getting hot again but hed had nothing new to contribute so if it wasnt andy fowler and hardy had to believe it wasnt except for the sweaty moments in the middle of the night when he still questioned whoever had killed owen nash looked like they were going to get away with it eighty people were called for the first jury pool there were as many theories of jury composition as there were attorneys hardy and fowler had spent hours discussing the relative merits of various professions and types of people ever aware that they might when the crunch came wind up empaneling an individual who went against type and killed them for example every once in a while a secretary who for some reason tended to be proprosecution would show herself to have a soft heart and come up for the defense on the other hand a longhaired musician a typical prodefense juror could turn out to have a heavymetal neonazi edge and lean to convict in spite of these possibilities the two men had come up with a general idea of who they wanted on the jury and who they didnt whether chomorro would ask the questions to identify the traits or professions they were looking for remained a mystery as it transpired hardys original idea to provoke some judicial prejudice had borne and continued to bear some sour fruit witness chomorros denials about voir dire there was still though enough early prejudicial activity to use in an appeal if it came to that but first as fowler had convinced him there was a trial to be won if you overconcentrated on your backup position you could find yourself needing it in fact after all the preparation and discussion it might after all come down as it so often did to old gut instinct there was however one rather unique wrinkle involved in choosing this particular jury in the mind of the public judges were generally held in high esteem and andy fowler had been a judge would people who might be opposed to authority figures defense jurors usually find in fowler a rebel they admired would the lawandorder types normally proprosecution view him as one of their own whod just made a mistake or would he be vulnerable to the wrath of the betrayed in the end they decided that their ideal juror would be a sensitive bluecollar white male with a good background and education either that fowler said or mr ed the talking horse they also thought they might have decent luck with an educated older black or oriental woman an hispanic woman they reasoned might take too many cues from chomorro and most of those cues would favor pullios they agreed that an older caucasian woman would be disastrous how could fowler throw away everything he had on paid sex with a japanese prostitute but a younger liberated white woman so long as she wasnt a secretary might be all right there was romance and drama in what fowler had done for love gay men and women would probably be good for the defense outsiders siding with an authority figure now on the outside and looked down on by the respectables but of course pullios would no doubt challenge any she presumed were gay without giving that as the reason if they got the chance they would try to keep any scientists or engineers men or women should they appear in the pool hardy was certain by now that the thrust of pullioss offense would be consciousness of guilt and therefore people who tended to believe in evidence as opposed to theory scientists as opposed to philosophers would better serve the defense needs of course scientists as a rule tended to be conservative and thus proprosecution but what the hell you couldnt have everything nobody no group was altogether desirable or predictable both hardy and his client found this stereotyping odious especially in san francisco it went against the social and personal grain it was a cliché to say so but two of hardys best friends were in fact the mulatto abe glitsky and pico morales who was not of northern european ancestry but they also felt they had to develop some criteria they were looking they hoped at professions affiliations attitudes if they ignored race and gender they werent doing themselves any favors i hate this fowler whispered i hated it before from behind the bench i still do each side had twenty peremptory challenges where they could dismiss a prospective juror with no reason given hardy and fowler had decided to use a diagram of the twelve jury seats in the pool and to cross out those they wanted to challenge with their legal pad in front of and between them this was a relatively subtle approach chosen so they wouldnt have to confer and risk antagonizing the jurors who remained people didnt like to feel they were being judged even if they werent challenged personally the jurors were sworn in and chomorro started talking to them or rather reading to them andrew bryan fowler has been charged with murder in the first degree in an indictment returned by the grand jury for the state of california fowler hardy noticed did not hang his head or show any outward signs of guilt or embarrassment while the indictment again was read in full judges addressing juries or prospective jurors could be friendly and avuncular or tight and businesslike hardy thought chomorro relatively new to the process struck a tone of studied affability it was as though an effort to appear friendly to jurors had appeared on the job description if he kept it up it might be good for andy whose breezy geniality was hardy felt genuine im going to ask a series of questions to all of you he addressed himself both to the panel of twelve on the courtroom side of the rail and to the sixty or so other prospective jurors waiting in the gallery if you answer yes to any of them i ask those of you up here he gestured to the jury box to raise your hand those of you in the gallery pool please listen carefully and if you are called up here and would have answered yes to any of these questions inform us immediately among the questions hardy had submitted for chomorro to ask the most important was the most obvious based on anything they had read or seen in the media had any of the prospective jurors already formed an opinion about the innocence or guilt of the defendant chomorro did ask that question a fairly routine one he would have asked anyway there was a lot of looking around but no one put his hand up chomorro didnt let it go let me rephrase that or ask a related question and you prospective jurors in the gallery you may raise your hands directly here how many of you have read about this case or know about it from television or the radio there was a scattered show of hands eight in the jury box hardy swiveled to look back at the gallery there were about ten more in the two months hed spent preparing for trial most of his creative ideas had gone out the window if a change of venue would have a better chance of getting andy a fair trial he would have gone for it but hed hired a consultant who had taken a poll and discovered that only between twentythree and thirty percent of adults in san francisco had ever heard of this case at first it had shocked him he knew people read less and less were too busy for most current events but still do any of you whose hands are up feel you know the issues in this case a few hands went down youre going to be hearing evidence that may or may not corroborate what you think you already know would any of those remaining have any problem accepting those new arguments or evidence this was getting weaker than what hardy had hoped for only four people and none in the jury box had their hands up all right then i think we can proceed chomorro then began the general winnowing process did anyone in the panel know the defendant had anyone known the victim the prosecutor or defense attorney chomorro read the list of proposed witnesses and asked if anyone knew any of them the tedious procedure continued were any of the panel themselves or any members of their families peace officers or lawyers ditto victims of violent crime what about nonviolent crime had anyone been arrested five of the twenty jurors raised their hands during this period of questioning a large percentage chomorro followed up individually with each one and ended by dismissing all five five new prospective jurors took their seats when the general questions had finished chomorro began taking the panel one at a time this was where before june of hardy could have narrowed things down considerably but now he was at the mercy of chomorros questions seat number one was a heavyset woman of about forty she gave her name as monica sellers she had been married for seventeen years to the same man and had three children for the past three years after the children were old enough shed been employed as a parttime bookkeeper for a temp agency that worked out of the mission district before that shed been a housewife now mrs sellers by the way do you prefer mrs or ms she laughed nervously oh mrs definitely im mrs sellers all right mrs sellers let me ask you this question then and would the rest of the panel please pay attention i will be instructing you in certain matters of law and one of the words youre going to hear a lot in the next few weeks is going to be evidence there are two basic kinds of evidence direct evidence for example when an eyewitness sees something and swears to it if you believe that witness then his or her statement would be direct evidence circumstantial evidence might be for example a fingerprint hardy jumped up objection your honor chomorro interrupted in his monologue frowned from the bench objection to what mr hardy i was about to say that a fingerprint on an object can be circumstantial evidence that the object had been touched by the person who had left fingerprints on it do you mean to object to that no your honor sorry he sat down and fowler whispered that he ought to reel it in a little if he didnt want the jury to start turning against him chomorro turned back to the panel the classic analogy related to direct versus circumstantial evidence is something we call the cherrypie analogy chomorro appeared a bit embarrassed by the homespun nature of his words if you walk into your kitchen and see your child eating cherry pie then you have direct evidence that he was eating the pie if on the other hand you come in and see a halfempty pie plate and your childs face and clothes covered with cherry pie filling then you have circumstantial evidence that hes eaten the pie i need hardly add that both types of evidence can be pretty convincing the jury nodded appreciatively and chomorro more relaxed at the positive reaction continued lets take another example since this evidence is central to what a trial is all about how about lipstick on a cigarette which can also be evidence mr smith sees mrs jones smoking a certain type of cigarette and leaving a certain colored lipstick stain then lets say he walks to another room in her house and sees a similar cigarette butt lying in an ashtray in another room that second cigarette butt is circumstantial evidence that mrs jones has been in that room she may have been in that room but it is not a fact proved by direct evidence i trust thats clear this is good fowler whispered hardy nodded agreeing and glanced at pullios her mouth was set tightly she looked straight ahead however chomorro went on that said if i tell you as a matter of law that an abundance of circumstantial evidence under certain conditions can be sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt would you have a problem with that mrs sellers looked thoughtful no i dont think so pullios looked to be suppressing a smile hardy put an x through seat number one he didnt want to run through his challenges but there was no option here as chomorro nodded to mrs sellers would any of you have a problem first one then two other prospective jurors wanted some clarification chomorro took them one at a time getting names marital status occupations beginning to fill in the blanks they were all men two in their fifties one a black man of about thirty finally they all agreed they could accept chomorros instructions although there might have to be a lot of circumstantial evidence which brought chomorro to a pedantic discussion of quality versus quantity of evidence a small amount of direct evidence might outweigh an abundance of circumstantial evidence or vice versa seat number two was shane pollett cabinetmaker a relic of the sixties with graying long hair and a tiedyed tshirt a mediumlength beard an expression of amused tolerance he was fortyfour years old in his second marriage second family three young kids two already grown up hardy was beginning to understand chomorros technique he would move quickly through the panel asking a technical question or making a legal point or two to each member opening it up to the rest if his goal was to keep things moving along it would work for hardys purposes it wasnt nearly enough mr pollett let me ask you this sure pollett said clearly the informality irreverence rankled chomorro but he forced a smile if the state didnt have someone come in and say this happened i saw it would you accept that thered be another way they could prove something happened to use my example sure why not hardy leaned over and whispered to fowler why do i like this guy fowler shrugged wrong answer for us but the right tone gives one pause keep your eyes open jane brought sandwiches into the room theyd been assigned on the second floor of the hall it was a little after one oclock on the first day and seven jurors were already empaneled chomorro wanted a jury in two days max and by god they were going to have one how are we doing she asked knocking em dead her father answered brightly he pulled a submarine and a soda from the bag jane had brought in no chips jane smacked her forehead sorry i forgot the chips hardy pulled the bag toward him he realized the banter was in the bravefront department but his patience was worn thin lets chat some more about chips chips are real important right now he started unwrapping his own sandwich okay ive got it four to three slightly toward us is there anybody you hate jane asked her face serious anybody i hate i challenge but theres damn little to go on i know fowler said to call this a voir dire is a little misleading i dont think leo knows that much what hes doing whats he leaving out jane asked its not so much that fowler said hardy spoke up hes not getting anybody to open up who are these people what do they think about what movies do they like hobbies anything when he gets done were not going to know anybody better than we do now you look at what theyre wearing if they got a nice face if they dont stare at us like they hate your father thats about it that and his socalled explanations of law he does favor the leading question fowler admitted but hes a politician what do you expect hes what i expect all right but im let down on so many other expectations why couldnt we get lucky here hes going awful light on the burden of proof dont you think well we knew that going in hardy chewed a moment there must be a rebuttal to consciousness of guilt not that i know of fowler said you cant prove a negative if hed only make a nod toward due process i gave him twenty questions on the investigation the indictment the grandjury process all of that what was that jane asked jesus everything hardy said everything these people should know and probably wont that an indictment is essentially a minimum showing of cause for trial that no defense people can be present during the grandjury proceedings that basically its the prosecutors ballgame these prospective jurors out there are intimidated enough then you tell them that another jury a grand jury no less thinks your father killed owen nash what are they supposed to think hardy turned to his client hes got to bring up some of that put it in context fowler shook his head he wont you can bet on it hes telling us its not relevant fowler smiled grimly what a judge thinks has a way of making it into the courtroom believe me i know your dueprocess argument might make the appeal but youre going to have to get clever and lucky to get it introduced here jane tapped her bottle of soda on the table a few times gosh you guys are heartening to talk to she said chomorro finished his questioning and asked if either side would like to exercise a challenge hardy decidedly did not want to dismiss the first person interviewed it would not enamor him to the jury but since mrs sellers had come down so strongly for believing in the accumulation of circumstantial evidence he had no choice he could tell it both surprised and hurt her as if shed failed a test he looked at the eleven faces to his left most of them fixed solemnly on mrs sellers as she walked back through the swinging door that separated the gallery from the courtroom the clerk called a name to fill the vacancy by they had empaneled a jury and two alternates there were seven men and five women four blacks two men and two women and despite hardys initial misgivings one oriental a fiftyfiveyearold bespeckled vietnamese shopkeeper named nguyen minh ro fowler had crossed him off on their schematic almost as soon as hed started talking but then ro not perfectly understanding the laws of his new country had asked the very question that hardy had wanted to get in just how was it that mr fowler was to be considered innocent when the grand jury had already said he was guilty hardy could have kissed the man he still might have dismissed him but there was something in his body language toward chomorro as the indictment process sunk in that looked promising for the defense surprisingly pullios didnt challenge and he was in they could break it down demographically any number of ways seven men five women seven whites five nonwhites they did have a fortunate break with their hope for scientificengineering types three of the jury worked to some degree with computers additionally one middleaged black woman mercedes taylor was an architect there were no secretaries they had kept pollett the cabinetmaker three computer jocks an architect two salesmen one housewife two smallbusiness people including ro a construction person and a highschool teacher chomorro had put on reading glasses as the day progressed his affability fading along apparently with his eyesight by the time he began questioning the alternates at four oclock he was as clipped as a drill sergeant asking them if theyd heard anything in the questioning and instructions to the other jurors that they felt ought to disqualify them no okay then he finished them both in under twenty minutes i dont blame her why should she want to help you the she peter struler was referring to was may shinn he sat on his mollys desk facing her in her chair his legs on either side of her pullios had pushed herself back nearly to the wall and looked up at him i thought the letter made that very clear she said shes got about a half dozen civil suits going freeman knows her civil jury will more likely pay off on an upstanding citizen who helped the authorities solve the murder of which she was wrongly accused besides all the witnesses will be cops and das we could do her some good she might be suing us but its the city that pays off struler shook his head id just bring her in on what straightfaced struler replied how about a dwo something like that pullios knew her law and shed never heard of a dwo okay ill bite whats a dwo struler grinned you know driving while oriental gets em every time there was no training this guy is it just me or do i get the feeling your political correctness is slipping again who gives he said enunciating clearly a big steaming pile of shit he put his feet up on the chairs arms outside the window behind molly it was pitch black though it wasnt far into the dinner hour her door was closed so hit her with a subpoena i know but the minute i do that she goes on the official witness list yeah well excuse me but arent those the rules she graced him with a getserious expression and he asked if hardy had interviewed her she said he hadnt so whyd she talk to you pullios smiled i asked freeman to clear it for me to apologize personally for what id put her through struler shook his head in admiration you are a cruel and terrible woman thank you sir it got her to talk to me about fowler and the gun but she said she wouldnt be a witness against him hey shes not married to him its not like she has a choice i want to keep her on my side as long as i can though the nice letter all that you need what shes got pullios nodded its absolutely essential okay struler said heres what i suggest you do wait until the last possible moment so theres no notice to hardy then send somebody out some da investigator like my own self and slap her with a submeister whats that struler shook his head come on molls he said get hip saturday night live submeister subarama mr sub subster at her continued blank stare he finally relented you lawyers ought to get out more i swear to god a subpoena molly hit her with a subpoena hardy plugged in the christmas lights hed strung up around his front porch over the weekend rebecca walking now clapped her hands stopping to point and yelling what sounded like why why why at the top of her lungs hardy picked her up and held her closer to them light light light he said the beck shook her head laughing is she the greatest kid in the world frannie said the universe hardy said why rebecca said some of the lights had started blinking she pointed to them why why i think shes going to be a philosopher hardy said like her father like her uncle moses maybe not exactly like her father frannie now in her eighth month of pregnancy had her arm around hardys waist the problems that had led up to hardys mugging in october were behind them he was working a lot of hours but he was at least sharing it with her plus they were laughing together teasing each other enjoying the beck the car pulled up and doubleparked in front of their house whos that frannie asked hardy knew immediately he kissed his wife on the cheek and handed the baby to her ill be right back hed been expecting this somehow he walked down the few steps then onto the path that bisected his lawn to the gate at the fence apprehensive he met her there she was wearing a heavy coat against the chill a cowllike head covering pulled down around her ears her hands were deep in her pockets vapor from her breath hung in the still air a moment before it dissipated you shouldnt be here celine she seemed unsteady as if shed been drinking but he was close enough to have smelled that and didnt i had to talk to you youve changed your phone number you were in court all day celine ill be there tomorrow i didnt know what i wanted to say then he let out a breath he had it coming okay i i she began then stopped its all right hardy heard the door to his house close frannie and rebecca had gone inside i just wanted you to know that i understand i dont want you to hate me to think that i hate you hardy nodded thats good to hear i certainly dont hate you you were acting like it no i was trying to ignore you thats different its something i have to do yes of course but ill still be there every day you have to know that all right but i dont think you ought to come by here the last time i know that was a mistake he recalled her panicked retreat the last time shed come up to his gate my life is here he said i forgot that for a moment im sorry no it wasnt that it wasnt even you you just suddenly reminded me so much of my father she gripped the gate steadying herself i didnt mean to say it like that but your wife your baby what i couldnt have hardy had his hands in his pockets the vapor from their breathing merged in the air between them she seemed to gather herself then regain control your client the judge you obviously dont think he did it no i dont then who did i dont know were looking but so far there isnt much much to be very honest nothing poor daddy she whispered there wasnt anything more to say she glanced at his house behind him nodded turned and walked quickly to her car he had taken to following a routine every night first he was not drinking at all during the week from sunday through thursday night he would finish dinner and help frannie with the dishes they would talk about each others day he would bounce things off her then he would take a cup of coffee and go into his office for a couple of hours of what he called creative leisure toss some darts read over some testimony he thought he already knew by heart play devils advocate with every position he could think of sometimes hed call abe just to keep the needle in he tried not to work on the weekends or on wednesday nights although hed told frannie that theyd have to suspend date night during the duration of the trial and of course for however many weekends the trial took weekends as such would not exist his paper load now included six full binders four filled legal pads and a dozen cassette tapes it was amazing he thought that as many times as you went through it there was always something youd missed he remembered papers hed done in college proofing and proofing and rereading and then handing in what he thought was perfect work only to get it back with a typo or something screwed up in the first line but tonight the choreography was complete the dance began in earnest tomorrow he arranged his books binders pads and tapes neatly on his desk and turned out the light in his office and walked through his house he looked in at rebecca pulling up a blanket around her the bedroom was bathed in blue light from the fish tank in the kitchen pots and pans hung neatly from overhead hooks his black pan glistened on the top of the gas stove moving forward through the dining room he caught a whiff of lemon oil from the polished table then unmistakable seductive mnemonic the scent of christmas tree and woodsmoke frannie sat in the recliner next to the fire feet up and hands folded over her belly the only other light in the room came from the tree blinking reds and greens and blues nat king cole was singing quietly in german oh tannenbaum hardy took it all in for a moment are you ready she asked as ill ever be frannie patted the side of the chair and hardy crossed the room and sat on the floor next to her she idly ran her hand over his head through his hair have you thought about after this trial not much i thought wed have this next baby get back to real life are you going to be happy with real life im happy with this life frannie the fire crackled he knew what she meant he was in trial time everything assumed an importance that was out of proportion to daytoday prosaic reality she was worried about a recurrence of the letdown hed gone through over the summer how far did it go with her she asked he looked up at her her hand still rested on his head her face was untroubled and unlined beautiful in the firelight i dont want any details she said and i appreciate you dealing with it yourself i know what infatuation is and i dont think we need to get each other involved in them but i need to know how far it went hardy stared at the fire suddenly aware that the music had stopped its funny i thought it was jane no he could embroider and skate around it but he knew what shed asked it stopped in time it didnt happen she let out a long breath i dont know everything you need dismas but if you can try to tell me ill try to give it to you you already do fran im just telling you whatever it takes we stick it through together okay but you have to want me i do want you hey thats why im here all right she said because thats why im here good morning pullios looked nice friendly approachable the girl next door she wore low brown pumps and a tawny suit the cut of which minimized her curves shoulderlength brown hair framed a face nearly devoid of makeup she smiled at one and all pleasant but on serious business i want to begin by thanking you all for your patience yesterday it was a long day for all of us and im sure well have more in the days to come but let me assure you that your presence on this jury is one of the most important duties that can be undertaken by citizens in our society and your time and attention here is well appreciated hardy gave some thought to an objection right away pullios had no business massaging the jury that was if anyones the judges role but he knew you had to walk a fine line with objections the jury also had to feel good about him and if he objected to pullios saying they were appreciated it would no doubt be misunderstood although like a lot of important jobs she continued the pay could be better a nice chuckle even chomorro smiled what a nice person this prosecutor was she walked back to her desk moved a yellow pad then turned back to the jury im going to tell you a lot about what we know about the defendant andrew fowler and the man he murdered owen nash i make the point that im going to tell you a lot because you are undoubtedly going to hear that fowler had poked him early or not hardy had to get on the boards sometime objection your honor to his surprise chomorro nodded sustained he looked down at pullios just make your case counselor this is your opening statement dont editorialize im sorry excuse me your honor gracious and unflustered this one she moved on early in the morning of saturday june twentieth of last summer a windy blustery day the victim in this case mr owen nash boarded his sailboat the eloise and prepared to take what would be his last sail the prosecution will prove to you ladies and gentlemen prove beyond a reasonable doubt that with him on the eloise that morning was the person who would murder him the defendant andrew fowler a former colleague of the defendant a fellow member of the olympic club will tell you that mr fowler had talked of making an appointment to see mr nash to solicit political contributions from him this was the pretense for their getting together the evidence will corroborate that mr nash and his killer sailed under the golden gate bridge and headed south down the coast we have an expert in tides and currents who will tell you with a good deal of precision exactly where owen nash fell into the sea after being shot two times with acaliber pistol the coroner will explain that the first bullet struck mr nash just above and to the right of his penis the second bullet went through his heart an expert in bloodstains will describe how this second bullet sent mr nash over the rail of his boat and into the ocean at first glance a very convenient circumstance for his killer we will show you that mr fowler is an experienced boatsman in his own right that he could easily have kept the eloise at sea until the evening when he could have guided it back into the marina even in high seas a meteorologist will describe the weather on that evening there were high winds and small craft warnings were out in this weather it is no surprise that there was no one at the marina when mr fowler returned he tied up the boat leaving it unlocked and was not seen by another human being until he arrived at work right here in this building on the following monday morning here was another objection but this time hardy merely made a note of it counsel wasnt supposed to argue evidence in their opening statements pullios didnt use notes but she returned again to her desk playing down any appearance as a superwoman after checking her props she turned and continued rather than predict what the defense will contend relating to evidence in this case here a nod to chomorro a smile to the jury i will tell you right now that the prosecution has found no one who can point to mr fowler and say that was the man i saw on the eloise on june twentieth with owen nash no one saw mr fowler on the eloise besides owen nash and hes dead well youre asking then why are we here we are here she answered herself first because mr fowlers pattern of behavior over the course of several months cannot be explained other than by acknowledging his consciousness of his own guilt duplicity deception abandonment of the high ethical standards objection your honor chomorro nodded two for two hardy thought not too bad sustained lets stick to the evidence ms pullios she apologized again to the judge and jury but it clearly didnt rattle her the prosecution will demonstrate that mr fowler knew the precise location of the murder weapon on board the eloise and that he had a compelling reason to kill mr nash the oldest and most lethal motive in the world jealousy mr nash had superseded him in the affections of the woman he loved for whom he subsequently risked and this is a fact not a conjecture risked his entire career and reputation as a judge and a man of honor we will show that the defendant first identified and then tracked down his rival with the help of a private investigator that he concocted a plan for the two of them to meet that he painstakingly arranged an alibi for the weekend of this meeting all these facts speak to mr fowlers consciousness of guilt but all this is not to say there is no direct evidence there is a murder weapon for example and on the murder weapon not on the outside but on the clip which holds the bullets for the gun are the fingerprints of the defendant andrew fowler a stir in the courtroom hardy had known this would be a bad point but there wasnt anything he could do about it andys story was all he had to tell pullios pushed on they were captivated now this of course is not direct evidence that mr fowler was on the eloise with mr nash nor obviously is the fact that he wasnt seen anywhere else nor by itself is the discussion with his colleague about meeting mr nash for political reasons neither finally is his jealousy his hiring of a private investigator his attempts to hide or cover up all of his activities relating to his lover may shinn or his rival owen nash but the people of the state of california contend that taken together the evidence in this case can lead to no other conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt andrew fowler did with malice aforethought sometime in the morning of june twentieth shoot and kill owen nash hardy thought she was finished and took a drink of water preparing to stand and begin his opening statement but she turned back at her desk i would like to make two final but important points one circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof judge chomorro mentioned this to you yesterday and it is a crucial point here circumstantial evidence is still evidence and the evidence in this case inescapably convicts the defendant hardy knew he could object but figured hed run out his string with the jury any further objections would look like he was trying to keep something hidden from them he let her go on uninterrupted secondly why is there little direct evidence does it make any sense that a man could commit a murder and leave nothing behind by which he can be identified well lets consider that mr fowler has spent the better part of the last thirty years as a judge in this very superior court of san francisco during that time he has heard hundreds if not thousands of criminal cases is it any wonder that a man with this experience would leave little or no physical trace of his presence ask yourselves this if your job is evaluating evidence if you are intimately familiar with how the legal system works in all its detail if you know every test and every procedure someone will use to catch you dont you think you could avoid leaving anything incriminating behind i think i could i think andrew fowler could and did the evidence will speak for itself youll have to bear with me hardy began im in a bit of a bind his legs were so weak with nerves he didnt trust himself to stand either at attention or at ease in front of the jury so he leaned back against his table hoping his legs would improve as he got going the charge against my client is murder the most serious of crimes yet the prosecution theory here is so bizarre that i hardly know how to discuss it without losing my temper or insulting your intelligence or both a sea of blank faces were these the same folks who had smiled frowned chuckled and gasped on cue as elizabeth pullios stood before them but there was nothing to do for it here he was and he had better get it together and press on stripped of all the rhetoric and polite verbiage listen to the nonsense the prosecution presents here is their truly astounding theory because there is no evidence the defendant must be guilty hardy paused to let that sink in weve just heard that theres no evidence in this case because mr fowler was too smart to leave any well im going to tell you something by that standard everyone in this courtroom all of you jury members me the judge the gallery out there unless were all ready to admit we werent smart enough to think of a way not to get caught if ms pullioss version of justice were the law of the land all of us could be found equally guilty of the murder of owen nash the jury woke up the gallery came to life and pullios was on her feet objecting good let them see both sides could interrupt she was sustained hardy had unfairly characterized her statement and was arguing to the jurors he told the judge he was very sorry the jury was instructed to disregard what hed said and he was sure they would try and he hoped fail his sea legs came in all right he said let me tell you as the judge instructs me what the defense has to prove and then what the defense will prove the first is simple the defense doesnt have to prove anything the burden of proof rests on the prosecution and during the course of this trial with all the direct and circumstantial evidence you will be asked to evaluate it will be up to the prosecution to prove that andy fowler is guilty pullios objected again hardy was arguing the law not stating the facts she was sustained hardy didnt care when youve heard and seen everything the prosecution has the inescapable conclusion will be that the state has not met its burden of proof it cannot provide evidence to prove that andy fowler killed owen nash and ladies and gentleman fancy theories of guilty consciences notwithstanding evidence is what a jury trial is all about until you twelve people deliberate knowing all the evidence and basing your judgment on it return with a guilty verdict it is presumed that andy fowler just plain didnt do it thats the law and im sure you all understand it again she was alienating jurors and didnt seem aware of it pullios objected this time chomorro overruled her with a pointed comment about the latitude she had been allowed in her opening hardy kept his face impassive and went back to his work but my second point the defense plans to go beyond that a lot of you are probably sitting in the jury box here wondering how an eminent jurist like objection sustained mr hardy mr fowler is the defendant in a murder trial he is not an eminent jurist all right your honor hardy walked to his table and took a drink of water the jury was waiting for him when he turned back to them im sure all of you believe to a greater or lesser extent in our criminal justice system its why youre all here doing your civic duty as ms pullios said you are doing an important job giving up important other work to be part of this process we very much appreciate it hardy had swiveled half away from the jury and nodded to pullios back to the box it is one thing to say you believe in the presumption of innocence it is quite another to come here as you are now sit in a jury box and look at a man a man who used to be a judge sitting at the defense table accused of committing the most serious crime a man can commit murder in the first degree and not believe there isnt some powerful compelling overwhelming reason why that person is there his very presence seems to be an argument for his guilt the judge rapped his gavel mr hardy weve gone over this in voir dire hardy stopped consciously slowing himself down not exactly given to theatrics he suddenly found it completely natural to point at andy fowler that man he said lowering his voice has been a member of the legal community in this city for more than half his life pullios popped back in objection your honor no ill overrule that counselor thats a fact hardy thanked the judge that man hardy repeated still pointing will be the first to admit he made a grievous error of judgment from that one mistake he was drawn to others perhaps more serious until at last he had sacrificed his good name his standing in the community the respect of his peers he found himself standing very close to the rail separating the jurors from the courtroom now who are andy fowlers peers they are the professional prosecutors the policemen the other judges in this building they are the very people who have brought this murder indictment against him your honor pullios was on her feet mr hardy is impugning the entire grandjury process chomorro seemed to agree but also seemed uncertain is there relevance to some evidence here counselor your honor the defense will present direct and incontrovertible evidence eyewitness testimony from members of the district attorneys own staff and from the san francisco police department that there was nothing approaching an impartial investigation leading to the indictment of mr fowler the district attorneys office concocted a theory out of whole cloth and proceeded to fill in whatever blanks they needed to get an indictment there hardy had gotten it out and chomorro could overrule him if he wanted to pullios took over do we call this the paranoid defense your honor someone was out to get mr fowler so we got together and accused him of murder mr hardy it speaks to the interpretation of evidence interpretation of evidence is in the hands of the jury hardy nodded my point exactly your honor but pullios wasnt ready to quit the evidence must speak for itself your honor chomorro banged his gavel all right all right hold on a minute here the courtroom hung in silence by its absence hardy for the first time noticed the ticking of the court reporters keys finally chomorro spoke up ill overrule ms pullioss objection you may proceed mr hardy hardy took a deep breath and let it out slowly he didnt want to betray that he was sighing in relief hed also blanked on where he was going he walked to his table and checked his outline youve already heard the term consciousness of guilt in the peoples opening statement and i dont dispute that there are certain actions that would seem to admit guilt these would include such behavior as flight to avoid prosecution resisting arrest and so on but were on very slippery ground here when were using consciousness of guilt a very general legal area as a catchall for a specific crime hardy went on to describe an example of a situation where someone had resisted arrest and fled from arresting officers if there had been a murder on that block would that persons actions in any way prove he had been involved in the murder of course not perhaps the person had stolen a car maybe he had an outstanding arrest warrant for jaywalking maybe he was a member of a minority group in a neighborhood where minorities were routinely harassed the point hardy said is that our person here can be guilty of something and can act in what we would recognize as a guilty manner but his actions dont automatically make him guilty of or a suspect in any specific crime he thought hed nailed that point now we have already admitted that andy fowler felt guilty well go a step further he acted in a guilty manner the prosecution is telling you that they will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mr fowlers behavior allows for no other explanation for this behavior except that he committed murder we dont believe they can do this we dont believe that you will let them because it isnt true he took another three or four seconds to look up and down the jury box then he thanked them and sat down fowler told his daughter that chomorro had obviously talked to some of his lawyer friends at lunch which was why he had called the conference in his chambers before they began with the testimony of coroner john strout in the afternoon whats it about jane asked her father she was beside him at the defense table which was allowed when court wasnt in session behind them in the gallery the crowd was gathering again after the lunch recess chomorros going over some rules he said this is his first murder trial remember he doesnt want to foul it up and have it declared a mistrial how could he do that fowler patted his daughters hand see all these years i guess ive made it look easy youre not supposed to argue law during opening statements for example you can say what youre going to be showing but youre not supposed to explain it which you may have noticed ms pullios did also all this objecting and interrupting its already getting to be a little personal in whats supposed to be an impartial process didnt dismas want that fowler nodded yes he did and to that extent hes doing fine but chomorro id bet anything has got some ringers back there he motioned to the gallery a couple of clerks taking notes a trials supposed to be about evidence not personalities if it gets too bitter it jeopardizes the trial do we want that no jane i dont want a mistrial i want a fair trial dismas wants one too although he also wants to fight which is good up to a certain point but if im going to have any life after this weve got to win fairly so everybody knows im innocent even diz daddy he doesnt think you did it he wouldnt be defending you fowler wasnt so sure hardys own uncertainties hadnt been lost on him ive known him a long time jane longer than you have remember hes willing enough to pretend to believe even to himself that im innocent but i wonder if it isnt more a case of his feeling the evidence doesnt prove i did it and well thats the same thing fowler shook his head no it isnt jane its not even close hardy had read dr john strouts grandjury testimony twenty times hed memorized the autopsy report hed paid another doctor a friend of picos named walter beckman to spend a night talking about medical issues and hed come to the conclusion that strouts testimony couldnt damage andy fowler the coroner had to be called to establish the fact of the death the means of death but essentially his testimony would be neutral a foundation for what followed which he soon discovered was selling pullios short and he should have known better strout tall and lanky pushed back the witness chair so he could fit his long legs into the space he appeared to be the most relaxed person in the courtroom which was to be expected he had given testimony perhaps an average of once a week for the past twelve years he sat straight his elbows on the arms of the chair pullios and hardy had both been instructed not to come close to witnesses when they were interrogating them so pullios stood where she had delivered her opening statement about in the center of a circle that encompassed hardy the jury strout and chomorro after leading the doctor through his qualifications which were not in dispute she asked him to describe the wounds he had discovered in owen nashs body well he drawled there were two wounds both created byacpcaliber slugs the lower wound not in itself fatal entered the body in the pubic area excuse me dr strout pullios said distasteful as this is would you please be more precise as to the location of this first wound the drawl became more pronounced well if we dont want to get into latin counselor the pubic area is relatively precise its the area covered by pubic hair above the genitals in other words within an inch or so of the penis hardy saw where she was going if a man were eliminating his sexual rival objection leading the witness pullios quickly said shed rephrase can you tell us the location of this first wound in relation to mr nashs penis it entered just about at the base of the penis slightly high and to the right some of the men on the jury seemed to wince any more about this wound strout went into some detail about the bullets passage through nashs body nicking the ilium depositing some chips of bone in the greatest gluteal muscle before exiting through it he went on at pullioss careful prodding to make the point that this wound had in all probability been the first one and why do you say that doctor strout recrossed his legs well the second shot was fatal almost immediately it went right through the heart struck a rib and ricocheted up into the left lung now unless mr nash stood a while on his feet after he was dead we can assume he fell within about a second of being shot and if he was on the ground the bullet through his pubic area would have been lodged in the deck not on the side under the railing which was i believe where it was found hardy objected citing relevance but he knew the testimony was relevant to what pullios was doing which was planting in every jurors mind a vivid picture of the actions of a jealous and jilted suitor first he would shoot his victim in the crotch then he would aim for the heart killing him after hed maimed him as a man chomorro overruled hardy but pullios didnt pursue it she graciously thanked dr strout and told him she had no further questions so the dike was already leaking where hed foreseen no damage he had to try and put his finger in dr strout he began thesecaliber bullets that produced the wounds in owen nash for the jury can you describe their impact as opposed to different sized slugs strout no less relaxed than hed been with pullios sat back in the chair he looked directly at the jury and answered in his pleasant twang well theyre in the lowerend range according to size for handguns the smallest is a and its slightly larger the diameter is slightly larger than that thank you now was there anything you could determine from your autopsy about the load in the bullet itself the amount of powder in the casing strout got thoughtful this was the kind of question he liked judging from the fact that the second bullet didnt make an exit wound it could not have been a particularly heavy load about average youd say yes about average so dr strout what weve got here is a small bullet with about an average powder load hitting a fullgrown man would the impact of that bullet necessarily throw the man backward even if it hit him squarely in the chest objection your honor thats not dr strouts area of expertise whats the point mr hardy ms pullios went to some length to bring out dr strouts belief that the first shot was to mr nashs pubic area chomorro chewed on it a second then overruled pullios dr strout is it possible that a man even if hit in the heart by a bullet of this size with this sort of charge behind it could remain standing for half a second particularly if he were moving toward the gun when the bullet was fired yes id say so and would that be enough time for his assailant to get off another shot with an automatic such as the murder weapon half a second id say its possible thats all thank you doctor what bothers me is i didnt even see it coming you did fine fowler said i doubt its relevant anyway who cares where the first shot went they were taking a tenminute recess still sitting at the defense table hardy explained what he thought was the connection and fowler doodled on a pad for a moment then he said look diz it doesnt tie directly to me therefore its not relevant its speculation conjecture call it what you will but keep me right in the center of this picture or we are in trouble you were in the center of that andy fowler showing displeasure for one of the first times shook his head no he said the murderer was after strout they heard from a ballistics specialist who identified the murder weapon as a beretta model a singleaction semiautomatic that held eight rounds of acp the gun registered to may shinn was introduced as peoples exhibit and hardy could tell the jury was surprised by the size of it it was very small with a barrel only two and onehalf inches long the bullet that had passed through nashs body had been found imbedded in the side paneling of the boat behind the wheel there was a fifteenminute slide show on the similarities of the striations on the recovered slugs with others fired from the same gun when the lights came up so did a few heads that had been nodding pullios was explaining the obvious how this testimony conclusively proved that exhibit may shinns gun was the murder weapon big deal hardy thought and chose not to crossexamine the fingerprint specialist was a young black woman named anita wells she testified that there were two sets of identifiable fingerprints on the gun those of may shinn the registered owner and of the defendant andy fowler hardy had badly wanted to get the may shinn fiasco introduced into the record and he knew pullios had no choice but to let him if she wanted to get fowlers prints in which she had to do it was he was sure why she had called wells on day one when pullios had finished a cursory interrogation hardy went to the center of the courtroom ms wells he asked have you had occasion to test peoples exhibit one for fingerprints more than once wells looked up at the judge then at pullios she nodded and the judge told her to speak up answer with words yes she said and when did you first see this gun the witness thought a minute around the beginning of july and at that time when you tested it for fingerprints can you tell the jury what you found pullios stood up and objected asked and answered your honor hardy shook his head ill rephrase it the first time you looked did you identify the defendants fingerprints wells swallowed no did you identify any fingerprints at that time yes may shinns may shinn the registered owner of the gun and where were ms shinns prints there were several clear impressions on the barrel and the grip all right now after you identified ms shinns fingerprints what did you do well first i verified the comparison they were what i was looking for so in other words you went looking for may shinns fingerprints isnt that true yes and after the case against ms shinn got thrown out you went looking for andy fowlers fingerprints and you found them isnt that true pullios objected but hardy didnt want to let this one go your honor when the case against mr fowler gets dropped does the prosecution plan to go looking for other prints at that time the defendants fingerprints on this gun are critical to the case against him the jury cant know too much about how they were identified pullios wasnt quitting either ms wells has already testified that they were on the gun thats true mr hardy were talking about mr fowlers fingerprints not may shinns you are arguing evidence that hasnt been presented in this case try not to confuse the jury by referring to what is not properly before it hardy felt this was a big loss he stood a moment gathering his forces you still with us mr hardy chomorro asked hardy had anticipated chomorros antagonism from the bench but now at its first appearance he realized how powerful its influence could be if chomorro was allowed to patronize him the jury would pick up on it and his credibility would suffer andy fowler had been right this wasnt an appealable issue it had been bad strategy of course your honor hardy said mildly i was waiting for your ruling chomorros face tightened slightly i thought id made that clear the objection is sustained this time hardy simply nodded he spread his hands to the jury and smiled at them sorry my mistake but the message was clear he was a reasonable man waiting to make sure he understood the judges ruling there was no antagonism between himself and chomorro he went back to anita wells can you tell us how long a fingerprint can last i dont understand i mean does it go away after a while by itself does it evaporate no fingerprints are oilbased they last until theyre wiped away so mr fowlers fingerprints on the clip inside the gun might not have been placed there at any time near to when the gun was found or fired thats true did you find anything indicating it might not be true no so mr fowlers fingerprints might have been on the gun for as long as a year pullios stood up asked and answered your honor ill withdraw it hardy said no further questions its early but id put us ahead on points they had their coats off their ties loosened from fowlers law office high up in embarcadero one the city glittered out the window christmas lights starting to appear below hardy was not so sure i wanted to get shinn in he had wanted to call may as a defense witness from the beginning but fowler wouldnt hear of it what could she possibly say that could make a difference he had argued fowler hadnt seen her after all in the four months before the murder to say nothing of the fact that she had turned down hardys several requests for interviews she remembered him from visitors room a thank you the prosecution they both figured wouldnt go near her she would be understandably hostile to the san francisco district attorneys office so strangely enough the other central figure in this case would apparently play no active role in it hardy did not like that at all andy had poured himself a neat scotch from a tumbler on the sideboard and now took a drink of it he stood and carried the glass over to the window hardy watched his back a minute you havent seen her andy may shinn was still the issue the looming specter an unmentionable apparition the chronology could not have been simpler a year ago andy fowler had been in love with may shinn in midfebruary she had dumped him for owen nash in july he had sacrificed his career for her in october he had been arrested for murdering her lover and in the two months that hardy had been seeing fowler every day he had never to hardys knowledge made any effort to contact her fowlers shoulders sagged no what would be the point it just seems you might have fowler gave it a moment then nodded i suppose it does he returned to the chair behind his desk and sat heavily into it what do you want me to say i dont know maybe she could help us theres no doubt she can hurt us how hardy shrugged maybe she knows something god knows weve tried everybody else and weve got nothing resembling a lead for x fowler sipped and stared no diz i dont think so suddenly a frightening thought occurred andy was still carrying a torch hardy had kept the secret of shinns other clients to himself excluding glitsky but he was coming around to thinking it might do andy some good to know the truth to face the truth if nothing else it might break him out of his reluctance to use what may might have you know he said there were other men fowler pushed his glass a quarter turn at a time in a circle on his desk what hardy spent five minutes explaining to andy checking the phone records proving that may had lied to him fowler stared into space behind hardys head why are you telling me all this now because your life is at stake here andy and i think maybe youre somehow planning on getting found not guilty putting this trial behind you and doing nothing to jeopardize what you still think is your relationship with this woman and if thats the case you ought to know what that relationship really was he took a moment i know what it was thats become clear to me before you told me this well hardy asked well what maybe you could talk to her maybe she knows something he paused waiting for andy about x if nothing else the exjudge suddenly looking old and tired leaned his head back against the chair and blew at the ceiling dont you think she would have mentioned that in her own defense last summer she never got the chance she got plenty of chance she doesnt know you think he had to drive it home but you thought she had cut off her other clients for you remember she wasnt supposed to be sleeping with anyone else fowler pushed his fingers into his eyes there must be some aphorism here about old fools and young women he pulled his hands away from his face okay okay do what youve got to do when hardy got home at eleven the house was asleep there was a redi delivery service box on his front porch when he walked up and he opened it in his office the dailies only deathpenalty defendants who got them free and people as rich as andy fowler who could afford them got daily transcripts one hundred eightyeight typed pages of todays transcripts that he ought to review before tomorrow maybe someone had said something at the trial today he hadnt heard or listened to carefully enough he saw frannies note by the telephone elizabeth pullios had called with the message that the prosecution was adding may shinn to their witness list re fowler knowledge gun on boat shinn again what did that woman really know was this only the second day he couldnt imagine ever getting to sleep hed already tried twice once a little after midnight then again around two now the clock by his bed read and hed just had a rush of adrenaline remembering how hed been so unsuspecting of strouts testimony and then there had been a snake in it he recognized in a flash what had awakened him tom and josé hed noted their presence both in the courtroom and on the witness list and as hed done with strout had reviewed and reviewed and finally reached the conclusion that neither of the marina guards had anything damaging to say about andy fowler what had jolted him awake was the realization that he was wrong again he had to be wrong pullios wouldnt call them to pass the time of day there must be something there and he hadnt seen it wearily he threw back the covers and padded barefoot to his office we talked to her last night pullios said i think shes tired of all this it does get that way it was nine oclock and hardy was leaning over the prosecution table talking with his opposing counsel about may shinn you want to tell me about her testimony there had been an element of courtesy in pullioss phoning him to let him know they were calling shinn as a witness it made him nervous you know peter struler hes been handling this hes interviewing her today of course you can review the transcript hardy said he planned to but you saw may last night howd you get her to agree to talk to you you know shes very bitter about all this all the litigation the way shes been treated i thought we might make some gesture well sergeant struler did hardy waited you know weve been holding all of her clothes personal items knickknacks things like that from the eloise the sergeant thought we could cut through the red tape and at least get that stuff back to her none of it is evidence here strictly speaking what is evidence here hardy said well her testimony will be pullios smiled sweetly did your client tell you how he found out that the gun was on board exactly where she kept it andy fowler still appeared as exhausted as he had in the office the previous night well theres the missing link if she does it he said hardy kicked the wastebasket it crashed against the wall then fell on its side you knew she knew this all along you knew it jane had come to the courthouse with her father and had accompanied them into their conference room dismas for gods sake a guard opened the door and asked if everything was all right in there hardy told him it was and goodbye fowler seemingly unmoved shook his head she wasnt testifying remember why do you think i didnt want to call her ourselves well now she is how could you not tell me this fowler said nothing then maybe i can talk to her now last night you couldnt though right nice timing on the change of heart goddamn it ive at least got to have the facts andy i cant defend you without them jesus you know that i honestly didnt think it would come up diz hardy put both hands on the table and leaned over well its come up how about that is there anything else you want to tell me that you dont think is going to come up jane cut in dismas come on he turned on her trying to keep his voice under control you know what this is jane your dads right its the missing link there was no way they had firstdegree murder unless he knew the gun was on board without that theres no way they could prove hed premeditated it hed only had two hours of sleep his stomach was churning and his head buzzing with four cups of espresso he had planned this argument as his ace in the hole ready to unleash it during his closing argument it was in fact a crucial point in his finally coming around to a belief in andys innocence he had even asked andy directly early ondid you know the gun was on the boat just like that couldnt have been clearer and he had looked right at him figuring it wouldnt come out and lied just like he had lied about not knowing owen nash no wonder he hadnt wanted may on the stand ill tell you something andy he said im tempted to withdraw dismas you cant yes i can jane youd be surprised fowler wagged his head back and forth nothings changed diz i still didnt do it if it helps you to hear it again i never claimed my behavior with or about may was entirely rational let alone sensible but jane hardy said could you leave us alone a minute its okay honey go ahead fowler told her the door slammed after her but it barely registered listen up here andy hardy said im not stupid yes may has had you offcenter and that may explain a lot but youre also acting like nothings changed above it all still the judge even though you happen to be on trial for your life youre still trying to save face as though nothing you did or didnt do could matter because youre the judge and a fine fellow and you want people to still see you that way forget it andy thats all over youre on trial for murder here trying to save some image so you wont look foolish or bad or whatever to me or anyone else is a total waste and dangerous if theres anything else you want to tell me tell me now it doesnt matter a damn what i think of you what anybody thinks of you i know that goes crossgrain to the way youve lived your life but its true the only thing that matters about you now is that you didnt kill owen nash fowlers eyes were bloodshot i didnt he whispered i dont think you did hardy said thats the only reason im still here hardy had been ready to stipulate that owen nash had been shot on the eloise sometime during the afternoon of saturday june as well as to several other timing and forensic issues pullios wanted to talk to everybody on the witness stand and would stipulate to nothing fowler thought it was because she had few enough facts to work with and without a parade of prosecution witnesses her case would appear to have less factual support so they had to sit and listen to josé relate how the eloise had already been out when hed come on around seven oclock or so on saturday morning and had been back in at its slip the following morning hardy had a point or two on cross he wanted to make sure that when josé and tom had boarded the boat on wednesday neither of them had tampered with it josé told him he hadnt boarded the eloise or seen anyone else near it tom then testified that the marina had been nearly empty all that day the weather had been terrible and he hadnt seen anything of nashs boat it hadnt yet gotten back in by the time he got off for the night when pullios had finished with tom hardy stood up he didnt want the jury to become somehow lulled by unquestioned testimony to his disadvantage even if it appeared unimportant mr waddell he said did you check the eloise on sunday when it was at its slip what do you mean check it go aboard see if it was secured anything like that no i didnt when was the first time you went aboard the eloise that was with you on the following wednesday night i remember and was the cabin to the boat locked when you went aboard no sir in other words anyone could have gone aboard the eloise between sunday and wednesday night objection calls for a conclusion from the witness sustained hardy took a beat he didnt really need it he thought hed made his point and excused the witness he halfexpected pullios to do something on redirect but she let tom go hardy would take it he had read over everything both tom and josé had told either him or glitsky and had found nothing that looked like it could bite him and there hadnt been it gave him some hope emmet turkel combed back his forelock of sandy hair and smiled at pullios a character with a gaptoothed grin the private investigator from new york had an oldfashioned brooklyn accent he had obviously spent many hours on the witness stand just as obviously he admired the looks of the prosecuting attorney the jury noticed and seemed to be enjoying it it was early afternoon and turkel and pullios had chatted about the formers professional relationship with the defendant covering the same ground as his tape andy fowler had hired him by telephone on february turkel had some other business to clear up but he made it out to san francisco by the next wednesday february met with the judge at some fancy pizzeria hey what you folks out here put on a pizza it had taken him turkel said only a few days to find out why may shinn had ended her professional relationship with andy fowler when pullios asked him why that had been he answered it was because she had gotten herself a new sugar daddy hardy had objected and been sustained but the damage was done none of turkels testimony covering fowlers relationship with may his efforts to hide his activities and his character in general put the defendant in anything like a positive light still hardy had at least known what was going to be coming turkel didnt present anything in the first two hours that he hadnt prefigured in his taped interview with peter struler months earlier no surprise but definitely no help pullios had introduced the march page from fowlers desk calendar showing owen nashs name and had it marked as exhibit turkel said that had been the day he had informed fowler of the results of his investigation pullios asked him if mr fowler had given mr turkel any indication of what he was going to do with the information no not then turkel said did he at any time nah not really he was just kidding like you know i dont know mr turkel ill repeat the question did mr fowler say anything about mr nash at any time to you after youd told him he was ms shinns current paramour yeah well we talked again sometime around april may i called him just keeping up contact you know and i ask him does he still have his problem with this guy nash did he want i come out and clear it up for him clear it up yeah you know you asked mr fowler if he wanted you to kill mr nash well you might take it that way but can you tell us mr fowlers exact words please but im telling you we was kidding you know people kid all the time nevertheless mr turkel if you could tell the jury what was said turkel glanced at fowler and shrugged theatrically chomorro slammed his gavel and told him to refrain from the gestures and answer the question turkel sighed i said hey im doin nothin the next couple weeks i could use a vacation fly out there do this guy the judge said no thanks if i want the man disposed of ill do it myself thats clear enough said moses mcguire no jury would buy that you never know what juries are going to think hardy told him yeah but turkel was right people talk like that all the time it never means anything except when it does it was wednesday night not exactly date night but frannie had invited her brother over when hardy got home at seventhirty she poured him a beer told him she was giving him a special dispensation on his noalcoholduringtheweek policy and guided him to his chair in the living room he would be a better lawyer if he could recharge for a while moses would be around in a minute or two they were having a fancy legoflamb dinner and he was going to sit and eat it his plan had been to keep reading reading reading the dailies would be in later tonight probably also may shinns transcript he wanted to go over every word turkel had said chomorro had called it a day after pullios finished with the private investigator and hardy would start crossexamining him tomorrow suddenly he realized enough was enough frannie was right he was too beat to think he finished his beer and lit the fire turned on the christmastree lights and listened to john fahey play some seasonal guitar and now moses was here frannie was humming bustling around between the kitchen and dining room setting a fancy table he was having another beer the claustrophobic feeling that had enveloped him for the past two days was letting up so was the fatigue the real problem he said is that turkels in it period its not so much his testimony although thats bad enough but the fact that andy hired him at all whats the matter with that he wanted to find out what had happened why may dumped him so he hires a private eye would you hire a private eye moses shrugged he was a working judge maybe he didnt have the time personally i dont know what did he tell you thats what he told me but what am i supposed to sell to the jury i mean weve all had relationships end right do we go three thousand miles for a private eye to keep chasing it frannie was in the archway between the living and dining rooms i would chase you to the very ends of the earth she said meanwhile dinner is served shed gone all out the soup was a rich consommé with tapioca and sour cream the lamb stuck with garlic and rubbed with rosemary and lemon juice was served with potatoes and a spinach dish with nutmeg and balsamic vinegar she even had a half glass of the outstanding oregon pinot noir they talked about christmases past mosess memories of his and frannies parents hardys memories of his the trial wasnt there after moses left hardy and frannie cleaned the table and did the dishes together catching up on each other trying out names for the new baby getting back to some teasing would you think i was a terrible human being if i didnt work tonight hardy asked frannies eyes were bright i dont think i could forgive that she put her arms around him how about if i got up early how early real early frannie gave a good imitation of thinking about it so what would you do instead of working i mean maybe go to bed get a little sleep which one real early turned out to be four oclock but he woke up refreshed the growing sense of panic hed been feeling somehow dissipated he got into some running clothes long sweats and a thermal windbreaker and chugged his fourmile course by quarter after five he had showered and dressed and was at his desk with yesterdays dailies and the transcript of may shinns tape with the das office it was every bit as bad as hed feared q you had stopped seeing mr fowler by this time isnt that right a yes i think it was early in march he just caught me at home normally i screen my calls but i was expecting owen so i picked it up q and what did fowler say a he said he was worried about me q why a he said hed heard i was seeing owen i guess hed heard bad things about him or thought he had he said he wanted to make sure i was all right q what did you tell him a i mostly tried to say he was being silly look i didnt want to hurt him then he said if owen ever hurt me in any way i should come to him i could always come to him so you know i was trying to keep it light i told him if anything owen made me feel safer than he ever had at least owen had taken the gun q which gun ms shinn a the gun i never liked to keep it around and id asked andy to take it home with him i hated it in the house but he wouldnt do it being a judge q then what a i told him we put the gun on board the eloise in the desk right next to the bed in case there was an emergency and i needed it but at least it wasnt at home anymore it made me feel safer q and what did the judge did mr fowler say to that a nothing really then he asked me why i had stopped seeing him it was really hard but i told him i was in love with owen q how did he react to that a he said he thought id been in love with him i told him i liked him that he had been very important to me he asked what if owen werent in the picture anymore did i think i could see him again q and what did you say a i said i was sorry but i just didnt think so owen had changed me or i had changed myself i just wasnt the same anymore i was a different person he said if owen wasnt there maybe i would be the way i was feel toward him the way i had i thought owen was always going to be there q its all right ms shinn its okay take your time a i said i didnt know q didnt know what may a what id do if owen wasnt there i couldnt think about that i believed him owen i mean he wasnt going to leave me then andy the judge said what if something happened to owen what would i do then q and what did you say to that a i think i said i didnt know i didnt even want to think about something like that hardy ran into glitsky under the list of fallen policemen in the lobby of the hall of justice it was court went into session in ten minutes and andy fowler had not yet arrived jane was calling his home as she already had done twice since nine oclock there had been no answer either time hardy told abe a little about may shinns damaging testimony maybe fowler just decided to cut and run he wouldnt do that he put up a million dollars bail abe he surrendered his passport glitsky more knowledgeable in such matters smiled you want a new passport give me ten minutes cost you fifty bucks he wouldnt do it a million dollars doesnt stand up against a life in the slammer and for a man like fowler you know how long a judges life is going to be once he gets there thats the good news he wont suffer very long the bad news is hell suffer real hard hes not going there abe right i forgot jane came up shaking her head no you know hardy said your dad is making me old before my time hell get here so will christmas jane glitsky looked at his watch contempt time starts in about three minutes yes mr hardy your honor mr fowler called from a gas station about twenty minutes ago he has car trouble he was taking a cab from where he was it shouldnt be more than a half hour chomorro spent a minute rearranging things on the bench he tried not to betray how angry he was and was not entirely successful ms pullios he asked whats our choice your honor the judge tried to smile at the jury hardy knew this was another prosecution bonanza guilty and late thought he was still a big shot well ladies and gentlemen why dont you all go out and have yourselves another cup of coffee the smile vanished mr hardy if mr fowler is not here at tenoone im going to cancel his bail and put him back in custody is that understood yes your honor to say nothing hardy thought of his own contempt if it turned out that andy had left the country or taken off it wasnt recommended procedure for attorneys to lie to the court as he had just done but what was his option he got up from the defense table and went back through the swinging door to the gallery where jane was sitting next to glitsky who had stayed around to view the proceedings what if he doesnt show abe said thanks abe the thought never occurred to me he looked at his exwife any ideas about what pullios had left the prosecution table and was standing at the end of the aisle from where she just happened to overhear hardy turned quickly around lunch he said were trying to decide between chinese and italian how much had she heard whatever she gave no sign its going to be a long day she said chinese you eat it and a half hour later youre hungry again id do italian her eyes left hardy and went to glitsky hello abe i almost didnt recognize you at the defense side the sergeant nodded tightly the other side was filled up he said pullios decided against whatever she was going to say then moved crisply back through the gallery bitch jane said hardy said nothing he crossed one leg over the other looked at his watch and waited your car broke down the clutch went out you called me from out on lombard and took a cab it was andy fowler strolled up the center aisle as though he had the world by the tail he shook hardys hand and kissed his daughter on the cheek hardy thought hed give him the short version and fill it in later my car is out in the parking lot how about if i had a flat and they fixed it hardy sometimes wondered if the reason he hated to lie was because once you started it got so hard to remember exactly what youd said had he told chomorro it was the clutch or was it just car trouble he knew to keep it simple he probably kept it simple all right it was flat jesus christ andy where the hell were you fowler had an embarrassed look mays he said quietly i finally went to see may before hardy could react the clerk was calling the court to order the jury by and large hadnt left the box it was precisely ten oclock hardy didnt hope to get much out of turkel the private investigator was wearing a turtleneck and a limegreen sports jacket after he was sworn in he again made himself comfortable in the witness chair making eye contact with the jury hardy let him perform awhile wasting time pretending to read his notes at his desk then went to the center of the courtroom mr turkel he began when mr fowler first called you back in february how did he sound objection conclusion sustained hardy tried again can you recall any of the conversation you had exactly turkel still had eyes for pullios but she seemed to have antagonized him somewhat by pushing yesterday the private investigator hated rinkydink testimony especially being forced to give it by the rules of the court he was now giving hardy his full attention well the judge said hi em asked if i was busy and i said yeah a little like i always do he smiled at the jury trade secret pullios spoke up your honor chomorro leaned over just answer the questions sure your honor just like i did yesterday chomorro not getting it nodded thats right hardy thought he did get it a prosecution witness deciding he might be able to do something for the defense cover your ass two ways to sunday go on he said all right then the judge said chomorro interrupted mr turkel please refer to mr fowler either as mr fowler or as the defendant reasonable turkel agreed sure your honor sorry again lets start again shall we hardy said how long have you known the defendant your honor relevance now hardy looked to the jury your honor id like to have mr turkel be able to get in a word of testimony at some point during this crossexamination his relationship with the defendant is relevant if were to understand the context of the actual words used in their discussions together this of course directly related to the testimony yesterday about andy saying hed in effect kill nash but hardy was beginning to think if he could get pullios running she might trip on her own feet chomorro overruled her and turkel got to answer about four years ive known mr fowler about four years in what capacity mostly professional referrals like that but we get along okay we played golf together a coupla times turkel looked at the jury again explaining he saw me wear this nice green coat in court one time figured id won the masters this time chomorro said nothing good hardy turned around fowler was smiling some of the jury would notice that all right so the defendant was rather more than a professional acquaintance but less than a friend objection your honor leading the witness youre allowed to do that on cross ms pullios overruled hardy took a breath and held it here was an eccentric on the stand clearly liked by the jury and for some reason he was being thoroughly harassed by the da one moment your honor hardy went back to his table and pretended to read more notes there really wasnt any testimony of turkels he believed could help his case the bare facts were pretty damning andy had hired him to find out why may had left him then turkel had found out and told him about owen nash and you didnt simply get information for the hell of it once you had it at least the temptation was to do something with it not he thought too much of a stretch for someone to believe that what andy had done was to identify his enemy and why would he do that if he wasnt planning on acting against him still at this moment turkel on the stand somehow had made hardy feel and perhaps the jury as well that andy was a good guy and that the powers arrayed against him were nitpickers and bureaucrats and maybe worse leave it at that he turned around and spoke from the defense desk i have no further questions of this witness as it turned out they went for chinese andy said he was buying which he always did hardy jane and her father caught a cab outside the hall and got to grant street the center of chinatown in about eight minutes all the way up hardy sat silently he didnt know how long he could keep this up the effusive charming andy fowler his client was wearing him down i had to see her he was saying i was certain shed see me tell me why she would want to testify against me what did she say the answers were all there you know how they get you he said in the voice of reason she lost sight of what the prosecution the das office what they were doing what were they doing jane said they had held back a lot of her valuables from the eloise and they put things to her so that the point seemed to be that coming down to be a witness was essentially a formality so that she could get her things back theyve been inundating her with paper i just didnt want her to be taken in misled she told me she did not have anything to say against me she of course knew i hadnt killed owen nash so what could be the problem but now shed promised themhe shook his head so i explained to her the appearance of the connection about me knowing the gun was on the boat the cab arrived at the restaurant and they got into a booth with a curtain the dim sum began to arrive pork bao sharks fin soup pot stickers hardy tasted none of it finally he had to say something you realize andy that if pullios finds out you tried to influence mays testimony all of this will come out making you look even worse than you do now andy seemed unfazed may and i had a good talk she understands now why should it come out a better question is why do you think you can keep it locked up fowler spooned up some soup and said to his daughter this man is too pessimistic and then to hardy listen diz shes a good woman i dont care about her background i know her she is not out to get me to the contrary she is very upset with the prosecution people he continued popping morsels of food this is an eyeopener for me you know when i was on the bench i liked to believe that we not only had an efficient crew out there but that there were certain established rules we differed on the propriety of what i considered entrapment which didnt make me a prosecutors favorite but by and large there was a community of the legal system im finding the generally accepted rules dont apply at least not in this case theyve misled may about the gist of her testimony and they were pretty slipshod too hardy asked what they had done youd think that since they were trading it for her cooperation they would check the inventory and make sure she got everything back but evidently someone with the police had stolen the most important thing to her so even without my intervention shes not inclined to help them anymore shes already talked andy i read the transcript this morning fowler shrugged she wont say the same thing on the stand shell perjure herself to help you fowler took a sip of tea shell say she was coerced at the interview which in effect she was and that under oath she just cant remember hardy cradled his forehead in the palm of his hand lord help me what did they steal jane kept to the essentials her favorite coat fowler said tightening his face nash had given it to her she said it was like a work of art fulllength goosedown he got it in japan for her remarkable design colors hardy had to get back to business so whats she going to say when they call her diz relax its completely understandable think about it theyve got to know shes potentially a hostile witness anyway shes suing the city for gods sake they wont pursue it hardy wasnt at all certain of that but there was no arguing now the deed had been done if fowlers scenario transpired an enormous if then possibly hed helped his case but at what risk so what now if youre going to start seeing her again do me a favor and at least wait until after the trial we didnt even discuss that how did she behave with you hardy asked fowler looked unhappy well to tell you the truth it wasnt very heartening but well it was still good to see her even if it seemed like the old feelings were gone for her as though the whole experience had just worn her down everything she said had gone wrong for her so it shouldnt have been a great surprise that theyd stolen her coat lied to her she gave me the impression that that she thought going on at all with her life was a waste of time the whole question of her testimony didnt seem to matter much but if i thought it would be a help shed try maybe shes looking for something again jane said maybe when this is all over the judge nodded i suppose thats what ive got to hope for and thats why i was late he said turning to hardy i just couldnt leave her that way feeling so down i we just talked i tried to convince her especially if her money comes through that there is a future hardy reached behind him and pulled the curtain signaling for the check wed better get back he said hardy thought the afternoon would have made a root canal look like a walk in the park in furtherance of her consciousnessofguilt theory pullios called a succession of witnesses including two superior court judges several community leaders a city supervisor and fowlers own clerk and all of them testified that andy fowler had told them after the may shinn trial had been canceled but before his own indictment that the first he had heard of owen nash other than reading about him in the newspapers from time to time was after his death he had told one and all that he had no idea that nash had been seeing may shinn the only one hardy saw fit to crossexamine was a pat shields the silverhaired president of the olympic club who had intimated that andy fowler and owen nash as fellow members of the club must have known each other hardy had whispered to fowler at the defense table please tell me you really never knew owen nash fowler said he hadnt and hardy hoping at last he wasnt being lied to stood up mr shields he said how long has mr fowler been a member of the olympic club id say forever certainly longer than myself hes second generation and mr nash wed been recruiting him for years quietly of course but in any event he joined about a year ago so he was in the club for how long a few months a few months he died in june and he joined in when november or december yes i believe so around there and did he come into the club every day well we have two locations you know downtown and the golf course so i couldnt speak for both but as to downtown id say no perhaps once a month six times shields lifted his shoulders lets say between five and ten i didnt count he smiled affably its not like we keep tabs on members hardy turned friendly of course not the times mr nash came in downtown did he come in for lunch or dinner or to work out or what mostly id say lunch although thats just an impression all right well let me ask you this did you ever see mr nash having lunch with mr fowler no do you recall ever seeing mr nash and mr fowler in the club having lunch at the same time no not specifically not specifically do you mean you might have and you dont remember you just have an impression no i mean i didnt see them together or at the same time he glanced at the jury showing signs of nerves it was just a figure of speech of course how about sports squash golf to your knowledge did mr nash play either of these with mr fowler not to my knowledge no well isnt it a fact mr shields that the prosecution here asked you to check your reservations cards for both the golf course out by the ocean and the courts at the downtown location tennis and squash to see if mr nash and mr fowler had reserved time together shields frowned apparently this smacked of keeping tabs on the members even if one of them was on trial for murder members were presumed to be gentlemen and were not to be checked up on yes thats true and did you do that he nodded yes yes i did that and did you find any record that mr nash had ever played any of these sports with mr fowler or even in an approximate time span no in fact mr shields isnt it true that you have no indication whatever that mr nash and mr fowler knew each other or spent time in each others company in any way at all yes i suppose thats true hardy said he had no further questions of course it still didnt prove fowler had not lied to shields about when he had known owen nash or if he had known owen nash at all in fact hardy thought here he had danced around with this man for the better part of a half hour and hadnt really challenged his essential testimony in a substantive way what was there to challenge like the other afternoons witnesses shields was a good man who no doubt was telling the truth fowler was a man charged with murder who was known to have lied in the past hardy could throw up smoke but he doubted he could obscure that fact from the jury glitsky came up through the gallery pushed open the swinging door and strode into the courtroom proper he was a wellknown and respected police officer and his entrance in itself was not unusual that he came to the defense table was though not unprecedented very much out of the ordinary pullios was standing in what had become counsels spot in front of the bench she was beginning to question gary smythe andy fowlers golf partner fellow olympic club member and stockbroker they certainly had done their homework witnesses were coming out of the woodwork glitsky leaned over putting a hand on hardys arm looking up at him he thought hed never seen the sergeant so drawn there was a pallor underneath the pigment of his skin his eyes seemed to have trouble focusing and hardy was reminded of cases of shellshock he had witnessed in vietnam get a recess he whispered weve got to talk now abe glitsky wasnt given to histrionics if he said now he had good reason hardy nodded excuse me he said interrupting pullios who had been in the middle of a question she turned to face him her expression unpleasant yes mr hardy chomorro said your honor an emergency has come up i wonder if the court would grant a short recess your honor pullios fumed ive just begun with this witness ten minutes your honor pullios gave glitsky a questioning look chomorro checked the wall clock if i give you ten minutes now we wont have time on direct here he took in the jury and gave them a weary smile how about if we call it a day today and pick up with mr smythe tomorrow no glitsky said sotto voce to hardy dont let them do that hardy stood that wont be necessary your honor a couple of minutes will do which annoyed chomorro well which is it mr hardy do you want a recess or not he directed himself to glitsky whats this about sergeant care to share it with the court glitsky was clearly torn it was ingrained that cops didnt work with the defense even if there was a personal connection such as he and hardy it got to be too much he shrugged at hardy as much to say he tried then to chomorro and pullios with counsel the judge motioned them all forward and they clustered in front of the raised bench glitsky still looked pale this is unofficial your honor and i apologize for interrupting but ive just come down from homicide yes glitsky took a breath it seems may shinn is dead jesus christ from hardy pullios hung as if poleaxed what and we got two neighbors independently who read the papers watched some tv glitsky turned to hardy both of them say they saw your man there this morning fowler pullios nearly yelled glitsky turned back to her and nodded the same at that moment peter struler pushed open the outer doors and started up the aisle almost running i think this might make it official glitsky said nash mistress found dead homicide not ruled out in apparent suicide by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer may shinn who for a short time last summer was the prime suspect in the murder of owen nash was found dead in her apartment this afternoon apparently a suicide victim the body was discovered by special investigator sergeant peter struler who had had an earlier appointment with ms shinn following a statement she had given yesterday in the murder trial of former superior court judge andrew fowler in spite of the appearance of suicide spokespersons for both the police department and the district attorneys office refuse to rule out homicide as the cause of death following the discovery that mr fowler had visited ms shinn in her apartment this morning jurors in his trial have been sequestered and mr fowler himself has been placed into custody mr fowler had been late to court this morning and had initially told the court hed had car trouble as this paper goes to press the exact time of ms shinns death has not been determined her body was discovered slumped over a makeshift altar in her apartment dressed in the ceremonial white robes of the japanese ritual suicide known as seppuku or more commonly harakiri most other essential forms of that ritual were carried out as well according to police sources see box on back page the altar had been strewn with papers from litigation ms shinn had been involved in related to charges brought against her by the grand jury and the district attorneys office last summer ms shinns attorney david freeman said he was terribly shocked and saddened by the death of his client may shinn has become another victim of the lack of due process in our courts freeman said her illegal premature arrest following the death of the man she loved put her into a downward spiral of depression from which there was no escape one can only hope she has now found some peace as jeff elliot was typing the last words into his computer dismas hardy was drinking what must have been his twentieth cup of coffee he sat no place to go on a yellow bench in the windowless visitors room at the morgue strout was still inside personally doing the autopsy on may shinn locke himself had put in an appearance as had drysdale pullios and of course struler glitsky had come in around eightthirty and stayed to keep him company for a while hardy was not responsive he was still reliving the scene in chomorros chambers after struler had come in with the official word they were in andy fowlers old office but all vestiges of andys old wasp effects had been decorated away the gray berber walltowall had been lifted and hardwood shined up beneath it inca or aztec rugs lay under stuffed furniture in bold latin designs photographs of reagan bush quayle george deukmejian and pete wilson shaking hands with leo chomorro covered the back wall the desk was heavy and black and unlike andys nearly bare on its surface chomorro sat behind it elbows on it hands together pullios leaned arms crossed against the bookshelves struler straddled a foldup chair and glitsky stood by the doorway drysdale sat in one of the chairs next to hardy who tried to appear calm chomorro addressed himself to hardy do you mean to tell me that you knew fowler had been to shinns this morning when you told me he had car trouble no judge not then he told me at lunch and how long were you planning to withhold this information i dont know it was the truth you dont know your client is suborning threatening possibly killing a prosecution witness we dont know that your honor theres no hint of that not yet pullios said in any event you thought you could keep this to yourself at the very least mr hardy im going to have to report this to the state bar he did not threaten her hardy said and struler here says she killed herself it appeared she killed herself struler said quickly fowler didnt kill her pullios looked at him like he didnt kill nash right hardy kept his voice flat thats right bets how about as a change of pace we wait for the coroners report get a fact or two and find out what were dealing with before the accusations start chomorro broke it up regardless of what mr fowler did or didnt do youve got a defendant going to visit a prosecution witness at the very least her testimonys going to be no good shes not giving any testimony pullios said shes dead chomorro shook his head i dont know im inclined to think weve got a mistrial here maybe we ought to start over fresh id agree to that hardy said quickly he could barely admit it to himself but the thought still wouldnt go away had andy killed may but a mistrial wasnt to pullioss liking she thought she had the thing won now hardy couldnt say he blamed her im sorry judge i dont agree she went on to argue that may shinn was only one witness and that her testimony hadnt in the event been suborned if mr hardy will stipulate to the fact that the defendant had known the gun was on board not a chance he said im sure you discussed it in his daughters presence pullios said ill call her shed never testify against her father chomorros black eyes glared shed better or ill hold her in contempt and put her in jail until she does and so it had gone hardy couldnt have jane get on the stand for any reason by some incredible stretch she might mention having known biblically owen nash what was worse the jury knowing about andys preawareness that mays gun was on board or another reason he might have had to want nash dead in the end chomorro had decided on his strategy to keep fowler in custody at least until it had been determined that may shinn had or had not killed herself the jury which up to now had been allowed to return to their homes under the stricture that they not discuss the case with anyone were to be sequestered in a hotel until that question was settled so that this development would not prejudice them against the defendant glitsky finally saw fit to interject a thought fowlers clothes should be tested for fibers hairs semen and blood he was a homicide cop if there had been a killing he didnt want the evidence to get thrown away this time pullios told him that was a good idea and he told her he knew it was investigating murders was what he did when people let him the door to the visitors room opened it was after tenthirty and hardy looked up halfexpecting to see strout coming in to tell him that may had in fact been murdered that the knife wounds were inconsistent with what could be selfinflicted instead he looked into the basset face of david freeman who asked politely if he could sit down ah mr hardy just came to pay my respects he said in the past months hardy had had two interviews with freeman in his office regarding the testimony he was going to give for the prosecution nominally adversarial the two men both had maverick streaks which they recognized in each other and which hardy felt formed a bond of sorts that at this point was still unacknowledged strout still in with her freeman asked hardy nodded considered a moment then decided to speak his mind you know he said i wish youd taken this case when andy first asked you freeman shook his head i dont think youve lost it its not over until the jury comes in hardy raised his eyes thats what they say particularly if andy didnt kill may i think theyre reaching if they think he did he was there at mays this morning hardy was testing freeman shrugged i was there two days ago does the jury know it do they need to know it hardy grabbed the nugget at this point hed take anything from any source why do you think theyre reaching i mean beyond wanting a conviction in their previous four hours of discussions hardy thought he had adequately covered the trial ground with freeman but he was beginning to realize that freeman tended to answer only what he had been asked and hardy had stuck to fowlers actions as they related to the consciousnessofguilt theory he had all but ignored may shinn the person thinking she had fallen out of the loop now he was no longer sure of that because may was depressed she was suicidal i spent over an hour last night trying to talk her out of killing herself why was she so depressed i think thats obvious dont you not just a coat coat oh that no that just might have been the last straw just another reminder that she couldnt hope for anything anymore thats why she first called me i guess upset over it being stolen but the depression itself thats been going on since the summer she was in love with owen nash believed she was after he died she lost what shed put her hopes in what had kept her going then to be put on trial for his murder hardy shook his head still testing i dont know what she told you but she didnt love owen nash or so farris had said no no youre wrong there why do you say that same as with fowler you dont take money from someone you love not for sex anyway she didnt take money from nash she never did that stopped hardy cold what she never took money from him what about the will what about it the will was a will i think it started out as more of a gesture but when owen died i mean wouldnt you pursue two million dollars hardys head was beginning to throb again he reached for the cup of now cold coffee on the table next to him why had he always assumed that owen was paying may shinn had it been ken farris whod told him that early on had farris been lying no freeman was going on may did love owen nash theres no doubt about that and ive come to believe he told her he loved her too he was wearing her ring when he was found she was a lovable woman clearly true look what shed done to andy fowler may obviously had more substance than hed given her credit for but she certainly had deceived andy fowler and he reminded freeman of this freeman nodded as if this were old news that was before owen nash before nash she did whatever was expedient she told me this certain clients you can become like a confessor to them psychologist devils advocate a dependency develops hardy remembering celine didnt need a reminder of that in mays case she and i actually became pretty close we were doing a lot of work together at hardys glance freeman went on and no we werent sleeping together anyway something very real seems to have happened with may and owen who were both pretty cynical to begin with they changed each other for the better what does that mean may dropped her old lovers andy fowler for example could be she might have been able to scam owen along like shed done with men before but she wanted to clear the slate and nash i gather it was pretty much the same except of course he had a wider circle and more responsibilities it might have taken longer to put into effect this decision to go public with their intended marriage for example hardy remembered that farris had said that owen had changed in the last months of his life was that the explanation you really think they were going to get married i do yes and im not too easily conned hardy had never seriously considered that and why more than anything was that because ken farris had told him may and owen were definitely breaking up it brought him up short wondering what else hed overlooked or ignored his good friend and very competent investigator abe glitsky had supposedly checked the alibi of ken farris but now the thought occurred that in this one area pullios may have been right abe might have been so burned by the false arrest of may that his heart wasnt into pursuing the leads in this case as he otherwise might have he had after all not followed up the unidentified fingerprint on the murder weapon while struler had done so he hadnt discovered the private eye emmet turkel hardy found himself wondering if abe had actually flown to taos or only made a few phone calls owen nashs death had left ken farris in sole charge of a million empire unencumbered now by a controlling eccentric might not that be worth killing for something ring a bell freeman asked mildly maybe they heard footsteps and were both standing by the time strout opened the door yall want to come in he said the body lay covered on a gurney in the chilled room strout led the way and pulled back the sheet from over her face it struck hardy how young she had been her face without makeup or expression was one of a young girl sleeping freeman moved closer to the gurney traced a finger along the line of mays jaw lifted the sheet further and looked down at her body grimacing strout and hardy backed away where are her clothes hardy asked bagged and gone theyre checking for fabrics hairs stains sop a waste of time why because there is no doubt this woman killed herself hardy felt the fatigue leave in a rush the clock up over the freezers said it was past eleven and suddenly his client had at least been proclaimed innocent of committing this murder because in fact it wasnt a murder somehow he felt the case had turned fowler hadnt killed may it made no rational difference in this case about nash and yet it seemed to matter a great deal in everything andy fowler had done hardy saw evidence of confusion concern for his reputation a misdirected vision that he could somehow plug eleven holes with ten fingers but what he didnt see suddenly and with clarity was a murderer andy did impulsive things and then made up foolish stories to cover up how foolish he had been he was a man out of his depth with his emotions what andy had not done was plan the coldblooded killing of another man somebody else had done that someone cold efficient and organized with neither remorse nor emotion in fact the murderer of owen nash was close to the polar opposite of andy fowler jeff elliot knew that in the old days six months ago before he met dorothy he would have been waiting at the morgue until the results came in on the postmortem so he could have a chance to make the morning edition but tonight he had written his piece proofed and filed it and headed home other stories around the hall of justice were getting attention now one concerned a cat the das had bought to control the influx of mice that had started to show up in the building in the wake of the construction for the new jail the cat had been named arnold mousenegger and had already gotten several graphs in the chronicle a quote of the day from chris locke arnold is a budgetary godsend we couldnt afford to exterminate the whole building and an appearance on channel hot stuff and owen nash was still as dead as hed ever been andy fowler was in jail and wasnt about to get out to kill anybody else tonight the trial proceeded at its own pace jeffs work would keep until the morning dorothy had been asleep but got up to greet him when he opened the door she poured them both glasses of domestic white wine while sitting on the bed he took his clothes off the telephone rang and without thinking he picked it up jeff this is dismas hardy and im doing you a favor you still awake dont you have a trial in the morning good lawyers never sleep and i wanted you to be the first to know on the record that strout has ruled may shinn a suicide andy fowler did not kill her nobody killed her she killed herself department of redundancy department jeff said suicide means she killed herself hardy thanked him sincerely for the lesson in grammar dorothy came over and placed the wineglass on the table next to the phone she sat next to him and rubbed his shoulders is this solidjeff asked horses mouth the horse being strout im still at the morgue i thought youd like to know jeff hesitated a moment it meant he wasnt going to sleep for a few more hours ive already filed the first edition hey hardy said its not even midnight dont you guys just stop the presses rip out the front page maybe if arnold mousenegger had four confirmed kills in one day everybody knew about arnold by the way hardy asked you still willing to dig a little if i can find a likely hole by the way huh it just occurred to me im sure it did but yeah i guess so what is it im not sure yet ill let you know when jeff hung up he took a sip of his wine and kissed dorothy sorry he said when news breaks she kissed him back when you win the pulitzer she said ill forgive you for this dismas youve got to get some sleep frannie looked very pregnant standing in his office doorway what time is it hardy stretched afraid to check his watch time is for wimps he said she came behind his desk and put her arms around him leaning into his back how will you be able to think tomorrow tomorrows friday he said good actually today is friday does that mean anything it means tomorrow i can catch up on some sleep tonight ive got to catch up on these dailies he held up a thick pile of typed pages two days worth i took last night off remember he rested his head back against her remember she messed his hair i remember very well but still andy fowler didnt kill may he said she killed herself just like it looked frannie straightened up well thats good i guess its good though why the idiot went to mays house she shushed him dont get going she said do your reading come to bed now a few more pages promise the first thing he had to do in the morning was call ken farris and get some answers if he didnt like the answers he would call jeff elliot back maybe even hire his own emmet turkel and do a number on a weekend in taos last june he also had to remember the questions they kept flitting in and out and he found himself making a list while he tried to read the dailies from two days before which now seemed like two months with all that had happened since theyd testified he barely remembered tom waddell and josé ochorio much less what theyd said or why it might be relevant the yellow pad with his notes said nash paying may records on another line the words specifics of on changes how was he different then breaking up why ring the notion that may had been honest throughout put a very different light on everything that had happened hardy started another pad intending to begin with the assumption that may and owen had in fact loved each other he would go through his first file folders the ones hed copied so long ago over the weekend and review every word shed said he wrote a few words on the may pad then jumped to the dailies he had to turn back to see who was talking tom or josé he reminded himself tom was the afternoon guy the kid hed met that first day he grabbed the early folder opening it to glitskys interrogations of them both intending to start over get a fresh grip on the facts again he hadnt slept in twenty hours now he was reading about josé seeing may shinn leaving the boat on thursday but josé was the morning guy so he couldnt have seen may on thursday morning it must have been wednesday which made no sense because may said shed gone to the boat on thursday so hardy quick went back to the pad with the may questions he looked back oh it must have been tom after all whod said it one of the folders was open to tom frannie was right you couldnt work if you couldnt think and hardys brain had just shifted to off enough he couldnt keep it all straight what seemed like only seconds later he was in bed the telephone was ringing in his ear and it had gotten light wake you up glitsky asked brightly hardy looked at the clock no he said i was just sorting my socks i like to get it done before the weekend this is what time real working people get up glitsky said besides i thought you might have hung around downtown to find out what strout decided strout decided may shinn killed herself he started to tell abe about last night a little of his talk with freeman frannie came in with a cup of hot coffee and hardy still talking swung himself up to sit on the side of the bed so freeman says they were really planning to get married he concluded how does that grab you glitsky was silent a long moment nash was wearing the ring wasnt he right there on his finger and he wasnt wearing it the last time farris saw him if farris wasnt lying hardy went on to describe a few of the inconsistencies hed come across in the last twelve hours so what do you think its something to think about abe said especially if youre convinced farris lied hardy fully awake sipped his coffee this whole business has made me be not positive of anything abe first im not positive may was in love with owen or viceversa the difference is now im willing to consider it and once i do that it opens this other can of worms preconceptions are my favorite yeah theyre a good time hardy was still on his earlier problem i guess the only thing im positive of is that if may didnt lie then ive got myself a passel of rethinking to do over the weekend well you know abe said im busy but im here it was an offer hardy knew didnt come easy but abe had his own reasons too as had happened with hardy months before when pullios took his case away it rankled hardy thought a minute it had to be something abe the police had access to and he didnt you could find out who took the coat he said i mean maybe they took something else one of your guys no response hey abe you there sure i thought you were talking to frannie no abe i was talking to you you were talking to me about a coat hardy caught up to where abe must be then ran it down to him abe could check over the inventory on the eloise find if a member of the department had taken mays coat apply a little pressure find out if some evidence had been misplaced diz abe said our guys dont steal from crime scenes i mean if they do weve got to go to internal affairs but they dont hardy drank more coffee its someplace to look see if something jumps out at you maybe although of course id never suggest you do this you could have an offtherecord chat with the guys who were there taking the inventory of what was on the eloise right i could never do that i know hardy said and as i said id never ask hardy had tried farris at his home and gotten his answering machine at his office he got another answering machine and left a message hearing a couple of beeps as he did so there was a concept he thought recording the answering machine recording department of redundancy department indeed he felt like a receptionist as soon as hed finished leaving his message at owen industries for farris to call him at home and leave a number where he could be reached his telephone rang again grand central station he said picking it up what are we going to do about clothes it was jane she told hardy that theyd taken her fathers suit for the lab tests and what was he going to wear to court today hardy told her to swing by her fathers house get him a decent change and meet him downtown at eightfifteen enough time to change and try to determine where they would try to go today with what he figured would be by now the most hostile jury in the history of jurisprudence angry at having been locked up themselves since jeff elliots article had made the morning edition like the rest of the world jane knew for certain now that her father hadnt killed may this time when he hung up frannie poked her head in his office in keeping with your popularity this morning she said your daughter would appreciate a short audience hardy glanced at the pile on his desk the two days worth of dailies the binders and notepads the cassettes he raised his eyes back to his wife she was smiling but did not appear particularly amused the beck appeared on her still wobbly legs next to frannie seeing hardy she lit up like the christmas tree held out her hands yelled da da da and started to run toward him tripping on her own feet and pitching headlong into the front of his desk hardy was up and around before frannie could get to her he picked her up holding her against him rubbing the red spot on her forehead where the bump would come up kissing her he hugged and rocked her its okay beck its okay honey daddys here everythings all right he took the dailies with him hed have to find the time to review them maybe during lunch maybe while andy was getting dressed he and jane had delivered the new suit upstairs leaving it at the guards desk with instructions for delivery then hed asked her if she could leave him to his reading until ninefifteen half a precious hour later he got settled in their little conference room took the binders from his huge lawyers briefcase and spread them out intending to start where hed left off last night or with where he thought hed been toms testimony about may coming to the eloise on thursday but he couldnt find it after the first pass through every word tom had said to him glitsky or the court hardy rubbed his hands over his eyes and wondered if he had finally lost his mind maybe he wasnt cut out for this kind of pressure he ought to buy a boat and move to mexico start a fishing fleet not by bread alone he thought no sleep too sleep ought to come into the picture he wondered if pullios was sleeping should he hire someone to call her every hour around the clock level out the field he forced himself back all right it wasnt in toms testimony where it should have been how about josés finally he found it at the end of glitskys initial interview with josé but that was wrong it had to be wrong hardy reread the transcript josé answering when glitsky asked if he remembered exactly what may had been doing when hed seen her a i dont know she was out there on the street walking back to her car maybe i dont know i see her going away q and youre sure it was may a si it was her q are you certain what day it was it could be very important pause a i think it was thursday oh sure it must have been i remember i got the note from tom hed locked the boat which was wednesday right so i go check it its still locked thursday im sure si thursday had may mentioned going back to the eloise twice on thursday for some reason because tom and josé had both seen may on thursday hardy had been assuming it was the same sighting but it couldnt have been josé was there in the morning and thats when he saw her later that same afternoon tom said that he saw her there again hardy pulled another legal pad and wrote a heading on the top questions for freeman someone who had talked to may more frequently might be able to supply answers under his heading he wrote number of visits thursday it didnt even matter or rather he couldnt figure why it might matter but he was starting to believe that nothing here was irrelevant hardy walking next to jane got to the courtroom as celine was coming up as she had taken to doing she looked right through him maybe that was the best way she could handle it he thought probably it was best for him too if they were going to be seeing each other on a daily basis it would be easier better if she avoided communication but here they were face to face he reached for her arm and stopped her she froze hardy backed off a step and apologized i just wondered if youd heard from ken farris lately she tried to gain control i spoke to him last night i asked him about the shinn womans claim now that she was dead at hardys uncomprehending stare she quickly with annoyance added the two million dollars hardy had never had any indication that celine gave a damn about the money he was interested in farris wanted to locate him so he was home he wasnt out of town i think i just said that thats right you did she didnt want to talk to him and he wouldnt force it he was after all defending the man on trial for her fathers murder if you talk to him again would you tell him id like a word with him she looked him over glanced at jane came back to him certainly she said now if youll excuse me jane almost protectively took hardys arm holding him as they watched her walk away as she opened the courtroom doors celine turned back to look again seeing hardy janes arm through his from her perspective he realized that this attractive woman who had been at his side since the trial started was at least a new girlfriend celine knew it wasnt his wife whom shed seen twice at their house more reason for her to be hostile he thought celine must believe he had lied to her that he had decided to stop seeing her not because he was married but because he had found someone new when fowler was led in jane squeezed hardys arm oh my god he was wearing the clothes jane had brought but he looked more like a bum wearing a borrowed suit everything seemed to hang wrong the tie wasnt tightened and his top button was undone the pants beltless fell over his shoes his hair didnt look like it had been washed or combed his eyes were redrimmed he patted his daughters hand after the guard led him to the table smiling weakly he told her and hardy that he was all right he would be fine mays death had hit him hard that was all jane did her best to get him fixed up before they brought the jury in tie top button hair when the disgruntled jury started to file in she went back to the gallery and everybody waited for the judge chomorros first order of business was to apologize to the jury for the need to sequester them at the end of the day yesterday we had an extraordinary set of circumstances develop and i determined that having put all of you through as much of this as weve already done we would try our best to keep those efforts from being wasted in a mistrial in brief i will tell you that a central prosecution witness in this case may shinn committed suicide yesterday this was not news to anyone in the gallery so there wasnt the expected buzz but hardy could see the effect it had on the jury each of them some more obviously than others scanned the defense table at the time there was considerable media conjecture as you might imagine as to how this development related to the case we are hearing now and my purpose in having you sequestered was to keep you from that exposure i apologize for the need to have done that but in my view it was essential to keep this trial on track that stricture has now been eased and i will be letting you go to your homes for the weekend however let me admonish each and every one of you again do not discuss this case or the evidence you are considering with anyone while we are still in this proceeding chomorro took a sip from a glass of water you are probably going to be unable to avoid hearing opinions about the defendants relationship with ms shinn you may also hear that mr fowler visited ms shinn yesterday morning i must make it clear to you however that these two events mr fowlers visit and ms shinns death are causally unrelated and for the purpose of this trial not relevant the coroner has issued an unequivocal verdict of death by suicide for ms shinn the police department has already determined from their investigations that there is no evidence linking mr fowler to ms shinns death in light of that i instruct you to disregard any rumors or opinions you might come across that purport to establish that link there is no factual basis for it chomorro stopped again hardy patted the back of fowlers hand and got a wan smile in return the judge took another sip of water now moving along counsel for both parties here have stipulated to the facts ms shinn was to present in her testimony chomorro stopped reading and made eye contact with the jury you may want to take notes as the facts you are about to hear may possibly not make the impression they would if you heard them recited by a witness on the stand he adjusted his glasses and again looked down at the desk in front of him one you are to take as an established fact that ms shinn spoke to mr fowler in march and told him that she had removed the murder weapon peoples exhibit one from her apartment and kept it stored in the desk next to mr nashs bed aboard the eloise from the reaction the jury understood the significance of this fact even without ornamentation it was a compelling point but hardy had decided there was nothing he could do about it those points were on the board hardy put them behind him he had fought for the phrasing of the rest of the stipulation and sat forward in his chair waiting for it two chomorro continued it is also a fact that during that same conversation mr fowler asked ms shinn if she would consider reestablishing their relationship fowlers and shinns if she stopped seeing mr nash hardy let out the breath hed been holding that was better than if something happened to mr nash chomorro kept reading ms shinn answered that she did not know and could not say she did say she loved owen nash and that mr fowler had been someone she felt very close to hardy winced inwardly at the emphasis pullios speaking in a relaxed tone was nonetheless teeing off on gary smythe fowlers broker and sometimes golf partner was clearly reluctant to give what he thought was testimony damaging to his friend ironically this worked in pullioss favor if he were openly excoriating fowler the jury might have reason to think there was a grudge against andy something personal he was paying back and enjoying but to the contrary every word was wrung out of him which provided strong credibility to what he said pullios was enjoying herself as well she might hardy thought after the events that had begun with andy showing up late in the courtroom mays death the sequestering of the jury chomorros admonition to the jury this morning and finally the stipulations about mays testimony freeman may have told him the previous night that he thought he still could win it and with the new questions he had for farris and the marina guards hardy was the most convinced hed been of fowlers innocence but right now he knew he was losing the jury while pullios had the floor mr smythe i show you here the may sixteenth page from the desk calendar of the defendant showing the initials on and the word eloise she entered the page into evidence as peoples exhibit then went back to the witness on or about may sixteenth did you have a discussion with mr fowler about mr nash yes smythe didnt like it tell us the substance of that discussion well it wasnt much chomorro leaned over from the bench try not to characterize what it was mr smythe just tell us what was said smythe nodded was silent for a minute then tried again judge fowler and i have been active in fundraising for a long time i mentioned to him i had received an invitation to a charity event that owen nash was sponsoring aboard his boat and he asked me if i could get him an invitation we could doubleteam him and how did you respond i thought it was a good idea and you got him an invitation yes so did both of you go no as it turned out neither of us did i became sick and andy decided not to did he say why he so decided after going out of his way to get the invitation smythe looked at fowler then down at his lap he was having a hard time back then he didnt feel like going out a hard time personally hardy got up objecting and was sustained so what happened to your fundraising plans with mr nash you have to understand these things go on continuously theyre fluid in their timing but i was a little disappointed that neither andy judge fowler that neither of us had taken advantage of such an opportunity and i said as much to andy he paused looking again at his friend at the defense table andy said he had other reasons to talk with owen nash anyway and he promised hed get to him within a month pullios hung on him for a beat then turned to the jury he promised hed get to him within a month she repeated then to hardy your witness mr smythe hardy said to your knowledge did mr fowler ever meet mr nash face to face no did mr fowler ever tell you he had made an appointment with mr nash to discuss anything aboard the eloise or anywhere else no he did not did you have occasion to talk to mr fowler between may sixteenth and june twentieth the day owen nash died oh yes we talked almost every day you talked almost every day do you recall if mr nashs name came up between may sixteenth and june twentieth well the one discussion i told ms pullios about and after that no no you dont recall or no it didnt come up i dont recall it coming up if he had made an appointment with mr nash dont you think he would have told you objection pullios said speculation it was sustained as hardy had known it would be but that was okay with him he continued id like to clarify this on may sixteenth mr fowler despite having an invitation did not go to the eloise thats true at no time during the following month did he mention either making an appointment with owen nash or going to the eloise right so if i may summarize the facts elicited in your testimony mr smythe to your personal knowledge mr fowler never met mr nash and never boarded the eloise thats correct not to my knowledge is it a fact mr smythe that mr fowler promised as you said that he would get to owen nash within a month of may sixteenth smythe frowned yes he did say that so the fact is that he told you he was going to do it it is not a fact that he actually did it in fact you are aware of no evidence at all that he did do it isnt that true yes thats correct pullios had narrowed down her witness list to david freeman and maury carter the bail bondsman after lunch she was obviously going to close things up for the prosecution with the character issue leaving the jury with the impression that andys consciousness of his guilt over the murder was the only possible explanation for his actions chomorro had made it clear he was going to allow all the testimony in this vein hardy looked forward to having freeman on the stand although his testimony would get into evidence the bare facts of andys unethical behavior as a lifetime defense lawyer he would be instinctively opposed to pullios hardy had of course talked with him several times during the two months he had been preparing for the trial and in those discussions freeman had seemed genuinely distressed by his upcoming role as a prosecution witness but facts were facts andy fowler had hired him to defend may shinn freeman had told andy flat out in fowlers own chambers that in his opinion he had no option but to recuse himself from the case now that it had turned up in his courtroom he had arranged with maury carter for the bail in freemans long career he had told hardy he had never seen a judge do anything like what andy fowler had done of course he wasnt going to put it like that on the stand but fowlers actions had been so incredible to freeman that they beggared description however last night he had also indicated to hardy that hardy hadnt lost the case yet and that had been before theyd been certain may had killed herself when things had looked even worse was he perhaps planning some emphasis in his testimony to make it less damning than it seemed on the face of it chomorro decided that andy fowler could be readmitted to bail and now the subdued exjudge and his daughter made clear they did not want to be with his attorney and went off to lunch by themselves which at the moment suited hardy just fine did you get a chronology of may for the whole week hardy asked freeman of course hardy and freeman were talking in the hallway it would not do for the two of them to spend an hour lunching at lous just before freeman went on the stand for pullios so hardy took advantage of what camouflage there might be out in the open halls do you remember her going to the eloise freeman looked like he had slept in the clothes he had worn at the morgue the previous night yes not a smart move why did she tell you she did it theyre not going to ask me about this you know pullios is going to want to know about judge fowler hiring me not about may shinn hardy didnt want to push but neither did he intend to back down its for me not pullios i want to know about may shinn he said all right but im not sure why it matters when if or why may shinn went to the eloise ill tell you what she told me okay his eyes searched the hallway perhaps looking for members of the prosecution team then he came back to hardy she read about herself linked to nash in the chronicle on thursday morning the first day it was speculated that the mystery hand might be nashs she was afraid that theyd try to find something to tie her to him a very justified fear as it turned out she knew her gun was on the eloise and she decided shed come down and remove it before the investigation heated up but when she went there it was the middle of the day and she realized shed be recognized even worse somehow be connected to what had happened so she would come back later when it was dark or when no one was around but by that time the police had closed it off hardy stood with his arms folded filtering thinking how did she know she could get aboard did she have a key good it was as though freeman had been through all of this before was checking hardy on his thought processes no she did not have a key that was one of the other things that stopped her aside from the recognition factor were assuming everything she said was true now isnt that right i believed her two things one it wasnt unknown for nash to forget to lock up and two if hed been killed on board which in fact he had been perhaps the killer didnt have a key or forgot to lock up may thought that was likely more than that hardy thought it was true the eloise had not been locked on wednesday night when he had gotten to it all right hardy said so here is my question did may tell you she also came down early thursday morning no why would she have done that same reasons well then why would she have come back i dont know freeman paced away a step or two he recalled something else how early that whole week she was a wreck once she finally got to sleep she sometimes slept until noon hardy shook his head no it was way before then right about when the morning guard was coming on say seventhirty he said he saw somebody more than that he said he saw may on the eloise no walking away close up positive id neither hardy saying it realized what it meant freeman said well to answer your original question may told me she went down to the eloise one time thursday afternoon to see if she could get the gun a thought occurred to hardy maybe she knew fowlers prints were on it and she was going down to protect him freeman shook his head impatiently she wasnt protecting fowler he didnt matter to her anymore much as it might pain him to hear it i wouldnt bring up that particular point on cross you got something here dont you if i do i dont know what it is yesterday when i hadnt believed may everything seemed tight today hardy lifted his shoulders i dont know the board tilted and ive got a new angle and now some of the pieces dont fit im trying to decide which angles the right one the right one is the one that gets your client off that may wasnt lying but to freeman that had already been asked and answered he moved closer to hardy in any event i hope youve written your eleveneighteen he was referring to section of the california penal code a motion for directed verdict of acquittal by which the judge directed the jury to return a verdict to acquit true this section was almost automatically invoked by defense attorneys after the prosecution rested in every trial but especially in cases such as this one in which the evidence might be deemed insufficient to sustain a conviction just as automatically the motion was nearly always denied but freeman was making it clear that in this case he believed it had a chance hardy said he was filing the motion but didnt hold out much hope for it neither did freeman it seemed chomorro doesnt have the experience this is his first big trial hes got to leave it for the jury having said that he raised his hands palms up but the law is a wonderful thing and you just never know hardy had another twenty minutes before court reconvened he went upstairs to the fourth floor found glitsky alone in the homicide room chewing on his damned ice and hunched over his desk reading he looked up now you were wrong he said hardy pulled a chair up against his desk im listening there was no coat glitsky shoved the paper he was reading at hardy check it out anybody comes in while youre looking be smart right this sheet here he said putting a finger on it is the inventory down to the rubberbands in the desk diz its complete of the master suite on the eloise this other one is the list struler got from may all of her stuff what she wanted returned to her in exchange for testifying why didnt they just subpoena her glitsky chewed some ice swallowed i guess they thought this would make her more agreeable he shook his head but guess what hardy was scanning the list yeah he said absently hey you know this happens all the time you get somebody suing the city and thinks they can get an extra fur coat or something out of the deal put it on the list say we stole it it was there but he hit the sheet again surprise it wasnt there its why we make our day one inventories this was going backward again hardy wasnt going to entertain it may didnt lie abe thats where were at he understood glitsky being upset with may shinn she had after all named him personally in her suit for false arrest and hadnt she lied to him about not going to japan hadnt that been what moved him to arrest her okay all of the above hardy said but she thought this coat was there she called david freeman about it mentioned it to fowler when he came by she jumped all over struler wouldnt you wouldnt i what if you had a scam like this wouldnt you play it up hardy couldnt agree he was going to run with the idea of may telling the truth until he got to a wall this might not make sense in the face of it but it wasnt yet a wall still glitsky was on his side and he wanted to keep him there maybe he conceded but either way this helps it doesnt help me everywhere i look theres more of nothing you find anything about farris no i got a call in speaking of whichhe grabbed glitskys telephone and pushed some buttons lunch break he told frannie any calls when he hung up he shook his headnothing he out of town or what hardy shrugged probably just busy plus im not on his side anymore remember im defending nashs killer now if you wanted no way ive already done him up and down if you get a line on some physical evidence ill see what i can do but now youve got shinn telling the truth and farris lying for no apparent reason neither of which i think i buy i know farris didnt kill nash he was in taos youre barking up the wrong tree hardy didnt argue he knew better than to push any further all right maybe hell call me back if something pops though im going to call you glitsky finished chewing his ice loudly that knowledge gives meaning to my life he said can i have these hardy asked gathering the inventories not only can you have them glitsky replied you must have them i had to wait all morning for the office to empty out so i could make you some copies hardy tapped his palm against glitskys cheek youre such a sweet guy he said dont ever change glitsky growled i wasnt planning to fowler and jane were sitting at the defense table when hardy entered the courtroom at onetwenty celine was already at her spot on the aisle in the second bench he found himself slowing down coming abreast of her then forced himself along through the swinging doors fowler didnt look much better hardy pulled up his chair and placed a hand on his back you holding up jane on the other side of her father gave hardy a worried look he forced a show of enthusiasm weve got a couple of interesting developments im a fool diz been one all along physically andys eyes looked better the redness had gone down the black bagginess under them had receded but the expression in them or rather the lack of it was almost more unsettling she never cared a damn at all did she why beat around about it no hardy said no i guess she didnt andy jane frosted him from across her father but he ignored it now how about you stop having to suffer for what shes done to you shes gone didnt you tell jane once you just had to treat it as though it was a friend that died well now thats what it is she lied to me hardy was getting tired of the explanation to himself as well that may lied as the answer for everything did she or did you lie to yourself jane fairly hissed at him dismas you know andy he pressed on maybe you just needed more that was all she gave you what you were paying for which was a fantasy and youre a guy judge who can make things happen maybe even make your fantasy come true you werent like the other guys the lesser types whose lives passed through your hands every day dismas stop it jane said it loud enough this time that several jury members looked their way hardy saw the reaction and gave a controlled nod in that direction he lowered his voice the fantasys over judge youre reduced to being a mortal i cant say i blame you for crying over it but at least its a real place to start fowlers eyes had gotten something back in them anger or hatred or both either hardy thought was better than nothing youre a big help dismas thanks a lot at least jane had modulated her voice fowler straightened up dont tell me i dont want her back you dont know hardy nodded youre right andy i dont know what i do know is that you never had a chance to get her back because you never had her in the first place what do you suppose this is doing dismas jane asked its all right hon fowler told her hardy kept at it damn straight its all right you ask what its doing jane i dont know maybe im getting a little tired of wading through all of this while the ol judge here sails on overhead he spoke to his client andy im sorry but youre not some tragic hero i cant just sit here and watch you waste away over some fairy tale youve concocted thats pretty well destroyed everything youve worked for hardy softened his voice put his hand on fowlers back the womans dead andy shes not coming back its time to wake up and this is your wakeup call david freeman famed defense counsel was the centerpiece of the prosecutions case and elizabeth pullios knew it thus far they had established beyond any doubt reasonable or otherwise that andy fowler had been devastated by may had hired a private investigator to find out why she had stopped seeing him had found out it was because she had fallen in love with owen nash or acted like she did and had kept a surveillance on the movements of nash for the next several months until the mans murder to nearly everyone he knew except for gary smythe he had told less than the truth had indeed lied about owen nash he knew the location of the gun on the boat and his fingerprints were on it he was an expert sailor in his own right and could easily have taken the eloise in and tied it up after dark even in rough water all that established however hardy still thought the jury would have a difficult time bringing in a murder verdict especially after fowler testified for himself assuming hardy could move him to do so so far everything the judge had done a couple of white lies a more or less natural curiosity to understand more about why a lover as perceived by him had tired of him a plausible explanation of how fingerprints came to be on the murder weapon could be explained hardy hoped by the overriding fact that he had merely wanted to keep an illicit and embarrassing relationship secret up to now hardy believed none of this showed sufficient consciousnessofguilt to prove anything to secure a conviction when david freeman took the stand however all that would change in spite of freemans private support it was going to get ugly hardy thought he was prepared to object to every question if need be and if the jury didnt like him for it so be it the bare facts of freemans testimony would be damning enough he at least wanted to try to contain any interpretation of them pullios playing affable and deferential began to walk freeman gently through some establishing testimony then commenced zeroing in on the events of the previous june mr freeman do you know the defendant yes for how long ive known the judge for many years he didnt so much as glance at hardy would you say you were friends weve had a courteous professional relationship we dont see each other socially sort of like me and you he smiled she smiled the jury seemed to like it last june did your relationship change yes how the judge hired me chomorro mr freeman were all aware that the defendant was a judge in this court for accuracys sake please refer to mr fowler either by his name or as the defendant freeman said it was a habit he was sorry and what did mr fowler hire you to do to defend may shinn who had been charged with killing owen nash chomorros gavel came down with a crash hardy suppressed a smile nice dave he thought mr freeman restrict your answers to the questions asked im sorry your honor i thought that was what was asked but there it was in the record pullios could not very well object since she had asked the question there was nothing to do but press on mr fowler hired you to defend may shinn who as you say was charged with murder thats right were you surprised by his request not at first this was a wrinkle hardy had not expected in his deposition freeman had said he was stunned by it now he was not surprised at first pullios went with it why not at first sometimes the court will want to check out a couple of defense firms before giving a criminal assignment see if they might be overloaded that type of thing but that wasnt the case here no what was the case here well the judge excuse me the defendant wanted to hire me as a private person to defend ms shinn yes and was that unusual id say yes it was was there anything else unusual about the arrangements hardy stood at his table objection overbroad sustained pullios tried again was ms shinn to know about this arrangement hardy was up again conclusion from the witness and hearsay pullios might be getting it out but it was going to be pulling teeth she smiled tightly can you describe to us the conversation you had with the defendant regarding her defense up to a point yes freeman said he spoke directly to the jury after i accepted the job of course mr fowler became my client and our conversations were privileged freeman wasnt giving up a thing hardy had been planning on drawing him out on cross going into the false arrest of may shinn all of that but it seemed freeman was doing his work for him pullios however could read the signs too this one said ambush ahead freeman was in prosecutors lingo going sideways witnesses did it all the time pullios had seen it before she got a little less friendly mr freeman is it a fact that mr fowler asked you to keep your relationship with him a secret from ms shinn yes is it a fact that bail of five hundred thousand dollars was set for ms shinn the facts continued to come out that fowler had put up his apartment building as collateral that ms shinn was indicted by the grand jury for murder putting the case in superior court that shinns trial was assigned to fowlers courtroom now pullios was on a roll and there wasnt much to do about it now mr freeman knowing as you did the relationship between the defendant and ms shinn what was your reaction to the assignment of ms shinns trial to mr fowlers courtroom freeman thought about his answer for a moment well i had mixed feelings i thought it would be good for my client if the trial went on in mr fowlers court but i thought there was no chance that would happen an answer pullios wanted you expected mr fowler to recuse himself hardy objected citing relevance who cares what mr freeman expected chomorro thought i do and said overruled pullios repeated the question asking whether freeman expected fowler to recuse himself of course but he did not freeman gave it a second but there was really no avoiding it no he did not hardy thought he could make a few points mr freeman ms shinn was charged with killing owen nash the same individual the defendant is now charged with killing thats right before you had agreed to defend ms shinn on that charge and hence before you had established an attorneyclient relationship with mr fowler did the defendant tell you why he wanted you to defend ms shinn he wanted an attorney he knew would present a strong defense did he say ms shinn would need a strong defense yes in your opinion mr freeman did mr fowler think ms shinn was guilty objection hardy rephrased it did mr fowler tell you he thought ms shinn was guilty of murdering owen nash yes he did he thought so you have won acquittals in several murder cases have you not mr freeman objection your honor this isnt relevant here hardy was matteroffact your honor the prosecution went over mr freemans credentials at the beginning of his testimony i want the jury to be aware of mr freemans reputation not just as a defense attorney but as an excellent defense attorney all right chomorro as he often did later in the day was getting surly but lets move it along he had the recorder reread the question and freeman answered that yes he had won several acquittals in fact wasnt it through your efforts that the charges against ms shinn were dropped yes largely now lets see if we can get this straight mr fowler knowing your reputation hired you to represent ms shinn who was subsequently cleared of the murder charge through your efforts yes true and that reopened the investigation leading to mr fowlers own arrest for the same crime objection pullios said calls for a conclusion whats your question mr hardy hardy thought he had made his point by inference at least would a man who was guilty of murder hire an attorney whose past record of successes made it likely he could get the case reopened the most reasonable explanation for hiring freeman was that in fact fowler did believe may had been guilty and of course if he thought that then he wasnt ill leave it your honor he said turning back to freeman hardy asked if at the time he had been hired he thought there was any chance that may shinns trial would go to fowlers courtroom no none at all if i had thought there was at that time i would not have taken it but there wasnt why not well she was in department twentytwo there were seven trial judges available and i was sure that if andy got the case hed recuse himself pullios was up like a shot but these were relevant facts and hardy was able to get freeman to tell most of the story how judges were picked for trials the circuitous route mays proceedings took before it came before fowler it could not have been foreseen finally hardy came to the end of it on the day charges were dropped against ms shinn how many days had she already been on trial i mean for example had you picked a jury had the prosecution begun its case no none of that were you aware of any other developments in that case on that day yes judge fowler resigned do you mean he recused himself from the case i mean he resigned as a judge he quit the bench and this was how long after the trial had come to his courtroom one day hardy turned to the jury one day he repeated pullios did not have any redirect on freeman and neither did she call maury carter the bail bondsman since facts relating to the bail had been substantially nailed down in freemans testimony instead after hardy had finished with freeman the prosecution rested hardy had to feel better freemans testimony which he had feared would be disastrous had not been anything of the sort it seemed the jury knew the worst of what andy had done but at least hardy felt they had gotten it in the least damaging light possible during the recess hardy argued his motion in chomorros chambers the judge to his surprise seemed to be giving him his full attention and proved it by telling counsel he was going to take the weekend to consider the motion he would render his decision on the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on monday meanwhile however hardy should be prepared to begin calling his defense witnesses his client had not said a word to him the entire afternoon when the judge came out and adjourned court for the week he only muttered see you monday and went back to join his daughter hardy gathered his papers at ten past five it was already dark as he went out toward the parking lot a storm was coming in and a wind had risen steady and cold alaska written all over it hardy put down his heavy briefcase and stood by the entrance to the morgue looking through a hole in the plywood into the construction site where the new jail was slowly rising a steady trickle of workers getting off passed behind him and he envied their snatches of conversation of laughter plans for the night for the weekend he turned up his suit collar against the wind feeling alone and desolate hey hardy dismas is that you knocking off early glad i caught up with you it was ken farris walking against the tide flowing from the building i got your messages but couldnt get away thought id try to catch you after court you adjourned already is it over what farris had said was true he normally could have expected to find hardy in the courtroom at this time but his arrival just now struck hardy as a little convenient he could just have called back hardy said as much ah you know the office you get to the end of the week any excuse to get out early this is on my way home anyway so hows it going what can i do for you this about may shinn hardy looked at him levelly i guess its about a lot if youve got some time you feel like a drink farris seemed to rein himself in sure he said something wrong well lets say alls not right they walked back through the hall and crossed the street lous crowded and noisy was hung with yards of red and green tinsel lit by christmas bulbs with all the seats taken they stood at the bar hardy called for a bass ale farris ordered a beefeater martini extra dry lou behind the bar caught hardys eye he new hardy introduced them and lou said dryly that all their martinis were extra dry no vermouth farris said hed take whatever lou poured which was the right answer he got some ice several ounces of gin a couple of olives hell of a place he said taking it in he clinked the glass against hardys okay whats happening the prosecutions rested i start calling my defense witnesses on monday youre not asking me to be a witness for andy fowler are you no why do you ask you think he killed owen farris sipped his gin tell you the truth i wouldnt be surprised if he killed may too i dont care what they say no may killed herself if they had found anything that connected to fowler hed have been long since charged with it and they were looking but hardy didnt like it because if farris still genuinely entertained the thought maybe the jury did too in spite of chomorros instructions hed better not forget that about may when we first talked you told me owen had been paying her right he paid all of them so do you know for a fact that he was paying her did he specifically tell you he was farris appeared to be giving it thought hardy continued you told me nash had changed the last few months i was wondering might that have been one of the changes farris seemed somewhere inside himself finally he said scarcely loud enough to be heard over the din owen went with call girls prostitutes call them what you will it was just his nature it was who he was and thats who what may was well maybe not hardy said thats what im getting at which seemed to anger farris goddamn it thats never been in dispute hardy sipped his ale its in dispute now mays lawyer youve met him freeman he says the two of them actually loved each other farris was shaking his head thats got to be bullshit why because he just didnt thats why this is owen nash were talking about he wasnt going to marry some whore why are you digging all this up because i dont believe andy fowler killed anybody why is it so upsetting to you if owen loved may shinn because i knew owen and that wasnt him hardy stepped back taking a beat both men went to their drinks hardy leaned forward again listen ken youve just spent six months contesting the validity of the will its no wonder youre committed to your position im just asking if youve got any proof owen was paying her his own admission to you canceled checks whatever youre the one whod told me hed changed with her was a forhire deal with a whore going to change him wasnt he wearing her ring when he was shot we dont know that someone could have put it on him why i dont know hardy kept at it it doesnt make any sense he put it on himself he was planning on telling you sometime possibly soon i think he had decided to marry the woman just as he had said ken farris was down to an olive jesus he said i just he shook his head you just assumed didnt you why wouldnt he have told me he told me everything maybe he didnt know maybe it snuck up on him but its all pretty consistent if you put it together weve got the change in behavior the settling down leaving her number with you for emergencies the will the ring if you buy the premise then may wasnt lying about anything which is why i called you i needed to verify that lou unasked had slid another round under their elbows farris didnt seem to notice he picked up the new drink and knocked off a third of it there were no checks he said finally of course cash you know i dont think we ever talked about whether he paid her it never came up a retreat a cover the bad news hardy thought was that farris maybe probably hadnt been lying maybe hed honestly believed an untruth and passed it along as a fact which wasnt nearly the same thing and it left a hole where there had at least been the chance of another suspect besides hardys client large drops of rain fell in sheets splattering on his windshield he found a parking place half a block down the street from his house and turned off the engine thinking he would wait for a break in the storm could this be the beginning of the end of the drought now in its seventh year and hardy knew a lot of people in san francisco who believed it would never end that this was the new california of the greenhouse effect the precursor of a future world of ozone depletion skin cancers aids and acid rain this cleansing pacific downpour soothed him somehow he sat back in his seat eyes closed listening to the steady tattoo of the drops on the roof there was still an unanswered question with may the coat maybe it would lead somewhere and then on monday chomorro might decide to grant his motion and that would be the end of the trial and he felt sure the end of his relationship with both his exwife and her father he wasnt sure how he felt about that whatever if he got andy off on the murder charge which is what hed been hired to do hed take whatever fallout developed but he also knew the trial coming to an early end was a very long shot and it still nagged that the truth if there was a truth continued to elude him he could get andy off he could flap his arms and fly to the moon if he wanted but until he found out who did put two bullets into owen nash he knew he wouldnt feel hed accomplished what hed really set out to do if nothing else he would still have to live with the fact that he was only ninetysevenpercent certain that nashs killer had not been the man he had labored to set free it had rained hard all night awakening hardy and frannie several times with peals of thunder a sound almost unknown in san francisco sometime in the middle of the night hardy got up to rebeccas cries and brought her to sleep between them in their bed up alone at dawn he put on his running shoes shorts and a tshirt and headed out around the park in the rain after a shower he made himself a breakfast of hash eggs toast and coffee and ate reading the paper occasionally looking up into the gray clouds through the kitchen skylight jeff elliot was not featured on the front page or anywhere else the daytoday workings of the trial were not exactly grist for the media mill he knew jeff would be around when the jury retired to deliberate maybe sit in for the closing arguments but that the mundane world of the courtroom was no match for the exploits of arnold mousenegger journalistic priorities mice over men after breakfast he leaned over to kiss his wife and baby he wore jeans and work boots his old greek sailors hat over a heavy white fishermans sweater he hoped that this day of all days josé decided to get to work on time it was still steadily pouring as hardy turned into the marina parking lot on a day possibly much like the one on which owen nash had gone out for the last time there were only two other cars in the lot hardy got within fifty feet of the guard station opened his car door grabbed his smaller briefcase and sprinted josé at the desk beyond the counter put down his issue of sports illustrated and stood up he recognized hardy right away i bet youre getting a little bored with this but ive got a couple of questions for you hardy said he took off his hat and put it on the counter next to the briefcase josé seemed to be an easygoing guy it was a miserable morning with no one else around he was happy with the interruption i was going over your statement yesterday josé hardy snapped open the briefcase and was getting out some of the paper and theres something i didnt understand josé nodded leaning over the counter looking at the inchthick pile of type he grinned i say all that well between your interview with sergeant glitsky and your trial testimony my girlfriend she say im too quiet i never talk i should show her these i could make you a copy if you want hardy said meanwhile let me ask you see here when you were first talking to sergeant glitsky hardy opened the transcript to the page he had highlighted and turned it around for josé to see at the end of the interview you said youd seen may shinn here at the marina on thursday morning jose was frowning looking at the page si he said uncertainly tom and me we talk about that after we see she kill herself right what did you talk about well you know after the trial we talk about that day the thursday si only i see her in the morning you know i know josé thats what im trying to figure out he pointed down to the transcript you see this part where you say she was going away from you si so how could you be sure it was may well i see her a lot tambien that thing she wear on her head and that coat nobody else with a coat like that one hardy tried to keep his voice flat what was the thing she was wearing on her head i dont know how you call it like a fur hat and the coat well you know the coat like some he searched for the word like some painting muchos colores okay josé let me ask you this and ive got all day if you want to think about it did you at any time see mays face no i dont have to think she was like way down there he gestured down the street she dont have a car i think least i never see her drive a car she always before come down with seňor nash she never came down alone maybe a little early to wait for him let herself aboard he shook his head no not that i remember maybe tom he know something else maybe hardy trying different combinations had to look back down at the questions he had prepared this time he did not want to leave anything out josé do you remember what time you got into work that morning that thursday josé straightened up nervously the shift begin at sixthirty hardy gave him a conspiratorial look i know that josé but im talking about that specific day i wont tell a soul i promise he was hoping he wouldnt have to make josé himself tell the world on the stand but he wasnt promising that josé shrugged i think a little late tom talk to me about it that day i remember somebody come by the day before asking about it too so i stop after that hardy smiled at him you were safe he said that was me but that day josé grinned back pretty bad he said maybe eight eightthirty the rain pounded at the glass all around them but i really stop being tarde back then you know this morning even no one going out im here he was close to greens a place he favored for lunch for their breads and coffees and the sculpted wood and the view of the water he had never been there this early in the morning and they werent yet open for business but they took pity on him standing out in the rain and let him sit at the bar and have a cup of coffee okay it wasnt certain that it hadnt been may remember that keeping up about the trial on her own may could have realized the implications of josés testimony shed been seen in her coat and then gotten rid of it trying to scam with struler to cover where it had gone he didnt think so what he thought was at least beginning to consider to realize it had been perking for a while was that someone else the person who had really killed owen nash had returned to the eloise on thursday morning maybe she it had to be a she now even in mays coat josé wasnt going to mistake andy fowler for may shinn maybe she had left something incriminating on the boat and seeing the eloise in the morning paper realized shed have to work fast helped by josés tardiness she had gone aboard taken out whatever it was stolen mays coat so that in case she was seen which she was identification would be confusing but wait she couldnt have gotten aboard tom had locked up the boat in hardys presence the night before and josé had rechecked it on his shift the next day unless of course the person had a key to the eloise or how about if she wasnt going to remove something from the boat but was going to put something back in for the twentieth time hardy tried to picture that drawer in the rolltop desk the drawer where abe had discovered the murder weapon the same drawer hed looked in on wednesday night and seen nothing maybe as they were so fond of saying about baseball it was a game of inches this is ridiculous abe hadnt been thrilled to get his call before nine on a saturday morning but hardy sweetly reminded him of his own call at six the day before besides glitsky was a cop first and he was dressed and going out for another interview anyway he might grumble but hardy knew that the murder of owen nash would get abes attention until it was solved as it was abe made it down to the marina in less than a half hour and he hardy and josé walked together in the steady rain out to where the eloise still rested at her slip i know it is hardy agreed but the implications of his whatifs were staggering he wouldnt have to consider them in fact he couldnt if he didnt get this fact nailed down the police tape had been removed and josé unlocked the door and stepped aside so glitsky could lead the way down the generators were off it was dark inside the rain thrummed above as the three of them stood a minute letting their eyes adjust looks about the same hardy said glitsky wasnt here to take inventory all right what hardy went forward through the galley the short hall the master suite the police might have removed mays belongings but the room seemed eerily the same the exercycle desks as though someone still lived aboard glitsky pulled back one of the curtains to let in a little more light and hardy walked to the rolltop desk he opened the drawer okay humor me would you take your time close your eyes and visualize it show me exactly where you found the gun glitsky came around the bed and looked in at the open drawer he took a small knife out of his pocket this is about the same length right and placed it on top of the maps that were still in the drawer back maybe three inches from the front hardy nodded did you jerk the drawer open which would have caused the gun to slip forward or backward on the maps glitsky was patient no i was my usual wonderful methodical self you want to tell me what this is about hardy looked down again at the knife in the drawer doing his own visualizing making sure he picked up the knife and gave it back to glitsky the gun wasnt there wednesday night abe i looked in this drawer a new onslaught of rain raked the boat in the room it sounded like they were inside a tin drum hardy stood there in his hat and pea coat glitsky and josé wore slickers all the men had their hands in their pockets the boat bumped the slip glitsky thought on it so may came and brought the gun back thursday morning making her the stupidest person in america maybe not maybe she saw her name in the paper and didnt want it in her house the gun hadnt been in her house it was here remember besides she didnt have a key you know thats probably worth doublechecking at her apartment abe wrote himself a note let me get this straight youre saying the shooter took the gun off this boat on saturday so whos going to bring the gun back someone who wants to and almost did frame may glitsky looked around another minute youd swear on this about the gun hardy nodded it wasnt here abe somebody came by here thursday morning unlocked the boat and put it in this drawer then they took mays fancy coat from the closet along with a babushka or something like that locked up and waltzed away why because they hated may hardy felt like he was on a roll owen dumped somebody for may so this person the perp killed owen out of jealousy then when they saw may linked to the eloise figured this was a good chance to get her too glitsky sucked at his teeth what time was this when this person came back hardy glanced at josé making a little face it must have been pretty early then it doesnt really let off your man fowler does it well i was thinking it couldnt very well have been a man at all josé here recognized the coat the guard piped in it was a woman sir theres no doubt of that it was a woman wearing the coat okay it could have been a man who let himself onto the boat it could have been two separate incidents andy didnt have a key you cant prove a negative hardy was getting frustrated that glitsky didnt see this abe the coat was aboard here how do we know that diz may said it was here he said our perp took it which was why it wasnt in your inventory glitsky patiently answered im not saying it didnt happen your way diz im saying it also very well could have happened at least one other way may could have worn the coat down here seen andy hell if he was framing her he couldve invited her down for just that reason so shed be seen in her unique coat after she realized what was happening she dumped the coat then saw her chance to get it back by hassling us that just didnt happen abe so prove it it was a woman abe glitsky was not convinced id make pretty sure what your client was doing that morning before i brought it up to the jury besides the only woman alive related to this case is celine nash aside from having no motive she was in santa cruz i checked hardy stood his ground i still think it was a woman glitsky shrugged well neither of us think may did it so who hardys mind was wrestling with the incomprehensible jane his exwife andy fowlers daughter she hadnt told him the whole truth about her relationship with owen nash it was understandable why should she have a onetime thing hed told himself but what if all right what if get tough face the possible however impossible jane had continued seeing nash he had dumped her for may shinn he had totally worked her and she had killed him and either confided in her father or somehow he had found out on his own no wonder he was acting genial passive cover for his daughter would he have done everything hed done with that motivation sure he would have hated nash and this torch he was supposedly carrying for shinn didnt it make more sense that hed be angry at her for dropping him there would be a sweetness in making her pay for his daughters crime as pay she certainly had he parked in front of janes house once it had belonged to both of them on jackson in pacific heights he had heard on the radio coming over that more than two inches of rain had already fallen since midnight going up the steps he knocked at the custom door with its molded glass inlay he saw a mans form appear through the door perfect he thought thinking he was about to meet chuck chuck bobuck or whoever else was the man of the month the door opened and he was looking at his client andy weve got to talk he said you are such a bastard jane was crying her legs curled up under her on her bed jane im trying to save your fathers life here its not been the best time ive ever had either hardy felt terrible seeing his exwife in tears he could be glib or pretend to be about the men in her life after him but he wasnt blind to the fact that she was looking for the right one that what she wanted was a man steady and strong who would love her and stay true and she wasnt finding him he supposed perhaps wrongly that hed at least come the closest to that ideal but something their own history had made the commitment impossible he could see her every day and not think about it but now confronted by it it was very hard how can you even think that dismas what kind of person do you really think i am i told you it was nothing it was just a night andy was waiting in the living room hardy would get to him if he had to but first he had to know about jane and owen nash just one night and you never saw him again thats right it happens what do you want me to say i dont want you to say anything if thats the truth she hit the bed with a balledup fist i told you its the truth i saw owen nash one day one night one okay okay jane what are you saying i killed him reading his expression she brought her hand to her mouth oh my god you really think that she jumped up sniffling and went to her bureau opening a wide black book and turning the pages she turned to him holding the book open for him to see june eighteenth to twentysecond the i magnin summer fashions exposition all day every day im giving seminars and hosting teas check on it hardy looked down hating this i believe you jane i said i believed you she pulled the bureau chair out and sat back down crying again silently wiping at her eyes with a kleenex hardy got up off the bed and left the room he told andy they had to get together the next day to go over his testimony they made an appointment for noon and then hardy left him to comfort his daughter he had written frannie a note saying he would probably be gone all day and she had left one for him she was at her late exhusbands mothers rebeccas grandmothers house and would be back by six she hoped to see him then he went to his office and threw darts for twenty minutes now and then glancing at the window to watch the rain drop out of the gray this was the time he was supposed to be gearing up for his defense for the legal battle between him and pullios on the interpretation of the evidence that andy fowler had allegedly killed owen nash but hardy felt that somehow the essence was being lost it reminded him of his highschool debates where he would argue both sides of something sometimes three or four times in the same afternoon as though there was no correct answer oh and he knew it was the fashion had been since he had gone to college dont make value judgments relativity was king there was no absolute truth but like it or not he had grown up to believe that there was truth that right differed fundamentally from wrong and what he was supposed to do on monday was continue the debate he knew that he would call abe glitsky and art drysdale and possibly josé as witnesses and wind up with andy testifying on his own behalf he had been preparing his summation almost since the trial had begun the problem was that now so far as he could sort it out little of what really had happened had found its way into this trial the supposed crucible of truth on the one hand he didnt want to divert his attention away from his defense of andy he knew he should be sitting at his desk outlining writing key phrases and arguments to win over the jury but the other side of him felt that now that he was satisfied that he knew what had happened he should pursue that truth singlemindedly only that pursuit could take andy fowlers fate out of the hands of the jury remove it from debate the only thing that would ultimately clear his client was an alternate explanation of events but the time he spent on that took away from his formal defense at trial he threw darts the inventories were no help they listed sweatbands taken from the drawers in the desks next to the bed some weightlifting gloves leg warmers switching back to his formal trial preparation hardy pulled his legal pad in front of him should he call josé as a witness and introduce everything he had found this morning he wrote it down looked at it and realized that nothing he had found out proved that andy had not been on the boat thursday morning prove a negative what about the significance and believability of the gun in the drawer he could call pullios and chomorro right now and say that he personally had discovered a crucial bit of evidence that would demand a retrial because he could not be a witness for his own client he would testify that the gun had not been in the drawer on wednesday night but proving it to a new jury would again be difficult it was still possible he had to admit that the gun had slid forward or backward with every opening of the drawer he could simply have overlooked it missed it in his haste and even if he did establish the guns absence did that necessarily mean the prosecution would have the burden of proving that andy fowler had somehow acquired a key to the eloise playing glitsky he came up with five reasons in five minutes why they wouldnt he got up and fed his fish he knew what he knew the gun had been brought back to the eloise on thursday morning by the jealous woman who had killed her past lover owen nash she had done it to get it out of her own possession and to shift the blame to may and on both counts the strategy had worked he had to hit and hit again the fact that the burden of proof was always on the prosecution they had to prove fowler had killed nash it wasnt hardys job to prove he hadnt what he had to do was keep the jury clear on that point pullios had to prove andys guilt even if the jury thought andy was guilty of something to some degree he had to make the point to the jury that they werent to determine whether or not andy was innocent but rather whether the prosecution by the evidence presented had proved him guilty and if not then although he might not be innocent he was legally not guilty innocent did not mean exactly the same thing as not guilty it was in this case a crucial distinction back at his desk he pushed some buttons then exchanged a few words with ken farris about the terrible weather you still at it farris asked no rest for the weary hardy said a point occurs to me if you dont mind helping the defense i can go half a yard farris said though id prefer not to think of it as assisting the defense he paused briefly dismas let me ask you something i get a feeling this is more than just a job for you you dont think fowler did it do you you wouldnt do this as an exercise in the law hardy had been through it all before fowler didnt do it he said im also trying to find out who did a pause then why do they keep putting us through this getting the wrong people hardy knew it was a long story nashs fame pullioss ambition fowlers duplicity suspicion and prejudice and all of the above but farris had asked it rhetorically and hardy passed it by did owen give the key to the eloise to any of his girlfriends he asked i doubt it the eloise was his baby you know hed have people aboard but not without him did he have any other longstanding girlfriends mistresses whatever besides may he had to hardy was thinking a few weeks once in a while a month that was about it he paid them off they went their way do you remember him talking about any of them being bitter angry rejected anything at all like that no im sorry but there just wasnt that much made of it or i should say them they came and went like the seasons he laughed dryly no scratch that more like the courses of a meal that was the big difference with may she was around awhile and no one else was no except celine of course hardy sat riveted to his chair he felt the blood draining out of his face the rain beat on his window darkness was settling in did celine have a key to the eloise he asked keeping his voice calm hey i was kidding about that really a bad joke does she have a key well i think she does she used to but she didnt i know that hardy forced himself to slow down to speak calmly just another something to think about keeping track of these keys thats all but do me a favor would you sure shes mad enough at me about all this defending the man on trial for her fathers murder would you try not to mention this key business to her if you see her yeah okay no problem when he hung up he didnt move for several minutes the house wasnt there nor was his office nor the rain nor the darkness outside the night celine had come by for the first time she had quickly left after seeing him in his green jogging suit the same kind owen nash had been wearing on the day he had been shot was seeing him like seeing her fathers ghost shed reacted at least for a moment as though she had you just suddenly reminded me so much of my father so rethink that visit how could he have reminded her of her father with that intensity if she hadnt seen him in the same outfit if she hadnt been with him on that last day of course she might have seen him other times in his jogging clothes except that wasnt very likely they didnt live together they didnt jog together strout he had mentioned in the case of may shinn though hardy knew it was true anyway that standard operating procedure at the morgue was to bag the victims clothes celine had seen nash at the coroners but hed been naked certainly the jogging suit was a better explanation of her extreme reaction than just seeing him in domestic bliss with wife and child if he hadnt been so convinced she was in love with him would he have ever believed her explanation for her reaction dismas the ladykiller he shook his head in disgust but why money greed well it was true she stood to benefit with may gone more than anyone except perhaps ken farris but since she already had more than she needed hed quickly discounted that potential motive not to mention that he never considered her a suspect anyway he wasnt happy with it the more you got the more you wanted money the alleged root of all evil including murder what about her reaction to mays death at least she wont get the money greed one of the seven deadly sins and greed didnt presuppose poverty or exclude the wealthy there had to be more it was rocking him he was aware sitting back now in his chair that his stomach had tightened he consciously unclenched his fists he knew he was right but wasnt sure why one thing was sure as the killer she had acted plausibly smartly played on his male ego let him think she was fixed on him in his role as her fathers avenger while may was a suspect how better to keep him from suspecting her than to fabricate and build their own illicit relationship to use his libido as insurance he was such a fool but glitsky had looked into this celine had been in santa cruz she couldnt have been out on the eloise hardy thought he had read and reread each of the binders on his desk but he hadnt abes reports following up on alibis for ken and celine sat there within their tabs he had listened to abe telling him about the two weight lifters who lived with one of their mothers about celine spending the weekend remodeling their victorian house now he read abes synopsis of the telephone interview he had conducted the telephone rang on his desk and he grabbed at it mr hardy this is judge chomorro and im the queen of spain hardy thought but it was the judges voice no mistake what was he doing calling hardy at home over the weekend during a trial this being his first murder trial hardy wasnt certain what to make of it was a call from a judge to a defense attorney a relatively common practice or another example of chomorros own inexperience there was nothing to do but hear him out he said hello and listened while the judge told him that he had called to give him fair and decent warning that he had decided to deny hardys motion that the evidence was going to the jury for their verdict pullios had also been informed by the way chomorro said again in the interests of total fairness for the defense or covering your ass in an appeal hardy thought i want you to be prepared for the prosecution to object to your argument on the investigation procedure leading to the indictment of mr fowler he paused a moment and i am of a mind to sustain those objections hardy tried to get out an objection now i understand wed covered that in pretrial your honor well ive given it a lot of thought since then especially since yesterday going over your eleveneighteen and i fail to see any direct relevance to the evidence thats been presented ms pullios may have moved too quickly on ms shinn but there was ample evidence to indict mr fowler in the first place and certainly enough for a jury to decide to convict well leave it up to them your honor you realize that was the main thrust of my defense frankly thats one of the reasons for this courtesy call i wanted to give you some time to prepare talk to your client he can tell you there was nothing technically improper about his indictment a trial is supposed to weigh evidence if you want to impugn the system youre of course free to appeal as i presume you will if you lose hardy could imagine drysdale or locke or both of them having had a chat with chomorro the previous night or this morning reminding him a trial is supposed to weigh evidence right out of the textbook here was the reason for chomorros unorthodox call hed talked to somebody and been told that his ruling on the law regarding hardys defense would perhaps provide grounds for a prosecutorial appeal no chomorro wasnt going to screw up his first murder trial it was a straightforward procedure evidence was presented and the jury decided that was how he was going to play it no way he felt he could ask glitsky it was a fishing expedition and hardy knew it and abe had his own work to do he wouldnt run off on what hed consider a hunch of hardys to doublecheck his own work hardy couldnt blame him frannie called at sixthirty an half hour late he hadnt noticed and swore at himself how are you he asked hows the beck her voice seemed small and far away he told her he was still working and she said that shed known that erin rebeccas grandmother had invited her to stay for dinner maybe even overnight if the rain didnt let up hed be at it until the wee hours anyway she didnt think hed mind did he he didnt mind he said how could he this had been his doing and he was going to have to fix it he told her he loved her would miss her but understood he was getting to the end of it jeff elliot owed him one he was an investigative reporter and if there was something to discover in santa cruz hardy hoped he was the guy to find it he only had to sell him on the idea in this weather are you kidding me its probably going to be beautiful there tomorrow hardy read the papers will you this is supposed to go on all weekend jeff itll be an adventure take your girlfriend go down there and have a little vacation on me whats a little rain among lovers he got himself a large can of fosters lager and a handful of nuts and walked through the long and suddenly lonely house wind howled between the buildings the rain fell without letup the worst storm in years he turned on the christmastree lights planted his beer and nuts on the reading table next to his reclining chair and put a match under the kindling in the fire sam cooke played in his mind saturday night and i aint got nobody forget that he had brought up his binders and was going to go through them again his own notes hed taken so many notes he thought his wrist was going to fall off every time he had spoken to pullios drysdale glitsky farris celine while it had still been strictly professional he had jotted down at least the gist of the conversations if they concerned this case random thoughts theories of moses and frannie of pico and his old officemates at a little after tenthirty he got up for another beer after which he was going to hang it up for the night and get some sleep he had just gotten to the time ken farris had come downtown ostensibly to verify owens handwriting on the will hardy remembered that they had gotten into how the system worked too slowly farris knew may had been on the eloise celine had told him hardy had dutifully noted it then written hearsay in the margin and had if not forgotten it at least dropped it from his active consideration celine had also told hardy that may had planned to go out on the eloise with owen theyd been walking back from their first meeting he remembered it now distinctly may however had denied it and may it turned out was telling the truth so celine had lied except he still couldnt prove it opening the refrigerator he stopped he slammed the door closed and nearly ran back up through the house to his binders it took only a minute it had been when pullios had him question celine in front of the grand jury trying for the indictment on may shinn celine had testified that on tuesday morning june she had called her father at his office wanting to make sure he hadnt made any plans for that weekend that included her he had said no that he and may were going out alone on the eloise okay celines version was in the record but it was still hearsay it was also a lie but how to prove farriss office where there was a beep every twenty seconds and everything was on tape hardy slept fitfully waking before dawn rain continued to fall but more gently now in a thick drizzle he showered and dressed and sat drinking coffee staring at the clock on the wall wondering what would be a reasonable time to call ken farris again reasonable or not he wanted to call him before he had time to leave the house he went back to the binders and read over the testimony wanting to make sure although he knew it that it hadnt been fatigue he had asked celine when she had called her father sometime in the morning it was the tuesday i believe the sixteenth if that was the tuesday yes he was at his office down in south san francisco he held out until sevenfifteen about the longest ninety minutes of his life farris didnt appear to appreciate his restraint what the hell hardy what time is it he told him apologizing explaining keeping him on the line ive got a real lead he concluded i dont want to put you through all this again give you another suspect to worry about but i think ive found a place to finally get some physical evidence he told him his conjecture about the tapes please tell me youve still got them we should he said we keep them for six months so youve still got the ones for june i dont know is that six months im not really awake yet you know what id like to do is review the last two weeks of june all the calls nash made or took at his office farris sounded like he yawned at least he was waking up thats all how about a fullscale audit while youre at it hardy could take a little abuse if he was going to get what he wanted he waited shit why not you looking for anything in particular something yeah but id rather not say exactly what just now i mention it because we keep logs you wont have to listen to all the tapes if you know who you want he went on sounding more like himself now i know all this taping seems like excessive security but were in a hightech field there really is espionage people have claimed oral contracts with me or owen on some things we like to protect ourselves you dont have to justify a thing to me where do you keep the logs theyre in south city at the plant weve got a vault farris sighed i dont imagine this is going to wait until say business hours tomorrow morning is it dorothy took the exit and headed the car up the hill away from the ocean the wipers clicketyclacked on the flat windshield of the old vw bug the windows on both sides were down an inch to act as defrosters both she and jeff wore parkas for warmth the heater didnt work the drive to santa cruz down highway from san francisco had taken them a little over an hour and they probably should have been in sour moods dorothy rolled down her window further and put her hand out catching raindrops i dont think ill ever hate the rain again maybe we should move to oregon tierra del fuego she said it rains all the time there i hear they had used yesterdays storm as an excuse to stay inside for the whole day nothing to do but curl up stay warm enjoy each other when hardy had called they were ready to go outside not dying for it but it had some appeal ive got to meet this friend of yours hardy what a great idea well hes not exactly a friend hes a source if you remember i was a source for your bail story youre prettier than he is a little bit anyway she slapped him the car swerved and she straightened it they were driving through a heavily wooded pine section back up behind the uc campus a brown slick of water ran down the center of the street there was a house about every two hundred yards i think that was our street you just passed jeff said plus you said youd have an idea by now she pulled the car over and stopped looking behind her at the street sign she started making a uturn i do have an idea she said although i dont know why i have to think of everything jeff put his hand on her leg i think of some things she smiled looked down and covered his hand with her own driving now with one hand she squeezed it yes you do the idea was to get them talking len and karl werent home they were down at the gym pumping iron together they did it every morning karls mother explained they were religious about it both were very disciplined boys very structured len was currently runnerup mr northern california and karl was going down to santa monica right after new years for the golds gym prelims the three of them jeff dorothy mrs franck sat in the kitchen nook brand new hardwood floors a custom oak table curved glass in the windows they were drinking herb tea and mrs franck had cut up some fiber bars into cookielike things the old victorian house was large newly painted immaculate everywhere there were new rugs framed prints on the walls antiques but look at me chattering on you didnt come here to talk about my sons i call them both my sons lens my soninlaw really but hes like a son they were legally married last summer you know i think thats wonderful dorothy said mrs franck beamed im so glad a lot of people dont understand you know they see two men and you know i admit i had a difficult time accepting it at first but if you could see them and then offering to take me in i mean theyre just wonderful boys and they do love one another and then having all this looking around jeff took the opening somebody must be doing very well already mrs franck beamed i know she said this place now its a dream come true it is beautiful dorothy said i dont think even celine did it justice jeff said almost as an aside to dorothy im glad we came down are you really going to feature it in the chronicle jeff nodded its why were here celine told me i couldnt do a complete feature on restored victorians if i didnt see this place but i still think she sold it short i dont think theres one in san francisco thats this nice well if the boys come home dont even breathe a bad word about celine they wont hear of it youre all pretty close huh jeff had his notepad out mrs franck nodded she must be the most generous person god ever put on this earth she was a help was she karls mother rolled her eyes to the heavens you cant imagine anything we needed you should have seen the place before and now she gestured to take it all in so is celine like a sponsor or what jeff asked you know thats the funny thing i think she just took a liking to karl he had been up in the city trying to work out some things they have a coach up there whos really marvelous and he met her at her club shes in fine shape herself you know and what happened well you have to know karl but he is the sweetest man everyone loves him the two of them he and celine just got to be friends i think he was a little lonely for len up there all alone in the city like he was he needed someone to talk to and you know hes so faithful he didnt want to lead on any other men so i guess he and celine just clicked and he started telling her about his dreams you know his life his career this house he and len wanted to fix up mrs franck lowered her voice and leaned toward them across the table celines very rich you know her father was owen nash jeff and dorothy both nodded its a terrible shame about her father isnt it that poor man has that judge been found guilty yet jeff told her the trial was still going on well its just so awful the whole thing especially for celine she sighed and on top of everything else dorothy spoke up are other things hard for her too oh you know even the rich sometimes i think its almost harder for them whyjeff asked oh you know all the people after their money you never know if anyones sincere i think thats why she cares so much about karl i mean before he even knew about the money that she had money well hes just always been there for her hed do anything for her we all would i think she just needs some friends she can count on who dont pester her she needs a place to stay where its not a hotel where shes not celine nash just a normal person thats nice dorothy said everybody needs that mrs franck nodded we just let her come and go shes got her own room well i guess youll see it when we go on up karl fixed it up for her especially lord knows one thing this house has is enough rooms but thats karl he says this house is her house shes welcome even if were not here is that often jeff asked oh you know with the boys competing sometimes shell come down on a thursday or friday and well all be going off for the weekend someplace long beach or las vegas we come back sunday or monday and shell have a dinner or something waiting for us shes really so great the monterey bay club had a listing of all the sanctioned weightlifting events of on june saturday and sunday the mr california regionals had been held in san diego at the mission bay inn dorothy sat in a booth at the pelicans nest just off the santa cruz boardwalk sipping a bloody mary checking the shine on her new diamond the rain had picked up again slanting sheets of water across the bay jeff was coming back from the pay telephones he walked easily with the crutches barely seeming to need them when he was hot on a lead like this one he slid into the booth and kissed her karl franck and his mother checked in with len hoeffner on friday evening june nineteenth both were listed as entrants in the pageant so celine wasnt here she might have been she might have come down on friday night to see them off im sure there are plane records somewhere but i dont think hardys going to need them and she was back by sunday it wasnt a question jeff nodded and so far as the francks knew or assumed she was there all weekend they werent even lying as far as they knew when they said so she probably had a nice meal waiting for them when they got home and a story about a relaxed weekend doing nothing except for killing her father jeff stared out the window at the rain except maybe for that hardy had gone down to pick up frannie and rebecca he took them out to breakfast and then swung by their house again for another days clothes and baby supplies before dropping them back at her former motherinlaws he probably wasnt going to be back home all day anyway and he had some nagging notion that things could get dangerous maybe that was ridiculous but hed play it safe anyway hed feel more comfortable if his wife and child were out of harms way the other thing he had done was call andy fowler still at janes and cancel their noon appointment to go over his trial testimony he told him about chomorros decision not to allow his line of questioning on the backward collection of evidence fowler had been lowkey listen diz when you get me on the stand ill simply tell the truth i did not kill owen nash and they havent proved i did their burden remember i think its a good idea to take the day off get a little resttake the day off sure now he was closing the owen industries security logbook it hadnt taken much time he had reviewed the calls to and from nashs office for the two weeks prior to his death there was one call to celine though it was on monday not tuesday hardly by itself a critical flaw in celines testimony he was sitting at kens desk at his office the one so much like his own at owen industries in south san francisco farris had come down with his security supervisor gary simpson at eleventhirty then left the two men to find whatever it was hardy was looking for simpson sat legs crossed and bored across the desk from him okay hardy said weve got one hit you mind if we give it a listen simpson shrugged and stood up stretching theatrically he was a tall man in jeans and a flannel shirt thats what im here for he motioned with his head back this way they walked hardy following down the redtiled hallways and around a couple of corners the door marked security was oversized doublelocked with deadbolts simpsons office was to the right inside and there was a small anteroom with two waiting chairs an end table and a coffee table and in contrast to the rest of the building no plants anywhere these rooms were much colder than the others simpson gestured for hardy to follow him back behind his desk was a walkin vault and hardy waited while simpson unlocked and opened the desk pushed a series of buttons inside a drawer then did the same thing on a panel next to the door to the vault hightech hardy said simpson half turned well were in the business we ought to keep up on state of the art the door opened inward hardy had envisioned a bunch of drawers filled with tapes but again was confronted with an array of buttons and lights more state of the art simpson sat at a console featuring innumerable leds and three computer terminals whats your number there on the left column for the call you want hardy still carrying the thin logbook opened to the page he read out the sixdigit number and simpson entered it on the board there was a brief wait then a click youre lucky simpson said this date gets automatically erased in two days you want to override it so it doesnt do that sure no sweat he pushed a few buttons okay he said you ready hardy was surprised at the sound of owen nashs voice somehow less authoritarian than hardy had imagined raspy but consciously softened hardy thought as though he were speaking to a child i know youre unhappy with me he said but dont hang up please a longish pause the digital sound reproduction was superb hardy could hear celines breathing become more rapid all right she said evenly i wont hang up we have to see each other nash said we need to talk about this no i dont want to see you about this i want you back its happening celine its going to happen a breathy silence it cant daddy it just cant what about me youll be fine honey i still love you you dont now it was owens turn to take a beat ill always love you honey we just cant go on the way we have ive changed its different because of her no not just her because of me maybe shes made me see it but the change is mine its my decision i wont let you make it celine i wont daddy she cant do this she cant have you its not her he repeated its me and i have made the decision ill change your mind i know i can suddenly there was a deeper insinuating tone it was unusual enough that simpson turned around to look at hardy you know i can nash did not answer immediately when he did his voice was a whisper as though wrung from the depths of him no you cant anymore celine thats done thats over its come terribly close to ruining both of our lives it cant go on a strident laugh i suppose you wont see me your own daughter ill always see you celine whenever you want just not not that way i want one chance daddy hon almost screaming now somehow without raising her voice then the throbbing voice again please please daddy i just need to see you it wont nash began if it doesnt ill leave it i promise resigned when whenever you want wherever you want a final pause then nashs voice thick ill call you jeff elliots call was on hardys answering machine at his office at home celine may have been in santa cruz at some point during the weekend but neither len nor karl nor his mother could verify shed been there on saturday since regardless of what they had told or implied to glitsky they hadnt been home themselves the assistant district attorney in charge of sexual crimes was a woman named alyson skrwlewski hardy had barely known her though he guessed that by now shed have heard of him i just have a quick general question if you dont mind she considered a moment like most of the das staff she wasnt disposed to do any favors that would hurt a prosecution case and even if she was inclined to be helpful the situation hardy calling her this way on a sunday afternoon made her uncomfortable lets hear the question first she said then ill tell you whether i can answer it i guess i want to know is what are the most common manifestations of fatherdaughter incest well i guess thats general enough i can talk about that what do you want to know everything i can but specifically when the victim grows up is she likely to do anything differently than other women who havent had that experience not when if she grows up you mean suicide would be high on the list hardy let her think her relationships are going to stink probably shell be an enabler maybe let her husband abuse her own daughter thats if she wants a husband they dont marry often oh no not that so much i mean this is almost too general every case is different its just such an allencompassing terrible situation they might marry five times finding the socalled right mix of somebody who abuses them and babies them it sucks hardy agreed but she wasnt telling him anything that might help him what about backgrounds what about them anything you might expect to see more than in someone else you mean with the victim or the father both i guess well theres some evidence that if the father didnt interact immediately normally with the victim in the first years of her life hes more likely to be sexually attracted to her if he never changed a diaper never burped her and so forth the incest taboo doesnt kick in she sounded apologetic hey thats a fairly new theory and pretty unprovable with the women at least theres more data what do they do well a surprising number of them try to burn down their houses no one really seems to know why besides some obvious symbolic stuff but arson is often in the profile hardy felt the hairs rise on his arms skrwlewski continued and then of course theres the prostitution but everyone knows that they all go into prostitution no no not so much go into that life although of course many do but more have some isolated experiences their selfimage is so low they dont feel attractive you know yet they know men want them daddy did and they can take out their hostility by making them pay it all gets pretty twisted around sounds like it i guess some people dont react as badly but youll almost always get the manipulation using sex for something else the love substitute hardys stomach was a knot he sat at his desk with his arms folded across his chest outside his window the wind had died down and there were a few breaks in the clouds he had all the proof he needed for himself but there was the same problem that had dogged the murder of owen nash from the outset the lack of physical evidence celines conversation with her father provocative and revealing as it had been never named a date didnt so much as mention the eloise it also hadnt mentioned may but celine could argue with absolute credibility that she had simply been mistaken as to the day when shed talked with her father about him meeting may on the boat she had the one talk with him at his office then another one later in the week he said hed call her didnt he and shed gotten the two mixed up the santa cruz people being away didnt necessarily mean she hadnt been there it meant her alibi was weaker almost undoubtedly false but by itself it still didnt put her on the eloise on saturday other hints came back to him he remembered celine telling him shed only been a member of hardbodies for six months in other words from about the time shed stopped working out on the eloise when owen had started seeing may regularly surely the headbands on the boat never claimed by may had been celines so had the lifting gloves one pair of which shed no doubt worn when she had fired mays beretta as with andy fowler and may shinn before him there was no apparent physical link tying celine nash to the murder of her father he had been right though he took little satisfaction from it owen nash had been killed by a jealous woman but the woman had been his own daughter and if he had been sexually abusing his own daughter since he supposed their trip around the world together when shed been six years old or even earlier he certainly deserved whatever punishment she could give him he knew she had done it and now he knew why more accurately he knew she had done it because he knew why he thought of his own adopted baby girl then tried to imagine the immense physical and psychological damage owen hashs abuse had visited on his own daughter and suddenly he found he had lost any desire to see celine punished she had been punished enough hadnt she shed never get out from under the private stigma never away from the pain deep down he didnt even blame her but though punishment might not be his motive he still had to prove it to clear andy fowler and celine was nobody to underestimate earlier in the morning he had sent frannie and rebecca away deriding himself for considering that celine might be dangerous now he was glad that he had she had shot and killed her father she hadnt blinked at and had in fact done her best to bring about the false accusation of may shinn from the gallery she had daily watched the slow skewering of andy fowler his oncedistinguished career in ruins she had clearly been prepared to take hardys marriage down with her to get him off her scent hardy still had andy fowler to defend the trial would have to go on pullios couldnt let it go now and without a smoking gun hardys accusations of celine at this stage would come across as rank courtroom shenanigans it might at last get him the longpromised contempt citation from chomorro the key is my only hope abe shes got to have the key glitsky had listened patiently for him he interrupted only about every ten seconds tired of hardys meddling not liking to hear that celines alibi the one he had provided was suspect now its celine he asked at last too bad nash didnt have a dog after celines trial we could indict the dog come on abe ive run it all down for you we need a warrant if shes got the key if its at her house glitsky stopped him big deal it proves she could have gone to the eloise on thursday morning proves she could have please this one time give me a break diz it doesnt prove anything its just another theory you know thats how theyre going to see it thats why we need the physical evidence the key with my testimony if anybody believes you why wouldnt they because my friend it is in your own best interests to make up something like this like the gun not having been there when you looked on wednesday night it wasnt there abe im not saying it was the issue here as always is proof and im telling you how its going to look can you think of any judge in the city who would issue a search warrant on this hardy was silent okay how about in all of america all right all right i understand abe but im telling you celine did it im telling you why what am i supposed to do about that theres no way andy fowlers going down for this i hate to tell you this ol buddy but you want my opinion he is unless you get him off coming in a little after nine the size of the crowd in the gallery was daunting hardy wondered if someone had leaked the news that his witnesses might not be appearing that theyd be moving right along to andys testimony then closing arguments and jury instructions the verdict might even come in today and the media wanted to be there his witnesses had been subpoenaed though and they were on hand glitsky in a coat and tie glitskys lieutenant frank batiste ron reynolds his polygraph expert art drysdale sitting next to chris locke himself hardy wasnt too surprised to see david freeman down for the show celine was sitting in her usual spot by the aisle abe he realized had been right his job had never varied he had to convince the jury that the evidence did not warrant a conviction he had come up with an idea to get to celine if he had to he might have to prove that she was guilty in order to get andy off but he didnt want to confuse the two issues andy in a dark blue suit entered with jane still hurt and angry at hardy for the grilling hed given her on saturday about her relationship with owen nash she didnt come through the rail as she usually did fowler however seemed to have forgotten hardys outburst at him on friday about his stance the transparency of his attachment to may and sat down calmly at the defense table from his vantage now certain that his client had not killed anyone hardy was more equable about the judges attitude and appearance much of which was he decided a brave front this was an innocent man he could seem to remain above it all if he wanted if it made him feel better hardy was also beginning to understand a little of what was behind andys apparent sangfroid the man had after all spent thirty years on the bench and it was in his blood to believe in the jury system there would not be a miscarriage of justice here he didnt kill owen nash the jury would come up with the right decision if he didnt believe that what had he been doing presiding over the system for three decades if hardy wanted the jury to believe that andy was more of a regular joe it was because he thought it would make him appear more sympathetic now he was realizing that the jurys empathy with andy wasnt the issue either in reality there was only one issue did the evidence prove he had killed owen nash the judge entered and everyone stood hardy went to the center of the courtroom and nodded at the members of the jury then at the judge chomorro had given fair enough notice the defense calls inspector sergeant abraham glitsky he turned to watch abe come forward catching a raised eye from pullios at the prosecution table well object all day betsy he thought to himself this is relevant and im going to bring it up glitsky was sworn in and hardy after establishing abes credentials as an experienced homicide investigator began for the jurys benefit sergeant would you tell us how an inspector such as yourself gets assigned to a homicide investigation glitsky sat comfortably in the witness chair having been there many times forthcoming competent with nothing to hide he looked directly from hardy to the jury its more or less random he said there are twelve inspectors and typically we each handle between three and six cases rotating them as they come in if it gets a little unbalanced lieutenant batiste might shuffle one or two around all right now in this random manner did you happen to get the owen nash homicide yes i did in that capacity what was your role in collecting evidence glitsky gave it a minutes thought i am in charge of coordinating all the physical evidence that we eventually turn over to the district attorneys office if the matter is going to be charged i also check on the alibis of suspects potential motives we look into paper records bank accounts telephone logs anything we feel relates to the homicide in this case i also supervised the forensics team that went aboard the eloise mr nashs boat glitsky and hardy had been over all this many times did you go aboard the eloise yourself yes i did and what did you find there glitsky went over the inventory the bloodstains the slug in the baseboard the exercise equipment the murder weapon when you got to the eloise was it locked up yes the attendant there had to open the cabin for us this was thursday afternoon june twentyfifth is that right right now sergeant as your investigation proceeded did it eventually center on one suspect yes it did because of the physical evidence to some extent there were fingerprints on the murder weapon a lack of an alibi an apparent motive hardy had decided he might be able to introduce all of this testimony if he avoided having glitsky draw any conclusions and if he kept may shinns name out of it so far he was talking about the formal police investigation into the murder of owen nash relevant testimony and based on that evidence those suspicions did you make an arrest no not right then there wasnt enough to justify it but eventually you did make an arrest did you find more evidence no more physical evidence but i came to the conclusion that the suspect was about to flee hardy turned to the jury in other words your suspect was exhibiting consciousnessofguilt and you felt justified making an arrest because of that thats correct hardy turned back to glitsky sergeant this person with fingerprints on the gun no alibi no apparent motive the one acting so guilty was that suspect andy fowler no it was not hardy nodded and turned to pullios he had gotten through it without an objection your witness sergeant glitsky when you did make the initial arrest in his case the one mr hardy has just referred to were you coerced in any way by any member of your department or by the district attorneys staff hardy couldnt believe it pullios was inadvertently introducing the very argument he had been trying to avoid because of chomorros decision no at that time it was a fairly standard investigation although we do try to move quickly he looked at the jury the trail of a homicide gets cold in a hurry before making your arrest did you wait for the complete fingerprint analysis on the murder weapon peoples exhibit one yes and didnt mr fowlers prints turn up well at the time they were unidentified you dont deny that mr fowlers fingerprints were on the gun do you no but before you knew whose they were you arrested another person you told mr hardy your suspect had an apparent motive and alibi did you get an opportunity before the arrest to check that alibi no but and isnt it true that in fact your suspect had two eyewitnesses to where she was on the day of the murder eyewitnesses you failed to locate i wouldnt characterize it as please just answer the question sergeant its very straightforward glitsky looked down for the first time hardy thought it wasnt a good sign yes thats true i didnt locate them pullios walked back to her table took a sip of water and read some notes shifting gears now sergeant she began again how many homicides were you handling at this time back in june hardy stood up objecting the sergeants caseload isnt relevant here on the contrary pullios said mr hardy went to some lengths to establish sergeant glitskys professional routine under normal conditions if these were not normal conditions if the sergeant was under unusual stress for example the rigor of his investigations might suffer for it glitskys lips were tight the suspect was leaving the country he said chomorro tapped his gavel please confine yourself to answering the questions sergeant ms pullios im going to sustain mr hardy here no one is questioning the sergeants handling of his case but of course pullios had done just that trying to discredit a prosecution witness who consorted with the defense as soon as glitsky stepped down chomorro asked to see counsel in his chambers and called a tenminute recess he stood in front of his desk now look he began as soon as pullios and hardy were inside ive warned you both about opening this can of worms and im not going to have it this isnt a conspiracy case on either side mr hardy that was some pretty nice navigating through some difficult shoals but were not going on in this direction i notice youve got lieutenant batiste up soon do i take it hes going to say sergeant glitsky is a good cop who always follows established procedures more or less chomorro shook his head well hes not going to ive also got some real concerns about how you intend to handle art drysdale i think its all getting pretty irrelevant here he held up a hand im not trying to cramp your style mr hardy but unless youve got something a little more substantive i think you might reconsider your direction i know youll have the defendant up there half the day ill let you summarize your procedure questions in the closing argument up to a point but im not inclined to let this thing degenerate into character assassinations of everyone in this building clear yes your honor but in that case i do have a request id like to add a witness at this point pullios asked youve just asked me to cut out half of my witnesses it doesnt seem unreasonable to take another tack its a small point anyway judge chomorro cut pullios off who is it celine nash the victims daughter youre calling her for the defense hardy shrugged im calling her to get at the truth your honor the substance of her testimony will be access to the eloise nashs habits on board how is that relevant to andy fowler pullios asked come on elizabeth i dont want to give everything away ill get to it when shes on the stand that wasnt strictly true but it was a small enough point and chomorro having taken away ought to give him one back all right the judge said all right elizabeth pullios thought about it then nodded okay she said why not testimony before lunch was taken up by ron reynolds the polygraph expert hardy kept him on the stand longer than he thought really necessary since the only important point he had to make was that andy had volunteered to take the lie detector test if andy fowler had been guilty or even acting with a consciousnessofguilt he would not have done that was hardys point of course polygraph evidence of this sort was only admissible by stipulation but pullios had agreed to the testimony provided she could make the point that fowler hadnt actually passed the test hardy didnt need reynoldss point but pullios couldnt do much with hers either and hardy needed reynolds to take up most of the rest of the morning on the stand he had to take the good with the bad so he ran reynolds around with how the polygraph worked in general why people did well or poorly on it margin for error and so on on cross pullios as expected leaned on the fact that fowler with his vast experience would conceivably know how to beat the test and therefore could have volunteered to take it knowing he could throw off the results but for hardy it accomplished his ultimate goal he did not want to call celine nash before lunch suddenly after the recess in chomorros office the course of the trial lay clearly charted before him he would take celine the witness baiting the trap after lunch afterward fowler would testify on his own behalf then perhaps hardy would get to his closing argument tomorrow chomorro would give the jury their instructions and leave it in their hands but today after she testified celine would remain in the courtroom as she had every day until that days business was done he was counting on the fact that she would not risk altering her routine not when she was so close to winning celine nash she reacted almost as though shed been hit turning in her seat abruptly to look around her recovering her composure she stood in the gallery and walked up through the railing looking questioningly at hardy she settled herself into the witness box she wore charcoal pinstripes over a magenta silk blouse the effect of which was somehow both severe and demure her hair was pulled back accenting the chiseled face the aristocratic lines hardy steeled himself and moved to his spot as she was being sworn in ms nash ive just a few questions if you feel up to them she nodded wary looking to the jury then to pullios when she came back to hardy she seemed to relax getting into the role go ahead mr hardy im fine thank you you and your father owen nash were very close were you not yes we were and you spoke often saw each other often yes at least once a week often more going sailing having dinner that type of thing yes now in the last few weeks of your fathers life did this pattern continue well yes i know i talked to him the week she lowered her eyes the week he died for example it had been normal and did you talk about any particular subject most of the time no not really we talked about a lot of things we were very close like old friends i see you talked about a lot of things business associates sports gossip personal matters pretty much yes now during these last weeks did he ever mention the name of andy fowler either to you or in your presence she considered no not that i remember hardy walked back to the defense table and picked up some papers i have here he said a copy of the transcript of your testimony before the grand jury in which you said that your father had told you he was planning on going out on the eloise with may shinn on the day he was killed do you remember that testimony yes of course and yet we know that may shinn did not go out with your father that day it wasnt a question and chomorro took the opportunity to lean down from the bench i trust youre going somewhere here mr hardy he really wasnt he was telling celine he hadnt forgotten about that testimony he apologized to the judge and went back to his table replacing the transcript turning he started over in a mellower tone ms nash your father took a great deal of pride in his boat did he not easier ground he loved it she said sitting back it was like a home to him his real home you were familiar with it then you spent a lot of time on board casual well yes but not so much recently he was taking may out on it a good deal do you know did you father tell you if may shinn had a key to the eloise pullios stood up your honor i know were on boats here but this is a little too much fishing for my taste mr hardy do you have a point your honor sometime between wednesday night june twentyfourth and the next afternoon the person who killed owen nash brought the murder weapon back onto the eloise that person would need a key your honor this is outrageous how does this unsubstantiated claim relate to this proceeding to mr fowler to anything no evidence has been entered even hinted at on this point hardy knew this would be the response but he had to get the message to celine that he knew he kept calm her face he noticed had gone pale although at the moment no one else was looking at her he was at the center of the storm mr hardy chomorro said weve heard sergeant glitsky testify that he found the gun on thursday aboard the eloise do you have a witness with a different version of events no your honor not yet well this is neither the time nor the place to find it is there anything relevant youd like to ask ms nash otherwise he leaned over toward celine as hardy said no the court apologizes ms nash if ms pullios has no objection no pass the witness pullios said when hardy sat down fowler whispered to him what the hell was all that about if thats the best we got then let me up there celine was cool but hed always known that she walked by his table without a glance at him he turned to watch her go back to her seat on the aisle thank god he thought as hed assumed she wasnt leaving finally andy fowler took the stand and hardy led him through the testimony they had rehearsed fifty times he did look good up there hardy thought selfassured confident speaking clearly giving the jury his attention and respect they went through it all from the beginning taking the good with the bad there were a few rough moments such as when hardy asked him as they had decided he would just why it was he had hired emmet turkel i didnt hire him to find out about owen nash fowler said i dont deny that was what he found but i just wanted to know why may would not see me anymore i thought she might even be in some trouble i just wanted to know and she had made it clear she didnt want to talk to me about it they went over how the fingerprints came to be on the clip of the gun the tortuous and unlikely route that mays proceeding had traveled to wind up in andys courtroom and once it was there fowler said i felt it was too late it was a mistake a terrible mistake but it wasnt something i had contrived it just happened it fell in my lap he admitted the lies to his colleagues portraying himself accurately hardy thought as a man torn between his private needs and his professional position i should have asked her to marry me months before and taken whatever came from that he said but i never thought about losing her until she was gone and then again it was too late flat out as to his weekend in the sierras what could he say he had gone up to clear his head with the express purpose of seeing no one he had succeeded only too well he wished he hadnt it would have saved the state he took in the jurors and the jury much time trouble and expense in all it took less than two hours of relaxed if meticulous testimony fowler remained composed saying what needed to be said pullios was obliged to charge not like a bull but like a terrier holding onto his trouser leg hoping to pull him off balance watching her work hardy was struck once again by her passion here was no act every ounce of her dripped with the conviction that andy fowler lied with every breath he drew and had coldbloodedly murdered owen nash would you say mr fowler that you are an avid camper the judge smiled no not particularly how many times roughly have you been camping in say the past year just the once im sure of that how about in the past couple of years no no what no ive only gone that once in the last few years im a pretty busy man or have been and yet last june out of the blue you suddenly decided to take a weekend off and go backpacking in the high sierras thats right would you mind telling us where you ate on friday night friday night was the night you left town wasnt it yes it was one of those spots up highway fifty above placerville i dont remember the exact name do you recall what town it was near fowler shook his head no im really not too familiar with the area do you remember what you ate his frown grew pronounced i believe i ate a steak he tried some levity but since im under oath i wont swear to it she kept at it was it dark when he had finished dinner where had he spent the night exactly when did he hit the trailhead what was his destination how had he found it what did he bring with him to eat on saturday night it was getting to him you know he said i didnt give a great deal of thought to that weekend until after i was charged with this crime it was simply a weekend away not one to remember yes pullios said turning to the jury we can see that she moved along as hardy feared she would to the stipulation about fowler knowing not only that the gun was on the boat but exactly where it had been kept and this was after you had broken up you found this out yes when may shinn wasnt talking to you to the extent that you had to hire a private investigator to find out why she wouldnt see you well she talked to me that once why did she do that i dont really know i called and she happened to answer the phone usually it was set to her machine but she picked up so we talked and just casually talking she happened to mention that her beretta was in the desk at the side of owen nashs bed on board the eloise no it wasnt quite like that would you tell us please what it was quite like hardy looked at the clock she had at least another hour today and she was to his regret hammering at the evidence they did have avoiding for the moment the entire consciousnessofguilt issue although he knew that too would come also and perhaps worse andy seemed to be losing it a little beginning to come across peevish lets talk about mr turkel again youve testified that you were curious about why ms shinn was breaking up with you thats right and so you hired mr turkel short questions little tugs on the trousers but they were doing the job fowler nodded wearily yes i hired mr turkel how much did he charge you i think it was about a hundred and thirtyfive dollars a day plus expenses pullios brought in the jury again one hundred thirtyfive dollars a day and did you pay for his plane fare out here yes and back she brought out that he had spent over to obtain detailed information on owen nash and may shinn and now having spent all this money what did you intend to do with this information why nothing i just wanted to know as ive explained you paid fifteen hundred dollars to find out something about which you intended to do nothing thats right hardy was nervous confidence eroding his client now into his third hour on the stand eyes shifting from pullios to hardy to the judge was coming across body language and all like a pathological liar pullios saw that of course and it led her naturally into all the real lies to his friends associates to anyone who would listen and then finally the litany of his admitted transgressions designed to show andys consciousnessofguilt how long have you been on the bench did you swear a sacred oath never to subvert the judicial process have you ever previously recused yourself from a case oh several times were the grounds as strong as they were here had he ever even heard of another judge putting up bail for a defendant on and on and on hardy took a page of notes then gave up on it pullios wasnt twisting the facts she was using them very effectively to create a character and a circumstance that made murder not only seem consistent but inevitable at a quarter to five she finished at last and turned fowler back to hardy for redirect he only had one area to which he wanted to return where he thought he might be able to repair some of the damage mr fowler was your conduct regarding the may shinn matter investigated by the ethics committee of the bar association of california objection pullios was sounding a little weary chomorro knew the end was in sight and cut hardy a little slack overruled hardy repeated the question and fowler on the stand nodded yes it was and you were in fact disbarred for what ms pullios has been calling your egregious misconduct hardy knew that andy had been reprimanded but not otherwise disciplined on the shinn trial issue and even after andy was indicted for murder the bar association wasnt going to disbar or do anything to a fellow attorney until he had been convicted no i was not are you in fact as we sit here now a member in good standing of the state bar i am all right thank you fowler had wanted to talk jane wanted to argue frannie he was sure wanted him to come home jeff elliot had arrived in the gallery and wanted an interview but celine had been leaving the courtroom and there wasnt time for any of that he had stuffed his papers into his briefcase earlier and now making excuses pushed his way through the gallery and out into the hallway she was fifty feet ahead of him as she left the building through the back door by the morgue a cold night had fallen the air still felt damp from the storm although it had stopped raining hardy jogged to keep close he too was parked in the back lot and got to his car about when celine reached hers he left the lot three cars behind her and followed her uptown across market to van ness then north to lombard always keeping at least one vehicle between them he had to run only two red lights on lombard as she turned west he ventured closer in the lane next to her she drove a little over the speed limit but not recklessly for a moment as they approached the golden gate bridge turnoff he felt a moment of panic he was wrong and she was going to sausalito or somewhere maybe to visit ken farris but she took the turnoff avoiding the bridge and swung out through the swaying eucalyptus of the presidio he had never been to her house he didnt know where she lived but he was certain she was going home he might have guessed her house was less than three blocks from her late fathers palace in the seacliff section really not so far from his own house in distance although light years away in other respects celines place however was not a palace it didnt appear much bigger than hardys she turned into the driveway and he pulled up to the curb across the street and killed his lights this he knew was a long shot but it had come to him last night as the only possibility left to break the evidence deadlock if celine still had her key to the eloise it would be over it was the only explanation of the missing gun how it had come back into the drawer after he had seen it empty on wednesday night what he had to do was get it find it on her in her possession ring the bell knock her down tie her up and search the house but he couldnt do that he had to wait she could be flushing it down the toilet throwing it into the garbage but he didnt think shed do anything like that shed want it out of the house away from the area entirely if she had it her nature would make her get rid of it dramatically he hoped so he waited a light went on in the upstairs window her shadow moving across it even in the cold he realized his palms were sweating what was he doing this for he should have somehow cajoled or forced abe to come along but here he was he waited the light went out then another one downstairs he heard a door slam then a car door open and close and he turned on his own ignition with his lights off he swung a uturn and followed her back the way she had come on the el camino del mar but she only drove for about three minutes before pulling into the darkened parking lot at phelan beach the night was eerily still after the rain eucalyptus leaves scratched and clacked overhead a foghorn bellowed from far away hardy had let her get into the trees before he parked by the entrance and started to jog again through the light forest she had driven to the front of the lot turned off her engine doused her lights the golden gate bridge loomed spectacularly overhead in the clear night air the door opened and she got out and without turning or hesitating started for the beach a threequarter moon reflected off the water casting a light shadow as she walked unhurriedly across the sand hardy got to the edge of the beach and pulled off his shoes she was halfway to the water when he broke into a run toward her she heard as he closed the distance she turned celine it was almost as if she had been expecting him this was no generalized fear she knew who he was and seeing him she nodded as if to herself then whirled with her right hand in the air hardy lunged for her wrist caught it and closed his other hand around hers god hed forgotten how strong she was she pulled against him kicking at his legs his groin he held her never relaxing his grip on her hands forcing himself to kick back catching her at the side of the knee sending her twisting down falling on top of her still struggling she bit into his arm near the shoulder spinning around he forced his weight down on top of her her legs came up trying to knee him throwing sand over them both into faces and eyes he rolled over onto her hand holding it clenched tight beneath him and began to pry at the fingers with her other hand she reached up digging her nails into his scalp he felt the skin tear down into his neck she was getting weaker the vise grip of her hand slowly opened enough for him to feel what she held there to grab it and roll away he didnt know if that would end it so he kept rolling until he got a little distance maybe six feet then came to his knees facing her panting from the exertion celine still lay there in her tailored charcoal suit now torn to rags gasping for breath he didnt take his eyes from her he looked down at the key in his hand attached to a little ring and a small block of wood he knew without being able to see it that the wood would have written on it either burned or indelibly marked the word eloise gradually he became aware of the lapping of the water against the beach celine turned onto her side and curled up in a fetal position her sobbing ignored him it was totally private and chilling a keening for all she had lost for all she never had owen nash grinned into the wind as he brought the boom around his cigar was out halfconsumed in his mouth they had been out on the water for two hours and it was going to be all right he had told celine he was going to marry may she would see shed eventually accept it and now she could be free of him and the thing theyd begun so long ago that had bound them in guilt and lust for so long he couldnt remember when it hadnt been there they had not talked much yet but he had always been able to control her and now it was just a matter of waiting for the right moment the door to the cabin opened and she came out wind whipping that fine wet hair he had started telling her as they were going through the gate together fighting the current and the wind afterward okay it shook her when she saw he meant it she said she needed to be alone even with the rough seas she wanted to go below and do some aerobics let it all settle get loose she had apparently taken a shower and stood now in the doorway to the cabin wrapped in a turkish robe barefoot she came up another step onto the deck the robe swung open and he caught a glimpse of the front of her breasts and belly her shaved pubis she did not pull the robe closed but came toward him unsteadily in the rocking boat her eyes glazed he presumed from the exertion coming around the wheel she pressed herself up against him opening the robe come below daddy he had to fight for his breath for the control he swore he would have honey ive told you her hand went down to him caressing i know what youve said i dont care if you have her but youve got to keep me youve got to keep us she found him under the green jogging pants and against his will he began to respond as he always did suddenly the boat heeled and pushed him up against her both of them against the wheel come below she whispered holding him but this could not go on he would never let it happen again he had promised himself and he had promised may he had found something real for the first time since his marriage to eloise it was his last chance and his selfish beautiful daughter was not going to take it from him as shed taken eloise years before because of his weakness for her flesh hating himself and hating her for what theyd both become he pushed back against her no no he shoved her hard i said its over celine goddammit over leave me alone she went down on the slippery deck the robe spilling open around her and then he saw it in her eyes the hate he knew had to be there you didnt live this way without hate glazed but dryeyed she stared at him as if he were an alien force then she gathered herself up wrapped the robe around her and went below without a word he had lost the wind goddammit his cigar was gone too the drizzle increased visibility was about a hundred yards he squinted through the mist checked his compass making sure he was on a south or southwest heading he didnt want to beach her he listened for the telltale sound of breakers shed be all right he thought again it was the kind of thing that would take some time he ought to have factored that in instead of just laying it on her shed get used to the idea eventually he was sure she emerged again a couple of minutes later still in the robe but more under control now there see he was right shed work it out you couldnt expect a woman not to try some histrionics he was surprised to see her wearing her lifting gloves she must have wanted to work off some of it he thought it was getting to be time to head the eloise back in daddy he wasnt cruel he didnt want to hurt her if she were ready to talk again hed talk gently he understood her he came around the wheel and started walking toward her she took the gun from the pocket of the terry robe and leveled it at him he stopped tried to smile as he might with an errant child reaching out one hand honey she lowered her aim and fired he felt a punch then a pain deep in his groin his legs went dead and he dropped to his knees looking up at her with a surprised expression at the tiny muzzle of mays tiny gun my god celine youve killed your father she shook her head not yet daddy he saw the muzzle come up and settle on his heart fowler didnt do it notguilty verdict returned in nash murder trial by jeffrey elliot chronicle staff writer former superior court judge andrew b fowler yesterday was found not guilty of the murder of financier owen nash the jury deliberated less than two full days in returning the verdict in favor of the former judge who had been a fixture on the san francisco bench for over three decades the trial marked a personal victory both for fowler and for his attorney dismas hardy an exprosecutor for whom this trial marked a defense debut hardy insisted that he had never doubted his clients innocence that judge fowler had himself been a victim of infighting within the citys judiciary there was never any physical evidence tying the judge to the crime hardy said of course that doesnt mean the jury might not have found him guilty but this verdict is a wonderful vindication of the system we werent happy from the beginning said jury foreman shane pollett theyd already arrested someone else on pretty much the same evidence it wasnt that fowler hadnt done some bad things but nobody proved hed killed nash the prosecution had to prove fowler killed nash and they didnt do it this verdict marks the second defeat for the district attorneys office surrounding the death of owen nash last summer the office charged nashs mistress may shinn of the murder but subsequently was forced to drop the charge when her alibi was corroborated by two witnesses district attorney christopher locke denied there was any witchhunt of judge fowler the evidence he said and we looked at it very closely for several months strongly implicated the judge but the jury has spoken thats how it works thats the end of it asked if he was going to pursue another investigation into the death of owen nash locke said that that was up to the police department if they bring us another suspect and new evidence of course well move on it immediately there are however no new suspects at this time judge fowler plans to spend the next few weeks in hawaii and then resume his position as a partner in the firm of strand worke luzinski hardy sat across from jeff elliots desk in the chronicle building what do you mean celine didnt do it what about everything i found out in santa cruz speaking of which i trust you had a good time hardy said you should have for four hundred dollars what costs four hundred dollars in santa cruz elliot said straightfaced i think we rode the roller coaster a hundred and forty times each but listen getting back to this thing my story hardy stopped him all you found out was she might not have been there right elliot nodded you got anything anywhere that puts her on the boat no ask yourself why this sounds familiar hardy hated to take jeffs story away but he wasnt in the prosecution business anymore look jeff you can try to get some police action on this but they wont thank you for it ive tried i know owen nash gives everybody downtown a bad headache you got any reason why you think celine might have done it other than i told you she might have jeff shrugged somebody lies about their alibi everybody has lied about their alibi in this case or looked like they have he put a hand on jeffs shoulder youre welcome to it jeff but its a dry well its just another maybe elliot turned to his computer squinted at something came back to hardy what made you change your mind i got the impression you honestly thought shed done it hardy crossed a leg over another one that was before my client was cleared jeff if id needed to find out who killed nash to get fowler off i suppose i would have kept on it but now andy didnt do it that was my main interest youre not curious hardy got cryptic no i know everything i need to keeping life simple right hardy nodded something like that on december hardy stood holding rebecca in one arm and a package in the other at the clement street post office with the christmas rush he had waited for almost twenty minutes by the time he got to the window the clerk took the package a box about twobythree inches no way he said no way what hardy asked christmas man theres no way the clerk looked at the address i were you id just deliver it its only half a mile if that be there in fifteen minutes nice houses up there i love it when its lit up its not a christmas present hardy said it doesnt have to get there any time probably wont make it till new year thats okay it doesnt matter the clerk shook the box its not fragile is it sounds like keys or something thats what it is hardy said somebody lost some keys he read about it on the day his son vincent was born he was still in st marys hospital on the top of the world he had spent the night coaching frannie breathing and yelling and pushing with her until nearly dawn when the head had come through and then five minutes later the doctor told them they had a boy frannie had pulled hardy into the bed with her and the doctor lay the baby between them the two of them looked in wonder at the life theyd produced vincent cuddled into both of them that afternoon uncle moses brought rebecca by he also brought the days newspaper after moses had gone frannie had gone to sleep with rebecca on the bed hardy started reading the chronicle on page jeff elliot had written a brief story outlining the stabbing death of celine nash the daughter of the late financier owen nash at a rough trade hotel in the tenderloin district there were no suspects yet in connection with the slaying and it was presumed that the victim who had a past history of occasional prostitution had simply gotten unlucky with a john hardy closed the paper out the window of the hospital room the day was fading into an overcast dusk a while later they brought vincent in for feeding hardy gave frannie a distracted smile then looked back out at the falling night are you all right frannie was nursing the baby studying him what is it hardy shook himself away from his thoughts he got up from his chair and came over to her bed lifting the sleeping beck onto him squeezing in next to frannie he said nothing just the world out there i guess you know what she said thats not the world the world is on this bed right now frannie laced her fingers in his hand hardy felt his daughter stir against him and his son made some contented sounds he tried to blink the room back into focus but it didnt work so he brought his hand up to his eyes john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the truth and the hearing lives with his family in northern
