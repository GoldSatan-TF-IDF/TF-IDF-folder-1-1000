the ballads in this volume are translated from the works of oehlenslæger a poet who is yet living and who stands high in the estimation of his countrymen and from the kiæmpé viser a collection of old songs celebrating the actions of the ancient heroes of scandinavia the old danish poets were for the most part extremely rude in their versification their stanzas of four or two lines have not the full rhyme of vowel and consonant but merely what the spaniards call the assonante or vowel rhyme and attention seldom seems to have been paid to the number of feet on which the lines moved along but however defective their poetry may be in point of harmony of numbers it describes in vivid and barbaric language scenes of barbaric grandeur which in these days are never witnessed and which though the modern muse may imagine she generally fails in attempting to pourtray from the violent desire to be smooth and tuneful forgetting that smoothness and tunefulness are nearly synonymous with tameness and unmeaningness i expect shortly to lay before the public a complete translation of the kiæmpé viser made by me some years ago and of which i hope the specimens here produced will not give an unfavourable idea it was originally my intention to publish among the miscellaneous pieces several translations from the gælic formerly the language of the western world the noble tongue a labhair

touch the heart and tinge the cheek as deeply as divinest greek in simple words and unsought rhyme give me the songs of olden timethe deathraven from the danish of oehlenslæger the silken sail which caught the summer breeze drove the light vessel through the azure seas upon the lofty deck dame sigrid lay and watchd the setting of the orb of day then all at once the smiling sky grew dark the breakers ravd and sinking seemd the bark the wild deathraven perchd upon the mast screamd mid the tumult and awoke the blast dame sigrid saw the demon bird on high and teardrops started in her beauteous eye her cheeks which late like blushing roses bloomd had now the pallid hue of fear assumd o wild deathraven calm thy frightful rage nor war with one who warfare cannot wage tame yonder billows make them cease to roar and i will give thee pounds of golden ore with gold thou must not hope to pay the brave for gold i will not calm a single wave for gold i will not hush the stormy air and yet my heart is movd by thy despair give me the treasure hid beneath thy belt and straight yon clouds in harmless rain shall melt and down ill thunder with my claws of steel upon the merman clinging to your keel what i conceald beneath my girdle bear is thineirrevocably thinei swear thou hast refusd a great and noble prey to get possession of my closet key lo here it is and when within thy maw mayst thou much comfort from the morsel draw the polishd steel upon the deck she cast and off the raven flutterd from the mast then down at once he plungd amid the main and clove the mermans frightful head in twain the foamclad billows to repose he brought and tamd the tempest with the speed of thought then with a thricerepeated demon cry he soard aloft and vanishd in the sky a soft wind blew the ship towards the land and soon dame sigrid reachd the wishdfor strand once late at eve she playd upon her harp close by the lake where slowly swam the carp and as the moonbeam down upon her shone she thought of norway and its pinewoods lone yet love i denmark said she and the danes for oer them alf my mighty husband reigns then neath her girdle something movd and yearnd and into terror all her bliss was turnd ah now i know thy meaning cruel bird long sat she then and neither spoke nor stirrd faint through the mist which robd the sky in gray the pale stars glimmerd from the milky wayah now i know thy meaning cruel bird she strove in vain to breathe another word above her head its leaf the aspen shook moist as her cheek and pallid as her look full five months passd ere she mid night and gloom brought forth with pain an infant from her womb they baptizd it at midnights murky hour lest it should fall within the demons power it was a boy more lovely than the morn yet sigrids heart with bitter care was torn deep in a grot through which a brook did flow with crystal drops they sprinkled harralds brow he grew and grew till upon danish ground no youth to match the stripling could be found he was at once so graceful and so strong his look was fire and his speech was song when yet a child he tamd the battle steed and only thought of war and daring deed but yet queen sigrid nursd prophetic fears and when she viewd him always swam in tears one evening late she lay upon her bed king alf her noble spouse was long since dead she felt so languid and her aching breast with more than usual sorrow was oppressd ah then she heard a sudden sound that thrilld her every nerve and lifes warm current chilld the bird of death had through the casement flown and thus he screamd to her in frightful tone the wealthy bird came towering came scowering oer hill and stream look here look here thou needy bird how gay my feathers gleam the needy bird came fluttering came muttering and sadly sang look here look here thou wealthy bird how loose my feathers hang remember queen the stormy day when cast away thou wast so nigh thou wast the needy bird that day and unto me didst cry deathraven now comes towering comes scowering oer hill and stream but when wilt thou dame sigrid fair thy plighted word redeem a hollow moan from sigrids bosom came while he surveyd her with his eye of flame fly said she demon monster get thee hence my humble prayr shall be my sons defence she crossd herself and then the fiend flew out but first contemptuously he dancd about and sang no prayr shall save him from my rage in christian blood my thirst i will assuage young harrald seizd his scarlet cap and criedill probe the grief my mother fain would hide then rushing into her apartment fair o mother said he wherefore sittst thou there far from thy family at dead of night with lips so mute and cheeks so ghastly white tell me what lies so heavy at thy heart grief when confided loses half its smart o harrald sighd she yielding to his prayr creatures are swarming in the earth and air who wild with wickedness and hot with wrath wage war on those who follow virtues path one of those fiends is on the watch for thee armd with a promise wrung by him from me his bloodshot eyes in narrow sockets roll and every night he leaves his mirksome hole he was a kind of god in former days kings worshippd him and minstrels sang his praise but when christs doctrine through the dark north flamd his and all evil spirits might was tamd he now is but a raven yet is still full strong enough to work on thee his will lost is the wretch who in his power falls vainly he shrieks in vain for mercy calls she whisperd to him then with bloodless lip what had befallen her on board the ship but youthful harrald listend undismayd and merely grippd the handle of his blade my son she murmurd when her tale was told fear withers me but thou lookst blythe and bold the youth uplifted then his sparkling eye and said whilst gazing on the moonlit sky once my dear mother at the close of day among tall flowers in the grove i lay soft sang the linnets from a thousand trees and sweetly lulld i slumberd by degrees then heavens curtain was methought undrawn and clad in hues that deck the brow of morn an angel slowly sank towards the earth which seemd to hail him with a smile of mirth he raisd his hand and bade me fix my eye upon a chain which hanging from the sky embracd the world and stretching high and low clinkd as it movd the notes of joy and wo the links that came in sight were purpled oer full frequently with what seemd human gore of various metals made it claspd the mould steel clung to silver iron clung to gold then said the angel with majestic air the chain of destiny thou seest there accept whateer it gives and murmur not for hard necessity has cast each lot he vanishdi awoke with sudden start but that strange dream was graven on my heart i go wherever fate shall please to call without gods leave no fly to earth can fall it thundersand from midnights mirky cloud comes peal on peal reverberating loud the frothclad breakers cast with sullen roara scottish bark upon the whitend shore straight to the royal palace hasten then a lovely maid and thirty seaworn men minona scotlands princess scotlands boast the storm has driven to the danish coast oft while the train hew timber in the groves minona arm in arm with harrald roves warm from his lip the words of passion flow pure in her eyes the flames of passion glow one summer eve upon a mossy bank mouth joind to mouth and breast to breast they sank the moon arose in haste to see their love and wild birds carrolld from the boughs above but now the ship which seemd of late a wreck floats with a mast set proudly on her deck minona kisses harralds blooming face whilst he attends her to the parting place his bold young heart beats high against his side she saild awayand like one petrified full long he stood upon the shore to view the smooth keel slipping through the waters blue months pass and sigrids sorrow disappears the wild deathravens might no more she fears a gentle red bedecks her cheek again and briny drops her eye no longer stain my harrald stalks in manly size and strength swart bird of darkness i rejoice at length if thy curst claw could hurt my gallant son long long ere this the deed would have been done but harrald lookd so moody and forlorn and thus his mother he addressd one morn minonas face is equalld by her mind methinks she calls me from her hills of wind give me a ship with men and gold at need and let me to her fathers kingdom speed ill soon return and back across the tide bring thee a daughter and myself a bride dame sigrid promisd him an answer soon and went that night when risen was the moon deep through the black recesses of the wood to where old brunos shelterd cabin stood she enterdthere he sat behind his board his woollen vestment girded by a cord the little lamp which hung from overhead gleamd on the bibleleaves before him spread hail to thee fatherman of hoary age thy queen demands from thee thy counsel sage young harrald to a distant land will go and i his destiny would gladly know thou readst the starso do the stars portend that he shall come to an untimely end take from his mothers heart this one last care and she will always name thee in her prayr the hermit rising from his lonely nook with naked head and coldly placid look went out and gazd intently on the sky whose lights were letters to his ancient eye the stars said he in friendly order standone only flashes like an angry brand thy harrald gentle queen will not be slain upon the earth nor yet upon the main while thus the seer prophetically spoke a flush of joy oer sigrids features broke hell not be slain on ocean or on land she said and kissd the hermits wrinkled hand why then im happy and my son is free to mount his bark and gallop through the sea upon the grey stone he will sit as king when in the grave my bones are mouldering the painted galley floats now in the creek flags at her mast and garlands at her beak high on the yardarm hoisted is the sail half spread it flutters in the evening gale the night before he goes young harrald strayd into the wood where first he saw his maid burning impatience feverd all his blood he wishd for wings to bear him oer the flood then sighd the wind among the bushy grounds far in the distance rose the yell of hounds the flamewisps starting from the sedge and grass hung mid the vapours over the morass up to him came a beldame wildly drest bearing a closelyfolded feathervest she smild upon him with her cheeks so wan gave him the robe and was already gone young harrald though astonishd has no fears the mighty garment in his hand he rears of wondrous lovely feathers it was made which once the roc and ostrich had arrayd he wishes much to veil in it his form and speed as rapidly as speeds the storm he puts it on then seeks the open plain takes a short flight and flutters back again courage he cried i will no longer stay scotland shall see me ere the break of day then like a dragon in the air he soars startled from slumber in his wake it roars his wings across the ocean take their flight groves cities hills have vanishd from his sight see there he goes lone rider of the sky miles underneath him black the billows lie he hears a clapping on the midnight wind speed harrald speed the raven is behind flames from his swarthyrolling eye are cast ha harrald screamd he have we met at last for the first time the youth felt terrors force pale grew his cheek as that of clammy corse chill was his blood his nervous arm was faint while thus he stammerd forth his lowly plaint i see it is in vain to strive with fate thank god my soul is far above thy hate but ere my mortal part thou dost destroy let me one moment of sweet bliss enjoy the fair unmatchd minona is my love for her i travelld foollike here above let me fly to her with my last farewelland i am thine ere morning decks the fell firmly the raven holding him in air surveyd his prize with fiercelyrabid glare now is the time to wreak on thee my lust yet thou shalt own that i am good and just then from its socket harralds eye he tore and drank a full half of the heros gore since i have markd thee thou art free to go but loiter not when thou art there below young harrald sinks with many a sob and tear down from the sky to natures lower sphere he rested long beneath the poplar tall which grew up under the red churchs wall then rising slow he feebly staggerd on till his minonas bower he had won trembling and sad he stood beside the door pale as a spectre and besprent with gore minona come ere harralds youthful heart is burst by love and complicated smart soon will his figure disappear from earth yet we shall meet in heavens halls of mirth minona come and give me one embrace that i may instantly my path retrace thus warbles he in passions wildest note while death each moment rattles in his throat minona came almighty god she cried my harralds ghost has wanderd oer the tide red clots of blood his yellow tresses streak drops of the same are running down his cheek minona love survey me yet more near it is no shadow which accosts thee here place thy warm hand upon my heart and feel whether it beats for thee with slackend zeal at once the current of her tears she stoppd his arm upheld her or the maid had droppd the roses faded from her face away and on her head the raven locks grew gray all he had borne and what he yet must bear he murmurs to her whilst she trembles there the hero then with dying ardour pressd for the last time his bosom to her breast farewell minona all my fears are flown and if i grieve it is for thee alone give me a kiss and give me too a smile and let not tears that parting look defile now will i drink the bitter draught of death and yield courageously my forfeit breath farewell may heaven take thee in its care he said and mounted swiftly in the air she gazd but he had vanishd from her view she stood forsaken in the damp and dew then dark emotion quiverd in her eye and thus she prayd with hands uplifted high thou who wert vainly tempted in the wild thou who wert always charitably mild thou who madst peter walk on billows blue enable me my harrald to pursuesunken already was the morning star the song of nightingales was heard afar the red sun peepd above the mountains brow and flowers scented all the vale below there came a youthful maiden gaily drest bearing upon her back a feathervest fondly she kissd minonas features wan gave her the robe and then at once was gone and straight minona clothes in it her limbs and soaring upward through the ether swims to moan and sob her maddend breast disdains too big for such low comfort are its pains the fowls that meet her in yon airy fields she clips in pieces with an axe she wields each clanging pinion ceaselessly she plies but cannot meet the raven or his prize she hears a faint shriek in the air below and swift as eagle pounces on his foe down down she droppd and lighted on the shore which far and wide was wet with harralds gore she smild so ruefully but still was mute his good right hand was lying at her foot that pledge of truth in loves unclouded day was the sole remnant of the demons prey deep in her breast she hid the bloody hand and bade adieu for ever to the land again she scowerd through the airy path her eyeballs terrible with maddend wrath the ravensorcerer at length she spied and soon her steel was with his hot blood dyed the huge black body piecemeal found a grave amid the bosom of the briny wave the ocean billows fret and foam no more but softly rush towards the pebbled shore on which the lindens stand in many a group with leafy boughs that oer the waters droop there floats one single cloudlet in the blue close where the pale moon shows her face anew it is minona dying there that flies she sinks notnoshe mounts unto the skiesfridleif and helga from the danish of oehlenslæger the woods were in leaf and they cast a sweet shade among them walkd helga the beautiful maid the water is dashing oer yon little stones she sat down beside it and rested her bones she sat down and soon from a bush that was near sir fridleif approachd her with sword and with spear ah pity me helga and fly me not now i live only live on the smile of thy brow in thy fathers whole garden is found not a rose which bright as thyself and as beautiful grows sir fridleif thy words are but meant to deceive yet tell me what brings thee so late here at eve i cannot find rest and i cannot find ease though sweet sing the linnets among the wild trees if thou wilt but promise one day to be mine no more shall i sorrow no more shall i pine she sank in his arms and her cheeks were as red as the sun when he sinks in his watery bed but soon she arose from his loving embrace he walkd by her side through the wood for a space now listen young fridleif the gallant and bold take off from my finger this ring of red gold take off from my finger this ring of red gold and part with it not till in death thou art cold sir fridleif stood there in a sorrowful plight salt tears wet his eyeballs and blinded his sight go home and ill come to thy father with speed and claim thee from him on my mighty grey steed sir fridleif at night through the thick forest rode he fain would arrive at his lovd ones abode his harness was clanking his helm glitterd sheen his horse was so swift and himself was so keen he reachd the proud castle and jumpd on the ground his horse to the branch of a linden he bound he shoulderd his mantle of grey otter skin and through the wide door to sir erik went in here sittst thou sir erik

fridleif unbuckled his helmet and drank sweat sprung from his foreheadhis features grew blank i never have draind since the day i was born a bitterer draught from a costlier horn my course is completed my life is summd up for treason i smell in the dregs of the cup sir erik then said while he stampd on the ground young knight t is thy fortune to die like a hound my best belovd friend thou

the brave the knight bade his daughter come into the room look here my sweet child on thy merry bridegroom she lookd on the body and gave a wild start o father why hadst thou so cruel a heart she moand and lamented she ravd and she curst she lookd on her love till her very eyes burst at midnight sir erik was standing there mute with two pallid corses beside his cold foot he stood stiff and still and when morninglight came he stood like a post without life in his frame the youth and the maid were together interrd sir erik could not from his posture be stirrd he stood there as stiffly for thirty long days and lookd on the earth with a petrified gaze t is said on the night of the thirtieth long day to dust and to ashes he moulderd awaysir middel from the old danish so tightly was swanelil lacing her vest that forth spouted milk from each lilywhite breast that saw the queenmother and thus she begun what maketh the milk from thy bosom to run o this is not milk my dear mother i vow it is but the mead i was drinking just now ha out on thee minion these eyes have their sight wouldst tell me that mead in its colour is white well well since the proofs are so glaring and strong i

ashes at breaking of morn the maiden departed in anguish and wo and straight to sir middel it lists her to go arrivd at the portal she sounded the bell now wake thee love if thou art living and well

empty and wild she neither shall hang me nor burn thee my child collect what is precious in jewels and garb and ill to the stable and saddle my barb he gave her the cloak that he usd at his need and he lifted her up on the broadbosomd steed the forest is gaind and the city is past when her eyes to the heaven she wistfully cast what ails thee dear maid we had better now stay for thou art fatigud by the length of the way i am not fatigud by the length of the way but my seat is uneasy in truth i must say he spread on the cold earth his mantle so wide now rest thee my love and ill watch by thy side o jesus that one of my maidens were near the pains of a mother are on me i fear thy maidens are now at a distance from thee and thou art alone in the forest with me twere better to perish again and again than thou shouldst stand by me and gaze on my pain then take off thy kerchief and cover my head and perhaps i may stand in the wisewomans stead o christ that i had but a draught of the wave to quench my deaththirst and my temples to lave sir middel was to her so tender and true and he fetchd her the drink in her goldspangled shoe the fountain was distant and when he drew near two nightingales sat there and sang in his ear thy love she is dead and for ever at rest with two little babes that lie cold on her breastsuch was their song but he heeded them not and tracd his way back to the desolate spot but oh what a spectacle burst on his view for all they had told him was fatally true he dug a deep grave by the side of a tree and buried therein the unfortunate three as he clampd the mould down with his ironheeld boot he thought that the babies screamd under his foot then placing his weapon against a grey stone he cast himself on it and died with a groan ye maidens of norway henceforward beware for love when unbridled will end in despairelvirshades from the danish of oehlenslæger a sultry eve pursud a sultry day dark streaks of purple in the sky were seen and shadows half conceald the lonely way i spurrd my courser and more swiftly rode in moody silence through the forests green where doves and linnets had their lone abode it was my fate to reach a brook at last which by sweetscented bushes fencd around defiance bade to heat and nipping blast inclind to rest and hear the wild birds song i stretchd myself upon that brooks soft bound and there i fell asleep and slumberd long and only woke o wonder to perceive a goldhaird maiden as a snowdrop pale her slender form from out the ground upheave then fear oercame me and this daring heart beat three times audibly against my mail i wishd to speak but could no sound impart and see another maid rose up and took some drops of water from the foaming rill and gazd upon me with a wistful look said she what brings thee to this lonely place but do not fear for thou shalt meet no ill thou steelclad warrior full of youth and grace no sang the other in delightful tone but thou shalt gaze on prodigies which neer to mans unhallowd eye have yet been shown the brook which lately brawld among the trees stood still the murmur of that song to hear no green leaf stirrd and fetterd seemd the breeze the thrush upstarting in the distant dell shook its brown wing with golden streaks arrayd and apd the witchnotes as they rose and fell bright gleamd the lakes broad sheet of liquid blue where with the rabid pike the troutling playd the rose unlockd its folded leaves anew and blushd besprinkled with the nights cold tear once more the lily raisd its head and smild all ghastly white as when it decks the bier though sweet she sang my fears were not the less for in her accents there was something wild which i can feel t is true but not express come with us sang she deep below the earth where sun neer burns and stormwinds never rave come with us to our halls of princely mirth there thou shalt learn from us the runic laybut dip thee first in yonder crystal wave which binds thee to the elfin race for aye though painted flowers on earths breast abound yet we have far more lovely ones below like grass the chrysolites there strew the ground o come the other syren did exclaim for rubies there more red than roses grow the sapphirs blue the violet puts to shame i raisd my eyes to heavens starry dome and grippd my faulchion with convulsive might resolvd no witchcraft should my mind oercome my lengthend silence vexd the maidens sore wilt thou detain us here the livelong night or must we stripling proffer something more taught by us thou shalt bind the rugged bear seize on the mighty dragons heap of gold and slay the cockatrice while in her lair but from thy breast the blood we will suck out unless thou follow us beneath the mould decide decide nor longer pause in doubt cold sweat i shed and as with trembling hand i strove to whirl my beaming faulchion round it sank enthralld by magics potent band each witch drew nigh with dagger high upreard just then a cock beyond the wild woods bound crew loudand in the earth they disappeard i flung myself upon my frightend barb just as the shades began to grow less murk and sunbeams clad the sky in gayer garb let each young warrior from such places fly disease and death beneath the flowers lurk and elves would suck the warm blood from his eyethe heddybeespectre from the old danish i clomb in haste my dappled steed and gallopd far oer mount and mead and when the day drew nigh its close i laid me down to take repose i laid me down to take repose and slumbers sweet fell oer my brows and then methought as there i slept from out the ground the dead man leapt said he if thou art valiant knight my murder soon will see the light for thou wilt ride to heddybee where live my youthful brothers three and there too thou wilt surely find my father dear and mother kind and there sits kate my muchloved wife who with her women took my life they chokd me as in bed i lay then wrappd me in a truss of hay and bore me out at dead of night and

she mournd for her lover sir frovin the brave for he had embarkd on the boisterous wave and burning to gather the laurels of war had saild with king humble to orkney afar at feast and at revel wherever she went her thoughts on his perils and dangers were bent no joy has the heart that loves fondly and dear no pleasure save when the lovd object is near may asda walkd out in the bonny noontide and roamd where the beeches grew up in their pride she sat herself down on the green sloping hill where livd the erlpeople and where they live still then trembled the turf as she sat in repose and straight from the mountain three maidens arose and with them a loom and upon it a woof as white as the snow when it falls on the roof of red shining gold was the fairyloom made they sang and they dancd and their swift shuttles playd their song was of death and their song was of life it sounded like billows in tumult and strife they gave her the woof with a sorrowful look and vanishd like bubbles that burst on the brook but deep in the mountain was heard a sweet strain as the lady went home to her bower again the web was unfinishd she wove and she spun nor rested a moment until it was done and there was enough when the work was complete to form for a dead man a shirt or a sheet the heroes returnd from the wellfoughten field and bore home sir frovins corse laid on a shield sad sight for the maid but she still was alert and sewd round the body the funeral shirt and when she had come to the very last stitch her feelings so long suppressd rose to a pitch the cold clammy sweat from her features outbroke death struck her and meekly she bowd to the stroke she rests with her lover now deep in the grave and oer them the beeches their mossy boughs wave there sing the erlmaidens their ditties aloud and dance while the merry moon peeps from the cloudaager and eliza from the old danish have ye heard of bold sir aager how he rode to yonder isle there he saw the sweet eliza who upon him deignd to smile there he married sweet eliza with her lands and ruddy gold wo is me the monday after dead he lay beneath the mould in her bower sat eliza rent the air with shriek and groan all which heard the good sir aager underneath the granite stone up his mighty limbs he gatherd took the coffin on his back and to fair elizas bower hastend by the wellknown track on her chambers lowly

and cold wo is me the monday after dead she lay beneath the mouldsaint oluf from the old danish st oluf was a mighty king who ruld the northern land the holy christian faith he preachd and taught it sword in hand st oluf built a lofty ship with sails of silk so fair to hornelummer i must go and see whats passing there o do not go the seamen said to yonder fatal ground where savage jutts and wicked elves and demon sprites abound st oluf climbd the vessels side his courage nought could tame heave up heave up the anchor straight lets go in jesus name the cross shall be my faulchion now the book of god my shield and armd with them i hope and trust to make the demons yield and swift as eagle cleaves the sky the gallant vessel flew direct for hornelummers rock through oceans wavy blue t was early in the morning tide when she cast anchor there and lo the jutt stood on the cliff to breathe the morning air his eyes were like the burning beal his mouth was all awry the truth i tell and say he stood full twenty cubits high his beard was like a horses mane and down his bosom rolld the claws that fencd his finger ends were frightful to behold i never yet have seen he cried a ship come near my strand that here to shore i could not drag by putting out my hand the good st oluf smild thereat and thus addressd his crew now hold your tongues and well observe what im about to do the giant stretchd his mighty arm the ship was nigh his own but when st oluf raisd the cross he sank kneedeep in stonehere am i sunk kneedeep in stone my legs i cannot move but since my back and fists are free my might thou yet shalt prove be still be still thou noisy guest be still for evermore become a rock and beetle there above the billows hoar up started then from out the hill the demons hoary wife she cursd the king a thousand times and brandishd high her knife sore wonderd then the little elves who sat within the hill to see their mother all at once stand likewise stiff and still t is done they cried by yonder wight who rides upon the waves lets wade out to him through the surf and beat him with our staves at hornelummer happend then what happend neer before the elfins wishd to leave the hill and could not find a door they ran their heads against the wall and tried to break it through they could not break the solid rock but broke their necks in lieu now thanks to god and jesus christ and good st olufs arm to hornelummer we can sail without mishap or harmthe heroes of dovrefeld from the old danish on dovrefeld in norway were once together seen the twelve heroic brothers of ingeborg the queen and they were all magicians possest of mighty art who freely read the runic and knew the rhyme by heart the first could turn the lightning and quench its ruddy gleam the second with a whisper could still the running stream the third beneath the water could dive like any fish the fourth could get provision by striking on his dish the fifth upon the gold harp so pleasantly could play that all the men who heard him began to dance away the sixth he had a bugle and when he blew a blast the stoutest of his foemen would fly before him fast the seventh unimpeded through solid hills could roam the eighth could walk the ocean when billows were in foam the ninth could draw by magic the fishes from the deep the tenth was never weary nor overcome by sleep the eleventh bound the dragon which crept among the grass and all he wishd to happen was sure to come to pass the twelfth who was reputed the wisest of the band knew what was going forward in every foreign land and now forsooth i tell ye who listen to my strain that such a set of brothers will neer be seen againsvend vonved from the old danish grimm in the preface to his german translation of the kiæmpé viser characterizes this ballad in the following magnificent words seltsam ist das lied von dem held vonved unter dem empfang des zauberseegens und mit räthselhaften worten dass er nie wiederkehre oder dann den tod seines vaters rächen müsse reitet er aus lange sieht er keine stadt und keinen menschen dann wer sich ihm entgegen stelit den wirft er nieder den hirten legt er seine räthsel vor über das edelste und abscheuungswürdigste übar den gang der sonne und die ruhe des todten wer sie nicht iöst den erschlägt er trotzig sitzt er unter den helden ihre anerbietungen gefallen ihm nicht er reitet heim erschlägt zwölf zauberweiber die ihm entgegen kommen dann seine mutter endlich zernichtet er auch sein saitenspiel damit kein wohllaut mehr den wilden sinn besänftige es scheint dieses lied vor allen in einer eigenen bedeutung gedichtet und den mismuth eines zerstörten herumirrenden gemüths anzuzeigen das seine räthsel will gelöst haben es ist die angst eines menschen darin ausgedrückt der die flügel die er fühlt nicht frei bewegen kann und der wenn ihn diese angst peinigt gegen alles auch gegen sein liebstes wüthen muss dieser charakter scheint dem norden gantz eigenthümlich in dem seltsamen leben königs sigurd des jerusalemfahrers auch in shakspeares hamlet ist etwas ähnliches singular is the song of the hero vonved after having received the magic blessing he rides out darkly hinting that he must never return or have avenged the death of his father for a long time he sees no city and no man he then overthrows whomsoever opposes him he lays his enigmas before the herdsmen concerning that which is most grand and that which is most horrible concerning the course of the sun and the repose of the dead he who cannot explain them is slaughtered haughtily he sits among the heroestheir invitations do not please himhe rides home slays twelve sorceresses who come against himthen his mother and at last he demolishes his harp so that no sweet sound shall in future soften his wild humour this song more than any of the rest seems to be composed with a meaning of its own and shows the melancholy of a ruined wandering mind which will have its enigmas cleared up the anguish of a man is expressed therein who cannot move freely the wings which he feels and who when this anguish torments him is forced to deal out destruction against alleven against his bestbeloved such a character seems to be quite the property of the north in the strange life of king sigurd the wanderer to jerusalem and likewise in shakspeares hamlet there is something similar svend vonved sits in his lonely bower he strikes his harp with a hand of power his harp returnd a responsive din then came his mother hurrying in look out look out svend vonved in came his mother adeline and who was she

which from the days of arild have been much sung in denmark we find in it the names and bearings of most of those renowned heroes who are mentioned separately in other poems it divides itself into two parts the first which treats of the warriors bearings has a great resemblance to the th chapter of the vilkina saga as likewise has the last part wherein the duel is described to the th and st chapters of the same i cannot here forbear quoting and translating what anders sorensen vedel the good old editor of the first edition of the kiæmpé viser which appeared in says concerning the apparently superhuman performances of the heroes therein celebrated hvad ellers kiæmpernes storlemhed styrke og anden vilkaar berörer som overgaaer de menneskers der nu leve deres væxt og kraft det stykke kan ikke her noksom nu forhandles men skal i den danske krönikes tredie bog videligere omtales thi det jo i sandhed befindes og bevises af adskillige documenter og kundskab at disse gamle hellede som de kaldes have levet fast længer og været mandeligere större stærkere og höiere end den gemene mand er som nu lever paa denne dag that part which relates to these warriors size strength or other qualities so far surpassing the stature and powers of the men who now exist cannot be here sufficiently treated upon but shall be further discussed in the third book of the danish chronicles for in truth it is discovered and proved from various documents and sources that these old heroes as they are called lived much longer and were manlier stouter stronger and taller than man at the present day six score there were six score and ten from hald that rode that day and when they came to brattingsborg they pitchd their pavilion gay king nilaus stood on the turrets top had all around in sight

them stride not one of them all would have battled with him back would they all have hied it was vidrik verlandson he laughd at their craven fear how would ye have facd him when alive ye dare not him dead go near with his lances haft the body he pushd the head came toppling downthat the giant was a warrior stark forsooth i am forcd to own out took they then his ruddy gold and shard it amongst the band to vidrik came the largest part for t was earnd with his good hand little card he for the booty i ween but he thought of his meed of fame when men should say in the danish land that the giant he overcame so gladly rode they to bern again king diderik gladdest of all there causd he vidrik verlandson to sit next him in the hallelvir hill from the old danish upon this ballad oehlenslæger founded his elvir shades a translation of which has already been given i rested my head upon elvir hills side and my eyes were beginning to slumber that moment there rose up before me two maids whose charms would take ages to number one patted my face and the other exclaimd while loading my cheek with her kisses rise rise for to dance with you here we have sped from the undermost caves and abysses rise fairheaded swain and refuse not to dance and i and my sister will sing thee the loveliest ditties that ever were heard and the prettiest presents will bring thee then both of them sang so delightful a song that the boisterous river before us stood suddenly quiet and placid as though t were afraid to disturb the sweet chorus the boisterous stream stood suddenly still though accustomd to foam and to bellow and fearless the trout playd along with the pike and the pike playd with him as his fellow the fishes whose dwelling was deep in the flood up up from their caverns did sally the gay little birds of the forest began to warble forthwith in the valley now listen thou fairheaded swain and if thou wilt stand up and dance for a minute well teach thee to open the sorcerers book and to read all the runic thats in it the bear and the wolf thou shalt trammel unto the thick stem of the oak at thy pleasure before thee the dragon shall fly from his nest and shall leave thee sole lord of his treasure then about and around on the moonlight hill in their fairy fashion they sported while unmovd sat the gallant and fair young swain whom they in their wantonness courted and wilt thou not grant us our civil request proud stripling and wilt thou deny it by hells ruddy blazes our goldhandled knife shall lay thee for ever in quiet and if my good luck had not managd it so that the cock crew out then in the distance i should have been murderd by them on the hill without power to offer resistance t is therefore i counsel each young danish swain who may ride in the forest so dreary neer to lay down upon lone elvir hill though he chance to be ever so wearywaldemars chase the following ballad is merely a versification of one of the many feats of waldemar the famed phantom hunter of the north

peasant i saw something white just now through the cornstubble creeping which way did it go why methought to the beach then off went waldemar bounding a few minutes after they heard a faint screech and the horn of the hunter resounding then back came he laughing in horrible tone and the blood in their veins ran the colder when they saw that a freshslaughterd mermaid was thrown athwart his proud barbs dappled shoulder said he i have chasd her for seven score years as she landed to drink at the fountains no more did he deign to their terrified ears but gallopd away to the mountainsthe merman

deep blue there tempests and frequent disasters arise whilst free and untroubled we wend through the skies lo high among mountains a meadow lies spread and there we alight and get ready our bed there hatch we our eggs and beneath the chill pole we wait while the summer months over us roll no hunter desirous to make us his prey invades our lone valley by night or by day but greenmantled fairies their merry routs hold and fearless the pigmy there hammers its gold but when pallid winter again on the rocks shakes down in a shower the snow from his locks then comes the desire for heat in full

proud that holds the spirit of the hill who brings death in its hand so chill if down they do not quickly fall most certainly t will slay them all for sorely wrathful is its mood because they break its solitude because its treasure off they bear and fling light oer its gloomy lair t is white and kobbold is the name which it from oldest days does claim now back at once into time we go for many a hundred years i trow a gothic chamber salutes your sight a taper gleams feebly through the night a ghostly man by the board you see with his hand to his temples muses he parchments with age discolourd and dun ancient shields all written upon treebark bearing ciphers half defacd stones with runes and characters gracd things of more worth than ye are aware on the mighty table are pild up there he gazes now in exstatic trance through the casement out into natures expanse wheneer we sit at the lone midnight and stare out into the dubious light whilst the pallid moon is peering oer ruind cloister and crumbling tower feelings so wondrous strange come oer us the past and the future arise before us the present fadeth unmarkd away in the garb of insignificancy he gazes up into natures height the noble man with his eye so bright he gazes up to the starry skies whither sooner or later we hope to rise and now he takes in haste the pen and the spirit of oldom flows from it amain the scatterd gothsongs he changes unto an epic which maketh each bosom to glow thanks to the old monk toiling thus they call him saxo grammaticus an open field before you lies a windburst oer its bosom sighs now all is still all seems asleep midst of the field there stands a heap upon the heap stand runic stonesthereunder rest gigantic bones from arilds time that heap stands there but now t is tilld with utmost care in order that its owner may thereoff reap golden corn one day oft has he tried the niggard soul the mighty stones away to roll as useless burdens of his ground but they for that too big were found see see the moon through cloud and rack looks down upon the letters black and when the ghost its form uprears he shines upon its bursting tears for oh the moons an ancient man describe him mortal tongue neer can he shines alike serene and bright at midmost hour of witching night upon the spot of love and glee and on the gloomy gallowstree upon each rune behold him stare while off he hastes through fields of air he understands those signs ill gage whose meaning lies in sunken age and if he were in speaking state no doubt the old man could relate strange things that have on earth occurrd of which fame neer has said a word but since with look with look alone he cannot those events make known he waketh from his height sublime mere longing for the dark gone time the suicides grave from the german this piece is not translated for the sentiments which it contains but for its poetical beauties although the path of human life is rough and thorny the mind may always receive consolation by looking forward to the world to come the mind which rejects a future state has to thank itself for its utter misery and hopelessness the evening shadows fall upon the grave on which i sit it is no common heap below its turf are laid the bones of one who sick of life and misery did quench the vital spark which in his bosom burnd the shadows deepen and the ruddy tinge which lately flooded all the western sky has now diminishd to a single streak and here i sit alone and listen to the noise of forests and the hum of groves this is the time to think of natures god when birds and fountains streams and woods unite their varioussounding voices in his praise shall man alone refuse to sing ityes for man alone has nought to thank him for theres not a joy he gives to us on earth that is not dashd with bitterness and gall only when youth is past and age comes on do we find quietquiet is not bliss then tell me god what ive to thank thee for but to recur to him who rests beneathhe had a heart enthusiastic warm and formd for loveno prejudice dwelt there he roamd about the world to find a heart which felt with his he sought and found it not or if he found it providence steppd in and tore the cherishd object from his sight or filld its mind with visions weak and vain could he survive all this ah no he died died by the hand which injurd none but him and did he die unpitied and unwept most probably for there are fools who think t is crime in man to take what is his own and t was on account they laid him here within this sweet unconsecrated spot there comes a troop of maidens and of youths home from their labourhark they cease their song and pointing to the grave with trembling hands they make a circuit thinking that in me the ghost of the selfmurderer

translation of klingers faustus in and by a compilation of celebrated trials in the same year both these books appeared in london while he was engaged as a booksellers hack as described in lavengro in borrow returned to norwich and there he issued from the printinghouse of s wilkin in the upper haymarket these romantic ballads he had worked hard at collecting subscribers and two hundred copies were reserved for norwich at half a guinea each copy the remaining three hundred out of an edition of five hundred were sent to london some of these bear the imprint of john taylor waterloo place pall mall while the remainder bear the imprint of wightman cramp of paternoster row in the same year dr knapp only knew of the taylor edition because that is referred to in the correspondence copies however of the wightman cramp edition are in existence and the titlepage will be found reproduced with those of the first and second issue in the opening pages of this volume borrow sent copies to lockhart and cunningham advised gifts to other reviewers but not a single review of the book appeared yet his subscription list amply paid all expenses as borrow states in a letter to cunningham that list reveals the fact that such diverse persons as dr bathurst bishop of norwich and thurtell the murderer of mr weare were among the norwich subscribers while benjamin haydon john timbs and thomas campbell paid their halfguineas from london thurtell we may add was hanged before the book appearedappendix no
