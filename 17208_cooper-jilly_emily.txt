jilly cooper emily to claire with love chapter one if nina hadnt bugged me id never have gone to annie richmonds party cedric is beginning to take you for granted she said hurling clothes into a weekend case cedric i said crossly is getting his career together as soon as hes adopted as a candidate well get married because its better for candidates to have wives said nina he shouldnt leave you alone so much your first weekend back from holiday looking a million and a half dollars anyone else wouldnt be able to keep his hands off you but old seedcake just swans off to another political rally im very happy about my relationship with cedric and thats mine i snapped removing a yellow shirt she was surreptitiously packing in one corner of her case cedric keeps me on the straight and narrow i went on hes turned you into a bore said nina you used to be lovely company when you were playing fast and loose with half of london i want a sense of purpose in my life i protested i dont want to die in chelsea with my knickers down nina went to the mirror and started slapping mantan all over her face where are you off to i said home i dont want my mother fussing about me looking washed out and tomorrow im going out with an amazingly dishy new man now arent you jealous no i lied you just give up certain things when youre engaged like fun just because seedcakes put a ring on your finger he thinks hes entitled to neglect you all the time i think you ought to go to annie richmonds orgy shes got this fantastically goodlooking cousin coming if he gave you a whirl youd soon forget about seedcake dont call him that i stormed anyway ive nothing in common with annie richmonds friends any more nina laughed meaningly you mean cedric hasnt she reminds him of your past and that comehither look your eyes had once youre scared of going because you think you might fancy someone if you were really hooked on seedcake you wouldnt be frightened to go i felt depressed after shed gone id done all the boring things like washing my hair shaving my legs and doing my nails yesterday in the hope that i might see cedric tonight after a few minutes moping i settled down to halfheartedly cleaning the flat then washing the suntanoil out of a few shirts i looked at cedrics photograph beside my bed thought how goodlooking he was then i read a book on conservative policy it was incredibly boring and nearly sent me to sleep cedric telephoned as he said he would on the dot of ten oclock how heavenly to hear you darling i said overwhelmed with love how are you oh full of beans he said in his hooray political voice which meant there were people in the room as he told me what a success the meeting had been and how well his speech had gone i examined the diamond and sapphire ring hed given me finally he said what are you going to do with yourself all weekend annie richmonds throwing an orgy i said lightly as youre not here i was thinking of going cedric laughed heartily and disbelievingly i thought youd grown out of that sort of party he said i must go darling ill ring you on monday and well have dinner take care of yourself and remember no orgies theyre bad for my reputation i put the telephone down feeling extremely irritated what was the point of spending ten days alone in the south of france cedric naturally couldnt get away boring myself silly getting a suntan for his sake when he wasnt around to appreciate it i looked out at the september evening the dusk with its suggestion of autumn and nights drawing in and another year passing shot waves of repressed lust through me i thought of sex and sin and all the men in the world id never have the chance to get my hands on now it was such a long long time since id been to a good party cedric thought all my friends so frivolous and idiotic hed scared them away i looked at his photograph again short fair hair clear blue eyes a determined chin life is earnest life is real i said to myself firmly cedric would hate me to go to annie richmonds orgy so i wont go an hour later feeling horribly guilty i crept up the stairs to annie richmonds flat having heard the roar of the party all the way down the street annie opened the door emily she cried joyfully giving me a huge hug i never dreamed youd come she was wearing a dress so cut out there was hardly any of it left i was wearing a backless black dress pretty low at the front and welded together with safety pins as usual which id never dared show cedric id put on weight since i last wore it and was falling out all over the place i just hoped i looked a bit like sophia loren annie looked at me with approval stripped for action thats more like the old emily she said handing me a glass ive only just popped in for a quick drink i said cedrics away i know she smiled knowingly theres lots of talent in there so go in and forage for yourself the next room was impossibly clamorously full of goodlooking people trying to shout each other down i felt very nervous so i drank my disgusting drink straight down and quickly had another i didnt know a soul but then annie turned over her friends so fast a handsome australian in a red shirt came over and started to chat me up his eyes smouldered under bushy black eyebrows i knew that look of old i feel i know every inch of you already so lets get on with it it stated unequivocally bloody awful row he said pity i cant lipread he gazed at my mouth and then at my black dress which was descending fast any minute id be topless i heaved it up leave it he said im enjoying the view he was clearly a superstud and would have whipped me down the passage and under annies duvet in two seconds flat but i wanted to stay upright not flat suppressing the waves of lust that were sweeping over me i started to shout at him about cedric and his political career he cant have heard much of what i was saying but seemed to get the message and drifted off i was then collared by an ancient or more an elderly wren a model with long red hair and skinny white hands who went on and on about her split ends suddenly there was a commotion by the door but annie said a mans voice i thought i was coming to an orgy where are the walltowall couples the lovely girls in tiger skins split ends caught her breath i like everyone else turned around my jaw clanged for standing in the doorway was one of the most sensationally attractive men i had ever seen he was tall with broadish shoulders long black hair restless dark eyes with a wicked gleam in them and an arrogant sulky mouth he oozed sexuality he looked round the room as cool and haughty as a prince yet he had an explosive quality ive come out of the jungle and noones going to tame me he seemed to say every woman in the room was going mad with desire me included the only problem was a very beautiful dark girl dressed in what looked like a bikini entirely made of flowers who was hanging possessively on his arm you promised me an orgy annie he said coldly all i can see here is a debs teaparty annie richmond took him and the dark girl by the arm and hustled them towards the bar itll start warming up soon i could hear her saying theres a lot of fun people coming later i noticed she gave him a whole bottle of whisky to himself while the rest of us had to make do with the revolting cough mixture gradually the conversation started to soar and dip again whos that everyone was asking i turned to split ends whos that i said she looked at me incredulously you mean to say you dont know a stockbroker with a pink face whose eyes were about level with my cleavage came past and filled up our glasses thats rory balniel he said hes a bit of a menace hes annies cousin said split ends watering at the mouth and quite the most evil man in london in what way i asked oh getting drunk and breaking peoples hearts deliberately everything you can think of and a lot more besides he looks like the leader of a cossack horde i said what nationality is he scottish with foreign i think french on one side his family own masses of land in the highlands but all the moneys tied up in trusts and he cant get his hands on it hes been sent down from everywhere imaginable he hit london about a month ago i dont think hes been sober since hes a bit of a menace repeated the stockbroker looking longingly at my cleavage hes supposed to be a very good painter said split ends the only thing hes been painting recently is the town red said the stockbroker he treats women appallingly said split ends has he treated you appallingly i asked not yet she said with a sigh but im working on it i looked around again rory balniel was leaning against the mantelpiece two girls who looked as though the head groom had been polishing and currycombing them for weeks so sleek and patently glossy were they were vying for his attention he filled up their glasses from the whisky bottle then suddenly he lifted his head yawned slightly and looked in my direction i shot him a glance i hadnt used in months one of pure naked comehithering sex it didnt work he looked away without interest hard luck said split ends avidly drinking in this classic case of indifference at first sight youre obviously not his type hes probably queer i said crossly most don juans are latent homosexuals anyway split ends looked at me pityingly then grabbed a plate of food from a nearby table im going to offer him a stuffed date she said with a giggle and wheeled across the room towards him i turned my back and talked to the stockbroker it was a calculated gesture if anything was likely to turn rory balniel on it was my back brown smooth and bare from the nape of my neck almost to the base of my spinal column unmarred by any bikini marks i imagined his dark restless eyes ranging over me and thinking thats the sort of girl who sunbathes without a bikini top mettlesome ready for anything even being treated appallingly by rory balniel but when i looked around he was talking to split ends and was still hemmed in by the masses sexless beast i decided or perhaps its my sex appeal thats slipping cedric was right these people were frivolous and uninteresting the evening wore on people were dancing in the next room drinking a lot and necking a little noone was actually orgying i kept making up my mind to go home but some instinctive lack of selfpreservation made me stay i felt jolted uneasy and horribly aware of rory balniel there was an unconscious glitter about him a sinister stillness that set him apart from everyone else one had to admit his force split ends and the girl hed arrived with who i discovered was called tiffany i bet she made it up were still trying to engage his attention he was laughing a lot at their jokes but a little late on cue as he filled his glass his hand was quite steady only the glint in his eyes betrayed how much hed drunk annie richmond went up to him and removed the bottle of whisky rory love i dont mean to nag women always say that when theyre about to nag he said taking the whisky back from her people were really getting uncorked now couples had disappeared into other rooms a beautiful african girl was dancing by herself a fat man was telling filthy stories to an ugly american girl who had passed out on the floor the australian in the red shirt who had chatted me up earlier turned out to be split ends boyfriend he was not pleased at her paying so much attention to rory balniel and came strutting into the room wearing a mickey mouse mask expecting everyone to laugh where did you get that mask said rory balniel annie gave it to me you should wear it all the time every day always to the office it suits you gives your face a distinction it didnt have before dont be stupid said the australian furiously wrenching off the mask he nearly tripped over the ugly american girl who was now snoring on the floor jesus christ why doesnt somebody move her shes quite happy said rory balniel i expect she needs sleep anyway she gives the room a livedin feeling someone might tread on her face said the australian lugging her out of the way good thing too it could only improve things said rory balniel he was trying to balance a glass on one of his fingers managing to look like a siamese cat inevitably the glass crashed to the floor split ends and tiffany howled with laughter a blonde attracted by the tinkle of broken glass came over and joined the group i hear you paint she said id love to sit for you sometime rory balniel looked her over but would you lie for me later darling thats the point he started to undo the buttons of split ends dress i say said the pinkfaced stockbroker you cant do that here unfair to annie know what i mean no said rory balniel unpleasantly he had now undone all split ends buttons to reveal a very dirty bra dont she said crossly trying to do them up again his dark face set into a mask of malice if you throw yourself open to the public sweetheart you must expect people to want to see over you split ends flounced off good riddance said the blonde snuggling up to him shes a silly cow he said unemotionally draining his drink what did you say said the australian who was still smarting under the crack about the mickey mouse mask are you referring to my girlfriend i was referring to the silly cow said rory and if shes your girlfriend shes even stupider than she looks and dont come on all macho with me you bloody colonial or ill kick you back down under where you belong picking up a wine bottle he deliberately cracked it on the edge of the mantelpiece and brandished the jagged end in the australians face the australian clenched his fists ill call the police he said halfheartedly what are you going to call the police said rory balniel he picked up another glass from the mantelpiece and smashed it on the floor the australian puffed out his cheeks and then beat a hasty retreat the two girls roared with laughter again enjoying themselves hugely then they looked around for the next distraction hes absolutely poisonous i decided how does anyone put up with him picking his way disapprovingly over the broken pieces of glass the little stockbroker came over and asked me to dance i told you he was a menace did i not he asked in an undertone he then proceeded to make the most ferocious passes at me on the dance floor i can never understand why little men are so lecherous i suppose its more concentrated fortunately one of my safety pins gave way and plunged into him which cooled his ardour a bit but two seconds later he was back on the attack a quarter of an hour later black and blue and as mad as a wet cat i returned to collect my bag i was really leaving this time i found rory balniel was sitting on the sofa tiffany and the blonde on either side of him both girls were holding hands with each other across him but were so tight neither of them realized it rory darling whispered the blonde rory angel murmured tiffany it looked so ridiculous i burst out laughing he looked up and started to laugh too i think theyre made for each other he said and extracting himself got up and came over i leaned against the wall partly because i was slewed partly because my legs wouldnt hold me up the impact of this man close up was absolutely faintmaking hullo he said hullo i said ive always been a wizard at repartee he looked me over consideringly as if i was a colour chart and he was selecting a shade the drink has run out he said taking a final slug of whisky from the bottle he had very white even teeth but his fingers were quite heavily stained with nicotine what did you say your name was he said his voice had lost its earlier bitchy ring it was soft and husky now i didnt i said but since you ask its emily emily pretty name oldfashioned name are you an oldfashioned girl depends what you mean by oldfashioned prunes and prisms victorian or nell gwyn he took my hand hes drunk i said to myself firmly trying not to faint with excitement youre like a little renoir he said are those the outsize ones all grapes and rippling with flesh i said no thats rubens renoirs are soft and blonde and blueeyed with pink flesh tones its funny he added shooting me an exocet look youre not my type at all but you excite the hell out of me i looked down and to my horror saw that my fingers were coiling around his and watched my only unbitten nail gouging into the centre of his palm then suddenly i felt his fingers on my engagement ring i tried to jerk my hand away but he held on to it and examined the ring carefully who gave that to you he said cedric i said my er fiancé its a terrible word isnt it i gave a miserable insincere little giggle its a terrible ring too he said it cost a lot of money i said defensively why isnt he here i explained about cedric being in norfolk and furthering his political career how long have you been engaged nearly eighteen months the smile rory balniel gave me wasnt at all pleasant does he make love on all four channels he said i tried but failed to look affronted he doesnt make love to me much at all i muttered rory balniel was swinging the empty whisky bottle between finger and thumb he doesnt care about you at all does he cedric and i have a good thing going if youre mad about a girl you dont let her out of your sight instinctively my eyes slid to tiffany who was now sleeping peacefully her head on the blonde girls shoulder im not exactly mad about her he said shes stunning looking i said wistfully he shrugged his shoulders rollsroyce body maybe but a purley mind i giggled again suddenly he bent his head and kissed my bare shoulder i could feel the ripples of excitement all the way down to my toes any moment my dress safety pins and all was going to burst into flames i could have died with excitement i took a deep breath ive got a bottle of whisky at home i said well lets go then he said chapter two i wasnt proud of my behaviour i knew i was treating cedric abominably but then id never before in my life encountered such a personification of temptation as rory balniel and like oscar wilde ive always been able to resist anything except temptation we wandered along the kings road trying to find a taxi and giggling a great deal as we tried out all the baths sitting outside the bath shop then we passed an art gallery rory peered moodily through the window at the paintings look at that crap he said there but for the gracelessness of god go i the greatest genius of the twentieth century which reminds me ive got to see a man about my painting at eleven tomorrow youd better set your alarm clock when we get home presumptuous i thought does he think ill succumb so easily rory suddenly saw a taxi and flagged it down we kissed all the way home god i was enjoying myself id never felt a millionth of that raging abandoned glory the whole time id known cedric as the taxi chugged along and the orange numbers on the meter rocketed relentlessly upwards so did my temperature rory had such a marvellously lean broadshouldered body it must have been something to do with both being an artist and having gallic blood but he was certainly an artist at french kissing all the same somewhere inside me an insistent voice was warning me to call a halt i was backsliding at the speed of light doing all the things id done before id met cedric giving in too quickly losing too quickly and feeling just as insecure and unhappy as id been in the past ill say goodbye to him firmly at the door i told myself then when we got to the door i thought ill just give him a very quick drink to be sociable and then out he goes no sooner had we entered the flat and id given him some whisky than i rushed off to the bathroom cleaned my teeth and emptied half a bottle of ninas scent over myself i then went and removed the georgette heyer novel from my bedside table and replaced it with a couple of intellectual french novels i went into the drawingroom where did you learn to pour drinks like this one he asked i once worked in a bar i replied this is a septuple said rory draining the glass im seeing septuple i said after all the booze ive shipped i can see at least seven of you at the moment a magnificent seven admittedly then we can have a gangbang said rory with a whoop annies orgy is going to materialize after all primly i sat down on the sofa he sat beside me well orgy on he asked staring at me but making no move i hunted around nervously for something to say keep still he said youve got something in your hair i never knew if i had or i hadnt but he removed whatever it was and then unsmilingly he came closer and kissed me after a while i had a pang of conscience and tried to push him away ill make some coffee i muttered really i am engaged to cedric and he wouldnt approve at all shut up he said gently very slowly he undid all the safety pins holding my dress together first the one joining the bodice and shoulderstrap then the little gold pin just below the zip top and finally the two securing my strapless bra naked to the waist now i still couldnt move little renoir he said softly stop i said to myself but i couldnt move it was morning when i woke i hadnt closed the curtains properly so the sun seared straight into my eyes like a laser beam even more searing was cedrics smile his photograph stared right at me frantic with thirst i reached for the glass by the bed gulped at it and nearly threw up it was whisky inching my hand to the right i practically went through the ceiling as i encountered a body cedrics i gave a groan cedric was in norfolk rallying the faithful the unfaithful was lying in my bed i drew back the covers to look at the man beside me one glance told me i had impeccable taste when i was drunk and total lack of judgement too by allowing myself to get laid on the first date slowly piecing the evening together i looked at the clock half past ten i was supposed to wake him up to see a man about some paintings i got up and washed my face looked all blotchy like garlic sausage so i slapped on some casuallooking makeup then i threw a handful of alkaseltzers into a glass of water waited until the froth subsided drank it down and went back to bed i think rory was still drunk when i woke him up he got up drew the curtains and then groped for a cigarette what happened last night oh rory i wailed dont you remember anything well i remember spending a rainsoaked childhood among the sheep in scotland and being sacked from harrow and being sent down from oxford i remember coming to london to sell some paintings after that i think the drink took over then there seems to have been a lot of parties we were at annie richmonds party i said so we were and we both had quite a bit to drink and then we came back here well well well he said getting into the crumpled bed and did we oh god cant you remember that was i er did i perform adequately he didnt seem embarrassed only curious you were absolutely sensational thats what makes it so awful i said and rolling over i buried my face in the pillow and burst into tears he stroked my hair but i went on sobbing im not usually like this i dont just pick up men at parties and leap into bed with them on the first night at least not recently i wailed and youd better step on it youve got to see that man about your paintings at eleven oclock so i have slowly he clambered out of bed and started to get dressed i was shot through with misery but i tried to make a joke of the situation dont think ive enjoyed meeting you because i havent i said with a deliberate sniff he laughed and when he had dressed and cut himself shaving on ninas pink plastic razor he came back into the bedroom and said youll remember exactly what happened last night wont you when i write my memoirs ill need to pick your brains i pulled a pillow over my head there arent any to pick i groaned see you he said then he was gone i went through every kind of hell wondering if hed come back i castigated myself for the insanity of going to annie richmonds party for letting rory make love to me which despite his not remembering anything about it had been an utterly intoxicating experience which would spoil me for cedric for evermore the telephone rang three times each time for nina and each time the caller got his head bitten off for not being rory at four oclock realizing he wasnt coming back i got up had a bath cried for an hour and then poured myself a large whisky really i was acquiring a lot of bad habits id be eating between meals soon at six oclock the doorbell rang keep calm i told myself play it cool its bound to be the milkman or some salvation army lady after loot but it was rory swaying in the doorway and looking green ive just been sick in a dustbin he said i laughed trying to keep the joy out of my face come in i said he headed straight for the whisky may i have a drink he said my hangover ought to go down in medical history childbirth has nothing on it he had the most awful shakes theres a reason for all this drinking he went on but at the moment im glad to say i cant remember what it is i really oughtnt to have come back im afraid ive run out of money ive always wanted to keep a man i said stick with me baby and youll be up to your ears in racehorses its not as bad as that i got on well at the art gallery did he like your paintings i said he nodded hes going to give me an exhibition in the spring but thats wonderful i said youll be famous i know he peered in the mirror pushing a lock of black hair out of his eyes i dont think it suits me i feel terrible you ought to eat something i said youre admirable i wish i had a mother that fussed over me like that in fact he was very ill all night and most of the next day delirious and with a raging temperature pouring with sweat clinging to me muttering incoherently and shaking like a puppy on sunday night however he felt better suddenly picking up cedrics photograph he threw it out of the window that wasnt very friendly i said listening to the tinkle of broken glass whens he coming back tomorrow cedrics very good to me he keeps me on the rails before i met him it was one layabout after another the restless dark eyes travelled over me thats because youre a giver emily and you hate hurting people you slept with all those men because you couldnt say no rather than because you wanted to say yes oh not always anyway there werent that many of them in single figures that is if i rang you up and asked you out he went on undeterred even if you didnt fancy me youd say yes because you couldnt bear to upset me then youd send me a cable at the last moment or get one of your mates to ring up and say you were dying of food poisoning how do you know i said sulkily i know he said and pulled me into his arms the waves of lust were rippling all over me again youre ill i protested not that ill he said i like sleeping with you he said a couple of hours later lets get married i looked at him incredulously reeling from the shock youd better send cedric a telegram immediately he said i dont want him hanging around being a bloody nuisance to us did you say you wanted to marry me i whispered you cant want to marry me i mean what about all those girls after you you could marry anyone why me im kinky that way he said ill try anything once but where will we live i said bewildered in scotland ive got a place up there im much nicer in scotland london does frightful things to me and im due to inherit a bit of money shortly so we wont starve but but i stammered i really wanted him to take me in his arms and say he loved me to distraction but then the telephone rang rory picked it up hullo whos that oh cedric a slightly malicious gleam came into his eyes we havent met my names balniel rory balniel how was the political rally oh well thats splendid you deserve some compensation because im afraid emily has just agreed to marry me and shell be dispensing with your disservices from now on oh no i protested poor cedric i could hear him spluttering away on the other end of the telephone well im afraid youve lost your deposit on this one said rory and put down the receiver cedric will be very very angry i said in awe chapter three cedric wasnt the only one who was angry annie richmond was livid too you cant marry rory hes never been faithful to anyone for more than five minutes hes immoral and dreadfully spoilt he even used to cheat at conkers when he was a little boy nina was even more discouraging genuine concern for me combined when shed actually met rory in the flesh with overwhelming envy i know hes lovely to look at but hes an absolute devil youre batting out of your league cedric was far more suitable it was you in the first place i said crossly who was so against cedric and hustled me off to annie richmonds party i never dreamed youd go to these extremes where are you going to live in the highlands on an island it sounds too romantic for words nina sighed it is not romantic living on an island what will you do except talk to sheep and go mad while he slaps paint on canvases all day you wont hold him in a million years youll be thoroughly miserable and then come and snivel all over me the only thing a whirlwind courtship does is blow dust in everyones eyes i didnt care i was hanging from chandeliers swinging round lampposts i was so deranged with love i didnt know what to do with myself i felt i was drowning and i didnt want anyone to save me another aspect that delighted me was the being married part of the whole thing id never been cut out for a career and the thought that i could chuck in my ninetofive job and spend the rest of my life looking after rory filled me with joy i had fantasies of greeting him at the door after a hard day at his studio a beautiful child hanging on each hand three days later rory and i were married at chelsea register office i had been to see the renoirs at the tate and wore a laura ashley dress and a black breton on the back of my head even nina admitted i looked good rory was waiting when we arrived smoking and gazing moodily at the road it was the first time id seen him in a suit pale grey velvet with a black shirt isnt he the most beautiful thing youve ever seen i said rapturously yes said nina it isnt too late to change your mind he smiled when he saw us then his narrowed eyes fixed coldly on my hat tearing it from my head he threw it on the ground and kicked it into the kings road where a milk van ran over it dont you ever dare wear a hat again he said ruffling my hair then he took my hand and led me into the register office afterwards we had a party and drank champagne and flew to paris for our honeymoon when we arrived at our hotel which was pretty with shutters vines and pink geraniums overlooking the seine rory ordered more champagne he was in a strange wild mood i wondered how much hed drunk before he got to the register office i very much wanted him to pounce on me and ravish me at once i suddenly felt apprehensive lost and very much alone i went off and had a bath isnt that what all brides do all my things were new sponge bag flannel talcum powder toothbrush even my name was new emily balniel i said it over and over to myself as i lay in the bath with the water not too hot so i wouldnt emerge like a lobster i rubbed scented bath oil into every inch of my body and put on a new white negligée fantastically expensive and pretty and virginal i went into the bedroom and waited for rorys gasp of approval it never came he was on the telephone his face ashen hullo he was saying hullo yes its me all right i know its been a long time where am i in paris at the reconnaissance do you remember the reconnaissance darling i just wanted to tell you that i got married this afternoon so that makes us level again doesnt it and with a ghastly expression of triumph on his face he dropped the telephone back in its cradle who were you ringing i asked he looked at me for a minute as though i were a stranger there was the same sinister stillness the lurking danger that id been so aware of the first night i met him who was it i asked again mind your own business he snarled just because ive married you it doesnt give you the right to question all my movements i felt as though hed hit me for a minute we stared at each other bristling with hostility then he pulled himself together apologized for jumping down my throat and began to kiss me almost frenziedly when i woke up in the middle of the night i found him standing by the window smoking a cigarette he had his back to me but there was something infinitely despairing about the hunched set of his shoulders with a sick feeling of fear i wondered why he had felt it necessary to ring up a woman on the first night of his honeymoon and taunt her with the fact that hed just got married marriage as i discovered on my honeymoon may be a bed of roses but there are plenty of thorns lying around not that i found myself loving rory any the less rather the reverse but he was not easy to live with to begin with i never knew what mood he was going to be in there were the prolonged black glooms followed by sudden firework bursts of affection followed by an abstracted fit when he would sit for hours watching the sun on the plane trees outside our window there were also the sudden uncontrollable rages in a smart french restaurant he had picked up a dish of potato purée and hurled it at a passing fly i also had to get used to everyone looking at rory rather than at me and that was another thing about marriage i couldnt spend hours tarting myself up to compete with all those svelte french women if rory suddenly decided he wanted to go out it was straight out of bed into the shower and what the hell do you want to bother with makeup for i found being with him day in day out slightly claustrophobic there wasnt a moment to shave my armpits or touch up the roots of my hair he did quite a lot of work i was longing for him to sketch me and kept sweeping my hair back for him to admire the beauty of my bone structure but he was far more interested in drawing old men and women with wrinkled faces in cafés the drawings were amazingly good chapter four we were sitting in bed one afternoon after one of those heavy french lunches when suddenly there was a pounding on the door who the hells that i asked a chambermaid gone berserk and unable to contain herself said rory and shouted something very impolite in french the pounding went on perhaps its the flics said rory getting out of bed and putting on his trousers through a haze of alcohol i looked at his tousled black hair and broad brown shoulders swearing he unlocked the door a beautiful woman stood there chérie she cried ecstatically bébé i knew you were ere the man on the desk was so discreet he refuse to admit it and flinging her arms round rorys neck she kissed him on both cheeks i think you are ver unkind she went on reproachfully in a strong french accent sloping off and getting married without a word to anyone i mean think of the wedding presents you missed rory looked half exasperated half amused im afraid this is my mother he said oh gosh i squeaked how fright i mean how lovely how do you do it was a fine way to meet ones motherinlaw for the first time sitting up in bed wearing nothing but a crumpled sheet and a bright smile this is emily said rory rorys mother rushed across the room and hugged me but you are so pretty she said this pleases me very much i keep telling rory to find a nice wife and settle down i know you will make im appy and he will start behaving beautifully ill try i faltered she was stunning looking lush opulent exotic with huge dark blue eyes hair dyed the most terrific shade of strawberry blonde the most marvellous legs and lots of jewellery it was easy to see from where rory got his trafficstopping looks one of her eyelids was made up with brilliant violet eyeshadow the other smeared with emerald green i have just been to dior for a fitting i tried out their new makeup its a very pretty shade of green no wheres buster asked rory coming later she said hes having a drink with some friends hes lying said rory he couldnt possibly have a friend rorys mother giggled now chérie you must not be naughty buster is my second usband she explained to me rorys father hector was my first when i marry buster rory say to me youre getting better at choosing husbands maman but not much rorys mother suddenly gave a shriek ah mon dieu i remember the taxi is still waiting downstairs we ave run out of money we knew you would have some rory youre so rich now could you ring down and get the manager to pay the taxi rory looked at her with intense irritation then he laughed picked up the telephone and gabbled away in french ask im to send up some champagne said rorys mother at least two bottles i want to drink my new daughterinlaws health you must call me coco she said i caught rorys eye and tried not to giggle everything was getting out of hand later when the champagne arrived rory said why have you run out of money pa didnt leave you badly off of course he didnt darling it was just that we had to have central heating for the castle or wed have frozen to death and a sauna bath and a flagellation room said rory of course darling buster as been used to the best and hes been shooting four or five times a week and that all adds up everythings in such a muddle we cant decide whether we want to spend the winter in irasa she turned to me i hope youre going to like our island chérie those highland winters can be very terrible and its so boring seeing the same old people all the time and all those sheep thats what busters seeing his friend about what said rory buying this aeroplane he thinks he can get it cheap then we can all escape to london or paris or the riviera when we feel like it rory raised his eyes to heaven he does need it darling said coco almost pleadingly who told you we were here marina did she telephoned me in cannes to tell me the news the bitch said rory whos marina i asked marina maclean said coco at least she was now shes marina buchanan shes just married hamish buchanan whos very rich and more than twice her age she lives on the island too i saw her just before we left rory she didnt look very happy sort of feverish shes spending a fortune on clothes and jewellery thats what comes of trying to marry ones grandfather said rory unemotionally hamish looks terrible too said coco hes suddenly gone all hip growing his hair not eating meat and dancing in the modern way trying to keep up with marina i suppose he looks twenty years older oh well its no use wasting sympathy on marina shes made her bed and now shes about to lie in someone elses said rory oh look here comes buster i should like to get dressed i said plaintively oh nobody dresses for buster said rory buster macpherson when he arrived turned out to be the kind of man my mother would have gone mad for he had wellbrushed blond hair and blue eyes that let out a perpetual sparkle he looked like the hero in a boys comic he showed a lot of filmstar teeth he was absolutely not my type he had none of rorys explosive feline grace but he obviously exerted considerable fascination over coco who although she didnt look a day over thirtyfive must have been nearing fifty and a good ten years older than buster congratulations you chaps said buster he peered through the gloom at me under my sheet may i kiss the bride he asked no said rory youd better watch buster hes going through the change of life buster shot him an unfriendly look helped himself to a large glass of champagne and sat down ah honeymoons honeymoons he said shaking his head did you buy that aeroplane asked rory i think so said buster coco gave a crow of delight where are you going to land it asked rory in the high street no said coco weve got a little runway on the island now i knew i had something to tell you darling finn maclean is back rorys eyes narrowed the hell he is whats he poking his nose into now hes thrown up his smart harley street practice and come back to irasa as medical officer overseeing all the islands said buster hes persuaded the scottish medical board to build him a cottage hospital in the old church hall and buy him an aeroplane so he can hop from island to island our own flying doctor said rory why the hell has he come back i think he wanted to get out of london said buster his marriage broke up not surprised said rory no woman in her right senses could stand him finn maclean is marinas elder brother coco explained to me rory and he dont get on you understand he never got on with rorys father either he kept complaining about the poorness of the tenants hes an arrogant sod said rory you wont like him i rather like him mused coco he does not have the bedroom manner but he is all man life on irasa i decided certainly wasnt going to be dull the unpredictable marina running rings round her ancient husband rory feuding with finn maclean who was all man plus buster and coco a knockabout comedy act in themselves this is a nice hotel said coco meditatively trying on some of my scent can you get buster and me a room here rory no i cant said rory i happen to be on my honeymoon and id like to get on with it without your assistance chapter five after a fortnight rory started getting restless and decided to return to england we stopped in london and booked in at the ritz i must say i did enjoy being rich it was such bliss not having to look at the prices on the menu we were in the middle of dinner i lingering over a crêpe suzette because it was so delicious and rory halfway through his second bottle of wine gazing moodily out at green park where the yellow leaves whirled and eddied away from the wet black branches of the plane trees suddenly he summoned a waiter i want my bill he said adding to me finish up that revolting pudding were going home tonight but were booked in here i protested doesnt matter if we hurry we can catch the sleeper but its friday night i said well never get a bed want to bet said rory we tore across london in a taxi fortunately the streets were deserted and reached euston station just five minutes before the train was due to pull out youll never get on said the man at the booking office its fully booked what did i tell you i grumbled well have to sleep in a cattle truck stop whining said rory his eyes roved round the station suddenly they lit on one of those motorized trolleys that carry parcels round stations and are always running one over on the platform it was coming towards us stepping forward rory flagged it down the driver was so surprised he screeched to a halt and watched in amazement as rory piled our suitcases on what the bleeding hell do you think youre doing mate he said drive us up platform to the firstclass sleeper for glasgow said rory you want me to do what asked the driver go on said rory icily well miss the train if you dont hurry he climbed on and pulled me up beside him we cant i whispered in horror well get arrested shut up snarled rory go on he added to the driver we havent got all bloody day there was something about rorys manner a combination of arrogance and an expectation that everyone was going to do exactly what he wanted that made it almost impossible to oppose him grumbling that hed get the sack for this the driver set off cant you go any faster asked rory coldly the driver eyed the fiver in rorys hand you wont get a penny of this said rory unless we catch that train we gathered speed and amazingly stormed through the barrier unopposed and up the platform train doors were being slammed as we reached the sleeper put the luggage on the train said rory to the driver and strolled over to the attendant who was giving his lists a lastminute check i edged away terrified there was going to be a scene im afraid were booked solid sir i heard the attendant say didnt the ritz ring through said rory his voice taking on that carrying bitchy upperclass ring afraid not sir said the attendant bloody disgrace cant rely on anyone these days expect your side slipped up one of your staff must have forgotten to pass on the message the attendant quailed before rorys steely gaze he took off his peak cap and scratched his head well what are you going to do about it said rory im on my way back from my honeymoon my wife is quite exhausted we booked a sleeper and now youre trying to tell me youve given it away as the attendant looked in my direction i edged further away trying to merge into a slot machine i really dont know what to say sir if you value your job said rory youd better do something about it two minutes later an enraged middleaged couple in pyjamas were being shunted into a carriage down the train im awfully sorry sir the attendant was saying you might have thanked him i said sitting down on the bed and admiring the splendour of our firstclass compartment one doesnt thank peasants said rory pulling off his tie chapter six we drove towards the ferry which was to carry us to irasa i glanced at rory hunched over the wheel demons at his back the beautiful face sullen with bad temper his black mood had been coming on for several hours now at last we reached the ferry under a grey and black sky a mountainous sea came hurtling towards us thundering moaning and screaming and dirty with flying foam hello mr balniel said the man on the gate i wish youd brought some better weather its been raining six weeks in irasa even the seagulls are wearing souwesters on the boat the sky darkened noticeably the temperature dropped and the gulls were blown sideways like pieces of rag in the wind im not sure scotlands quite me i later thought disloyally as we bumped along onetrack roads with occasional glimpses of sulkylooking sea on our left a huge forbidding castle lowered out of the mist nice little weekend cottage i said thats where buster and coco live said rory this is us i suppose it had once been a rather large lodge to the castle a grey stone twostorey house hung with creeper surrounded by a wild forsaken garden i started to quote swinburne but rory shot me such a look i shut up i decided not to make any flash remarks either about being carried over the threshold rory was extraordinarily tense as though he was expecting something horrible he certainly got it ive never seen such shambles inside a house broken bottles knockeddown lamps and tables glasses strewn all over the floor dust everywhere thick cobwebs the bedrooms looked as though someone had used them as ashtrays the fridge like a primeval forest and someone had written goodbye forever in lipstick on the mirror the house consisted of a huge studio a drawingroom almost entirely lined with books two bedrooms upstairs a kitchen and a bathroom all were in absolute chaos oh god said rory i left a message with my mother to get someone to clean the place up its all right i said faintly itll only take a few hundred years to put to rights im not having you whisking around like snow white snapped rory well sleep at the castle tonight ill get someone to come in tomorrow i looked out of the bedroom window the view was sensational the house grew out of a two hundred and fifty foot cliff which dropped straight down to the sea i hope we dont fall out too often i joked weakly then i saw a cellophane packet of flowers on the bed oh look i said someone remembered us then i shivered with horror as i realized it was a funeral wreath of lilies inside the envelope on a blackedged card was written welcome home darlings how beastly i said in a trembling voice who could have done that rory picked up the card some joker whos got it in for me but thats horrible and quite unimportant he said tearing up the card he opened the window and threw the wreath out so it spun round and round and crashed on the rocks below startled i looked into his face which glowed suddenly with some malice i couldnt place come here he said softly he pulled me against him pushing my head down on his shoulder one hand tracing my arm the other moving over my body then he smiled and closed his long fingers round my wrist where the pulse pounded poor little baby he whispered he could always do this to me lets go next door and he pulled me into the dusty spare room with the huge window on to the road and began to kiss me shouldnt we draw the curtains i muttered they can see us from the road so what he murmured suddenly i heard a scrunch of wheels on the road outside swinging round i saw a blue porsche flash by in the driving seat was a redheaded girl who gazed in at us a mixture of despair and hatred in her huge haunted eyes i enjoyed staying at the castle living in baronial comfort and making the acquaintance of rorys black labrador walter scott who had been living with busters gamekeeper while he had been away he was a charming dog sleek amiable incurably greedy and not as well trained as rory would have liked after a few days we went back to live in rorys house very pretty it looked after it had been cleaned up and began marriage proper i didnt find it easy i was determined to be one of those wonderful little homemakers putting feminine touches everywhere but as rory remarked the only feminine touches i added were dripping pants and stockings and mascara on his towel i tried to cook too i once cooked moussaka and we didnt eat until one oclock in the morning but rory who was used to cocos french expertise was not impressed i also took hours over the washing there werent any launderettes in irasa and then it lay around for days in pillowcases waiting to be ironed and rory never seemed to have clean underpants when he needed them after a couple of weeks he said quite gently with all the cobwebs we seem to have formed a spider sanctuary here youre obviously not into housework so ive hired a char four days a week and she can iron my shirts too i felt humiliated but enormously relieved the char mrs mackie turned out to be a mixed blessing she was wonderful at cleaning but a terrible gossip and obviously irritated rory out of his mind as soon as she arrived he used to disappear into the mountains to paint and she and i sat round drinking cider and talking ive got a wicked bad leg she said one morning i shall have to go and see dr maclean finn maclean i said she nodded whats his sister marina like shes no right in the head although i shouldnt say it the old macleans never had any money dr maclean her father was a gud doctor but he dinna know about saving marina married this old man for his riches and its dancing him into his grave she is perhaps now young dr macleans come back hell keep her in order whys he come back when he was doing so well in london she shrugged irasa has an enchantment they all come back in the end chapter seven irasa island of the blessed or of the cursed i could understand why none of them could escape its spell and why only here could rory find the real inspiration for his painting the countryside took your breath away it was as though the autumn was pulling out all the stops before succumbing to the harshness of the highland winter bracken singed the entire hillsides the colour of a red setter the turning horse chestnuts blazed yellow the acacias pale acid green with rory painting all day walter scott and i had plenty of time to wander about and explore the island was fringed with wooded points like a starfish out of the ten or so big houses on one point lived rory and me on another buster and coco on another finn maclean and on yet another marina and hamish the islanders white cottages were dotted between one afternoon in late october i walked down to penlorren the islands tiny capital penlorren was a strange sleepy little town exquisitely pretty like a northern st tropez wooded hills ringed the bay but the main street was an arc of coloured houses dark green pink white and duckegg blue in the boats the fishermen were sorting their slippery silver catch into boxes as i walked about i was aware of being watched suddenly i looked round and there was the blue porsche parked by the side of the road the same redheaded girl was watching me with great undefended eyes i smiled at her but she started up the car and stormed down the main street scattering villagers whos that i asked a nearby fisherman and somehow knew he was going to answer marina maclean id forgotten to get any potatoes and i went back to the main store three old biddies were having a yap they didnt hear me come in did you see rory balniels wee bride said one pur lassie so bonny said the second she might as well have married the divil therell be trouble ahead said the third now young dr macleans back again then they suddenly saw me coughed and started taking a great deal of interest in a sack of turnips chapter eight the feeling of unease id had since the first night of my honeymoon grew stronger another fortnight passed i had to stop fooling myself that our marriage was going well i was so besotted with rory i wanted to touch him all the time not just bed touching but holding hands and lying tucked into his back at night like two spoons in a silver box but rory seemed to have no desire to come near me except when he made love to me which was getting less and less often i tried to kid myself he was worrying about work i knew about geniuses secretive more temperamental of finer grain than ordinary mortals and more easily upset i tried to talk to him about painting but he said i didnt understand what he was doing and anyway talking about it ruined it i was in the kitchen one morning i had learned to be quiet when work was going badly the clatter of a pan could drive him mad he wandered in yawning rubbing a hand through his hair looking so handsome with his sleepy sulky face i felt my stomach tighten do you want some coffee yes please feeling more like a normal wife i went into the kitchen started percolating coffee and sighed inwardly for the days when nina and i had lived on nescafé i thought of the beautiful haunted girl in the blue porsche i keep seeing marina buchanan i said rory looked at me so not to speak to i stammered shes terribly beautiful shall we ask them to dinner im sure theyd enjoy your cooking i bit my lip i didnt want a row im sorry about my cooking i am trying sure you are extremely trying rory please whats the matter what have i done you havent laid a finger on me for at least four days you can count up to five that is encouraging said rory acidly most newly weds are at it all the time i said we might be if you were less unimaginative in bed im surprised all your exes didnt expect something a bit more exciting i jumped back as though hed hit me sometimes there was a destructive force about rory god you bastard i whispered if you were a bit more encouraging i might be less unimaginative and if im no good in bed why the hell didnt you say so in the beginning i was probably too drunk to notice he said i hate you i screamed i stormed out of the room rushed upstairs and threw myself on the bed bursting into tears five minutes later i heard a door slam and his car driving off down the road i cried for hours hes only doing it to hurt me i kept saying trying to reassure myself i got up washed my face and wondered what to do next i thumbed through a magazine you could have pulled corks with the models hair i liked music but you couldnt listen to records all day i supposed i could put on a deeply felt hat and go for a walk i sat up dismayed i realized i was bored noone was more aware than i that boredom was a mark of inadequacy people with inner resources didnt get bored no as rory had discovered id got hidden shallows i went to the fridge and ate half a tin of potato salad there was a knock on the door delighted i leapt to my feet and rushed to open it there stood marina buchanan quivering with nerves as if even now she might turn and run she was lovely if haunted in a red coat and long black boots her shining titian hair blowing in the wind like a shampoo commercial her mouth was large and drooping her face deathly pale and there were huge blue shadows underneath her extraordinary eyes i understood everything my mother had told me about garbo i wished i hadnt eaten that potato salad hello she said im marina buchanan i know i said im emily balniel i know she said coco sent me a postcard suggesting we should get together oh how lovely i said come in and have some coffee or something how nice it looks she said gazing in admiration at the drawingroom lets have a drink not coffee i said i know one shouldnt at this hour of the morning but its such a celebration having someone to talk to we had the most tremendous gossip she didnt seem haunted any more just slightly malicious and very funny she adored coco she said but couldnt stand buster she wasnt very complimentary about her husband either hes terrific between the balance sheets so it means i can have everything i want but im getting a bit fed up playing tinker tailor with the caviar i giggled wheres rory she said out painting she looked at me closely you look tired has rory been giving you a hard time of course not i said firmly dont get sore im not being critical just realistic rorys divinelooking he exudes sexappeal the way other men breathe out carbon dioxide and hes got terrific qualities she paused as if trying to think what they were but he can be difficult where other people make scenes rory makes threeact plays when hes upset he takes it out on other people he always has my brother finn is difficult but in a more predictable way and hes not spoilt like rory or bitchy either rorys always trying to send finn up but it doesnt work because finn couldnt care less and although rorys always had everything somehow finn makes him feel inadequate they hate each others guts you know she added in satisfaction theres bound to be fireworks the island isnt big enough for both of them she got up and wandered round the room i looked at that wild unstable loveliness and wondered what had possessed her to marry an old man when she could have had anyone why dont you both come to dinner on thursday i said thatd be lovely but youd better ask rory first at that moment rory walked in hello rory she said softly and then when he didnt answer immediately she went rattling on it would be nice if you could learn to say hello sometimes rory with six months practice you might even learn to say its a lovely day i steeled myself wondering what sort of mood he was in now but he turned round then came over and kissed me on the mouth quite hard hello baby have you missed me oh yes i said snuggling against him feeling weak with relief then he looked across at marina and ice crept into his voice hello mrs buchanan hows marriage still making hamish while the sun shines i giggled weve been having a lovely gossip ive asked marina and hamish to dinner here on thursday chapter nine i was determined the dinner party would be a success for the next three days i cooked polished and panicked determined rory should be proud of me on the afternoon of the day they were coming i was well ahead the house gleamed like a telly ad all the food was done the only thing we needed was lots of flowers there were none in the garden but id noticed some gorgeous roses in a garden down the road i set off still in my nightie flimsy and black id been so busy i hadnt even bothered to get dressed it was a warm day for the time of year the wet grass felt delicious beneath my bare feet i ran past ancient fruit trees and overgrown shrubberies and started to pick great armfuls of roses i was just bending over tearing off one huge red rose with my teeth when i heard a furious voice behind me what the hell do you think youre doing i jumped out of my skin and spun round aghast the rose in my teeth like carmen a man towered over me he must have been in his early thirties he had dark red hair curling over his collar a battered freckled highcomplexioned face a square jaw a broken nose and angry hazel eyes his face was seamed with tiredness his mouth set in an ugly line but it was still a powerful compelling unforgettable face dont you realize this is private property then i twigged this must be finn maclean i stared at him fascinated it was not often one came face to face with a legend didnt you know you were trespassing yes i did im terribly sorry but noones ever picked any flowers here before it seems such a waste to leave them i didnt know youd turn up evidently he said taking in my extreme state of undress who are you anyway he asked emily i muttered emily balniel for a second there was a flicker of emotion other than anger in his face was it pity or contempt id have thought rory was rich enough to afford his own roses i suppose youve picked up all his habits of doing and taking exactly what you like no i havent and you can keep your rotten roses i said and threw the whole lot at his feet chapter ten although i was seething with rage i didnt mention the incident to rory when i got back he was in too bad a temper i started tidying the drawingroom i wish you wouldnt hum nervously when you do things he said stop fiddling with those leaves too they look awful enough as it is you only notice them because marinas coming i went into the kitchen and slammed the door first finn now rory i thought i was going to cry but it would only make my eyes red so i took a large swig of cooking wine instead then i suddenly realized i hadnt put out any napkins and had to rush upstairs pull them out of the laundry basket and iron them on the carpet maddeningly marina and hamish arrived twenty minutes early so i had no time to tart myself up i wondered if marina did it deliberately she looked staggering in a slinky backless blue dress which matched her eyes but even i was unprepared for hamish he must have been close on sixty with nudging eyes an avid grin and yellow teeth but hed got himself up like an outofdate raver thinning grey locks clustering over his forehead and down his back sideboards laddering his wrinkled cheeks a white chamois leather smock lots of beads and jeans several sizes too small for him he looked like an awful old goat rory who looked devastating in a grey satin shirt couldnt stop laughing marina darling what have you done to him he said in an undertone he looks like an octogenarian tonup boy ive made an old man very hippy said marina and giggled dont you like his smock a touch of white is so flattering close to the face when you reach a certain age they were convulsed with mirth i think i would have been shocked by their malice if hamish hadnt been so awful lecherous and pleased with himself we all drank a great deal before dinner im thinking of growing a beard hamish said i dont like beards on boys or girls said marina are you still taking singing lessons rory asked marina i drive over to edinburgh once a fortnight its a long way but worth it i usually stay the night it gives hamish a break to get up to mischief said hamish giving me a wink that nearly dislocated his eyelid no one really noticed the dinner not even when one of my false eyelashes fell in the soup marina ate nothing hamish was obviously frightened his trousers were going to split rory never ate much anyway i cleared the plates and served each course i might have been a waitress walter scott was having a field day finishing up in the kitchen there were strange undercurrents i felt as though i was watching a suspense story on television where id missed the beginning and couldnt quite work out what was going on hamish rubbed his skinny leg against mine any moment hed get a fork stuck into it after dinner marina turned on the gramophone she and hamish danced hamish looked absurd flailing about like a scarecrow in a gale marina moved like a maenad her red hair flying her face transformed by the soft light rory sat watching her his face expressionless he had been drinking heavily all evening finally she flopped down beside him on the sofa did you ever finish that watercolour of the harbour he nodded its in the studio may i come and see it they went next door hamish looked dreadful now grey and exhausted he went off to the loo and i wandered into the studio to see the painting they were talking about suddenly i froze with horror they hadnt bothered to turn on the studio light and were standing near the window in the moonlight marina stood there vibrating a foot away from rory her face glowed like a pale flame why did you marry her her voice dropped an octave oh come on rory said lets say i wasnt wanted any more to punish me to put me on the rack you cant believe i married hamish for anything but his money but shes something entirely different she turned on her heel and was coming towards me it was as though i was frozen in some terrible nightmare marina wait i heard rory say oh go to hell she said but the longing and ache in her voice were quite unmistakable she didnt see me as she came into the drawingroom hamish i want to go home she snapped her face was turned away from him only i could see it was wet with tears rory didnt even bother to come out and say goodbye to them i went back into the studio my legs hardly holding me up rory i said i think we ought to have things out ive nothing to have out nothing i realized hed reached that pitch of drunkenness that was about to explode into violence but i didnt care whats going on between you and marina why was she hanging around when we arrived it was she who sent the wreath wasnt it and her whom you rang up the first night of our honeymoon i want to know what its all about nothing nothing we were brought up together thats all anyway he snarled you asked her to dinner now get out of my way he pushed me aside im going to sleep in the spare room and dont come crawling into my bed in the middle of the night chapter eleven i didnt sleep at all i lay trembling with panic clutching walter scotts solid body my mind reeling from possibility to possibility at dawn i tried to be rational rory and marina had probably been childhood sweethearts and hed been piqued when she married hamish after all it was me hed married next morning i came down washed up and tried to be brave about my hangover what would please rory most i decided to clean out his studio he came down at midday he looked terrible he must have been hungover down to his toes but glass in hand he was making a nice recovery i was standing on a ladder dusting a shelf hello darling i said brightly what are you doing dusting why the hell cant miss mackie do that youll only muddle everything up for christs sake please dont lets quarrel im sorry for the things i said i didnt mean them i couldnt bear another night like last night you can always leave he said brutally i dont want to leave i love you his face softened do you now well come down off that stupid ladder then and catching my ankles he ran his hands slowly up my legs ill just dust this last folder i said steadying myself on the shelf put that down said rory his voice suddenly icy startled i swayed on my high ladder i said put it down purely out of nerves i let the folder slip from my hands and crash to the floor hastily i scrambled down and knelt to pick it up rory reached it at the same time as me his hand on my arm like a vice ow i yelped leave it he snarled but it was too late spilling out of the folder were the most beautiful drawings the naked model smiling that secret comehither smile was unmistakably marina we looked at the paintings scattered round our feet marina in her lush beauty mocked me a hundred times over well i said its your fault i told you not to touch that file theyre very good very lifelike indeed i said slowly trying to keep my voice from trembling im sure you didnt paint these from imagination of course i didnt i wanted to do some nudes last summer and there are only a limited number of people on the island wholl take their clothes off you can hardly see buster or hamish stripping down to the buff and sitting around for hours on end anyway as ive said before its damn all to do with you what i did before i was married or what you do after youre married i said bitterly rory drained his drink and poured himself another one rory i said slowly this is important do you love me at all rory looked bored depends how you define love how could i explain that he was the most beautiful man id ever seen that my tongue suddenly got stuck in my throat when i saw the set of his shoulders that i spent all day wanting him oh rory i said appalled cant you try and be a bit more loving why he said logically why did you marry me then he looked at me reflectively im beginning to wonder i gave a gasp god he could be vicious what shall we do about it then i said do he exploded do let me work thats enough for me but not enough for me i screamed and brushed blindly past him where are you going he said out well for gods sake come back in a less destructive mood and so our marriage began to deteriorate it wasnt helped by the rain which started to fall the next day and continued for weeks rory passed the time in painting i in sulking then in trying to win rory round then in sulking again i suppose i was pretty disagreeable myself i complained steadily about the weather and how bored i was at first i made an attempt to stop myself then i didnt try to stop myself then i found i couldnt emily the fishwife that crack about being lousy in bed had gone home too i wrote off to london for a sexy black cutout nightie and a book on how to undress in front of your husband it showed you how to swing your bra round like a football rattle and slide your pants off in one go i tried it on rory one evening but he merely raised his eyebrows and asked me if id been at the gin as the weeks passed he didnt lay a finger on me i was desperately unhappy and cried a great deal when he wasnt around i kept telling myself that when hed assembled enough canvases for the exhibition wed be like a couple of love birds but i didnt really believe it i spent most of my time corrupting walter scott rory was a great believer that dogs should be treated like dogs and kept outside i kept bringing him in and feeding him in between meals and cuddling him i needed a few allies gradually walter invaded the house he started off sleeping in the kitchen then moved to the foot of the stairs then to the landing outside our bedroom at dawn he would steal in and try to climb on our bed invariably rory who was a light sleeper would wake up and throw him out walter scott suffers from being an only dog he was fond of saying blood is thicker than walter i said nothing is thicker than walter said rory chapter twelve in november later than expected coco and buster came back buster brought his new private plane which he landed perilously on the sward outside the castle terrifying the life out of the islanders and the local sheep and nearly depositing himself three labradors gun cases rod boxes and several hundred tons of pigskin luggage in the sea pity said rory never mind therell be plenty of other opportunities in the old days he used to come up by train from euston and take the dogs to lampposts as the train waited interminably at crewe coco arrived in riproaring form and swept rory and me into a round of gaiety meeting people on the island and the mainland it was a frightful strain trying to keep up the appearance that i was blissfully happy a few days later marina and hamish asked us back to dinner i was amazed and irritated to discover she was a very good cook and had decorated hamishs huge stark house with a wild elegance i could never achieve in a million years of poring over house and garden the drawingroom had grey silk walls and flamered curtains and i felt sure had been chosen to compliment marinas colouring oh its lovely i said wistfully you ought to go into interior decorating emilys an inferior decorator said rory in my attempt to make our bedroom more feminine id started painting it but had got bored in the middle the colour too was disastrous it looked all right on the chart but once on the wall turned out an appalling e k directory pink i felt very overdressed that evening too trying to compete with marina id put on a seethrough blouse and a long skirt marina of course was wearing jeans there was another couple to dinner deidre and calen macdonald she was a commanding bigboned woman with a ringing voice he had a handsome dissipated face roving grey eyes and had obviously married her for her money he turned out to be a shooting friend of busters and made an absolute dead set at me i cant claim to be a gentleman but ive always preferred blondes he said cornering me on the sofa as soon as we were introduced and you really are gorgeous the intensity with which he gazed at my seethrough blouse threw me off balance i folded my arms firmly to cover up what i could er do you do anything for a living i said casting around for something to say good god no i realized very early on that i was quite incapable of supporting myself so i married old deidre instead shes a pretty full time job but i do get the odd afternoon off while shes sitting on committees how about you ive only been married seven weeks i said firmly so disillusion hasnt set in yet pretty tricky customer rory i admire you if you can handle him he runs rings round poor buster is he still drinking too much hardly at all i said out of the corner of my eye watching rory go to marinas sidetable and help himself to a second very large glass of whisky very loyal and proper said calen i must say you really are extremely attractive i wish youd stop sitting with your arms folded like a rugger player so i could appreciate you properly promise me that if you ever decide to be unfaithful to rory i can have first refusal i tried to look disapproving but after rorys indifference of the past few weeks it was such heaven to be chatted up i was sure marina had invited calen on purpose but although he flirted outrageously with me all evening i felt terribly depressed that rory wasnt betraying a spark of jealousy so nice for you to find someone of your own mental age to play with emily was all he said afterwards as the weeks passed we often encountered marina and hamish at parties marina and rory so studiously avoided each other that i wondered if they were meeting on the sly occasionally i saw her loathsome brother finn maclean driving round the island obviously far too preoccupied with building his beastly hospital to waste time on parties in december coco slipped down some steps at the castle after a boozy evening and sprained her ankle next day she rang up saying she was bored would i come over and see her on my way i drove into penlorren to find her some nice escapist novel from the bookshop having parked my car in the main street i started browsing through some romances oh dear the lovely things that happened to those heroines why didnt rory feel like that about me finally i heard a cough behind me the owner wanting to shut up shop hastily i bought the book and wandered dreamily into the main street through the mist and rain a man was standing by my car there was something heroic about the way he stood the massive breadth of the shoulders the hair curling over the collar of his battered sheepskin coat like michelangelos david instinctively i unhitched the long lock of hair from behind my ear and let it fall seductively over my eyes then i realized the man was finn maclean and he was blazingly angry is this your car yes at least its rorys cant you read he seized my arm and swung me round to face a notice on a garage door it said doctors car please leave free oh i said well in london people often put notices like that on their garage doors even if theyre not doctors just to keep people away this is not london he snapped and in terms of the most blistering invective proceeded to tell me exactly what he thought of londoners who came to live in the country and me in particular and didnt i realize that people could be dying because people like me parked their cars in places like this finally i got fed up it strikes me i said that while youve been rabbiting on and on and on about my criminal responsibility at least twenty more people could have died admittedly a few of them may have been chinese in fact if all the people who died while people like you were blowing their cool all over the islands were laid end to end dont be fatuous snapped finn theres obviously no point in trying to get anything through to you youd better move your car of course the beastly thing wouldnt start eventually i remembered to let out the clutch and it shot forward in a series of agonizing jerks louse swine monster i muttered to myself as i drove to the castle no wonder rory and he couldnt stand each other chapter thirteen i found coco lying in bed looking beautiful as always but very tired someone had brought her some lilies and shed buried her face in them her nose was bright yellow with pollen she was obviously in considerable pain but greeted me with her usual zest help yourself to a drink chérie and get me one buster has gone shooting every day now he shoot pop pop bang bang i find it very boring i ave live in scotland nearly thirty years and still i do not find the plusfour sexy admittedly buster ave very good legs a seagull excruciated on his coat just as he was leaving he was very angry i giggled coco could always cheer me up we gossiped for half an hour then i reverted to the subject i could never ignore for long even though it crucified me to talk about it have you seen marina i asked coco raised her eyes to heaven yes i ave thats a marriage going on the rocks we had dinner with them the other night she and hamish i gave her a lecture i said you are not making hamish happy like emily is making my rory happy i winced at that bit and marina laugh in my face sometimes i think she is a bit touchy in her head she is so different from her brother finn hes so kind and downtoearth and such a wonderful doctor that moment a maid banged on the door dr macleans here madam she said show him in said coco excitedly oh god he was as mad as a boiled squirrel last time i saw him i said but coco wasnt listening she was too busy combing her hair and spraying on scent in marched finn maclean talk of the devil said coco in delight i was just singing your praises to emily telling her what a wonderful doctor you were so kind and understanding i shouldnt think anything rattles you does it finn no i said acidly i should think its always dr maclean who does the rattling finn turned round and saw me his face hardened slightly oh its you he said i didnt know you knew emily said coco isnt she pretty and so good for rory im sure theyre ideally matched said finn the sarcasm was entirely lost on coco who beamed at us both lets have a look at your ankle finn said coco stretched out one of her beautiful smooth brown legs the ankle was very black and swollen although finn handled it with amazing delicacy she drew her breath in sore is it he said gently she nodded catching her lip poor old thing never mind youve still got one perfect ankle he said getting up no reason why the other shouldnt be as right as rain in a few weeks whats right about rain i said gloomily looking out of the window still id like to xray it finn went on ignoring me ill send an ambulance to pick you up later itll jolt you less than a car i must go i said ive got to cook rorys supper finn will give you a lift said coco ive got a car i said quickly it was very cold outside and i shivered i didnt want to leave the cosy warmth of the castle for one of rorys black moods finn maclean got something out of the pocket of his overcoat i should have thought it was a bit early on in your marriage to escape into tripe like this he said handing it to me it was the romantic novel id intended to give coco chapter fourteen cocos ankle was xrayed bound up and she was ordered to rest it just before christmas however maisie downleesh one of cocos friends decided to give a ball to celebrate her daughter dineys engagement we were all invited there is something about the idea of a ball that lifts the spirits however low one is i suppose its the excitement buying a new dress new makeup a new hairstyle and settling down in front of the mirror in an attempt to magic oneself into the most glamorous girl in the room in the past a ball had offered all the excitement of the unknown opportunity knocking this time i hoped it would be a chance to make myself beautiful enough to win back rory the ball was being held at the downleeshes castle on the mainland coco buster rory and i were all to stay there in the morning i took the car across the ferry and drove to edinburgh to buy a new dress in the afternoon i had to pick up a couple who were coming to the dance from london then drive back and pick up rory from the irasa ferry and then drive on to the downleeshes i was determined that a new me was going to emerge so gorgeous that every laird would be mad with desire for me i spent a frenzied morning rushing from shop to shop eventually in a back street i tracked down a gloriously tarty pale pink dress skin tight over the bottom slashed at the front and plunging back and front it had been reduced in a sale because there was a slight mark on the navel and because the assistant said with a sniff there was no call for that sort of garment in edinburgh i tried it on it was wildly sexy a little tight over the barkside dont ye thenk said the assistant who was keen to steer me into black velvet at three times the price thats just how i like it i said it was a bit long too so i went and bought new sixinch high shoes and then went to the hairdressers and had a pink rinse put on my hair i never do things by threequarters all in all it was a bit of a rush getting to the airport the frayns were waiting when i arrived i recognized them a mile off he was one of those braying chinless telegraph poles in a dungcoloured tweed jacket she was a typical exdeb with flat ears from permanently wearing a headscarf and a very long right arm from lugging suitcases to paddington every weekend to go home to mummy she had blue eyes mouse hair and one of those pink and white complexions that nothing not rough winds nor drinking and dancing till dawn can destroy they were also nauseatingly besotted with one another every sentence began charles thinks or fiona thinks and they kept roaring with laughter at each others jokes like hyenas she also had that terrible complacency that often overtakes newly married women and stems from relief at having hooked a man and being uncritically adored by him she was quite nice about me being late but there was a lot of talk about stopping at a telephone box on the dot of to ring up nanny and find out how little caroline was getting on and did i think wed get there in time to change its the first time ive been separated from caroline she said i do hope nanny can cope she sat in the front beside me he sat in the back they held hands all the time why didnt they both get in the back and neck it was a bitterly cold day stripped black trees were etched on the skyline the heavy brown sky was full of snow shaggy forelocked heads of the cows tossed in the gloom as they cropped the sparse turf just before we reached the ferry to pick up rory and walter scott it started snowing in earnest i had hoped rory and i could have a truce for the evening but i was an hour late which didnt improve his temper fiona who had evidently known rory as a child went into a flurry of whats happened to old so and so and who did so and so marry rory answered her in monosyllables he had snow melting in his hair and paint on his hands too awful she went on did you know annie richmonds father threw himself under a taxi in the rush hour in knightsbridge lucky to find one at that hour said rory looking broodingly at the snowflakes swarming like great bees on the windscreen i giggled rory looked at me and then noticed my hair jesus he said under his breath do you like it i said nervously no he said and turned up the wireless full blast to drown fionas chatter suddenly she gave a scream oh look theres a telephone box could you stop a minute rory so i can telephone nanny rory raised his eyes to heaven she got out of the car and giving little shrieks ran through the snow through the glass of the telephone box i could see her smiling fatuously forcing lp pieces into the telephone box rory didnt reply to charles desultory questions about shooting his nails were so bitten that his drumming fingers made little sound on the dashboard a quarter of an hour later fiona returned well said charles shes fine but shes missing us she said she brought up most of her lunch but shes just had two rusks and finished all her bottle so nanny thinks shes recovered rory scurled off through the snow his hands clenched on the wheel what bawful weather said fiona looking out of the window you really must start a family very soon emily she went on it gives a completely new dimension to ones life i think ones awfully selfish really until one has children parents said rory should always be seen and not heard punctuated by giggles and murmurs of oh charles from the back we finally reached the turrets and gables and great blackened keep of downleesh castle the windows threw shafts of light on to the snow which was gathering thickly on the surrounding fir trees and yews the usual cavalcade of terriers and labradors came pounding out of the house to welcome us walter scott was dragged off protesting by a footman to be given his dinner in the kitchen in the dark panelled hall great banks of holly were piled round the suits of armour the spears and the banners we had a drink before going upstairs diney lady downleeshs daughter whod just got engaged fell on fionas neck and they both started yapping about weddings and babies we were taken to our bedroom down long draughty passages to the west tower in spite of a fire in the grate it was bitterly cold i found when i got there that my suitcase had been unpacked and all my clothes laid out neatly on the mildewed fourposter including an old bone of walter scotts and a halfeaten bar of chocolate i had stuffed into my suitcase at the last moment on the walls were pictures of gundogs coming out of the bracken their mouths full of feathers i missed walter sometimes in those awful long silences i had with rory i found it a relief to jabber away to him can he come upstairs i said no said rory in the bookshelves was a book called a modern guide to pig husbandry perhaps i should read it i said it might give me some advice about being married to a pig across the passage were the unspeakable frayns they had already hogged the bathroom and judging from the sound of splashing and giggling it wasnt just a bath they were having i realized i was jealous of their happiness and involvement i wanted rory to start every sentence emily says and roar with laughter at my jokes i took ages over dressing painting my face as carefully as rory painted any of his pictures my pink dress looked pretty sensational i put a ruby brooch coco had given me over the mark on the navel it was certainly tight too everyone would be able to see my goosepimples but on the whole i was pleased with the result it was definitely one of my on days the only problem was that when i put on my new tights the crotch only came up to the middle of my thighs i gave them a tug and they split irrevocably leaving a large hole so i had to make do with bare legs i was just trying to give myself a better cleavage with sellotape when rory announced that he was ready even i though was unprepared for his beauty dressed up in a dark green velvet doublet with white lace at the throat and wrists and the dark green and blue kilt of the balniels pale and haughty his eyes glittering with bad temper he looked like something out of kidnapped alan breck stuart or young lochinvar coming out of the west oh i sighed you do look lovely rory grimaced and tugged at the frills at his neck i feel like kenneth mckellar he said never mind youve got exactly the right hips to wear a pleated skirt i said rory put a long tartan muffler thing on the dressingtable this is for you he said im not thinking of going out in this weather i said you wear it indoors he said draping it diagonally across my shoulders like this and pin it here but whatever for i moaned its the balniel tartan he said evenly married women are supposed to wear their husbands tartan but it completely covers up my cleavage just as well youre not at some orgy in chelsea now said rory do i really have to its a bit hooray for me very sulkily i arranged it somehow tartan didnt go with skintight pink satin and brooches on the navel i wanted to fiddle with my hair and makeup a few minutes longer but rory was sitting on the bed staring at me coldly making me nervous why dont you go on down i said ill wait here he said i combed a few pink tendrils over my shoulders what made you go crazy with the cochineal said rory i thought i ought to change my image i said sourly my old one didnt seem to be getting me very far downstairs in the huge drawingroom people were having drinks the host and hostess stood near the door repeating the same words of welcome to new arrivals looking round i realized i looked better than most of the women but infinitely more tarty most of them were big rawboned deb types in very coveredup clothes the occasional mottled purple arms were the nearest they got to décolletage very tall aristocratic men in kilts stood talking in haw haw voices about getting their lochs drained and burning their grouse moors fishes in glass cases and mounted stags heads stared glassily down from the walls fiona and charles were standing near the door she was wearing a blue dress and absolutely no eye makeup what a pretty dress i said with desperate insincerity yes everyone likes it she said blue is charles favourite colour charles was gaping at my pink hair his mouth even more open than usual fiona started trying to bring rory out about his painting do you do all that funny abstract stuff she said no said rory some young man he had a beard actually painted my sister sarah she sat for two hours and all he had drawn after all that time were three figs and a milk bottle she gave a tinkle of laughter rory looked at her stonily charles paints quite beautifully too i feel its such a shame his job in the city is so demanding he doesnt have time to take painting up as a hobby like you rory rory does not paint as a hobby i said furiously its his profession but i spoke to deaf ears rory had turned on his heel and gone off to get himself a drink charles and fiona were suddenly shrieking at a couple who had just come into the room i was extremely pleased therefore that the next moment calen macdonald bore down on me and kissed first my hand then my cheek then both my bare shoulders i was just saying to buster i wished i could see more of you he said pulling down my tartan sash and peering at my cleavage and now i have i must say that dress is very fetching pink looks like bare flesh if one shuts ones eyes wheres deidre i said oh shes stalking in inverness i giggled so ive got the whole evening off and im going to devote it entirely to you two matrons with redveined faces stopped discussing herbaceous borders and looked at us frostily at that moment a voice shouted emily and there was coco dripping with sapphires as big as gulls eggs wearing a glorious midnight blue dress she was lying like madame recamier on a red brocade sofa surrounded by admirers rory sat at her feet i didnt see you i said going over and kissing her you look very nice doesnt she rory said coco a bit prawn cocktail said rory i bit my lip i think she looks tremendous said buster giving me a warm look in the pink i might say he laughed heartily the room was filling up buster and calen were joined by some ancient general and they were soon busy recounting to each other the number of creatures they had slaughtered in the last week grouses and twelve bores and twenty bores and million bores thats all men can think about up here said coco she began talking to me about shoes there was a sudden stir and a whisper ran through the room the old general straightened his tie and smoothed his moustache what a beautiful girl he said a swift flush mounted to rorys pale cheeks with a sinking heart without turning my head i knew it must be marina hello everyone she said coming over and kissing coco hows your poor leg darling she was wearing a pale grey chiffon dress smothered in two huge pale grey feather boas with her flaming red hair it made one think of beech woods in autumn against a cloudy sky i noticed she had no truck with hamishs tartan across her bosom i supposed it was rorys tartan she was after sadly i realized that if i spent a million years on my face and clothes i would never be as beautiful as marina hamish all done up in black velvet and frills looked awful mutton dressed as cutlet said rory to marina under his breath even worse was to come following her into the room came finn maclean in a dinner jacket with a sleek brunette oh god said rory here comes the virgin surgeon diney he added turning to the daughter of the house what the hell is doctor finlay doing here he was absolutely wonderful about mummys ulcer said diney her eyes shining probably gave it to her in the first place said rory well i must say i think hes rather super myself said diney im surprised at you said rory one really shouldnt know ones doctor socially finn came up to coco hows it feeling he said much better said coco may be but there must be no dancing on it he said firmly whos that with him i whispered to calen macdonald i think shes one of his nurses said calen shes pretty i said not my type said calen and started whispering sweet everythings into my ear i however was much more interested in seeing how rory and finn reacted to each other look rory said coco heres finn rory just lighting a cigarette paused eyeing finn without any friendliness finn nodded coldly hello rory he said good evening doctor said rory he smiled but his eyes were cold his face as pale as marble there was an awkward pause isnt it nice finns back for good said coco brightly to the assembled company not for my good he isnt said rory this is frances said finn ignoring him and introducing the sleek brunette she works at the hospital oh a staff outing drawled rory what fun did you come here by charabanc with a crate of beer or is it part of the srn syllabus a dazzling night of dancing and passion in the arms of doctor maclean only for very privileged nurses said frances smiling at finn im surprised youve been able to drag him away from delivering babies and darning up appendices said rory frances was obviously uncertain how to take rory dr maclean certainly doesnt allow himself enough free time she said warmly quite so said rory his eyes lighting up with malicious amusement hes an example to us all i gather thats the reason your marriage came unstuck finn i heard your exwife couldnt cope with the short hours or wasnt your double bedside manner up to scratch however he smiled at frances you seem to be consoling yourself very nicely i turned away in embarrassment if only he wouldnt be so poisonous rory grabbed my arm you havent met emily have you finn yes he has i said quickly oh rory raised an eyebrow we met at cocos one day i said when finn came to see her about her ankle rory held out his glass to a passing waiter to fill up are you still trying to paint finn said hes got an exhibition in london in april i said hotly doesnt really need one said finn hes been making an exhibition of himself for years and taking frances by the arm crossed the room to talk to his host scintillating as ever said rory but his hand shook as he lit one cigarette from another do you like dancing reels emily said marina if i have enough to drink i said draining my glass i reel automatically we went in to dinner the leathery sneering faces of ancestors looked down from the walls the candlelight flickered on the gleaming panelling the suits of armour the long polished table with its shining silver and glasses and on the pearly white shoulders of marina i hope theres a huge flower arrangement in front of me so i dont have to sit staring at doctor maclean said rory i was horrified to see that he and marina were sitting next to each other on the opposite side of the table i was next to calen who ran his fingers all over my bare back when he pushed my chair in and now the bad news on my other side was six feet four inches of titianhaired disapproval finn maclean hello finn said calen how are things have you met this steaming girl doctor maclean isnt one of my fans i said maybe not said calen but hes tall enough to see right down your front unless i rearrange that sash thats better dont want to give you blood pressure do we finn always get swollen heads these quacks think all the nurses and women patients are nuts about them i laughed finn didnt it must be exciting running your own hospital i said to him he was about to answer when someone shoved a steaming great soup ladle between us great fun running your own hospital i went on then it was his turn to help himself to soup whats the disease people suffer most often from round here i asked verbal diarrhoea muttered calen i was just warming to my subject asking finn all the right questions about the hospital and the operations he would perform there when calen lifted up the curtain of hair hanging over my left ear and whispered christ i want to take you to bed i started to laugh in midsentence then blushed im awfully sorry i said to finn its just something calen said finn obviously thought we were too silly for words and turned his huge back on me and started talking to the girl on his right footmen moved round the table the clatter of plates mingled with the clink of knives and glasses and the hum of various animated conversations lady downleesh sat at the end of the table a large imposing woman who must once have been handsome only marina and rory sat mutely side by side talking little eating less they appeared to see and hear nothing of what was going on around them suddenly i felt panicky they were probably playing footyfooty i imagined their cloven hoofs entwined calen and finn were temporarily occupied with other conversations i dropped my napkin and dived under the table to retrieve it it was very dark i hoped my eyes would soon become accustomed to it but they didnt not enough carrots when i was a child i suppose i couldnt see which were rorys or marinas legs i grabbed someones ankle but it was much too fat for marinas and twitched convulsively cheap thrill all the same i couldnt stay here for ever exciting dowagers i surfaced again are you all right mrs balniel said lady downleesh looking somewhat startled fine i squeaked absolutely marvellous soup everyones waiting for you to finish yours said finn in an undertone oh i have i said ive got a tiny appetite i never eat between males finn didnt laugh pompous old stuffed shirt everyone started to talk about fishing as the soup plates were moved youre not a bit alike i said you and marina he shot me a wary glance in what way well shes so wild and youre so well controlled i cant see you as a medical student putting stuffed gorillas in college scarves down matrons bed he gave me one of those big onoff smiles he must use all the time for keeping people at a polite distance i was working too hard for that are all the people in this room your patients i asked must be funny to look round a table and know what every single woman looks like with her clothes off calen does anyway said finn what do you do with yourself all day not a lot im not very good at housework i read and grumble sometimes i even bite my nails you ought to get a job give you something to do he went on what did you do before you met rory oh i mistyped letters in several offices and i did a bit of modelling when i got thin enough and then i got engaged to an mp i dont think i would have been much of an asset to him and then rory came along its a full moon tonight said a horsefaced blonde sitting opposite us i wonder if the ghostll walk tonight whos sleeping in the west wing the frayns said diney downleesh lowering her voice and rory and his new wife what ghost i whispered nervously to calen calen laughed oh its nothing there was a downleesh younger son a couple of centuries ago who fell in love with his elder brothers wife the wife evidently had a soft spot for him as well one night when her husband was away she invited the younger brother into her bedroom he was just hotfooting along the west tower where she was sleeping all tarted up in his white dressinggown when the husband came back and picking a dirk off the wall he stabbed him the younger brother is supposed to stalk the passage when theres a full moon trying to avenge himself through all eternity for not getting his oats how creepy i said with a shiver ill take care of you said calen putting his hand on my thigh and encountering bare flesh christ he said my only pair of tights split i said finn maclean pretended not to notice calen filled my glass over and over again eventually we finished dinner and the ball began the host and hostess stood at the edge of the long gallery welcoming latecomers every time the front door opened you could feel a blast of icy air from outside it was terribly cold in these big houses the only way to keep warm was to stand near one of the huge log fires that were burning in each room then two minutes later you were bright scarlet in the face i could see exactly why burns said his love was like a red red rose rory came up to me what was finn maclean talking to you about he said suspiciously he was stressing the importance of getting ones teeth into something i said if he got his teeth into me id go straight off and have a rabies jab said rory on with the dance i said let emily be unconfined come on rory said diney downleesh coming over to us we need two more people to make up an eightsome over there we couldnt really refuse dumdiddy dumdiddy dumdiddydiddydiddy went the accordions the men gave strange unearthly wails like a train not stopping at a station we circled to the left we circled to the right wrong way hissed rory as we swung into the grand chain when it was my turn in the middle i made an even worse hash of it setting to all the wrong people and doing uturns instead of figures of eight and whooping a lot for christs sake stop capering around like the white heather club said rory under his breath women dont put their hands up or click their fingers or whoop the next dance thank god was an ordinary one i danced it with buster who squeezed me so hard i thought id shoot out of my dress like toothpaste why dont any of them look as though theyre enjoying themselves i said you can never tell until they fall on the floor said buster on the other side of the room marina was dancing with hamish she looked so glowingly beautiful and he so yellow and old and decayed i was suddenly reminded of mary queen of scots dancing and dancing her ancient husband into the grave the evening wore on i wasnt short of partners i danced every dance a piper came on well primed with whisky and assaulted our eardrums for a couple of reels my reputation as a reelwrecker was growing i messed up hamilton house and then the duke and duchess of perth and then the sixteensome on the surface i must have appeared rather like a loose horse in the national potentially dangerous thoroughly enjoying myself and quite out of control but through a haze of alcohol and misery i was aware of two things rorys complete indifference to my behaviour and finn macleans disapproval both made me behave even worse i danced a great deal with calen i came into my own when they stopped doing those silly reels did your wife dance professionally i heard a disapproving dowager say to rory as i came off the floor after a gruelling charleston calen and i went into the drawingroom for yet another drink i put my glass down on a gleaming walnut table when i picked it up two minutes later there was a large ring on the table oh god i said how awful looks better that way said calen looks more lived in somehow he led me back on to the floor the music was slow and dreamy now you are the promised breath of springtime sang calen laying his handsome face against mine i snuggled up against him for a few laps round the floor and then i escaped to the loo bigboned girls stood around talking about harrods and their comingout dances really i thought as i gazed in the mirror i look very loose indeed tight dress loose morals i suppose i wandered along the long gallery so i could watch the people on the floor a double line of dancers were engaged with serious faces in executing a reel marina and rory faced one another expressionless god they danced beautifully i was reminded of lochinvar again so stately his form and so lovely her face that never a hall such a galliard did grace and the brides maidens whispered twere better by far to have matched our fair cousin with young lochinvar oh dear i thought in misery in this case young lochinvar seems to have missed the boat arriving too late and finding his love married to hamish the dance ended the couples clapped and spilled out into the hall if only rory would come and look for me but it looked as though id have to wait for a ladies excuse me before i had a chance to dance with him again i heard footsteps behind me i felt two hands go round my waist i turned hopefully but it was calen ive got a bottle he said lets go and drink it somewhere more secluded he dropped a kiss on to my shoulder and led me downstairs along a long passage into a conservatory chinese lanterns hanging round the walls lit up the huge tropical plants the scent of azaleas hyacinths and white chrysanthemums mingled voluptuously with the arpège id poured all over myself the sound of the band reached us faintly from the hall you are the promised breath of springtime sang calen taking me in his arms there isnt any mistletoe i said we dont need it said calen his grey dissipated eyes gazing into mine youre rotten to the core i thought mad bad and dangerous to know bad from the neck upwards and not at all good for emily not that rory was doing much good for me either god i want you said calen undoing the top button of my dress he bent his head and kissed the top of my cleavage and slowly kissed his way up my neck and chin to my mouth i didnt feel anything really except a desire to slake my loneliness god it was a practised kiss i thought of all those hundreds of women he must have seduced hands travelled over my bare back pressing into every crevice suddenly a light flicked on in the library next door calen said a voice youre wanted on the telephone go to hell said calen burying his face in my neck dont be a bloody spoilsport finn over calens head our eyes met its deidre finn said oh god sighed calen as reluctantly he let me go you see before you the most henpecked husband in the highlands goodnight you dream of bliss he kissed me on the cheek and walked somewhat unsteadily out of the conservatory finn and i glared at each other you are beyond the pale i snapped beyond a whole dairyful of pales why do you have to rush around rotting up peoples sex lives i thought you were a doctor not a vicar i lurched slightly without calen to hold me up you wont get rory back that way said finn getting drunk and going to bed with calen doesnt solve anything oh it does it does i said with a sigh it gets you through the next half an hour and half an hour can be an eternity in scotland i wandered into the library and discovered a glass of champagne balanced on a stags head i drank it in one gulp ill take the high road and yell take the low road i said and ill be inebriated before ye tell me doctor you know the area better than i do what gives between rory and your sister nothing he said roughly youre imagining things and youre not making things any better behaving like this i stared at him for a minute my mother once had an english setter who had freckles like yours i said dreamily they looked really nice on a dog we went into the hall which was fortunately deserted what about your friend frances nightingale i said swinging back and forth on an heraldic leopard that reared up the bottom of the banisters isnt she missing you thats my problem he said look i said im not usually as silly as this its a pity youre not as good at mending broken hearts as broken bones i suggest said finn you go straight up to bed without making a fool of yourself any further take three alkaseltzers before you go to sleep youll feel much better in the morning come on he moved forward to take me upstairs but i broke away go and jump in the loch i snarled and ran away from him up the stairs i fell into bed preparing to cry myself to sleep but i must have flaked out almost immediately in the middle of the night it seemed i woke up i didnt know where i was it was pitch black in the room the fire had gone out where the hell was i then i remembered downleesh castle i put out a hand groping for rory he wasnt there i was alone in the huge fourposter suddenly the room seemed to go unnaturally cold the wind was blowing a blizzard outside the snow still falling heavily as the windows rattled and banged and the doors and stairs creaked it was like being on board ship then i felt my hair standing on end as i remembered the ghost in the white dressinggown that walked when the moon was full i gave a sob at the thought of him creeping down those long musty passages towards me i was trembling all over getting out of bed i ran my hands along the wall hysterically groping for a light switch i couldnt find one the room grew even colder suddenly i gave a gasp of terror as the curtain blew in and i realized to my horror the window was open i leapt back into bed where the hell was rory how could he leave me like this suddenly my blood froze as very very gently i heard the door creaking it stopped then creaked again and very very gradually it began to open i couldnt move my voice was strangled in my dry throat my heart pounding oh god i croaked oh please no i tried desperately to scream as one does in a nightmare but no sound came out slowly the door opened wider the curtains billowed again in the through draught from the window and the light from the snow revealed a ghostly figure wrapped in white gold hair gleaming it suddenly turned and looked in my direction and slowly crept towards the bed panic overwhelmed me i was going to be murdered someone was screaming horribly echoing on and on through the house the next minute i realized it was me the room was flooded with light and there was buster standing in the doorway looking very discomfited in a white silk dressinggown i went on screaming emily my god said buster im so sorry pet for christs sake stop making that frightful row i got into the wrong bedroom must have got the wrong wing for that matter i stopped screaming and burst into noisy hysterical sobs next minute finn maclean barged in still wearing black trousers and his white evening shirt what the hells going on he said he was followed by the frayns she had tied her hair up with a blue bow wheres rory i sobbed where is he im sorry buster i thought you were the ghost i was so frightened my breath was coming in great strangled gasps buster patted my shoulder gingerly there there poor emily he said got my wings muddled he added to finn she thought i was the downleesh ghost im not surprised after all the liquor she shipped said finn ill go and get something to calm her down once i started crying i couldnt stop do try and pull yourself together emily said fiona oughtnt you to slap her face or something she said as finn came back with a couple of pills and a glass of water get these down you he said gently i dont need them i sobbed then gave another scream as rory walked in through the curtains snowflakes thick on his hair and his shoulders what a lot of people in my wifes bedroom he said blandly looking round the room i didnt know you were entertaining emily you do keep extraordinary hours a muscle was going in his cheek he looked ghastly where have you been i said trying and failing to stop crying having a quiet cigarette on the battlements said rory pondering whether there was life after birth hello buster i didnt see you how nice of you to drop in on emily does my mother know youre here she was quite hysterical said fiona reprovingly im not surprised said rory with all these people in here he came over and patted me on the shoulder there there lovie pack it in now everythings all right i thought buster was a ghost i explained feeling terribly silly i could only see his dressinggown and his hair you what for a minute rory looked at buster incredulously and then he leant against the wall and started to shake with laughter i got into the wrong wing said buster looking very discomfited perfectly natural mistake in these old houses thought i was going into my own bedroom rory sniffed still laughing i didnt know ghosts reeked of aftershave really buster next time you go bedhopping you should take an a z just think if you ended up in our hostesss room he looked round the room well if youve all finished id quite like to go to bed finn maclean glared at rory for a second and then stalked out of the room followed by buster followed by the frayns what an extraordinary couple i could hear her saying do you think they could be a bit mad still laughing rory started pulling off his tie there was a knock on the door probably buster wondering if hes forgotten someone said rory sure enough buster stood on the threshold rory dear boy just like a word with you knowing you itll be several words said rory dont say anything to your mother about this will you i heard buster saying in a low voice shes been under a lot of strain with her ankle just taken a sleeping pill wouldnt want to upset her youre an old goat buster said rory but your secret is safe with emily and me i cant alas vouch for doctor maclean who is the soul of indiscretion or for that appalling couple we gave a lift to goodness i said after hed gone do you think he was being unfaithful to coco probably said rory he and my mother trust each other just about as far as they can throw each other which always seems a good basis for marriage but whose bedroom was he trying to get into i asked probably taking potluck said rory marinas perhaps i said then could have bitten my tongue off marina left hours ago she and hamish arent staying here said rory they were having the most frightful row when they left they should lay off arguing occasionally a short rest would recharge their batteries for starting again so he hadnt been with marina instead hed been on the battlements by himself in a blizzard driven by what extremes of despair somehow that seemed even worse he got into bed put his arms round me and kissed me on the forehead i could never understand his changes of mood sorry you were frightened by buster he said and the next moment he was asleep i lay awake for a long time towards dawn he rolled over and caught hold of me groaning oh my darling my little love i realized he was asleep and with a sick agony that it certainly wasnt me he was talking to chapter fifteen for the first time i dreaded christmas at home it had been our own cosy womblike festival but with rory there wasnt likely to be peace on earth or goodwill towards men halfheartedly i chose a fir tree from the plantation behind our house and set it in a tub put holly on the walls strung a bit of mistletoe from the drawingroom light on christmas eve i went into penlorren to do lastminute shopping and buy some little presents for rorys stocking i left rory cleaning his gun for the shoot buster had arranged for boxing day when i got back weighed down with parcels there was a car parked outside the gate i let myself in and was just about to shout i was back when i heard raised voices from the studio i tiptoed closer so i could distinguish them one was like rough sand with a pronounced scottish accent the other aristocratic drawling silken with menace through the door i could see finn and rory facing each other like a huge lion and a sleek slim black panther obviously in the middle of a blazing row neither of them heard me well doctor said rory the words dripping with insolence why are you hounding me like this because ive got several things i want to say to you well dont say them now emilyll be back any moment i dont know what devilish game youre up to this time said finn but youd better stop playing cat and mouse with my sister leave her alone youve done enough damage i felt my throat go dry i held on to the door handle for support marinas over twentyone surely shes old enough to take care of herself said rory you know she cant thundered finn you of all people must know how near the edge she is dont you ever think of hamish not if i can help it said rory in a bored voice or emily leave emily out of it shes my problem you should really visit us more often finn youre like a breath of fresh air you damned little rat roared finn youre going to carry on as before arent you well things are slightly more complicated now but on the whole doctor youve got a pretty clear view of things you know i can put the police on you dont you said finn suddenly rory lost his temper he went as white as a sheet his black eyes blazed you wouldnt dare he hissed your family would come out of it as badly as mine i dont care their faces were almost touching in their rage then rorys control seemed to desert him he sprang at finn howling abuse his fingers round finns throat at one moment it seemed as though finn was going to be murdered the next rory had gone down before a crashing blow on the jaw and finn was standing over him fists clenched about to kick rorys head in no i screamed no dont touch him finn swung round his yellow eyes blazing then he looked down at rory thats only the beginning rory he said i wont be so gentle with you next time and he was gone are you all right i said fine rory said i do love christmas dont you it brings out those delightful histrionic qualities latent in all of us i didnt laugh i suppose youre going to tell me he was talking nonsense i said that there wasnt any truth in his accusations rory poured himself a drink and downed it in one then he banged the glass down what do you think emily thats what matters i dont think anything i said biting my lip to stop myself crying i just know you havent made love to me for nearly three months and its driving me crazy then finn comes here and says all these things and they seem to add up rory picked up the gun from the table and examined it so youre not getting your ration he said softly put that thing away i said nervously does it frighten you poor frustrated emily he lifted the gun his finger on the trigger dont i screamed he aimed the gun upwards there was a muted explosion the crash of a light bulb and the studio was in darkness the next minute a wedge of muscle and flesh hurled itself against me knocking the breath out of my body pinioning me to the carpet then rorys mouth ground against mine with such intensity our teeth clashed i struggled helplessly like a fly against a wall trying to push him away no rory no i shrieked you wanted it he swore youre bloody well going to get it it was over in a few seconds i lay on the floor rocking from side to side my hands over my mouth my ribs felt as though theyd crack with agony from the dry sobs i couldnt utter rory flicked on the side light and shone it in my face thats what you wanted wasnt it you dont seem pleased i gazed at him dumbly i could feel the tears welling out of my eyes you hate my guts dont you i whispered its your lack of guts i hate he said then suddenly he put his arms round me and pulled me against him i jerked my head away oh emily emily he muttered im so miserable and ive made you miserable too forgive me i dont know what gets into me running a dry tongue over my lips and tasting the blood congealing there i digested this outburst i should have tried to comfort him to find out what drove him to these black uncontrollable rages but i didnt feel up to it without a word i shook him off got to my feet and walked out of the room banging the door shut chapter sixteen looking back on a time of intense unhappiness one fortunately remembers very little our marriage was into injury time somehow we got through christmas and the next month hardly speaking licking our wounds yet still putting up a front to the outside world over and over i made plans to leave but could never quite bring myself to in spite of everything i still loved rory february brought snow turning the island into a place of magic cocos ankle recovered and she decided to give a birthday party for buster rory went to glasgow for the night to stock up with paint but was due back at lunchtime on the day of the party i went to sleep and had the most terrible nightmare about marina and rory lying tangled in each others arms asleep on the floor i woke up in floods of tears with the moon in my eyes and the screaming horrors in my mind i groped for rory beside me and then remembered he wasnt there i was too frightened to go back to sleep again i got up and cleaned the house from top to toe my charwoman had been off for several weeks with rheumatism and spent hours cooking rory a gorgeous lunch to welcome him home then i went out and bought two bottles of really good wine from now on i decided i was going to make a last effort to save my marriage at twelve oclock the telephone rang it was rory he was still in edinburgh hed be back later in time for cocos party why bother to come back home at all i said and slammed down the telephone all my good resolutions gone to pot how the hell was i to fill in the time until he got back i refused to cry i decided to drive into penlorren and buy buster a present two miles from home i suddenly realized id come out without my purse and decided to turn round and get it the road was icy and inches deep in snow my uturn was disastrously unsuccessful the next thing i was stuck across the road the wheels whirring up snow every time i pressed the accelerator suddenly around the corner a dark blue car came thundering towards me going much too fast even without ice on the roads i screamed with terror but was absolutely powerless to move there was no way it could brake in time then by some miracle of steering the driver managed to yank the car to the right slithering into a sixteenyard skid missing my car by inches before juddering to a halt in a snowdrift trust my luck it was my old enemy finn maclean who got out of the car all red hair and lowered black brows jaw corners and narrow infuriated eyes what the blazes do you think he began then he realized it was me took a deep breath and said god i might have known he looked me over in a way that made me feel very small and hot and uncomfortable i couldnt help it i blurted out still shaking from shock thats what im complaining about he said wearily im sure you couldnt help it only an imbecile would have attempted to turn a car around here ive said im sorry i said colouring hotly anyway you were driving much too fast and my car skidded noone could have moved it get out said finn brusquely i got out he got in and turned the car immediately then he got out and held the door open for me nothing to it he said infuriatingly you were just using too much choke it was the last straw i got into the car just looked at him and burst into tears then crashing the gears i roared off home god knows how i got back with the whole countryside swimming with tears i dont know how long i cried but long enough to make me look as ugly as sin then i noticed the potted plant coco had given me for christmas it looked limp and dejected needs a bit of love and attention like me i said dismally and getting up i got a watering can and gave it some water then i remembered someone had once told me if you watered rush mats it brought out the green i heard a step i must have left the door open hoping by some miracle it might be rory i looked up it was finn maclean dont you come catfooting in here i snarled then i realized how stupid it must look me standing there watering carpets in the middle of the drawingroom im not quite off my rocker i said weakly its meant to bring out the green in the rushes finn began to laugh whenever i see you youre either tearing up roses with your teeth trying to block the traffic or watering carpets how come youre such a nutcase i dont know i muttered i think i was dropped as an adult youre going to water the whole floor in a minute he said taking the watering can away from me for a minute he looked at me consideringly aware how puffy and red my eyes were i gazed at my feet then he said i came to apologize for biting your head off this morning i was tired i hadnt been to bed still it was no excuse and im sorry i was so surprised i sat down on the sofa thats all right i said i had a lousy night too otherwise i wouldnt have cried wheres rory in glasgow im going over to mullin this afternoon to see a patient why dont you come too i get sick on planes i said quickly you cant land a plane there im taking the speedboat ill pick you up in half an hour we neednt talk if we dont want to chapter seventeen it was a beautiful day the sun shone and the hills glittered like mountains of salt against an arctic blue sky the gloom was still on me as we ploughed over the dark green water but i found it easier to endure particularly when i found finn and i could talk or not talk with a reasonable amount of ease when we moored and i leapt on to the landingstage he caught me and his hands were steady and reassuring like a man used to handling women as we walked up the mountainside to a little grey farmhouse the bracken glittered white like ostrich feathers of purest glass snow sparkled an inch on every leaf icicles hung four feet deep suddenly an old woman her arm in plaster came running out of an outhouse beside the farm doctor she screamed thank god yeve come its me wee cow careful youll slip said finn taking her good arm whats the matter with her shes started calving and things dinna look too well angus went to the mainland for help but hes not back yet ill have a look at her said finn going into the outhouse a terrified moaning threshing cow was lying in the corner easy now said finn soothingly and went up to her he had a look then called shes pretty far gone bridget the old woman promptly started crying and wailing that it was their only cow go back to the house finn told her ill do what i can youll only be a hindrance with that arm come on he added to me you can help i cant i squeaked i dont know anything about cows shall i take the boat back to the island and get help its too late said finn rolling up his sleeves as he spoke the cow gave another terrified moan of pain oh all right i said sulkily tell me what to do hold on to the calfs legs said finn and when i say pull pull hard gawd i muttered what a way to spend a thursday the straw was already sticky with blood and there was only one watt bulb to work under finn barked out instructions havent you got any pethedine for her i said finn didnt answer i supposed he was used to delivering babies but women in labour dont usually flail and lurch around like cows do im sure shed be less uptight if the bull had been present at the birth i joked weakly as i picked myself up from the stinking straw for the third time after that i stopped making jokes but just gritted my teeth and followed finns instructions aware that despite his herculean strength he could be surprisingly gentle then at last a thin longlegged calf was lying safe on the straw being proudly licked by its mother oh isnt it sweet i said tears pricking my eyelids well done said finn i felt as though hed given me the nobel prize come inside and have a wash bridgetll give us a cup of tea on the boat home he said you look absolutely whacked it isnt often i spend the afternoon playing midwife to a cow i said come along to the surgery tomorrow he said id like to have a look at you i blushed absurdly flattered at his concern hows the hospital going i asked fine three wards completed already you must be run off your feet he shrugged his shoulders ive got a new intern starting next week whichll help whats he like its a she oh i said momentarily nonplussed whats she like very attractive i chose her myself for yourself bit early to tell im a romantic i suppose all part of the celtic hangup i dont think the manwoman thing should be conducted on a rabbit level the lights were coming on in penlorren now pale in the fading light i felt stupidly displeased at the thought of some glamorous woman doctor working with finn i saw her with slim ankles and not a hair out of place white coat open to show an ample cashmere bosom what happened to your marriage i asked my wife liked having a harley street husband and giving little dinner parties in the suburbs with candlelight and sparkling wine oh dear i said giggling not quite your forte on the contrary i look very good by candlelight it was my fault as much as hers she was beautiful capable and absolutely bored me to death i married her without really knowing her most people dont love human beings anyway they just love an idealized picture in their heads i looked at his face softened now ive never liked red hair but finns was very dark and thick and grew beautifully close to his head ive never liked freckles either or broken noses but he had extraordinary eyes yellowflecked with thick black lashes and his mouth now it wasnt set in its usual hard line was beautiful the wind was blowing his trousers against his hard muscular legs he was in great shape too in spite of his size he moved about the boat like a cat are you coming to cocos party tonight i asked i might he said depends whats up at the hospital please come i said then blushed i mean if youre not too busy chapter eighteen rory was in the bath when i got back wearing my bath cap but still managing to look absurdly handsome come in he said im indecent where have you been out and about i said can i have that bath after you i went into the bedroom i didnt want to tell him about finn he followed me dripping from the bath wheres my white silk shirt he asked oh er im glad you asked that question is this it he said pulling a crumpled pink rag of a shirt out of the pillowcase of washing on the bed well it could be i said god said rory he went on pulling crumpled pink shirts out like a conjurer whipping out coloured handkerchiefs how do you manage it he asked i left one of my red silk scarves in the machine by mistake i said miserably next time you want to do some dyeing just count me out he said and starting to get dressed he put both feet into one leg of his underpants and fell over which didnt improve his temper how was edinburgh i said knowing that marina had her singing lesson there once a fortnight he paused a second too long ive been to glasgow he said evenly rubbed raw with rancour we arrived at the party it was a dazzling affair all the locals done up to the eyeballs in wool tweed i was wearing about a quarter as much clothing as everyone else pretty as a picture said buster coming and squeezing me happy birthday said rory i thought of buying you a book buster but i knew youd already got one i heard someone laugh behind us it was marina looking ravishing in a highnecked amber wool dress with long sleeves id forgotten about her being so beautiful since christmas she had become in my tortured imagination a sort of maneating gorgon with snakes writhing in her hair and corpses strewn about her feet she smiled into rorys eyes and went over to say hello to coco even the highnecked dress couldnt conceal two dark bruises under her chin shes got love bites all over her neck i hissed at rory out of the corner of my mouth i suppose you recognize the teeth marks he hissed back well they couldnt be hamishs i said he hasnt got any teeth left emilee said rory quietly youve got very bitchy since i married you you were bitchy before i married you i snapped it must be catching the party was a roaring success everyone drank a great deal too much i was sitting on the sofa with rory several hours later when marina came up and sat down beside us hello darlings ive decided to give up hamish for lent do you think elizabeths dress quite comes off she added pointing at a fat blonde it will do later in the evening if i know elizabeth said rory buster came up and filled up our drinks hello emily he said you look a bit bleak not having words with rory i hope rory and i dont have words any more we just have silences i said getting somewhat unsteadily to my feet come back said rory buster wants to look down your dress but i fled out of the room falling over busters labrador who took it in extremely bad part why didnt finn come every time the doorbell rang i hoped it was him people were dancing in the diningroom now i talked for hours to some dreary laird with a hawhaw voice and a comeheather look in his eye hamish came up to us he looked greyer and more haggard than ever but his eyes had lost none of their goatish gleam emily he said i havent talked to you all evening come and dance how could i refuse on the dance floor rory and marina were swaying very respectably two feet apart it was just the way they were looking at each other like souls in torment just like lovebirds arent they said hamish bitterly i looked at him startled on second thoughts he said its time you and i had a little chat he led me into a study off the hall and shut the door my heart was thumping unpleasantly what do you want i said just to talk doesnt that little ménage upset you what ménage i said quickly my lovely wife and your handsome husband weve each been dealt a marked card darling neither of them gives a damn about us i dont want to listen i said going towards the door but you must he said catching my arm his face suddenly alight with malevolence its quite a story when marina married me six months ago i was foolish enough to think she cared for me but within weeks i realized she only wanted me for my money if she was after money i said why didnt she marry rory hes just as rich as you are just as rich said hamish but rory if you remember only inherited his money after he married you that was one of the conditions of rorys father hectors will rory wouldnt get a bean until he was safely married then why didnt he marry marina that was another condition of the will hector made another condition that if he married marina he wouldnt get a penny it would all go to charity so he married you to get his hands on the cash i felt myself go icy cold but i dont understand i whispered that doesnt sound like rory at all if hed really wanted to marry marina he wouldnt have cared a damn about not inheriting the money he could easily have got a job or earned money from his painting if hed wanted to oh my poor child said hamish mockingly what a lot youve got to learn cant you understand that its not possible for rory ever to marry marina money or no money why not i said because theyre brother and sister what i gasped in horror they cant be im afraid so hector laird of the island lord lieutenant pillar of respectability on the surface was an old ram on the side like claiming droit de seigneur and all that he was very keen on marinas mother for a long time im afraid the result was marina i felt as though i was going to faint brother and sister i whispered again well halfbrother and sister hardly a healthy union particularly as theres always been a strong strain of insanity in hectors family but it doesnt seem to deter them does it how long have they known i muttered only about a year theres always been a blood feud between the balniels and the macleans as you know so when rory and marina fell in love they didnt exactly broadcast the fact until one night rory got drunk and had a row with hector they never really got on and told him he was going to marry marina hector nearly burst a gut the next day he told rory the truth and that under no circumstances could he marry marina rory went berserk with rage the shock killed hector he died that night of a heart attack but the will still stood my god i said dully so marina married me in a fit of despair hamish went on and rory went south and married you which drove marina mad with jealousy and now as you see theyre up to their old tricks my brain was reeling i felt as if id been kicked in the gut marina and rory brother and sister byron and augusta leigh starcrossed lovers a union so fatally seductive because it was impossible oh poor rory i breathed now i understand oh poor poor rory poor you and me breathed hamish in my ear he was standing very close to me one hand fondling my wrist his eyes fixed on my face in a greedy way i could feel the warmth of his body his hand stealing up my bare arm his hot breath on my shoulder you mustnt be shy of me little emily he said caressingly slipping his arm round my waist i think youre very pretty even if rory doesnt why dont we console one another no i screamed no no no go away you revolting old man dont touch me i leapt to my feet ran across the room wrenched open the door and went slap into finn maclean hello he said ive been looking for you then he looked at me more closely hey whats the matter nothing everything i sobbed and shoving him violently aside i fled past him i ran out into the garden it had been snowing again the drive was virginally white in the pale moonlight all was deathly silent the snow lay soft and tender on the lawn crying great heaving sobs i ran to the edge of the cliffs the sea stretched out opaque black and starpowdered the lighthouse flashed like a blue gem the rocks gleamed evilly two hundred feet below oh rory i sobbed i cant go on i cant go on but as i took a step forward my arm was caught in a vicelike grip dont be a bloody little fool said a voice nothings that important it was finn let me go i sobbed i want to die he held on to my arm and finally i collapsed against him oh finn i sobbed what am i going to do he held me for a minute then putting an arm round my shoulders he half carried me across the snow to the stables where buster kept his horses i collapsed on to a pile of hay still sobbing bitterly finn let me cry he just sat there stroking my shoulders finally i gulped its not true is it marina and rory both being hectors children finn paused his hand tightening on my shoulder then he said it is im afraid oh god i said why didnt anyone tell me noone knew except me and rory and marina marina must have told hamish even coco doesnt know about it how long have you known i said dully as long as i can remember i got back from school early one afternoon i heard laughter coming from the bedroom and went in and found my mother in bed with hector my father was away at the time i ran and hid in the woods my father came home that night and sent out a search party when they found me my father thrashed me for worrying my mother i never told him the truth i suppose kids have a sort of honour even at that age but i never forgave hector and he never forgave me for discovering what an old fraud he was so you always knew rory and marina were brother and sister he nodded about a year ago i came back from london for a weekend and discovered to my horror theyd fallen in love and were thinking of getting married i tried to stop marina but shed got the bit between her teeth by then so i went to hector and told him hed got to tell rory the truth not a very pretty story is it i said thats why ive been behaving like a policeman trying to keep them apart said finn with insanity on both sides and a blood tie between them it would be absolutely fatal if rory got marina pregnant i sat numbly trying to take it all in finn was holding me in his arms now stroking my hair soothing me like a child i felt the hardness of his body the gentleness of his hands it was so long since id been in a mans arms ive always said i have no sense of timing his mouth was so near to mine almost instinctively i put my face up and kissed him the next moment he was kissing me back heavens i said wriggling away absolutely appalled im terribly sorry dont be he said softly its one of the nicest surprises ive ever had and he kissed me again this time it was a kiss that meant business i tried to be frigid and unyielding but could feel the warm waves of lust coasting all over me i felt my body go weak i was torn between desire and utter exhaustion strange things happen in stables i muttered weakly one moment im a midwife next moment im bowling towards adultery talk about my tart is in the highlands finn smiled got up and pulled me to my feet come on im taking you home please dont i said listen he said i never meant this to happen when i brought you in here i want you very much but i think now is neither the time nor the place youre slightly drunk and youre suffering from severe shock im not going to let you do anything you might regret in the morning he drove me home outside the house he burrowed in his bag and produced a couple of sleeping pills take them tonight immediately you get in and come and see me at the surgery tomorrow at eleven then we can talk things over when i got in i hardly had the strength to undress i fell rather than got into bed pulled the sheets like a curtain over my head and dropped into a deep sleep chapter nineteen i woke up next morning feeling ghastly went straight to the loo and was violently sick i had a blinding headache took four alkaseltzers and was sick again rory was still fast asleep i tiptoed around the bedroom getting my clothes on i only just managed to make it to finns surgery there was only one woman in there when i arrived finn came out he looked tired but he smiled at me reassuringly ill just see mrs cameron first he said she wont take long i gazed unseeingly at magazines and wondered why i was feeling quite so awful finns receptionist eyed me with interest mrs balniel looking like a road accident she must have been thinking mrs cameron came out thanking finn effusively and i went into his surgery it was large and rather untidy and amazingly comforting finn shut the door and leant against it then he came across the room and kissed me it was a different kiss from last night that was alcohol and pentup emotion this was slow measured tender and left me just as weak with lust arent we doing fearful things to the hippocratic oath i said flopping on to a chair i couldnt give a damn you arent my patient yet though you ought to be you look terrible thanks i said and infinitely desirable nothing a few weeks away from rory wouldnt cure i was as sick as a dog all morning i said nerves and booze i suppose ill tell miss bates to shove off then ill give you a going over youd better wipe that lipstick off first i said finn laughed he wasnt laughing half an hour later youre pregnant he said i was stunned by the news but i cant be pregnant i gasped rory hasnt laid a finger on me for months then i remembered oh god i said whats the matter asked finn after that row on christmas eve when you knocked rory over he was so mad with rage he sort of raped me that must have been it said finn my brain was whirling me pregnant with rorys child what sort of chance would a baby have with rory not loving me and me fancying finn absolutely rotten all of a sudden i had a nightmare vision of rory and me shouting at each other across the babys cot of the baby crying all day and rory going spare because he couldnt work oh heavens i said shakily finn went to a cupboard in the corner of the room and got out a bottle of brandy and two glasses wed better have a drink he said as i watched him fill the glasses i was filled with a ridiculous mawkish sadness ill never be able to memorize every freckle on his face now i thought or see the grey hairs gradually take the fire out of that red mane he put a glass beside me then took hold of my frozen hands his were warm and strong and comforting i felt an irresistible urge to collapse in tears on his shoulder its a hell of a mess he said gently but it doesnt matter well sort something out can we i asked dolefully look he went on you and rory are washed up anyone can see that do you want to keep the baby i thought for a minute yes i do very much that means youll stay with rory what else can i do i said bitterly im signed up for this gig and ive got to play you can move in with me the room reeled for a moment all i could think of was the blissful sanctity of finn taking care of me oh finn i said the tears welling up in my eyes id drive you round the twist i wouldnt think so we can always try but what about the baby he shrugged his shoulders its rorys i said taking a slug of my brandy and nearly choking youd hate that youd keep seeing all the things you hate about rory in its character and your reputation on the island would be absolutely ruined your worst enemys wife shacking up with you and pregnant to boot my reputation can take it said finn is it because you want to score off rory by taking me away from him i blurted out it was a terrible thing to say rory would have certainly hit me for it but finn merely looked at me consideringly i dont know he said i thought about that for a long time last night after id dropped you off of course theres an element of truth i dont have any compunction about taking you away from rory i know hes made you miserable and unhappy but even if you were married to my best friend i dont think it would make any difference id still want you its one of the unattractive things about loving someone one just suspends all moral values then his face softened but there are an awful lot of attractive things about it come here no i said desperately please no he held out his hands why not i want you its very noble of you to make the offer but i couldnt noble what the hell are you talking about i know why youre asking me its from motives of altruism marinas your sister and you feel guilty about the way she and rory have fouled up my life finn drained his glass emily will you please stop talking nonsense im the least altruistic person alive apart from being a doctor i never do anything to please anyone except myself you took me sailing yesterday look said finn i took you sailing yesterday because i thought you needed a break now i realize ive wanted you since the first moment i saw you pulling up my roses with your teeth in a black seethrough nightie oh i felt myself blushing furiously how kind of you to put it like that and you dont believe a word of it no youd never have asked me to move in with you if i hadnt been pregnant i searched feverishly for a tissue and mopped my eyes of course i wouldnt said finn id have taken it more slowly theres absolutely no point in shacking up with someone one hardly knows who ones not in love with i said shakily that stopped him i suppose not he said grimly i gave my eyes a final wipe im sorry i dont mean to keep crying its the shock of the baby and finding out about rory and marina last night and besides id be hopeless for you i mean longterm i dont have the right face for greeting patients and id forget to pass on messages about cardiacs and things we can still go on seeing each other no i said when youre pregnant you cant go around carrying on with other people i mean it turns you into a sort of nun having a baby finn laughed but bitterly you know do you from your quarter of an hours experience youll still have to come in for checkups if you dont want to see me i suppose jackie barrett can look after you whos she my new intern oh god i minded about her i minded like hell i fought back the tears i didnt dare kiss finn or i might have broken down goodbye and thank you i said finn looked suddenly tired and defeated all right go back to rory if you want to but remember im here youve only to pick up a telephone and ill come and take you away chapter twenty which wasnt a very good basis for trying to rebuild a marriage when i got home i was all screwed up to tell rory about the baby but he was so immersed in slapping blue paint on a huge canvas absolutely lost to the world that i funked it and so having not told him i found it more and more difficult in fact he was so obsessed with work for the next few weeks he hardly noticed me at all i thought endlessly about the baby no more staying in the cinema to see the film once again got to get home to the babysitter no more running away to sea i thought of dirty nappies and sleepless nights and maternity bras and getting bigger and heavier and less attractive to rory but somehow i felt excited too growing inside was something that when it arrived would really need me something i could love totally and unashamedly as i wanted to love rory as circumstances had stopped me loving finn i kept wanting to tell rory i bought a bottle of champagne and day after day took it out of its hiding place at the back of a drawer then funked it and put it away i made a concerted attempt to win rory over sexually but it had been god im tired for days now as soon as i got into bed hed switch off his light turn his back on me and pretend to be asleep and id lie beside him tears sliding into my hair listening to the sea washing on the rocks below and thinking of finn who was probably still working going out to deliver a baby or soothing a restless patient his harsh beautifully ugly face would swim before my eyes and i would wonder how much longer i could hold out i went to every party on the island too in the hope that i might see him but he never turned up which meant i drank too much and was even sicker the morning after i did see miss barrett the new intern though i couldnt resist having a gawp i went in for a checkup and had a great shock she was naturally blonde and slim one of those women who look marvellous without makeup deep subtle competent able to keep her mouth shut the antithesis of me did i imagine too an added warmth in her voice when she talked about finn dr maclean likes things done this way dr maclean doesnt approve of pregnant women putting on too much weight dr maclean recommends these vitamin pills and dr maclean recommends me i wanted to shout at her hes mine and trespassers will be very much prosecuted the weeks passed slowly i sank into despair i could hardly bring myself to get up in the morning and get dressed one sunday morning however when i was trying to keep down some toast and marmalade i suddenly caught rory looking at me you look awful he said what are you trying to turn yourself into then followed a tenminute invective about my general attitude towards him and everyone else on the island i was lazy childish stubborn stupid and uncooperative why didnt i do something instead of slopping around all day what do you think i should be doing going to evening classes exchanging meaningful glances over the basketwork and all that i said maybe you could go out more see people buster offered you his horses anytime you wanted to ride anything but this plastic tomb youve sealed yourself into have you finished i whispered yes for the time being im sorry i came on so strong i didnt mean to be quite so vicious but im fed up with sharing a house with a zombie i got up without looking at him and dragged myself upstairs he was right one look at myself in the mirror sent me yelping to the bathroom to wash my hair then i rang buster and asked if i could come and ride with him that afternoon rory was absurdly pleased and even rubbed my hair dry for me stay over at the castle when youve finished he said ill come over and take you all out to dinner for the first time in months he kissed me buster and i rode up the lower slopes through beech trees between mossy rocks walter scott ran about snorting and chasing rabbits finally we reached the top hospitals finished now said buster pointing his whip at the new building on the right finns got it up jolly fast have you been inside i shook my head busters voice the usual mixture of sex gin and a dash of bitters flowed on have you seen finns new popsy i stiffened popsy dr barrett went on buster shes an absolute smasher took my lumbago to see her last week can hardly keep my hands off her are she and finn having a walkout i asked why do you think he brought her up here said buster as though it were a matter of course finn isnt daft black gloom overwhelmed me as i rode back down the hill finn in love with someone else that left rory and me didnt it i think ill go straight home now i said isnt rory taking us out to dinner asked buster he is i said but theres something i want to tell him first and i want to change too we stabled the horses and as i drove back home i decided now was the time to tell rory about the baby well have to face the music together mate i said to the child inside me maybe hell surprise us and be delighted after all i went into the house and tiptoed upstairs to get the champagne the bedroom door was open and i caught them redhanded chapter twentyone marina and rory in bed for a second all i could think was how beautiful they looked on my dark blue sheets her glorious mass of red hair cascading all over the pillows just like a hollywood film two people too beautiful for real life then i screamed and they looked round marina recovered from the shock first im sorry emily she said but you had to know sometime oh ive known i said ive known for ages and ive known too about your being brother and sister that rocked them i mean its nice your keeping it in the family i went on but that sort of thing is rather frowned on in the prayer book and by the law i should think i ran out of the room locked myself in the loo and started to cry after a few minutes someone came and rattled on the door go away i screamed use the other loo this ones engaged emily its me marinas gone for gods sake come out i want to help you help me i felt my tears escalating into hysterical laughter help me what can you do to help me let me in or ill break the door down no i screamed no no there was a silence and then an explosion i screamed again the door was swinging and rory was standing in the doorway a smoking gun in his hand hed shot the lock out now come out he said grabbing my arm and dragging me into the bedroom walter scott sat whimpering in the corner i know why you married me i hissed just to release the cash from hectors will to give you a front of respectability so you could carry on with marina your dear little sister rory was trembling who told you all this he said hamish did i said hes a swine said rory hes unhappy i said he didnt want anyone to be left out he certainly hasnt behaved any worse than you when youre desperate you suspend any kind of morality rory said echoing finns words of two months before then he told me quietly and without any emotion that when hed first met me hed been very attracted to me had thought i was so gentle loving and understanding that we might even make a go of it he said he had intended had tried desperately hard to break it off with marina but had failed to do so and there was nothing he could plead by way of excuse or justification volcanoes of invective and abuse kept boiling up inside me and sinking down again it was his detachment that paralysed my powers of speech but for the cold fixed shadows in his eyes and his deathly pallor he seemed his normal self marina and i do realize were social pariahs in the wilderness for good and all shes upset of course because she cant have my children shes upset i breathed oh boy do i feel sympathy for her i suppose its more exciting doing it here in our bed its much more exotic than turning on ten miles away where i couldnt possibly catch you he looked at me did i imagine there was a flicker of despair in his eyes then he said the fatal words im sorry em get out i hissed get out get out he stood irresolute for a minute i dont want to spend another minute under the same roof as you i said i suppose that was the cue he wanted within two minutes hed thrown his things into a suitcase and walter and he were gone whimpering with terror i rushed to the telephone i recognized jackie barretts voice immediately there was music in the background can i speak to dr maclean i said just a minute how cool and offhand she sounded is it urgent hes very tied up at the moment yes it is very urgent whos that speaking its personal finn darling she said and i could just imagine her turning up her palms in a gesture of helplessness im afraid its for you i slammed down the receiver rory gone finn obviously taken care of by dr barrett that left the baby and me youre the only thing ive got now i said numbly it wouldnt take me long to pack my suitcase either if i hurried i could catch the seven oclock ferry i rang for a taxi when the doorbell rang i grabbed rorys dark glasses to hide my swollen eyes gathered up my two suitcases and walked to the top of the stairs i suppose i must have missed the top step the next moment i was falling the pain was something id never known or could ever have imagined the rest was blackness chapter twentytwo through a haze of pain i kept dreaming of marina and rory in bed together writhing like snakes on those navyblue sheets then i heard a familiar voice say the doses have been exceptionally strong but her reflexes are much better a womans voice said its unlikely well get a peep out of her for twentyfour hours painfully battling with nausea i opened my eyes and there miraculously was finn standing at the end of the bed talking to a nurse the image of rory and marina floated back in front of me and i screamed finn moved like lightning darling emily its me i went on screaming and yelling incoherently he had his arms round me ill deal with her he said the nurse melted away i sat rigid i remember everything that happened i said its finn emily darling i stopped screaming and collapsed against him oh finn help me youve had a bad dream i remember everything my lips began to tremble you promise not to do anything to find rory not anything dont worry he reassured me he persuaded me to lie back on the pillows but kept a firm grip on my hand dont go away i whispered im staying right here i thought you didnt want me any more and then i found rory and marina steady darling dont think about it youre going to get better but i saw them in bed together i saw them the edge of the cliff began to crumble i started to scream and lash about the nurse came back with a hypodermic syringe i tried to struggle but finn held me still whatever it was they gave me worked instantly next time i surfaced i was calmer i was in an ugly fawn but sunny room a fat nurse was arranging some daffodils in a blue vase there were flowers everywhere is this a funeral parlour i asked she rushed over and started fumbling with my pulse where am i in hospital good old hospital with hot and cold housemen in every bedroom ill get dr maclean she said and belted off i heard mutterings in the passage about still being delirious finn walked into the room jump in doctor i said well be delirious together it sounds as though shes recovered finn said to the nurse he was one of those rewarding men who can betray emotion in public his yellow eyes were filled with tears as he looked down at me hello baby hello i said dont try to talk i missed you i said i missed you horribly he smiled i suppose you must have you talked enough in your sleep he looked absolutely grey with tiredness the dope theyd given me had removed every vestige of my selfcontrol i do love you i said youve got such a lovely face they kept me under gradually reduced sedation for the first fortyeight hours bringing me back to earth slowly i cant remember when the baby drifted back into my consciousness but i remember suddenly saying to finn in panic the baby its all right isnt it he took my hand im afraid you lost it we tried to save it darling you must believe that i felt gripped by a piercing sadness then i said wheres rory hes fine i said wheres rory tell me the truth finn the yellow eyes flickered for a moment he hasnt come back he must be on the mainland somewhere with marina he nodded i presume so she disappeared the night you fell down the stairs neither of them has been seen since chapter twentythree i lay in my hospital bed for i dont know how many days dully watching the beauty of the highland spring among this building of nests and mating of birds and animals i felt alien and outcast i ached for the baby i had lost a brisk bossy nurse looked after me nurse mckellen she had cometobedpan eyes and tried to fill me up with pills and pretty revolting food couldnt i have a nurse with a sense of humour i asked finn not on the health service he said i longed inordinately for his visits he used to pop in during the mornings or late in the evenings after visiting hours and just sit holding my hand and telling me about his day or letting me rave on about rory and the baby if i felt like it once when jackie barrett came in he didnt even let go of my hand shes getting better he told her good she said crisply you gave us all a fright she added to me i thought i detected a few chips of ice in her blue eyes i thought you were having an affaire with her i said after shed gone finn looked surprised she answered the telephone the night i rang and sounded awfully proprietorial she had no need to said finn we were only watching some medical programme on television after that i felt much happier i slept a lot finn still wouldnt allow me any visitors and i didnt want any but at the back of my mind was a great deal of dread and expectation i didnt have to wait long two days later i was lying in bed half asleep suddenly there was a commotion outside and a familiar voice saying impatiently where is she immediately i was awake and drenched with sweat my pulses pounding dont be so bloody stupid continued the voice im her husband then nurse mckellens voice anxious and flustered im sorry dr macleans orders are that she has no visitors then ill go through the wards waking every patient till i find her you dinna understand sir mrs balniels been verra ill she had severe concussion and internal haemorrhage as well and shes been very depressed since she regained consciousness learning about losing the baby poor wee lassie the what rorys voice was like the crack of a whip what did you say since she lost the bairn you must have been disappointed too sir then rorys voice hissing through his teeth where is she damn you and nurse mckellens highpitched shriek dont you lay your hands on me young man all right mrs balniels in there but ill no answer for dr maclean when he comes back i heard a quick step outside a moment later the door was flung open and in strode rory so there you are hello rory i croaked he was beside the bed black eyes blazing his face deathly pale against the black fur of his coat whats this about a baby he demanded is it true i nodded how long had you known about two months why the hell didnt you tell me i tried to i said miserably i wanted to so badly i just didnt feel up to it and you threw me out without even letting me know of its existence i didnt think youd be interested not interested in my own child mr balniel it was nurse mckellen again her starched bosom heaving we mustnt disturb mrs balniel rory didnt turn his head get out you fat bitch he said then when she didnt he turned on her one look at the murderous expression on his face and she scarpered how did it happen he asked i was wearing your dark glasses i must have missed the top step of the stairs and conked out when i hit the bottom i suppose you dont remember anything about it he said not much i said slowly but i remember very vividly what happened before rory sidestepped the issue why the hell couldnt you have told me about the baby before he said it was criminally irresponsible of you i hope you realize that i knew you were in love with marina i said feebly if id told you about the baby youd have thought i was trying to trap you thats the most fatuous remark ive ever heard snapped rory i suppose it was my child i burst into tears at that moment finn walked in he was livid you could feel the hatred sizzling between the two men like summer lightning whats going on finn said to nurse mckellen make him go away i sobbed leave her alone thundered finn get out of here do you want her to have a complete relapse shes my wife said rory im entitled to stay with her not if youre going to make her ill look at her finn sat down on the bed and put his arms round me there lovie its all right i cant take any more i sobbed into finns shoulder please make him go away finn looked up rory was ashen his fists clenched now are you going to get out said finn rory walked out slamming the door behind him chapter twentyfour next day finn flew round the island to visit his patients and rory rolled up at visiting time he looked tired sulky unshaven but still illogically handsome oh please dont let me fall under his spell again he brought with him a huge bunch of liliesofthevalley two tins of pâté de foie gras a pornographic novel and a bottle of lucozade the meat paste is from my mother he said buster sent the piece of porn he said he enjoyed it which is no great recommendation they all send love then he handed me the lucozade bottle this should get you through the long evenings its whisky and water actually but if you keep the top on i defy even dr maclean to tell the difference i giggled how did you get in here i said i should have thought finn would have put bloodhounds on the gates i batted my eyelashes at a rather formidable blonde called dr barrett she said i could see you for a quarter of an hour that figures i said how are you i asked im fine said rory whos looking after you i said then blushed furiously i mean i didnt mean to pry noones looking after me he said i was dying to ask where marina was but suddenly i felt exhausted like a hostess at the end of a party when noones enjoyed themselves you dont have to stay i said its awfully boring visiting people in hospital sick of me already are you i looked up and he was staring at me as if for the first time he went on staring until i dropped my eyes in embarrassment he got up to go ill come back tomorrow he said im sorry about the baby then he did the strangest thing he leant forward and did up the four undone buttons of my nightie i dont want finn looking at your tits he said he turned up every day after that neither of us mentioned marina i was surprised how nice he could be not mocking not bored but i found his visits a terrible strain if finn knew about them he didnt say anything one day a week later a heavily pregnant girl was rushed into the room next door to have her baby she was very young and frightened and her husband looked even younger and more scared but their tenderness for one another made me once again realize what i had lost when finn came in later in his overcoat just off on his rounds he found me in tears he understood at once is it the girl next door he asked i nodded miserably its just triggered off memories i said dont be unhappy he said putting his arms around me theres years ahead for you to have babies the door opened i jumped and looked around rory stood in the doorway looking distinctly menacing going absolutely scarlet i leapt away from finn then thought why the hell should i after the way rorys treated me i thought you werent coming until later i stammered so i notice he snapped shall i leave you to it dont be stupid i said finns just off on his rounds im quite happy to stay here if you think youll need protection finn said rory set his teeth and strolled in the middle of the room a muscle was pounding in his cheek before he could speak i quickly said im able to take care of myself thanks rory glared furiously at finn until he was out of the room if you dont want me to smash the hell out of him youd better not start necking with him any more ok quite ok i said but quite honestly youre being fatuous only jealousy could merit such rage and as you selfconfessedly dont love me why the hell should you be jealous i believe in protecting my own property said rory anyway he wasnt necking with me i said he was comforting me i was miserable about losing the baby rory came towards me holding out his arms its me who ought to comfort you he said gently i shrank away from him terrified i started to cry oh for christs sake he snapped im not up to rows i bleated he prowled up and down the room what a horrible place this is he said its time you came home i cant i yelped ive been very ill finn says im not strong enough to go home yet chapter twentyfive later that evening i tried to read busters pornographic novel while the little girl had her baby next door i held my ears to blot out her screams and the voice of her husband trying to reassure her finally i heard the lusty yelling of the newborn baby later going out to the loo i saw the husband outside the room tears pouring down his face is she all right i asked he nodded shes wonderful and the babys fine a wee boy were going to call him finn after dr maclean how would you like some whisky i said i wouldna say no to a drop i took him back to my room and got out the lucozade bottle an hour later we were sitting on my bed as tight as two ticks laughing immoderately over passages in busters novel it was nurse mckellen who discovered us she was absolutely appalled i escaped to the loo giggling feebly i felt very peculiar at least ive got some colour in my cheeks i said looking at my flushed wildeyed face in the mirror outside i found finn i looked down the passage there was noone there hello darling i whispered what have you been up to he said nurse mckellens spreading terrifying tales of drunken orgies i giggled and collapsed against him you have been drinking he said on the emptiest stomach in the western isles i said and its gone right down to my toes ive been celebrating the birth of little finn the second and reading porn so i feel fantastically sexy finn tried to look disapproving and then laughed i wound my arms round his neck and kissed him after a minutes hesitation he kissed me back long and hard until the blood was drumming in my head and i thought i was going to faint wow do i feel sexy i murmured how the hell do you think i feel he said a telephone shrilled in the next room id better answer that he said ill deal with you later ive got you under my skin ive got you deheep in the heart of me i sang as i swayed down the passage slap into rory standing in the shadows he must have seen everything oh god i said going briskly into reverse he caught my arm and held on tightly you bloody phoney he hissed you bloody little phoney all that dame aux camelias act not feeling well enough to get out of bed you said depends on whose bed doesnt it doctor maclean wont let you leave i bet he wont youre having a ball together arent you arent you he yelled i looked around for a convenient secondfloor window to jump out of you dont understand i muttered oh i do baby i understand only too well the whole thing was getting too much for me with a sigh i forced myself to look at him id never seen him so cold with rage youre coming home tonight before you get up to any more tricks he said that moment finn came out of the side door i thought theyd have a right old setto but i was wrong finn had other things on his mind now a petrol ships blown up outside the harbour he said theyre bringing the survivors back in the lifeboats most of them are likely to have secondor thirddegree burns so youll be needing all the beds you can get said rory yes we will said dr barrett coming down the hall ill take emily home then said rory thats an excellent idea said dr barrett warmly the scheming cow finn looked as though he was about to protest then thought better of it if you can take her to the castle he said where theres someone to look after her see that she rests as much as possible of course said rory do you need any help ill ring you if we do but most of the poor bastards will have had it the ambulance is leaving finn said jackie barrett going towards the stairs just coming said finn he looked at me as though he wanted to say something but i could feel him sliding away both mentally and physically ill ring tomorrow and see how youre getting on he said then he was gone i felt overwhelmed with desolation and fear and now emily dear said rory softly i think its time you came home we didnt speak on the way back from the hospital but as the castle loomed into view rory shot straight past it finn said you were to take me to the castle i bleated youre coming home snapped rory where i can keep an eye on you you cant force me to stay with you i can even if i have to strap you to the bed go directly to jail i chanted do not pass go do not collect i steeled myself for chaos when we got home but the house looked marvellous someone had obviously been having a massive blitz rory steered me into the studio the canvases had all been stacked neatly into one corner a huge log fire blazed and the smell of wood smoke mingled exotically with the scent of a big bowl of blue hyacinths on the windowsill anyone would think you were expecting company i said i was said rory grimly you i came to the hospital to collect you oh very masterful i said collapsing on to the divan in the corner rory poured himself a good mahoganycoloured whisky id like one too i said youve had enough he said he leaned against the mantelpiece a long stick he had been about to throw into the fire in his hands the expression on his face scared me he was quite capable of beating me up now he said just how long have you been having an affair with maclean i havent i said dont lie to me he thundered affairs begin below the waist i protested all finn has done is kiss me three times to be exact you counted them yes i did because they mattered and where did all this restraint take place finn looked after me the night i found out you and marina were brother and sister but the next day as soon as i discovered i was pregnant we stopped seeing each other tonight id been at the whisky and busters porny novel so when i met finn in the passage i suddenly fancied him rotten there was a crack rory had snapped the lath in his hands he was silent for a minute his face strangely dead then he threw the broken sticks on the fire youre nothing better than a tart he said i dont want to be better than a tart i said men seem to rather like them well its got to stop said rory you have the teremity i said temerity interrupted rory ill say teremity if i like you have the terem or whatever its called to carry on with marina behind my back and then kick up a doginthemanger rumpus just because i seek a little consolation from finn youre only livid because you hate finn not because you care a scrap for me shut up said rory youre drunk youd better go up to bed no i shrieked i cant do it do what sleep in that bed not after seeing you and marina i get nightmares night after night i couldnt sleep there i couldnt my voice was rising hysterically rory caught my arm stop it em youre behaving like a child let me go i screamed i hate you i hate you after that i said every terrible thing i could think of and then started hysterically beating my fists against his chest finally he was reduced to slapping me across the face and i collapsed sobbing on the divan chapter twentysix i awoke next morning with an awful head i lay for a moment with my eyes closed slowly painfully i pieced together the happenings of the night before i looked around me wincing i was in the studio then suddenly i remembered rory had hit me the louse i muttered getting unsteadily to my feet in the mirror above the fire i examined my face not a bruise in sight how infuriating my eyes lit on rorys oil paints on a nearby table why shouldnt i paint in a black eye myself soon i was busy slapping on blue and crimson paint now a touch of yellow rory wasnt the only artist round here within five minutes i looked exactly like henry cooper after a few brisk rounds with cassius clay hearing a step outside i hurriedly jumped into bed rory came in carrying a glass of orange juice awake are you he said how are you feeling not very good i quavered dont deserve to after all that liquor you shipped then he caught sight of the bruise heavens where did that come from i think you must have hit me i said in a martyred voice i dont remember much about it it must have been quite a blow but i cant really believe you would have thumped me on my first night home me being so weak and all perhaps i bumped into a door rory looked as discomfited as ive ever seen him you were hysterical he said it was the only way to shut you up im sorry em does it hurt agony i said closing my eyes a flood of vindictiveness warmed my blood lets have a look he said dont come near me i hissed he put a hand under my chin and forced my face up poor em he said shaking his head what a brute i am you should be more careful in future i said i will i will he said getting to his feet he looked the picture of contrition and next time dont add so much ochre bruises dont usually go yellow till the second day i opened my mouth shut it again and started to giggle i giggled till the tears and the bruise ran down my cheeks until rory started laughing too after that i slept for most of the day when i woke up rory was painting and it was dark outside what time is it about six six oclock suddenly i wondered what had happened to finn did anyone ring i asked rory had his back to me there was a pause then he said nastily your boyfriend did telephone about half an hour ago i told him you were asleep im just going down to the village for some cigarettes he added dont start getting out of bed or making a bolt for it id track you down in no time and if you put me to the bother you wouldnt find me in a very nice mood chapter twentyseven as soon as hed gone i leapt out of bed and rang the hospital finn sounded relieved to hear me but somehow detached are you ok darling im fine i lied rory said you were asleep i was but oh finn hes as touchy as gunpowder i do need you cant you come over later i cant lovie some of those poor sods from the petrol tanker are in pretty bad shape oh god why did finn always make me feel slightly ignoble what a horrible selfcentred little bitch i am id forgotten all about them i hadnt forgotten about you said finn then someone said something in the background look darling ive got to go ill try and come and see you tomorrow the receiver clicked at that moment rory walked through the front door and stood in the doorway looking murderous have you gone quite mad he said softly standing in a howling draught when youre supposed to be in bed who were you talking to coco i was just letting her know im home she happens to be in london said rory acidly he walked towards me put his hands on my shoulders and gazed down at me for a minute the fury seemed to die out of his eyes look he said you think youre hung up on finn but he isnt the answer for you hes married to his work always has been hes a man with no nonsense about him and for a minute his face softened and youre a chick with an awful lot of nonsense about you em now go and get into bed and ill bring you something to eat i went back to bed and thought about finn but at the back of my mind like an insistent tune the thought kept repeating itself if finn had really loved me hed never have let me leave the hospital hed have whisked me back to his flat rory didnt love me at all he loved marina but even so hed been utterly singleminded about getting me home and keeping me there i felt very confused and uncertain of my feelings i wanted my mother next morning the telephone rang that was your doctor friend said rory when hed put the receiver down hes coming round to see you in half an hour he went back to his easel rummaging noisily about for a tube of burnt sienna that hed mislaid finally he gave up looking and poured himself a drink and started painting i was dying to go and tart up for finn surreptitiously i levered myself out of bed where are you going said rory without turning round to the loo i said again said rory youve just been ive got a bit of an upset stomach i said sliding towards the door i should have thought it was hardly necessary then to take your bag with you said rory oh i said blushing and putting my bag on the table in the bathroom there was nothing to do my face with i washed and took the shine off my nose with some of rorys talcum powder and tidied my hair with walter scotts brush i got back into bed rory was still painting ferociously very cautiously i eased my bag off the table and just as cautiously opened it of course my bottle of arpège was at the bottom id scrabbled my way down there managed to unscrew the top and was just about to empty some over my wrists when rory turned round and my bag plus all its contents and the unstoppered scent bottle fell with an appalling crash to the floor rory was not amused we were in the middle of a fulldress row when finn rang the doorbell rory went to let him in i shoved the bag and all its contents under the bed the whole room stank of scent like a brothel finn came in looking bootfaced but he smiled when he saw me rory went and stood with his back to the fire his eyes moving from finn to me all right rory i wont be long said finn dismissively and picked up my wrist ill stay if you dont mind said rory well i do i snapped i feel like a biology lesson surrounded by medical students with you both in here ill turn my back if you like said rory but keep your thieving hands off her doctor and he gazed out of the window whistling mozart how are you feeling said finn gently are you eating all right like a horse said rory i am not i snapped i grabbed finns hand no need to feel finns pulse emily said rory oh shut up i said finn was a bit like a dignified carthorse with a couple of mongrels rowing between his legs its not fair i said to rory afterwards look at the way you and marina carry on were not talking about me and marina said rory his eyes glittering with strain and exasperation walter scott was noisily eating a coathanger in the corner walter thinks your behaviour is appalling i said and he knows all about dogs in the manger chapter twentyeight a week went by i corrected the proofs of the catalogue for rorys exhibition he was painting frantically wild swirling selfabsorbed canvases of savage intensity babies with no arms or legs feeling their way into life the agonized features of women giving birth they were ghastly hideous paintings but of staggering power for the first time it occurred to me that rory might have minded my losing the baby he was like a minefield one would inadvertently tread on him and hed explode and smoulder for hours he was always worse after the times finn came to see me each time i found finn increasingly more remote i couldnt even talk to him because rory stayed in the room all the time scowling it was horribly embarrassing then one night i woke up to find rory standing by the bed the fire was dying in the grate outside the window the sea gleamed like a python wwhats the matter i said nervously ive finished the last painting i sat up sleepily how clever you are have you been working all night he nodded there were great black smudges under his eyes you must be exhausted a bit i thought we ought to celebrate he poured champagne into two glasses what time is it i said about fivethirty i took a gulp of champagne it was icy cold and utterly delicious we ought to be sitting on a bench in a rose garden after a common ball i said with a giggle you in an evening shirt all covered in my lipstick and me in a brastrap dinner frock and a string of pearls he laughed and sat down on the bed suddenly i was as jumpy as a cat in his presence it was as if i were a virgin and he and i had never been to bed together he leaned forward and brushed a strand of hair back from my forehead and it happened shocks rockets warning bells the lot and i knew blindly that the old magic was working and i was utterly hooked on him again emily the pushover lying in the gutter with a lion standing over her rory however seemed unaware of the chemical change that had taken place in me oughtnt you to get some sleep i said ive got to pack up the canvases he said busters taking them down to london in his plane then he said not looking at me hes giving me a lift to edinburgh panic swept over me it was thursday marinas singing lesson day oh god oh god rory was obviously going to meet her what are you going to edinburgh for i said in a frozen voice to see an american about an exhibition in new york and a couple of press boys want to talk to me about the london exhibition when are you coming back i said tonight my mothers giving a party for my aunt shes arriving from paris this evening youre invited i think you should come theyre pretty amazing my aunt and my mother when they get together itd do you good to get out i lay back in bed trying to stop myself crying rory bent over and kissed me on the forehead try and get some more sleep he said chapter twentynine mrs mackie our daily woman came to look after me while he was away her gossiping nearly drove me insane i washed my hair and shut myself away in the studio to get away from her suddenly there was a knock on the door someone to see you said mrs mackie and marina walked in i felt weak with relief as though a great thorn had been pulled out of my side so rory hadnt gone to edinburgh to see her i wanted to fling my arms round her neck hello i said grinning from ear to ear she seemed shattered by the warmth of my reception are you going to cocos party tonight hamish wants to but im not sure if i can face it oh i am i said suddenly feeling i wanted to sing from the rooftops it should be a giggle if cocos sisters anything like her marina looked terrible her eyes were hidden behind huge amber sunglasses her face chalky she looked like someone who was shaking off gastric flu are you all right i said suddenly feeling sorry for her not very she said im suffering from a broken heart can i have a drink i gave her a huge slug of rorys whisky she looked at the golden liquid for a minute then said has rory said anything about me i shook my head oh god she put her head in her hands ive spent days and days waiting for the master to ring but the master did not ring he obviously doesnt wish to avail himself of the service are you still well crazy about him of course i am she screamed her eyes suddenly wild and hes crazy about me nothing will ever cure that i didnt flinch i was making great strides in selfcontrol these days hes crazy about me but he feels guilty about you losing the baby he thinks youve had a lousy deal so hes got to grit his teeth and try and make a go of it charming i said combing and combing my wet hair she took off her dark glasses her eyes were suddenly alight with malevolence look you dont love rory a millionth as much as i do you wouldnt be playing around with finn if you did finns crazy about you and hes a much better proposition than rory is hes straight and utterly dependable youre not tricky enough for rory he needs someone who can play him at his own game you drive him round the bend its absolutely mutual i said acidly all youve got to do is go to finn said marina why doesnt he come and take me away i said hes got a car because hes had a rough time hes had one broken marriage and when he wanted you to leave rory before you wouldnt go he wants you to come of your own free will how idealistic i said sulkily for someone who throws his weight around as much as finn does hes very diffident when it comes to sex he doesnt want to go through hell again hes got the hospital to consider and if you dont hurry dr barrett will snap him up anyway cant you realize that if rory wasnt my brother hed drop you like a hot coal suddenly her face crumpled and she burst into tears i cant stand hamish any more she sobbed you dont know what its like waking up to that awful old face on the pillow every morning i turned away with a sense of utter weariness i felt as though id been struggling for hours up a hill and just as i reached the top my hold had given way and i was pitching headlong into darkness after shed gone i told mrs mackie to go home i couldnt stand her chatter any more half an hour later finns car drew up outside i watched him get out and lock it what the hell did he have to lock it for round here i thought irritably there was noone to pinch any dangerous drugs except a few sheep go away i said miserably to finn refusing to open the door five minutes he said what for i said i dont like unfinished business is there unfinished business come on stop messing about let me in oh all right i said sulkily opening the door he followed me into the drawingroom do you want a drink i said no i want you he ran his hands through his hair i havent been able to get you on your own since rory took over he looked almost as bad as marina deep lines were entrenched around his mouth and his eyes he seemed to have aged ten years in as many days you havent tried very hard i said ive been run off my feet two men from the petrol ship died last night another early this morning oh im so sorry i said horrified did they suffer a lot yep said finn it hasnt been very pleasant at the hospital in fact its been hell did you get any extra help from the mainland i said ive got another doctor arriving this evening at least itll give jackie a break shes been marvellous im sure she has i said oh dear shes far more suitable for you than i am maybe she is said finn but it happens to be you that i love you certainly need more looking after than she does what the hell are you wandering about with bare feet and wet hair for he picked up a towel come on ill dry it for you no itll go all fluffy finn took no notice christ he rubbed hard i wont have any scalp left i grumbled after that the inevitable happened and i ended up in his arms and i must confess that i did like kissing him very much it was one of the great alltime pleasures like smoked salmon and brahms second piano concerto then i started getting nervous that rory might walk in so i wriggled out of his grasp who told you rory was away i said marina did she has been busy i said she was here earlier telling me how much she and rory still love each other and how noble rory had been coming back to me rory said finn kicking a log on the fire has never done anything noble in his life this little display of territorial imperative is sheer bloodymindedness because he doesnt want me to get you its only me hes jealous about did he ever give a damn when calen macdonald made a pass at you no i said plunging back into the depths of gloom why dont you leave him you know how much i want you to the downward path is easy i said but theres no turning back when your dear scheming sister was telling me how mad rory is about her it hurt me so much i couldnt speak but when she started dropping dark hints about you and doctor barrett it irritated me but it didnt tear me in pieces at all qed i love rory not you i suddenly felt a great sense of loss im wildly attracted to you physically i said i expect i always will be but im stuck with loving rory even if he doesnt love you i nodded i played my last card the only way it might work is if we went away together away from irasa and rory and marina and all those associations but that would mean your leaving the hospital darling i cant abandon it at this stage said finn you know i cant i could see the pain starting in his eyes i went over and put my arms round his neck breathing in his strong male solidarity oh finn i whispered im so sorry its not you chapter thirty all in all i didnt feel in a very festive state for cocos party numb misery would have just about summed it up rory had noticed my red eyes when he got home and demanded to know what was the matter id refused to tell him and hed got extremely bad tempered i was wearing a very sexy red dress but in my current condition i felt about as sexy as a pillarbox at least it matches your eyes said rory cocos party was the usual noisy success but everyone seemed even more anxious to get drunk than usual my sister arrives later coco told me she says she is bringing me a surprise i think i am too old to be surprised by anything but perhaps it will be something that amuses buster marina was wearing a beautiful white dress everything about her shimmered and glimmered softly as though the material had been woven of candle beams but inside it she looked like a stricken masquerader hamish was there too looking dreadfully old and ill i hadnt seen him since the night he told me rory and marina were brother and sister rory was drinking steadily and talking to buster about fishing buster was in a very good temper having landed a huge salmon that afternoon i was being the death and soul of the party about ten oclock after supper a crowd of us were in a little room off the hall playing roulette rory was winning hamish was losing heavily buster was still talking about his salmon amazing fish the salmon he said placing four chips on rouge they live for years in salt water and then always come back to the same freshwater spot to breed not surprising said marina and she looked at rory and laughed as youd know buster if youd ever suffered the agony of making love in salt water i really thought the bugger had got away said buster not listening at all not surprising said rory if he saw you hauling on the other end of the line then just as there was a pause in play and buster was raking in counters hamish looked at rory i hope youve been keeping a pretty close guard on your wife lately he said rory stopped in the middle of lighting a cigarette shut up hamish i snapped hush darling rory put his hand on my arm hamish is about to explain himself all im saying said hamish flashing his false teeth evilly is that patients often fall in love with their doctors and its nice to know im not the only cuckold in irasa his words brought an uneasy silence belt up hamish said buster you dont know what youre saying oh i do buster old chap all im saying to rory is that next time he goes to edinburgh and my wife disappears to join him he should realize that while hes away pretty mrs balniel will be amusing herself with dr maclean thats not true i squeaked are you going to take that back said rory through clenched teeth no dear boy im not your wife is as big a whore he got no further rory had chucked his drink into hamishs face and thats a waste of good whisky he said hamish whisky dripping from his face made a lunge at rory buster pulled him off the doorbell rang noisily bringing us back to our senses buster rory shrieked coco from the hall i think it must be marcelle excuse me said buster and hurried out hamish wiped the whisky off his face i dared not look at rory or marina the next minute coco swept into the room with her sister marcelle we all tried to act normally and everyone kissed everyone on both cheeks marcelle was not as pretty as coco younger and brassier but pretty high voltage all the same she said with a touch of malice ive brought you your surprise chérie hes putting the car away and feeling a little shy too why dont you go and get him buster said coco buster trotted out obediently who can it be said coco excitedly i have so many skeletons in the wardrobe id had my share of surprises too i was still shaking from hamishs accusations i sat down on the sofa the next moment buster came through the door for once hed lost his superb indolence he looked shattered he went up to coco darling he whispered this is going to be something of a shock i hope its a nice one said coco patting her curls and arranging her breasts in the lowcut black dress someone else stood behind buster in the door a tall thin figure alerted by everyones faces buster swung round for christs sake he snapped i told you to wait i watched fascinated as the man came through the door he had unruly black hair streaked with grey high cheek bones formidable contemptuous black eyes above grey pouches and a haughty thinlipped mouth he was dressed theatrically in a black cloak with a gold earring hanging from one ear he looked around slowly taking everyone in he must have been at least fifty but he was still sensationally attractive and i knew positively that id met him somewhere before there was a pause then coco turned as white as a sheet alexei she said in a frozen tone then she gave a strange little laugh that was almost a sob and running towards him flung her arms round his neck the odd thing was the silence everyone in the room looked stunned youre still very beautiful coco alexei said softly how did i ever let you go coco seemed to recover herself i was not rich enough for you she said unromantically you havent been properly introduced to my husband have you alexei said coco alexei was a great boyfriend of mine before i married hector she said so it seems said buster i seem to have stumbled on a little family gathering said the stranger with amusement oh where had i seen that arrogant equivocal smile before you must also meet my son rory said coco rory got to his feet very carefully they looked each other up and down i looked from rory to the stranger the resemblance was unmistakable did you say alexei was a boyfriend of yours before you married my father or afterwards rory said softly coco shrugged her shoulders well a bit of both darling alexei turned to rory your mother and i were very much in love but alas we neither of us had any money so she married hector and i alas martyred in the arms of a fat american heiress said coco then rory started to laugh he got a drink and raised it to hectors portrait kilted and bristling over the fire so the old bastard wasnt my father after all he said and turning to alexei i do hope you dont expect me to call you daddy coco smiled you do not mind chérie rory shook his head as long as his references are all right alexei grinned in genuine amusement oh theyre extremely good my dear im russian white of course and can trace my ancestry back to centuries before peter the great his glance wandered in my direction he had exactly the same way of stripping off all ones clothes that rory had this is rorys wife said coco alexei sighed and bowed over my hand what a pity he said i suppose that puts her out of bounds i wouldnt let that worry you i said in a shaking voice incest has never deterred anyone in this house ill never understand any of them i thought hopelessly only marina was beginning to generate a fitting amount of emotion the next moment she had rushed up to rory and flung her arms round his neck dont you see darling she cried wildly that lets you and me off the hook the room swam before me chapter thirtyone the next moment i blacked out i remember coming to and seeing a sea of faces and hearing rory shouting at everyone to get out of the way and give me some air she looks terrible said coco are you all right mon ange she got up too soon said buster she ought to see someone said coco i can see at least ten people already i joked feebly shall i call finn said marina no snapped rory thats the last thing she needs and picking me up he carried me upstairs youll rupture yourself i grumbled as he stumbled on the top step thank god id lost some weight in hospital rory kicked the door of the best guest room open a fire was blazing in the grate the purpleflowered sheets of the bed were turned down the scent of freesias filled the room but its all ready for marcelle i said feebly she can sleep somewhere else said rory depositing me on the bed he started to undo the zip of my dress ill do it i stammered leaping away he looked at me frowning do you hate me so much you cant even bear me to touch you no i mean what do you mean the tension was unbearable i cant explain he shrugged his shoulders all right if thats the way you want it ill get you a couple of my mothers sleeping pills i sat down on the bed burying my face in my hands i felt sick how could i explain to him that i couldnt bear him to touch me because if he did id only collapse gibbering with lust telling him i couldnt live without him that i loved him all the things he hated cocos sleeping pills must have been very strong it was midday when i woke up the sun was streaming through the curtains everything was quiet except for a persistent thrush and the occasional click of buster hitting a captive golfball in the garden the fire had been relit in the grate the scent of freesias was stronger than ever walter scott lay sprawled across my feet it was such a pretty room for a moment i wallowed in the voluptuous euphoria created by the sleeping pills then bit by bit the events of the last night came filtering back cocos sister arriving and then that glorious russian turning out to be rorys father and rory not being marinas brother after all and there being nothing now to stop them getting married and having hordes of ravishing blackeyed redhaired children or ravishing blueeyed blackhaired children oh god god god i writhed on the pillow a bad business paid only with agony what the hell was i to do next the last month had been difficult certainly rory and i living together with no sex but at least wed had a few laughs and i felt somehow that even if he didnt love me in the whitehot way he loved marina he was making very real efforts to make a go of it then marinas words of yesterday came back to me if he werent my brother hed drop you like a hot coal i lay feeling suicidal for a bit then got up and drew back the curtains it was a marvellous day the sea sparkling the larches waving their pale green branches against an angelically blue sky i felt the sun warming my hair and smoothing away the marks of the sheets on my skin buster hearing the curtains draw looked up i moved out of range and examined my body in the mirror the only advantage about being miserable is you do lose weight for a minute i forgot my gloom and admired my flat stomach and my ribs then i sucked in my cheeks and putting on a haughty models face stood up on my toes very nice said a voice at the door youll make the gatefold of playboy yet it was rory i gave a squeak of embarrassment and grabbed a towel to cover myself dont he said shutting the door he looked extremely pleased with himself i wondered with a flash of despair if hed spent the night celebrating with marina you look better he said coming towards me i backed away oh for gods sake em stop behaving like a frightened horse he was wearing a dark blue sweater and an old pair of paintstained jeans his hair was ruffled by the wind he looked so unspeakably handsome i felt my entrails go liquid i lowered my eyes in case he read the absolutely blatant desire there i wanted him so much i had to turn away and jump back into bed pulling the sheets up to my neck thats a good girl said rory it seems a pity to get up on such a lovely day where is everyone i asked wandering around the house in various stages of undress groaning about their hangovers he sat down on the bed and lit a cigarette do you still feel sick does the smoke worry you i shook my head in surprise fancy rory bothering to ask that how are you getting on adjusting to your new er father i baulked on the word rory grinned i quite like him but hes an old phoney hes already tried to borrow money off me but then my mother always did have frightful taste in men im very glad he didnt bring me up id have been cooling my heels in broadmoor by now is he as grand as he makes out i said i dont think so he looks degenerate enough but i dont believe those claims about tracing his ancestry back to peter the great it does appear in fact that ive been born on the wrong side of an awful lot of blankets do you mind having an illegitimate husband do you mind i said cagily not at all i never understood how hector could be related to me anyway his favourite painter was peter scott theres only one slight problem now to tax the ingenuity of the family solicitor have i any right any more to hectors money are you worried about it not particularly i quite like the thought of starving in a garret he shot me a glance under his eyelashes how about you i havent tried it i said carefully hows your mother taking it medium i think shes a bit put out buster and alexei have taken to each other like drakes to water great bounders think alike i suppose alexei like all foreigners has a great reverence for english upperclass institutions his ambition like busters is to murder as much wildlife as he can hes so heartbroken the grouse shooting season is over that buster has promised to take him pigeon shooting this afternoon are you going i said i might for a laugh so my mother is rather irritated about the whole thing shes not gaining an exlover shes losing a husband alexei is between marriages at the moment i think he and buster might do very well together but hes old enough to be busters father i said probably is if i know that lot said rory i burst out laughing rory took my hand you havent laughed much lately em i think we ought to have a talk i snatched my hand away people always say that i said in a trembling voice when theyre about to say something awful ive made you very unhappy since i married you havent i said rory im sorry you must have had a pretty bloody six months panic swept over me come on he said in an exaggeratedly gentle voice come here he held out his arms to me no i said desperately no no no i knew exactly what he was about to say that hed made me so unhappy i obviously didnt want to stay married to him any longer so why didnt we have an amicable divorce if he touched me i knew id cry is it that bad he said i nodded biting my lip i gather finn maclean was round to see you yesterday he said in a flat voice are you still hooked on him come on i want the truth i felt defeated my eyes filled with tears there was a knock on the door go away howled rory in walked finn my god exploded rory why the hell cant you ever leave us alone what do you mean by barging in here who the hell asked you ive come to have a look at emily said finn youve had a bloody sight too many looks at emily recently said rory she happens to be a patient of mine among other things said rory shes perfectly all right she looks it said finn he bent down to stroke walter scott who thumped his tail noisily on the floor and stop sucking up to my dog snarled rory oh please i said leave finn and me for a few minutes rory scowled at both of us all right he said going towards the door but if you put a finger wrong finn ill report you to the medical council and get you struck off the register and he slammed the door so hard all the windows rattled finn raised an eyebrow what was that little tantrum in aid of he was trying to give me the sack i said miserably and you interrupted him youve heard that his real fathers turned up finn nodded so theres nothing to stop rory and marina now its not going to be as easy as that theres hamish to be considered i doubt if hell give marina a divorce its funny i said feeling very ashamed of myself none of us ever thinks of hamish do we finn gave me some tranquillizers look he said im off to a conference in glasgow this afternoon id cancel it but ive got to speak im not too happy about the current situation marinas in a highly overwrought state so obviously is rory and im worried about hamish i want you to stay in bed today ill be staying at the kings hotel tonight dont hesitate to ring me if you need me heres the telephone number he dropped a kiss on the top of my head dont look so miserable little one things will sort themselves out knocking back tranquillizers like smarties i decided to disregard finns advice and get up when i finally made it downstairs i found a noisy and drunken lunch had just finished the debris of wine glasses napkins and cigar butts still lay on the diningroom table buster was bustling about organizing his pigeon shoot i went into the kitchen and opened a tin of pedigree chum for walter then wandered into the drawingroom where i found alexei well entrenched chewing on a large cigar drinking port and reading a book called the grouse in health and in disease ah my enchanting daughterinlaw he said getting to his feet and kissing my hand with a flourish oh god i hoped my fingers didnt smell of pedigree chum come and sit down he patted a rather small space on the sofa beside him and tell me about yourself predictably i couldnt think of anything to say but alexei had obviously had enough to drink for it not to matter a scrap coco tells me you lost a baby recently i am so sorry you must have been very disappointed you must have another one as soon as youre strong again you and rory would have beautiful children it was not a subject i cared to dwell on do you have lots of children yourself i said yes i think so several that i know about and several that i probably dont but none i think as talented as rory i have been looking at his paintings this morning i am proud of my new son he is a very goodlooking boy i think yes he is i said wistfully and not unlike me i think said alexei with satisfaction he got up i must go and change for the shooting but itll be dark in a couple of hours i said we wait till dusk and catch the pigeons as they come home to roost he said poor things i said wheres rory gone to fetch his gun hamish is coming too suddenly in spite of the centrally heated fug of the house i felt icy cold i didnt like the idea of that cast of characters going shooting alexei went up to change i turned on the television and watched a steeplechase it all looked so bright green and innocent one couldnt really believe those horses falling at the fences were really hurting themselves a few minutes later rory arrived with walter scott who told you to get up he asked angrily you look frightful i thought i might come and watch you all shooting i said absolutely not snapped rory youre supposed to rest according to your doctor go back upstairs at once at that moment buster walked in looking ludicrously like a french tart in rubber thigh boots and an extraordinary hat with a veil times getting on rory he said we ought to take up our positions at least an hour before dusk is he getting married to alexei already i said rory laughed its supposed to stop the pigeons seeing his face when they fly over a pity he doesnt wear it all the time come on he whistled to walter scott rory i said he turned in the doorway be careful i said dont worry he said its all gun and no fear i met coco coming down the stairs ullo bébé how are you i am fed up i ope the presence of alexei would make buster jealous and spend less time on his horrible bloody sports but it only makes im worse i like to have a good sleep in the afternoon but what is the point if there is noone to sleep with you so marcelle and i decided to go over to the mainland you will be all right mon ange of course i said i tried to sleep but i was in much too uptight a state i heard voices outside and crept to the window to see them go off poor hamish looked iller than ever alexei was laughing at some joke of busters walter scott who was thoroughly overexcited by the whole proceedings suddenly decided to mount hamishs red setter bitch hamish went mad and rushed over and started kicking walter in the ribs in a frenzy walter started howling and rory turned on hamish in fury i couldnt hear what he was saying but hamish went absolutely spare with rage i could see the white of his knuckles as his hands clenched on his gun then buster came over and said something and they all set off their boots ringing on the drive they crossed the burn and took the narrow winding path up to the pine woods i thought of the pigeons coming home after a long day to face the music tomorrow they would be strung up as corpses in the larder their destination pigeon pie i took more tranquillizers and tried to sleep but it was impossible i tried to read coco had left some magazines by the bed i read my horoscope which was lousy rorys horoscope said he was going to have a good week for romance blast him but should be careful of unforeseen danger towards the weekend i should never have let him go shooting an explosion of guns in the distance made me jump nervously then i heard a crunch of wheels on the gravel and looked out of the window again it was marina miss machiavelli herself she parked her blue car in front of the house and switched off the engine then combed her hair powdered her nose and put on more scent the conniving bitch god how i hated her she got out of the car fragile in a huge sheepskin coat and brown boots her red hair streaming in the breeze and set off down the track the guns had taken no wonder rory had been so insistent about my staying in bed and keeping out of his way drawn by some terrible fascination to see what they were getting up to i got up put on an old sheepskin coat of cocos and set off after her the guns popped in the distance like some faroff firework party it was getting dark the fir trees beetled darkly a rabbit scuttled over the dead leaves frightening the life out of me the sweat was rising on my forehead my breath coming in great gasps i ran on ducking to avoid overhanging branches there was the adders please keep out sign buster had put up to frighten off tourists i could hear voices now the colour was going out of the woods in the distance the sea was darkening to gun metal suddenly i rounded a corner and to my relief saw busters gamekeeper then marinas red hair and the guns strung out in a ring buster still wearing that ludicrous veil alexei next to him then rory then hamish with marina standing between them but slightly behind she was lighting one cigarette from another i hoped they wouldnt see me then i stepped on a twig and she and rory looked round he looked absolutely furious buster smiled at me waving and indicating to me to stay quiet walter scott sat beside rory quivering with excitement trying to look grown up marina tiptoed back and stood beside me on closer inspection she didnt look so hot her skin pale and mottled her eyes sunken and bloodshot even so there was plenty of the old dash about her i thought you were at deaths door she said its been quite exciting alexei has already tried to shoot a couple of sheep and nearly killed hamish i wish hed tried harder what are they waiting for i asked the pigeons she said theyre late back i had the most cataclysmic row with hamish last night she said lowering her voice i ended up throwing most of the silver at him we started at four oclock in the morning and went on till just before he came out this is halftime i ought to be sucking oranges and thinking what to do in the second half he said i behaved atrociously last night she went on her eyes glittering wildly and that he absolutely refuses to divorce me has rory spoken to you she said suddenly tense he tried to this morning i hissed but your dear brother walked in in the middle the trouble is whispered marina that rory feels frightfully guilty about you because everythings worked out for him now he can marry me if you went off with finn it would make things much easier for everyone i dont want to go off with finn i said my voice rising what the hell do you think youre doing riding roughshod over everyones lives dont you ever think that hamish and i might have feelings marina turned her great headlamp eyes on me id never hang around being a bore to a man who couldnt stand me ive got too much pride you obviously havent shut up you two said buster we were silent but the whole forest must have heard my heart thudding then suddenly the pigeons came sailing over the view over the pine tops and with a deafening crash the guns went off it was like being in the middle of a thunderstorm except that the sky was raining pigeons the deafening fusillade lasted about three minutes some of the birds escaped unscathed others came down directly the guns charged about looking for booty dogs circled cursed by their masters alexei stood proudly with two birds in each hand there were congratulations and verdicts walter scott rushed grinning up to me his mouth full of feathers must be some more in here said buster disappearing into the undergrowth a minute later his great red face appeared and he said in a low voice rory come here a minute rory followed by walter scott went into the undergrowth there was a pause then rory came out his face ashen in the half light shaking like a leaf whats the matter darling marina ran forward whats happened its hamish said rory theres been an accident im afraid hes blown his brains out his face suddenly worked like a small boy about to cry dont look marina its horrible marina gave a scream and rushed into the wood after buster rory disappeared to the right next moment i heard the sound of retching marina emerged a minute later her eyes mad with hysteria there you see she screamed at me rory killed him he killed him for me because he thought hamish wasnt going to let me go now who do you think rory loves dont be bloody silly marina said buster coming out of the copse of course rory didnt kill him poor old boy obviously did himself in rory having regained his composure had returned i didnt marina he said as she ran forward and collapsed in his arms i swear i didnt well its my fault then she sobbed i told hamish to do it i told him how much i loathed and hated him how much he disgusted me i goaded him into it oh rory rory ill never forgive myself i turned away i couldnt bear the infinitely tender way he was holding her in his arms stroking her hair and telling her everything would be all right suddenly there was an unearthly wailing everyone jumped nervously then we realized it was hamishs red setter howling with misery she was the only one said rory who gave a damn for the poor old bugger chapter thirtytwo i cant really remember much of getting back rory took me home he was in a terrible state shaking like a leaf he came in and poured a stiff whisky and downed it in one gulp look i must go to her i nodded mechanically yes of course you must im frightened this will unhinge her i feel sort of responsible do you understand yes i do do you want to come too i looked at him for the last time taking in the brown fur rug on the sofa the yellow cushions the gold of his corduroy jacket his dark hair and deathly pale face the smell of turpentine the utter despair in my heart i shook my head id rather stay here i wont be long he said and was gone so hamish had loved marina after all what was it that marina had said that afternoon that shed never hang around being a bore to a man who couldnt stand her so the game had ended that never should have begun im not a noble character but i know when im licked for the second time in two months i packed my suitcase i had no thought of going to finn finn fancied me but he didnt really love me not as rory understood love and now i couldnt have rory i didnt want second best i left a note darling hamish has set you and marina free now im going to do the same please be happy and dont try and find me emily mist swathed the irasa hills the lochs lay about them like steel and silver medallions in the moonlight a small chill wind whispered among the heather i walked the narrow track that twisted down the hill to the ferry i caught the last boat of the day there was scarcely anyone on it i stood on deck and watched the castle and everything i loved in the world getting dimmer and dimmer until they vanished in a mist of tears i shall never remember how i got through the next ten days i went to ground in a shabby london hotel bedroom i couldnt eat i couldnt sleep i just lay dryeyed on my bed like a wounded animal shocked by incredulous grief and horror i toyed with the idea of going to see my parents or ringing up nina but i couldnt bear the expressions of sympathy then the whispering and later the i told you sos and we always knew he was a bad lot and much later the pull yourself togethers sooner or later i knew i would have to face up to life but i hadnt got the courage to get in touch with them yet nor could i face the bitter disappointment i would feel if rory hadnt rung them and tried to contact me but why should he contact me he must be blissfully happy now with marina the idea of them together rose black and churning sometimes i thought i was going mad even my unconscious played tricks on me every night i dreamed of rory and woke up in tears in the street i saw lean dark tall men and heart thumping would charge forward shrinking away in horror when i realized it wasnt him i hoped i would find it easier as the days went by but it got much worse what i hadnt anticipated was going slap into the infinitely bosky lushness of a late london spring everything was far further on than it was in scotland outside my bedroom window the new limegreen leaves of the plane trees swung like little cherubs wings icecream pink cherry trees were dropping their blossom on the long grass huge velvety purple irises and bluebells filled the chelsea gardens everywhere too there was an atmosphere of sexiness of sap rising of pretty girls walking the streets in their new summer dresses of men whistling at them of lovers entwined in the park everything geared to ram home my loss to me hes gone hes gone and when thou knowest this thou knowest how dry a cinder this world is the day of the opening of rorys exhibition came and went with heroic selfcontrol i stuck to the hotel and didnt hang around in the coffee bar opposite in the hope of getting a glimpse of him i couldnt face the anguish of seeing him with marina but next morning i dragged myself up and went out and bought the papers and crept back to the hotel to read them the reviews were very mixed some of the critics loathed the paintings some adored them but everyone agreed that a dazzling new talent had arrived there were also several pictures of rory looking sulky and arrogant and impossibly handsome the nureyev of the art world the gossip columns called him i cried half the morning trying to decide what to do then the manager presented me with my weekly bill and i realized i could only just pay it next week i should have to get a job i had a bath and washed my hair i looked frightful like one of those women that wait for the bodies at the pit head even makeup didnt help much i cant even make any money as a tart now i said dismally id have to pay them when i got to bond street i felt giddy it struck me i hadnt eaten for days i went into a coffee bar and ordered an omelette but when it arrived i took one bite and thought i was going to throw up chucking down a pound i fled into the street four doors down i went up the steps to the agency that used to find me work in the old days how well i remembered that greycarpeted greywalled pottedplant world that i hoped id abandoned for ever i started to sweat and tremble audrey kennaway the principal agreed to see me she greeted me in an immaculate utterly awful primrose yellow dress and jacket her heavily madeup eyes swept over me well emily she said in cooing tones its nice to see you how are you enjoying your new jetset life are you on your way to newmarket or the cannes film festival actually neither im looking for a job i blurted out a job she raised eyebrows plucked to the edge of extinction surely not but i thought your handsome husband was doing so well he had such a success in the papers this morning her rednailed fingers drummed on the table thats all over i muttered it didnt work out im sorry she said im not surprised i could see her thinking shes let herself go so much her manner had become distinctly chillier theres not a lot of work about at the moment people are laying off staff everywhere she went on oh dear i said feebly in my day they were always laying on them audrey kennaway smiled coolly youll have to smarten yourself up a bit she said i know i know i said i havent been very well i used to type a bit do you remember i went on and when i was thin you sometimes got me television commercials or a bit of modelling im much thinner than that now i dont think i could find you anything in that field at the moment lets see if theres any filing clerk work her long red talons started moving through the cards in a box on her desk i felt great tears filling my eyes i struggled to control myself for a minute then leapt to my feet im sorry i said i couldnt do a filing job i cant even file my nails without setting my teeth on edge its a mistake for me to have come here youre quite right i couldnt hold a job down at the moment i cant hold down anything bursting into tears i fled out of the office down the stairs into the sunshine two streets away was rorys gallery gradually as though pulled by some invisible hand i was drawn towards it i went into a chemists to buy some dark glasses with my last pound they werent much help they hid my red eyes but the tears kept trickling underneath slowly i edged down grafton street no here it was my knees were knocking together my throat dry there was one of rorys paintings of the irasa coast in the window two fat women were looking at it i dont go for this modern stuff said one i entered the gallery my heart pounding then with a thud of disappointment i realized rory wasnt there i looked around the paintings looked superb and so many already had red sold stickers on them by the desk an american was writing out a cheque to a chinless wonder i wandered round the room proud yet bitterly resentful that people should be able to buy something that was so much a part of rory the chinless wonder having ditched the american wandered over can i help you he said i was just looking round i said you seem to have sold a lot we did awfully well yesterday and we sold four more this morning not i may add he whispered darkly through any assistance on the artists part what do you mean i said startled the chinless wonder smoothed his pale gold hair well hes talented i admit but quite frankly hes an ugly customer doesnt give a damn about the show being a success he put stickers on two more paintings always thought the fellow was pretty coldblooded he went on didnt seem to care about anything but hes certainly cut up at the moment apparently his wifes left him cant say i blame her only been married six months hes absolutely devastated i mean he was a dead loss at the private view on thursday id lined up a host of press boys to meet him and he wouldnt speak to any of them just hung around the door hoping she might turn up i leant against the wall for support ddid you say his wife has just left him i said slowly are you sure its his wife hes cut up about certain said the chinless wonder ill show you a picture of her we moved into a second room where i steeled myself to confront one of rorys beautiful voluptuous nude paintings of marina there she is he said pointing to a small oil opposite the window i felt my knees go weak my throat dry because it was a painting of me in jeans and an old sweater looking incredibly sad i never knew that rory had painted it tears stung my eyelids are you sure thats the one i whispered thats her said the chinless wonder i mean its a great painting but shes not a patch on that gorgeous redhead he was always painting in the nude still i suppose theres no accounting for tastes i say are you feeling all right would you like to sit down then he looked at the painting and at me i say he said absolutely appalled how frightfully rude of me that painting its you isnt it i really didnt mean to be rude you havent been i said half laughing half crying its the nicest nicest thing anyones ever said to me in my life do you possibly know where hes staying chapter thirtythree i ran towards the tube station rocked by conflicting emotions it was the rush hour as i battled with the crowds i tried to calm the turmoil raging inside me it couldnt be true it couldnt be true then suddenly as i reached the bottom of the steps i was absolutely knocked sideways by an ecstatic whining black heap leaping up and licking my face its tail going in a frenzy walter i sobbed flinging my arms round his neck oh walter wheres your master i looked up and there was rory come here you bloody dog he was shouting from the other side of the crowd his slit eyes were restless ranging from one person to another sliding towards me then as if drawn by the violence of my longing they fastened on me and i saw him start in recognition i tried to call his name but the words were strangled in my throat emily he yelled the next moment he was fighting his way through the crowd oh emily emily darling he said dont ever run away again and pinning me against the wall hunching his shoulders against the pressure of the crowd he began to kiss me greedily angrily as tears of love and happiness streaked my face after a few minutes i drew away gasping for breath we cant stay here said rory and dragged me in my tearful blindness muttering incoherently out into the street and across the road to his hotel where he kissed me all the way up in the lift utterly oblivious of the lift man walter scott jumped about trying to lick my hands what the bloody hell said rory as he slammed the bedroom door behind us do you mean by running away like that that sounded more like the old rory ive had the most frightful ten days of my life and poor walter he went on how do you think hes enjoyed being the victim of a broken home i didnt think you loved me i said collapsing on to the bed jesus said rory i tried to tell you enough times didnt i wear myself out trying to fend off that smug bastard finn maclean i nearly put a bullet through him that night i found him kissing you in the corridor at the hospital and ive been driven absolutely insane with jealousy these last few weeks having him rolling up to the house all hours of the day acting as though he owned you i played it as cool as i could when you came back from hospital i didnt want to rush things but whenever i tried to talk things over and explain how i felt you leapt away from me like a frightened horse i thought you were trying to tell me you couldnt live without marina that you were only staying with me because you felt guilty christ no thats all over it was over that night you caught us in bed together and threw me out we went to edinburgh but it was hell actually living with her she got on my nerves so much i wanted to wring her neck yacking away all the time and never letting me think all i could think of actually was you and what a sod id been to you then my prodigal father turned up and i discovered i wasnt even related to marina and there was no reason why i shouldnt marry her particularly now poor old hamish has kicked the bucket i realized the only person in the world i wanted to be married to was you but i said blushing crimson with pleasure that day you all went shooting marina said youd been trying to talk to me that morning to ask me for a divorce the truth was never one of marinas strong points said rory she knew i was going to talk to you we sat up half the night discussing the situation after youd gone to bed she said you were still crazy about finn and that i should let you go i said sod that for a lark he came and sat on the bed and pulled me into his arms youre not still keen on him are you hes so pompous and selfrighteous and such a bore i was scared stiff when you pushed off that youd gone to him i borrowed busters plane that night and landed it in a park in glasgow theres been a bit of a row about that and routed him out of his hotel bed he was pretty angry i bet he was i said in awe did you really i really did said rory and i wonder just how much longer i am going to have to go on trying to convince you that i love you i shouldnt think its ever happened before in irasa someone falling helplessly ludicrously in love with their own wife after theyve married them i felt myself blushing even more and gazed down at my hands for gods sake em darling look at me i picked up his hand and pressed it to my cheek ive been so unhappy i said then in the gallery i saw the painting you did of me they said it was the only one you wouldnt sell i couldnt bloody well find you said rory ive been telephoning your mother and nina for news every five minutes since you left oh my god i said i didnt ring them in case you hadnt i looked up and he was smiling at me and with a jolt i realized it was the first time hed smiled without mockery and closeup how wan and heavyeyed he looked as though he hadnt slept for weeks you have missed me i said in amazement i really do believe you love me after all and now ill prove it to you said rory triumphantly starting to slide down the zip of my dress im terribly out of practice i muttered suddenly shy i havent done it for ages dont worry its like riding a bicycle or swimming you never really lose the art get off walter he said pushing a protesting walter scott on to the floor this is one party youre not invited to as his lips touched mine we both began to tremble a feeling of reckless happiness overwhelmed me i felt his heart beating against mine and his kisses becoming more and more fierce and the sounds of the traffic outside grew dim as they gave way to the pounding in my ears by the time wed finished it was dark outside god that was lovely i sighed we should do it more often we will said rory all day and all night for ever darling he said looking suddenly worried do you think youll be able to put up with my absolutely bloody nature for the next sixty years i might i said if you compensate from time to time with performances like the one ive just experienced rory laughed softly and rubbed the back of my neck he lit a cigarette and lay down in the bed pulling me into the crook of his arm rory i said a few minutes later i know its a terrible thing to say at a time like this but im starving so am i he said shall we go out no i might want you between courses which wouldnt do in a restaurant ill send down for something later as he was opening a bottle of champagne he said darling do you mind awfully if we dont live in irasa any more do i mind i said incredulously of course i dont im bored with painting sheep and rocks he said i want to paint you in the sun and give you half a dozen babies to look after to stop you having thoughts about pushing off and leaving me any more but you love irasa its lost its charms said rory i dont want you within a million miles of finn maclean for a start and marinas a bloody troublemaker and ive had enough of my mother and buster for a few years and lastly my new father is still there house guestating what does he find to do all day i said is he still in love with buster yes theyre both addicted to whisky and highlycoloured reminiscences but alexei now seems to have other fish to fry in the old days when marina wanted to bug me she always used to say what she wanted was an older man well hamish was a bit too old but alexei looks a bit like me and when i left he was making a marvellous job comforting her in her bereavement my goodness i said staggered how extraordinary you dont mean well not yet marina fancies herself in black far too much to give it up for at least a year but i think now that shes so rich and alexei is so poor its very much on the cards youre not jealous i said anxiously not at all he bent over and kissed me but i really dont fancy marina as a stepmother
