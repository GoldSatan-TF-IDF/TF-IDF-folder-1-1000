michael crichton next the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it also seems pointless steven weinberg the word cause is an altar to an unknown god william james what is not possible is not to choose jeanpaul sartre this novel is fiction except for the parts that arent prologue vasco borden fortynine tugged at the lapels of his suit and straightened his tie as he walked down the plush carpeted hallway he wasnt used to wearing a suit though he had had this one in navy specially tailored to minimize the muscular bulk of his body borden was big sixfour twoforty an exfootball player who worked as a private investigator and fugitiverecovery specialist and right now vasco was following his man a thirtyyearold balding postdoc a fugitive from microproteonomics of cambridge mass as he headed right for the main room of the conference the biochange conference enthusiastically entitled make it happen now was being held at the venetian hotel in las vegas the two thousand attendees represented all sorts of biotech workers including investors hr officers who hired scientists technology transfer officers ceos and intellectual property attorneys in one way or another nearly every biotech company in america was represented here it was the perfect place for the fugitive to meet his contact the fugitive looked like a dink he had an innocent face and a little soul patch on his chin he slouched when he walked and gave the impression of timidity and ineptitude but the fact was hed made off with twelve transgenic embryos in a cryogenic dewar and transported them across country to this conference where he intended to turn them over to whomever he was working for it wouldnt be the first time a postdoc got tired of working on salary or the last the fugitive went over to the checkin table to get his conference card to drape around his neck vasco hung by the entrance slipping his own card over his head hed come prepared for this he pretended to look at the event roster the big speeches were all in the main ballroom seminars were scheduled for such topics as finetune your recruiting process and winning strategies to keep research talent executive and equity compensation corporate governance and the sec patent office trends and investor angels boon or curse and finally trade secrets piracy protect yourself now much of vascos work involved hightech firms he had been to these conferences before either they were about science or business this one was business the fugitive whose name was eddie tolman walked past him into the ballroom vasco followed tolman went down a few rows and dropped into a seat with no one nearby vasco slipped into the row behind and sat a little to one side the tolman kid checked his cell phone for text messages then seemed to relax and looked up to listen to the speech vasco wondered why the manat the podium was one of the most famous venture capitalists in california a legend in hightech investment jack b watson watsons face was blown up large on the screen behind him his trademark suntan and striking good looks magnified to fill the room watson was a younglooking fiftytwo and assiduously cultivated his reputation as a capitalist with a conscience that appellation had carried him through a succession of ruthless business deals all the media ever showed were his appearances at charter schools or handing out scholarships for underprivileged kids but in this room vasco knew watsons reputation for tough deal making would be foremost in everyones mind he wondered if watson was ruthless enough to acquire a dozen transgenic embryos by illicit means he probably was however at the moment watson was cheerleading biotechnology is booming we are poised to see the greatest growth of any industry since computers thirty years ago the largest biotech company amgen in los angeles employs seven thousand people federal grants to universities exceed four billion a year on campuses from new york to san francisco boston to miami venture capitalists invest in biotech companies at a rate of five billion a year the lure of magnificent cures made possible by stem cells cytokines and proteonomics are drawing the brightest talent to the field and with a global population growing older by the minute our future is brighter than ever and thats not all weve reached the point where we can stick it to big pharmaand we will those massive bloated companies need us and they know it they need genes they need technology theyre the past were the future were where the money is that drew huge applause vasco shifted his bulk in his seat the audience was applauding even though they knew that this son of a bitch would cut their company to pieces in a second if it suited his bottom line of course we face obstacles to our progress some peoplehowever well intentioned theythink they arechoose to stand in the way of human betterment they dont want the paralyzed to walk the cancer patient to thrive the sick child to live and play these people have their reasons for objecting religious ethical or even practical but whatever their reasons they are on the side of death and they will not triumph more thunderous applause vasco glanced at the fugitive tolman the kid was checking his phone again evidently waiting for a message and waiting impatiently did that mean the contact was late that was sure to make tolman nervous because somewhere vasco knew this kid had stashed a stainless steel thermos of liquid nitrogen that held the embryos it wasnt in the kids room vasco had already searched it and five days had passed since tolman left cambridge the coolant wouldnt last forever and if the embryos thawed they would be worthless so unless tolman had a way to top up his ln by now he must be anxious to retrieve his container and hand it over to his buyer it had to happen soon within an hour vasco was sure of it of course people will try to obstruct progress watson said from the podium even our best companies find themselves embroiled in pointless unproductive litigation one of my startups biogen in los angeles is in court right now because some guy named burnet thinks he doesnt need to honor the contracts he himself signed because now hes changed his mind burnet is trying to block medical progress unless we pay him an extortionist whose daughter is the lawyer handling the case for him keeping it in the family watson smiled but we will win the burnet case because progress cannot be stopped at that watson threw both hands up in the air waving to the audience as applause filled the room he almost acts like a candidate vasco thought is that what watson was aiming for the guy certainly had enough money to get elected being rich was essential in american politics these days pretty soon he looked over and saw that the tolman kid was gone the seat was empty shit progress is our mission our sacred calling watson cried progress to vanquish disease progress to halt aging banish dementia extend life a life free of disease decay pain and fear the great dream of humanitymade real at last vasco borden wasnt listening he was heading down the row toward the side aisle scanning the exit doors a couple of people leaving nobody looking like tolman the guy couldnt have gotten away there was he looked back just in time to see tolman moving slowly up the center aisle the kid was looking at his cell phone again sixty billion this year two hundred billion next year five hundred billion in five years that is the future of our industry and that is the prospect we bring to all mankind the crowd suddenly rose to its feet giving watson a standing ovation and for a moment vasco could no longer see tolman at all but only for a momentnow tolman was making for the center exit vasco turned away slipping through the side door and out into the lobby just as tolman came blinking into the bright lobby light tolman glanced at his watch and headed down the far corridor past big glass windows that looked out on the red brick campanile of san marco recreated by the venetian hotel and lit brilliantly at night he was going toward the swimming pool area or perhaps the courtyard this time of night those spaces would be crowded vasco stayed close this was it he thought in the ballroom jack watson paced back and forth smiling and waving to the cheering crowd thank you thats very kind thank you ducking his head a little each time he said it just the right amount of modesty rick diehl snorted in disgust as he watched diehl was backstage taking it all in on a little blackandwhite monitor diehl was the thirtyfouryearold ceo of biogen research a struggling startup in los angeles and this performance by his most important outside investor filled him with unease because diehl knew that despite the cheerleading and the press releases with smiling black kids at the end of the day jack watson was a true bastard as someone put it the best i can say about watson is hes not a sadist hes just a firstclass son of a bitch diehl had accepted funding from watson with the greatest reluctance he wished he didnt need it diehls wife was wealthy and he had started biogen with her money his first venture as ceo had been to bid on a cell line being licensed by ucla it was the socalled burnet cell line developed from a man named frank burnet whose body produced powerful cancerfighting chemicals called cytokines diehl hadnt really expected to land the license but he did and suddenly he faced the prospect of gearing up for fda approval for clinical trials the cost of clinical trials started at a million dollars and went rapidly to ten million a pop not counting downstream costs and aftermarketing expenses he could no longer rely solely on his wifes money he needed outside financing that was when he discovered just how risky venture capitalists considered cytokines to be many cytokines such as interleukins had taken years to come to market and many others were known to be dangerous even deadly to patients and then frank burnet had brought a lawsuit casting doubt on biogens ownership of the cell line diehl had trouble getting investors to even meet with him in the end he had to accept smiling suntanned jack watson but watson diehl knew wanted nothing less than to take over biogen and throw rick diehl out on his ass jack fantastic speech fantastic rick extended his hand as watson came backstage at last yeah glad you liked it watson didnt shake his hand instead he unclipped his wireless transmitter and dropped it in diehls palm take care of this rick sure jack your wife here no karen couldnt make it diehl shrugged thing with the kids im sorry she missed this speech watson said ill see she gets the dvd diehl said but we got the bad news out there watson said thats the point everybody now knows theres a lawsuit they know burnet is a bad guy and they know were on top of it thats the important thing the companys now perfectly positioned diehl said isthat why you agreed to give the speech watson stared at him you think iwant to come to vegas christ he unclipped the microphone handed it to diehl take care of this too sure jack and jack watson turned and walked away from him without another word rick diehl shivered thank god for karens money he thought because without it hed be doomed passing through the arches of the doges palace vasco borden moved into the courtyard following his fugitive eddie tolman through the nighttime crowd he heard his earpiece crackle that would be his assistant dolly in another part of the hotel he touched his ear go he said baldy boy tolman has reserved some entertainment is that right thats right he hold on vasco said just hold that thought up ahead he was seeing something he could not believe from the right side of the courtyard he saw jack b watson accompanied by a beautiful slinky darkhaired woman merging with the crowd watson was famous for always being accompanied by gorgeous women they all worked for him they were all smart and they were all stunning the woman didnt surprise vasco what surprised him was that jack watson was heading directly toward eddie tolman the fugitive that made no sense at all even if tolman were doing a deal with watson the famous investor would never meet him facetoface and certainly never in public but there they were on a collision course in the crowded venetian courtyard right before his eyes what the hell he couldnt believe it was going to happen but then the slinky woman stumbled a bit and stopped she was wearing a short skintight dress and heels she leaned on watsons shoulder bent her knee showing plenty of leg and inspected her shoe she adjusted her heel strap stood up again and smiled at watson and vasco glanced away from them and saw that tolman was gone but now watson and the woman crossed vascos own path passing so close to him that he could smell her perfume and he heard watson murmur something to her and she squeezed his arm and put her head on his shoulder as they walked the romantic couple was all that an accident had it happened on purpose had they made him he pressed his earpiece dolly i lost him no prob i got him he glanced up she was on the second floor watching everything below was that jack watson that just walked by yeah i thought maybe no no dolly said i cant imagine watsons involved in this not his style i mean baldy boy is heading for his room because he has an appointment thats what i was telling you he got some entertainment namely russian girl apparently he only likes russians tall ones anybody we know no but i have a little information and i got cameras in his suite howd you do that he was smiling lets just say venetian security isnt what it used to be cheaper too irina katayeva twentytwo knocked on the door in her left hand she held a bottle of wine encased in a velvet gift bag with drawstrings at the top a guy of about thirty answered the door smiled he wasnt attractive are you eddie thats right come on in i brought this for you from the hotel safe she handed him the wine watching all this on his little handheld video monitor vasco said she gave it to him in the hallway where it would be seen on the security monitor why didnt she wait until she was in the room maybe she was told to do it that way dolly said she must be six feet what do we know about her good english four years in this country studying at the university works at the hotel no so nonpro vasco said this is nevada dolly said on the monitor the russian girl went into the room and the door closed vasco turned the tuning dial on his video monitor picked up one of the inside cameras the kid had a big suite close to two thousand square feet done in the venetian style the girl nodded and smiled nice nice room yeah so you want a drink she shook her head i dont really have time she reached behind her back and unzipped the dress left it hanging from her shoulders she turned around pretending to be puzzled allowing him to see her bare back all the way down to her buttocks which way is the bedroom this way baby as they went into the bedroom vasco again turned the dials he saw the bedroom just as she was saying i dont know anything about your business and i dont want to know business is so boring she let the dress fall she stepped out of it and lay down on the bed naked now except for high heels she kicked them off i dont think you need a drink she said and i know i dont tolman threw himself on her landing with a kind of thud she grunted and tried to smile easy boy he was panting gasping he reached for her hair to caress her leave the hair alone she said she twisted away just lie down she said and let me make you happy aw hell vasco said staring at the tiny screen do you believe that he aint even a minuteman when a woman looks like that youd think never mind dolly said over the headset shes getting dressed now so she is he said and rather hurriedly too shes supposed to give him half an hour and if he paid her i didnt see it me neither but hes getting dressed too somethings up dolly said shes walking out the door vasco thumbed the tuner trying to change to a different camera all he got was static i cant see shit shes leaving hes still there no waithes leaving too yeah yeah and hes taking the wine bottle with him okay vasco said and wheres he going with it frozen embryos in liquid nitrogen were transported in a special stainless steel thermos lined with borosilicate glass called a dewar dewars were mostly big affairs shaped like milk jugs but you could get them as small as a liter a dewar didnt have the shape of a wine bottle because they had a widemouth cap but it would be about the same size and would fit in a wine sack for sure he must be carrying it vasco said it must be in the sack i figure dolly said you see em yet yeah i do vasco picked up the couple on the ground floor near the gondola stand they walked arm in arm the guy carrying the wine bottle in the crook of his arm keeping it upright it was an awkward way to carry it and they made an oddlooking pairthe beautiful girl and the diffident slouchy guy they walked along the canal hardly glancing at the shops as they passed them on their way to a meeting vasco said i see em dolly said vasco looked down the crowded street and saw dolly at the far end dolly was twentyeight and completely ordinarylooking dolly could be anybody an accountant girlfriend secretary assistant she could always pass tonight she was dressed vegasstyle teased blond hair and a sparkly dress with cleavage she was a little overweight which made the impression perfect vasco had been with her for four years now and they worked well as a team in private life they got along only okay she hated that he smoked cigars in bed heading for the hall dolly said no theyre doubling back the main hall was a huge oval passageway high gilded ceiling soft lights marble pillars it dwarfed the crowds that moved through it vasco hung back change their mind or they made us i think theyre being careful well this is the big moment because even more than catching the fugitive they had to know whom he was turning the embryos over to obviously someone at the conference wont be long now dolly said rick diehlwas walking back and forth along the shops by the gondola canal holding his cell phone in his hand he ignored the stores which were filled with expensive stuff of the sort he never wanted diehl had grown up as the third son of a baltimore physician all the other boys went to medical school and became obstetricians like their father diehl refused and went into medical research family pressure eventually drove him to move west he did genetic research at ucsf for a while but he was more intrigued by the entrepreneurial culture among the universities in san francisco it seemed like every professor worth his salt had either started his own company or was sitting on the boards of several biotech firms at lunch the conversation was all about tech transfer crosslicensing milestone payments buyouts and payouts foreground and background iprs by then karen ricks wife had come into a substantial inheritance and he realized he had enough capital to get started the bay area was crowded with firms there was intense competition for space and hiring he decided to go to the area north of los angeles where amgen had set up their huge facility diehl built a terrific modern plant put bright research teams in place and was on his way his father and brothers came to visit they were duly impressed butwhy wasnt she calling him back he looked at his watch it was nine oclock the kids should be in bed by now and karen should be home the maid said she had gone out an hour before she didnt know where but karen never left without her cell phone she must have it with her why wasnt she calling him back he didnt understand it and it just made him nervous as hell here he was alone in this damn city with more beautiful women per square foot than he had ever seen in his life true they were plastic lots of surgery but they were also sexy as hell up ahead he saw a schlumpy guy walking with a tall chick who was striding along on spike heels and she was just a knockout black hair smooth skin and a hot lean body the schlumpy guy must have paid for her but even so he clearly didnt appreciate her he was clutching his wine bottle like it was a baby and appeared so nervous he was almost sweating but that girljesus she was hot hot hot why the hell he thought wasnt karen calling him back hey vasco said looky look its that biogen guy walking around like he has nothing to do i see him dolly said she was about a block ahead of him nope never mind tolman and the russian girl walked right past the biogen guy who did nothing but flip open his phone and dial what was his name diehl vasco had heard something about him started a company on his wifes dough and now maybe she was in control of their marriage something like that rich broad old eastern family lots of money those broads could wear the pants restaurant dolly said theyre going in that terrazo place il terrazzo antico was a twostory restaurant with glassedin balconies the dcor was whorehouse modern gilded everything pillars ceiling walls every surface covered with decoration made vasco jumpy just to look at it the couple walked in right past the reservation desk heading for a side table and at the table vasco saw a heavyset guy who looked like a thug darkskinned and heavybrowed and the thug was looking at the russian girl and practically licking his lips tolman marched right up to the table and spoke to the darkskinned man the guy looked puzzled he didnt invite them to sit vasco thought somethings wrong the russian girl had stepped back a pace at that moment a flash went off dolly had snapped a picture the tolman kid looked took it all in and bolted shit dolly vasco started running after tolman who was heading deeper into the restaurant a waiter held up his hands sir excuse me vasco knocked him flat kept right on going tolman was ahead moving slower than he might because he was trying not to shake his precious wine bottle but he didnt know where he was going anymore he didnt know the restaurant he was just running whang through swinging doors into the kitchen vasco right after him everybody was yelling at them and some of the cooks were waving knives but tolman pushed on apparently convinced there was some sort of rear entrance to the kitchen there wasnt he was trapped he looked around wildly vasco slowed he flashed one of his badges in an officiallooking wallet citizens arrest he said tolman cowered back by two walkin freezers and a narrow door with a slim vertical window tolman went through the narrow door and it closed behind him a light blinked by the door it was a service elevator shit where does this go second floor anywhere else no just second floor vasco pressed his earpiece dolly im on it she said he heard her panting as she ran up stairs vasco positioned himself in front of the elevator door and waited he pressed the button to bring the elevator down im at the elevator now dolly said i saw him he went back down thats a tiny elevator vasco said i know if hes really got liquid nitrogen with him he shouldnt be in there a couple of years back vasco had chased a fugitive into a laboratorysupply warehouse the guy had nearly suffocated after he locked himself in a closet the elevator came down as soon as it stopped vasco yanked the handle to open it but tolman must have pushed an emergency switch because the door wouldnt open vasco could see the wine sack on the floor the velvet had been pushed down to reveal the stainless steel rim of the dewar and the top was off white steam around the opening through the glass tolman stared at him wildeyed come out son vasco said dont be foolish tolman shook his head its dangerous vasco said you know its dangerous but the kid pushed a button and the elevator started back up vasco had a bad feeling the kid knew all right he knew exactly what he was doing hes up here dolly said standing on the second floor but the door wont open no hes going down again go back to the table vasco said to her let him go she realized at once what he was talking about she hurried back down the plush red velvet staircase to the ground floor she was not surprised to see that the table where the thuggish man had sat was now empty no thug no beautiful russian girl just a hundreddollar bill tucked under a glass hed paid in cash of course and vanished vasco was now surrounded by three hotel security guys all talking at once standing half a head above them he yelled for quiet one thing he said how do we get the elevator open he must have hit the override how do we get it open we have to kill the power to it will that open it no but then we can wedge it open once its stopped how long will that take maybe ten fifteen minutes doesnt matter this guy isnt going anyplace yes he is vasco said the security guy laughed where the hell can he go the elevator came down again tolman was on his knees holding the glass door shut get up vasco said get up get up come on son its not worth it stand up suddenly tolmans eyes rolled up into his head and he fell onto his back the elevator started to rise what the hell one of the security men said who is he anyway ah shit vasco thought the kid had pushed some override that had jammed the elevator circuits it took them forty minutes to get the doors open and haul him out he was long since dead of course the instant he fell he was immersed in percent nitrogen atmosphere from the liquid nitrogen that was streaming from the dewar because nitrogen was heavier than air it progressively filled the elevator from the bottom up once the kid flopped on his back he was already unconscious and he would have died within a minute the security guys wanted to know what was in the dewar which was no longer smoking vasco got some gloves and pulled out the long metal stick there was nothing there just a series of empty clips where the embryos should have been the embryos had been removed you mean to say he killed himself one of the security men said thats right vasco said he worked in an embryology lab he knew about the danger of liquid nitrogen in a confined space nitrogen caused more laboratory fatalities than any other chemical half the people who died were trying to rescue coworkers who had collapsed in confined spaces it was his way out of a bad situation vasco said later driving home with him dolly said so what happened to the embryos vasco shook his head no idea the kid never got them you think the girl took them before she went to his room somebody took them vasco sighed the hotel doesnt know her they reviewed security cameras they dont know her and her student status university had her as a student last year she didnt enroll this year so shes vanished yeah dolly said her the darkskinned guy the embryos everything vanished id like to know how all this goes together vasco said maybe it doesnt dolly said wouldnt be the first time vasco said up ahead he saw the neon of a roadhouse in the desert he pulled over he needed a drink chapter division of los angeles superior court was a woodpaneled room dominated by the great seal of the state of california the room was small and had a tawdry feeling the reddish carpet was frayed and streaked with dirt the wood veneer on the witness stand was chipped and one of the fluorescent lights was out leaving the jury box darker than the rest of the room the jurors themselves were dressed casually in jeans and shortsleeve shirts the judges chair squeaked whenever the honorable davis pike turned away to glance at his laptop which he did often throughout the day alex burnet suspected he was checking his email or his stocks all in all this courtroom seemed an odd place to litigate complex issues of biotechnology but that was what they had been doing for the past two weeks in frank m burnet v regents of the university of california alex was thirtytwo a successful litigator a junior partner in her law firm she sat at the plaintiffs table with the other members of her fathers legal team and watched as her father took the witness stand although she smiled reassuringly she was in fact worried about how he would fare frank burnet was a barrelchested man who looked younger than his fiftyone years he appeared healthy and confident as he was sworn in alex knew that her fathers vigorous appearance could undermine his case and of course the pretrial publicity had been savagely negative rick diehls pr team had worked hard to portray her dad as an ungrateful greedy unscrupulous man a man who interfered with medical research a man who wouldnt keep his word who just wanted money none of that was truein reality it was the opposite of the truth but not a single reporter had called her father to ask his side of the story not one behind rick diehl stood jack watson the famous philanthropist the media assumed that watson was the good guy and therefore her father was the bad guy once that version of the morality play appeared in thenew york times written by the local entertainment reporter everybody else fell into line there was a huge me too piece in thela times trying to outdo the new york version in vilifying her father and the local news shows kept up a daily drumbeat about the man who wanted to halt medical progress the man who dared criticize ucla that renowned center of learning the great hometown university a halfdozen cameras followed her and her father whenever they walked up the courthouse steps their own efforts to get the story out had been singularly unsuccessful her fathers hired media advisor was competent enough but no match for jack watsons welloiled wellfinanced machine of course members of the jury would have seen some of the coverage and the impact of the coverage was to put added pressure on her father not merely to tell his story but also to redeem himself to contradict the damage already done to him by the press before he ever got to the witness stand her fathers attorney stood and began his questions mr burnet let me take you back to the month of june some eight years ago what were you doing at that time i was working construction her father said in a firm voice supervising all the welding on the calgary natural gas pipeline and when did you first suspect you were ill i started waking up in the night soaking wet drenched you had a fever i thought so you consulted a doctor not for a while he said i thought i had the flu or something but the sweats never stopped after a month i started to feel very weak then i went to the doctor and what did the doctor tell you he said i had a growth in my abdomen and he referred me to the most eminent specialist on the west coast a professor at ucla medical center in los angeles who was that specialist dr michael gross over there her father pointed to the defendant sitting at the next table alex did not look over she kept her gaze on her father and were you subsequently examined by dr gross yes i was he conducted a physical exam yes did he do any tests at that time yes he took blood and he did xrays and a cat scan of my entire body and he took a biopsy of my bone marrow how was that done mr burnet he stuck a needle in my hipbone right here the needle punches through the bone and into the marrow they suck out the marrow and analyze it and after these tests were concluded did he tell you his diagnosis yes he said i had acute tcell lymphoblastic leukemia what did you understand that disease to be cancer of the bone marrow did he propose treatment yes surgery and then chemotherapy and did he tell you your prognosis what the outcome of this disease was likely to be he said that it wasnt good was he more specific he said probably less than a year did you subsequently get a second opinion from another doctor yes i did with what result my diagnosis washe uhhe confirmed the diagnosis her father paused bit his lip fighting emotion alex was surprised he was usually tough and unemotional she felt a twinge of concern for him even though she knew this moment would help his case i was scared really scared her father said they all told mei didnt have long to live he lowered his head the courtroom was silent mr burnet would you like some water no im fine he raised his head passed his hand across his forehead please continue when youre ready i got a third opinion too and everybody said to me that dr gross was the best doctor for this disease so you initiated your therapy with dr gross yes i did her father seemed to have recovered alex sat back in her chair took a breath the testimony unrolled smoothly now a story her father had told dozens of times before how he a scared and frightened man fearing for his life had put his faith in dr gross how he had undergone surgery and chemotherapy under the direction of dr gross how the symptoms of the disease had slowly faded over the course of the following year how dr gross had seemed at first to believe that her father was well his treatment successfully completed you had followup examinations with dr gross yes every three months with what result everything was normal i gained weight my strength came back my hair grew back i felt good and then what happened about a year later after one of my checkups dr gross called to say he needed to do more tests did he say why he said some of my blood work didnt look right did he say which tests specifically no did he say you still had cancer no but thats what i was afraid of he had never repeated any tests before her father shifted in his chair i asked him if the cancer had come back and he said not at this point but we need to monitor you very closely he insisted i needed constant testing how did you react i was terrified in a way it was worse the second time when i was sick the first time i made my will made all the preparations then i got well and i got a new lease on lifea chance to start over then his phone call came and i was terrified again you believed you were sick of course why else would he be repeating tests you were frightened terrified watching the questioning alex thought its too bad we dont have pictures her father appeared vigorous and hearty she remembered when he had been frail gray and weak his clothes had hung on his frame he looked like a dying man now he looked strong like the construction worker he had been all his life he didnt look like a man who became frightened easily alex knew these questions were essential to establish a basis for fraud and a basis for mental distress but it had to be done carefully and their lead lawyer she knew had a bad habit of ignoring his own notes once the testimony was rolling the lawyer said what happened next mr burnet i went in for tests dr gross repeated everything he even did another liver biopsy with what result he told me to come back in six months why he just said come back in six months how did you feel at this time i felt healthy but i figured id had a relapse dr gross told you that no he never told me anything nobody at the hospital ever told me anything they just said come back in six months naturally enough her father believed he was still sick he met a woman he might have married but didnt because he thought he did not have long to live he sold his house and moved into a small apartment so he wouldnt have a mortgage it sounds like you were waiting to die the attorney said objection ill withdraw the question but lets move on mr burnet how long did you continue going to ucla for testing four years four years and when did you first suspect you were not being told the truth about your condition well four years later i still felt healthy nothing had happened every day i was waiting for lightning to strike but it never did but dr gross kept saying i had to come back for more tests more tests by then i had moved to san diego and i wanted to have my tests done there and sent up to him but he said no i had to do the tests at ucla why he said he preferred his own lab but it didnt make sense and he was giving me more and more forms to sign what forms at first they were just consent forms to acknowledge that i was undertaking a procedure with risk those first forms were one or two pages long pretty soon there were other forms that said i agreed to be involved in a research project each time i went back there were still more forms eventually the forms were ten pages long a whole document in dense legal language and did you sign them toward the end no why not because some of the forms were releases to permit the commercial use of my tissues that bothered you sure because i didnt think he was telling me the truth about what he was doing the reason for all the tests on one visit i asked dr gross straight out if he was using my tissues for commercial purposes he said absolutely not his interests were purely research so i said okay and i signed everything except the forms allowing my tissues to be used for commercial purposes and what happened he got very angry he said he would not be able to treat me further unless i signed all the forms and i was risking my health and my future he said i was making a big mistake objection hearsay all right mr burnet when you refused to sign the consent forms did dr gross stop treating you yes and did you then consult a lawyer yes and what did you subsequently discover that dr gross had sold my cellsthe cells he took from my body during all these teststo a drug company called biogen and how did you feel when you heard that i was shocked her father said i had gone to dr gross when i was sick and scared and vulnerable i had trusted my doctor i had put my life in his hands i trusted him and then it turned out that he had been lying to me and scaring me needlessly for years just so he could steal parts of my own body from me and sell them to make a profit for himself he never cared about me at all he just wanted to take my cells do you know what those cells were worth the drug company said three billion dollars the jury gasped chapter alex had been watching the jury all during the latest testimony their faces were impassive but nobody moved nobody shifted the gasps were involuntary evidence of how deeply engaged they were with what they were hearing and the jury remained transfixed as the questions continued mr burnet did dr gross ever apologize to you for misleading you no did he ever offer to share his profit with you no did you ask him to eventually i did yes when i realized what he had already done they were my cells from my body i thought i should have something to say about what was done with them but he refused yes he said it was none of my business what he did with my cells the jury reacted to that several turned and looked at dr gross that was a good sign too alex thought one final question mr burnet did you ever sign an authorization for dr gross to use your cells for any commercial purposes no you never authorized their sale never but he did it anyway no further questions the judge called a fifteenminute recess and when the court reconvened the ucla attorneys began the crossexamination for this trial ucla had hired raeper and cross a downtown firm that specialized in highstakes corporate litigation raeper represented oil companies and major defense contractors clearly ucla did not regard this trial as a defense of medical research three billion dollars were at stake it was big business and they hired a bigbusiness firm the lead attorney for ucla was albert rodriguez he had a youthful easy appearance a friendly smile and a disarming sense of seeming new at the job actually rodriguez was fortyfive and had been a successful litigator for twenty years but he somehow managed to give the impression that this was his first trial and he subtly appealed to the jury to cut him some slack now mr burnet i imagine it has been taxing for you to go over the emotionally draining experiences of the last few years i appreciate your telling the jury your experiences and i wont keep you long i believe you told the jury that you were very frightened as anyone would naturally be by the way how much weight had you lost when you first came to dr gross alex thought uhoh she knew where this was going they were going to emphasize the dramatic nature of the cure she glanced at the attorney sitting beside her who was clearly trying to think of a strategy she leaned over and whispered stop it the attorney shook his head confused her father was saying i dont know how much i lost about forty or fifty pounds so your clothes didnt fit well not at all and what was your energy like at that time could you climb a flight of stairs no id go two or three steps and id have to stop from exhaustion alex nudged the attorney at her side whisperedasked and answered the attorney immediately stood up objection your honor mr burnet has already stated he was diagnosed with a terminal condition yes rodriguez said and he has said he was frightened but i think the jury should know just how desperate his condition really was ill allow it thank you now then mr burnet you had lost a quarter of your body weight you were so weak you couldnt climb more than a couple of stairs and you had a deadly serious form of leukemia is that right yes alex gritted her teeth she wanted desperately to stop this line of questioning which was clearly prejudicial and irrelevant to the question of whether her fathers doctor had acted improperly after curing him but the judge had decided to allow it to continue and there was nothing she could do and it wasnt egregious enough to provide grounds for appeal and for help in your time of need rodriguez said you came to the best physician on the west coast to treat this disease yes and he treated you yes and he cured you this expert and caring doctor cured you objection your honor dr gross is a physician not a saint sustained all right rodriguez said let me put it this way mr burnet how long has it been since you were diagnosed with leukemia six years is it not true that a fiveyear survival in cancer is considered a cure objection calls for expert conclusion sustained your honor rodriguez said turning to the judge i dont know why this is so difficult for mr burnets attorneys i am merely trying to establish that dr gross did in fact cure the plaintiff of a deadly cancer and i the judge replied dont know why it is so difficult for the defense to ask that question plainly without objectionable phrasing yes your honor thank you mr burnet do you consider yourself cured of leukemia yes you are completely healthy at this time yes who in your opinion cured you dr gross thank you now i believe you told the court that when dr gross asked you to return for further testing you thought that meant you were still ill yes did dr gross ever tell you that you still had leukemia no did anyone in his office or did any of his staff ever tell you that no then rodriguez said if i understand your testimony at no time did you have any specific information that you were still ill correct all right now lets turn to your treatment you received surgery and chemotherapy do you know if you were given the standard treatment for tcell leukemia no my treatment was not standard it was new yes were you the first patient to receive this treatment protocol yes i was dr gross told you that yes and did he tell you how this new treatment protocol was developed he said it was part of a research program and you agreed to participate in this research program yes along with other patients with the disease i believe there were others yes and the research protocol worked in your case yes you were cured yes thank you now mr burnet you are aware that in medical research new drugs to help fight disease are often derived from or tested on patient tissues yes you knew your tissues would be used in that fashion yes but not for commercial im sorry just answer yes or no when you agreed to allow your tissues to be used for research did you know they might be used to derive or test new drugs yes and if a new drug was found did you expect the drug to be made available to other patients yes did you sign an authorization for that to happen a long pause then yes thank you mr burnet i have no further questions how do you think it went her father asked as they left the courthouse closing arguments were the following day they walked toward the parking lot in the hazy sunshine of downtown los angeles hard to say alex said they confused the facts very successfully we know theres no new drug that emerged from this program but i doubt the jury understands what really happened well bring in more expert witnesses to explain that ucla just made a cell line from your tissues and used it to manufacture a cytokine the way it is manufactured naturally inside your body theres no new drug here but thatll probably be lost on the jury and theres also the fact that rodriguez is explicitly shaping this case to look exactly like the moore case a couple of decades back moore was a case very much like yours tissues were taken under false pretenses and sold ucla won that one easily though they shouldnt have so counselor how does our case stand she smiled at her father threw her arm around his shoulder and kissed him on the cheek truth its uphill she said chapter barry sindlerdivorce lawyer to the stars shifted in his chair he was trying to pay attention to the client seated across the desk from him but he was having trouble the client was a nerd named diehl who ran some biotech company the guy talked abstractly no emotion practically no expression on his face even though he was telling how his wife was screwing around on him diehl must have been a terrible husband but barry wasnt sure how much money there was in this case it seemed the wife had all the money diehl droned on how his first suspicions arose when he called her from las vegas how he discovered the charge slips for the hotel that she went to every wednesday how he waited in the lobby and caught her checking in with a local tennis pro same old california story barry had heard it a hundred times didnt these people know they were walking clichs outraged husband catches wife with the tennis pro they wouldnt even use that one on desperate housewives barry gave up trying to listen he had too much on his mind this morning he had lost the kirkorivich case and it was all over town just because dna tests had shown that it wasnt the billionaires baby and then the court wouldnt award him his fees even though he had cut them to a measly mil the judge gave him a quarter of that every damn lawyer in town was gloating because they all had it in for barry sindler he had heard that la magazine was doing a big story on the case sure to be unfavorable to barry not that he gave a crap about that the truth was the more he got portrayed as an unprincipled ruthless prick the more clients flocked to him because when it came to a divorce people wanted a ruthless prick they lined up for one and barry sindler was without a doubt the most ruthless unscrupulous publicityhungry selfaggrandizing stopatnothing sonofabitch divorce lawyer in southern california and proud of it no barry didnt worry about any of those things he didnt even worry about the house he was building in montana for denise and her two rotten kids he didnt worry about the renovations on their house in holmby hills even though the kitchen alone was costing k and denise kept changing the plans denise was a serial renovator it was a disease no no no barry sindler worried about just one thingthe lease he had one whole floor in an office building on wilshire and doheny twentythree attorneys in his office none of them worth a shit but seeing all of them at their desks impressed the clients and they could do the minor stuff like take depositions and file delaying motionsstuff barry didnt want to be bothered with barry knew that litigation was a war of attrition especially in custody cases the goal was to run the costs as high as you could and stretch the proceedings out as long as you could because that way barry earned the largest possible fees and the spouse eventually got tired of the endless delays the new filings and of course the spiraling costs even the richest of them eventually got tired by and large husbands were sensible they wanted to get on with their lives buy a new house move in with the new girlfriend get a nice blow job they wanted custody issues settled but the wives usually wanted revengeso barry kept things from being settled year after year until the husbands caved millionaires billionaires celebrity assholesit didnt matter they all caved in the end people said it wasnt a good strategy for the kids well screw the kids if the clients cared anything about the kids they wouldnt get divorced in the first place theyd stay married and miserable like everybody else because the nerd had said something that jogged him back to attention im sorry barry sindler said run that by me again mr diehl what did you just say i said i want my wife tested i can assure you these proceedings will test her to the limit and of course well put a detective on her see how much she drinks whether she does drugs stays out all night has lesbian affairs all that standard procedure no no diehl said i want her tested genetically for what for everything he said ah barry said nodding wisely what the hell was the guy talking about genetic testing in a custody case he glanced down at the papers in front of him and the business card richard rick diehl phd barry frowned unhappily only assholes put a nickname on the card the card said he was ceo of biogen research inc some company out in westview village for example diehl said ill bet my wife has a genetic predisposition to bipolar illness she certainly acts erratic she might have the alzheimers gene if she does psychological tests could show early signs of alzheimers good very good barry sindler was nodding vigorously now this was making him happy fresh new disputed areas sindler loved disputed areas administer the psychological test did the test show early alzheimers or not who the fuck could say for sure wonderful wonderfulwhatever the test results they would be disputed more days in court more expert witnesses to interview battles of the doctorates dragging on for days days in court were especially lucrative and best of all barry realized that this genetic testing could become standard procedure for all custody cases sindler was breaking new ground here hed get publicity for this he leaned forward eagerly go on mr diehl test her for the diabetes gene breast cancer from the brca genes and all the rest and diehl continued my wife might also have the gene for huntingtons disease which causes fatal nerve degeneration her grandfather had huntingtons so its in her family both her parents are still young and the disease only shows up when youre older so my wife could be carrying the gene and that would mean a death sentence from huntingtons umm yes barry sindler said nodding that could render her unfit to be the primary caregiver to the children exactly im surprised she hasnt been tested already she doesnt want to know diehl said theres a fiftyfifty chance she may have the gene if she does shell eventually develop the disease and die writhing in dementia but shes twentyeight the disease might not appear for another twenty years so if she knew about it nowit could ruin the rest of her life but it could also relieve her if she didnt have the gene too big a risk she wont test any other tests you can think of hell yes diehl said thats just the beginning i want her tested with all the current panels there are twelve hundred gene tests now twelve hundred sindler licked his lips at the prospect excellent why had he never heard of this before he cleared his throat but you realize that if you do this she will demand you be tested as well no problem diehl said youve already been tested no i just know how to fake the lab results barry sindler sat back in his chair perfect chapter beneath the high canopy of trees the jungle floor was dark and silent no breeze stirred the giant ferns at shoulder height hagar wiped sweat from his forehead glanced back at the others and pushed on the expedition moved deep into the jungles of central sumatra no one spoke which was the way hagar liked it the river was just ahead a dugout canoe on the near bank a rope stretched across the river at shoulder height they crossed in two groups hagar standing up in the dugout pulling them across on the rope then going back for the others it was silent except for the cry of a distant hornbill they continued on the opposite bank the jungle trail grew narrower and muddy in spots the team didnt like that they made a lot of noise trying to scramble around the wet patches finally one said how much farther is it it was that kid the whiny american teenager with spots on his face he was looking to his mother a largish matron in a broad straw hat are we almost there the kid whined hagar put his finger to his lips quiet my feet hurt the other tourists were standing around a cluster of brightcolored clothing staring at the kid look hagar whispered if you make noise you wont see them i dont see them anyhow the kid pouted but he fell into line as the group moved on today they were mostly americans hagar didnt like americans but they werent the worst the worst he had to admit were the there look there the tourists were pointing ahead excited chattering about fifty yards up the trail and off to the right a juvenile male orangutan stood upright in the branches that swayed gently with his weight magnificent creature reddish fur roughly forty pounds distinctive white streak in the fur above his ear hagar had not seen him in weeks hagar gestured for the others to be quiet and moved up the trail the tourists were close behind him now stumbling banging into one another in their excitement ssssh he hissed whats the big deal one said i thought this was a sanctuary ssssh but theyre protected here ssssh hagar needed it quiet he reached into his shirt pocket and pressed the record button he unclipped his lapel mike and held it in his hand they were now about thirty yards from the orang they passed a sign along the trail that said bukut alam orangutan sanctuary this was where orphaned orangs were nursed to health and reintroduced into the wild there was a veterinary facility a research station a team of researchers if its a sanctuary i dont understand why george you heard what he said be quiet twenty yards now look another one two there they were pointing off to the left high in the canopy a oneyearold crashing through branches with an older juvenile swinging gracefully hagar didnt care he was focused on the first animal the whitestreaked orang did not move away now he was hanging by one hand swinging in the air head cocked to one side as he looked at them the younger animals in the canopy were gone whitestreak stayed where he was and stared ten yards hagar held his microphone out in front of him the tourists were pulling out their cameras the orang stared directly at hagar and made an odd sound like a coughdwaas hagar repeated the sound back dwaas the orang stared at him the curved lips moved a sequence of guttural gruntsooh stomm dwaas varlaat leanme one of the tourists said is he making those sounds yes hagar said is hetalking apes cant talk another tourist said orangs are silent it says so in the book several snapped flash pictures of the hanging ape the juvenile male showed no surprise but the lips movedgeen lichten dwaas does he have a cold a woman asked nervously sounds like hes coughing hes not coughing another voice said hagar glanced over his shoulder a heavyset man at the back a man who had struggled to keep up redfaced and puffing now held a tape recorder in his hand pointing it toward the orang he had a determined look on his face he said to hagar is this some kind of trick you play no hagar said the man pointed to the orang thats dutch he said sumatra used to be a dutch colony thats dutch i wouldnt know hagar said i would the animal said stupid leave me alone and then it said no lights when the camera flashes went off i dont know what those sounds were hagar said but you were recording them just out of curiosity you had your microphone out long before the sounds began you knew that animal would speak orangs cant speak hagar said that one can they all stared at the orangutan still swinging from one arm it scratched itself with the free arm it was silent the heavyset man said loudlygeen lichten the ape just stared blinked slowly geen lichten the orang gave no sign of comprehension after a moment he swung to a nearby branch and began to climb into the air moving easily arm on arm geen lichten the ape kept climbing the woman in the big straw hat said i think it was just coughing or something hey the heavyset man yelledmsieu commenta va the ape continued up through the branches swinging in an easy rhythm with its long arms it did not look down i thought maybe it speaks french the man said he shrugged guess not a light rain began to drip from the canopy the other tourists put their cameras away one shrugged on a light transparent raincoat hagar wiped the sweat from his forehead up ahead three young orangs were scampering around a tray of papayas on the ground the tourists turned their attention to them from high in the canopy came a growling soundespce de con the phrase came to them clearly surprisingly distinct in the still air the heavyset man spun aroundwhat everyone turned to look upward that was a swear word the teenager said in french i know it was a swear word in french hush his mother said the group stared up at the canopy searching the dense mass of dark leaves they could not see the ape up there the heavyset man yelledquestce que tu dis there was no answer just the crash of an animal moving through branches and the distant cry of a hornbill cheeky chimp chews off tourists news of the world affe spricht im dschungel flche george bush der spiegel orang parle franais paris matchbeneath a

printed polyglot primates sighted in sumatra los angeles times and finally a group of tourists in indonesia swear they were abused by an orangutan in the jungles of borneo according to the tourists the ape swore at them in dutch and french which means it was probably a lot smarter than they were but no recordings of the cursing chimp have turned up leading us to conclude that if you believe this story we have a job for you in the current administration plenty of talking apes there countdown with keith olbermannmsnbc news no correction chapter get thischarlie huggins said looking at the television in the kitchen of his house in san diego the sound was turned off but he was reading the crawl beneath it says talking ape cited in sumatra you mean it got a speeding ticket his wife said glancing at the screen she was making breakfast no huggins said they must mean the ape was sighted with an s the ape was sighted meaning the ape could see his wife was a high school english teacher she liked these jokes no honey the story sayssome people in sumatra encountered an ape in the jungle that talked i thought apes cant talk his wife said well thats what the story says so it has to be a lie you think uh nowbritney spears is not getting divorced im relieved she may be pregnant again from the pictures it looks like it and posh spice wore a nice green dress to a gala and sting says he can have sex for eight hours without stopping scrambled or over easy his wife said tantric apparently i mean your eggs scrambled call the kids will you she said everythings almost ready okay charlie got up from the table and headed for the stairs when he got to the living room the phone rang it was the lab in the laboratories of radial genomics inc in the eucalyptus groves of the university of california at san diego henry kendall drummed his fingers on the countertop while he waited for charlie to pick up the phone rang three times where the fuck was he finally charlies voice hello charlie henry said did you hear the news what news the ape in sumatra for christs sake that has to be bullshit charlie said why come on henry you know its bullshit they said the ape spoke dutch its bullshit it might have been uttenbroeks team kendall said nah the ape was big two or three years old so uttenbroek could have done it a few years ago his teams advanced enough besides those guys from utrecht are all liars charlie huggins sighed its illegal in the netherlands to do that research right which is why they would go to sumatra to do it henry the technologys much too difficult were years away from making a transgenic ape you know that i dont know that you hear what utrecht announced yesterday they harvested bull stem cells and cultured them in mouse testicles i would saythat is difficult i would say that is fucking cutting edge especially for the bulls i dont see anything funny here cant you imagine the poor mice dragging around giant purple bulls balls still not laughing henry charlie said are you telling me you see one report on television about a talking ape and you actually believe it im afraid i do henry charlie sounded exasperated its television this storys right up there with the twoheaded snake pull yourself together the twoheaded snake was real i have to get the kids to school ill talk to you later and charlie hung up fucker his wife always took the kids to school hes avoiding me henry kendall walked around the lab stared out the window paced some more he took a deep breath of course he knew charlie was right it had to be a fake story butwhat if it wasnt it was truethat henry kendall had a tendency to be highstrung his hands sometimes shook when he spoke especially when he was excited and he was a bit of a klutz always stumbling banging into things at the lab he had a nervous stomach he was a worrier but what henry couldnt tell charlie was that the real reason he was worried now had to do with a conversation that had taken place a week ago it seemed meaningless at the time now it took on a more ominous quality some ditsy secretary from the national institutes of health had called the lab and asked for dr kendall when he answered the phone she said are you dr henry a kendall yes is it correct that you came to the nih on a sixmonth sabbatical four years ago yes i did was that from may until october i think it was whats this about and did you conduct part of your research at the primate facility in maryland yes and is it correct that when you came to the nih in may of that year you underwent the usual testing for communicable diseases because you were going to do primate research yes henry said they had done a battery of tests everything from hiv to hepatitis to flu theyd drawn a lot of blood may i ask what this is about i am just filling out some additional paperwork she said for dr bellarmino henry felt a chill rob bellarmino was the head of the genetics section of nih he hadnt been there four years before when henry was there but he was in charge of things now and he was no particular friend of either henry or charlie is there some problem henry asked he had the distinct feeling there was no no she said weve just misplaced some of our paperwork and dr bellarmino is a stickler about records while you were at the primate facility did you do any research involving a female chimpanzee named mary her lab number was f you know i dont remember henry said its a long time back i worked with several chimps i dont recall specifically she was pregnant during that summer im sorry i just dont remember that was the summer we had an outbreak of encephalitis and they had to quarantine most of the chimps is that right yes i remember the quarantine they sent chimps all around the country to different facilities thank you dr kendall ohwhile i have you on the phone can i verify your address we have marbury madison drive la jolla yes it is thanks for your time dr kendall that was the entire conversation all henry really thought at the time was that bellarmino was a tricky son of a bitch you never knew what he was up to but nowwith this primate in sumatra henry shook his head charlie huggins could argue all he wanted but it was a fact that scientists had already made a transgenic monkey theyd done it years ago there were all kinds of transgenic mammals these daysdogs cats everything it was not out of the question that the talking orang was a transgenic animal henrys work at nih had been concerned with the genetic basis of autism hed gone to the primate facility because he wanted to know which genes accounted for the differences in communication abilities between humans and apes and he had done some work with chimp embryos it didnt lead anywhere in fact he had hardly gotten started before the encephalitis outbreak halted his research he ended up back at bethesda and working in a lab for the duration of his sabbatical that was all he knew at least all he knew for sure humans and chimps interbred until recently species split did not end sex researchers find a controversial result from genetics researchers at harvard and mit have concluded that the split between humans and chimpanzees occurred more recently than previously thought gene investigators had long known that apes and human beings both derived from a common ancestor who walked the earth some million years ago gibbons split off first million years ago orangutans split about million years ago gorillas split million years ago chimpanzees and human beings were the last to split about million years ago however after decoding the human genome in geneticists discovered that human beings and chimps differed in only of their genesabout genes in all this was far fewer than expected by scientists had begun to catalog precisely which genes differed between the species it is now clear that many structural proteins including hemoglobin and cytochrome c proteins are identical in chimps and humans human and chimp blood are identical if the species split million years ago why are they still so alike harvard geneticists believe humans and chimpanzees continued to interbreed long after the species split such interbreeding or hybridization puts evolutionary pressure on the x chromosome causing it to change more rapidly than normal the researchers found that the newest genes on the human genome appear on the x chromosome from this researchers argue that ancestral humans continued to breed with chimps until million years ago when the split became permanent this new view stands in sharp contrast to the consensus view that once speciation occurs hybridization is a negligible influence but according to dr david reich of harvard the fact that hybridization has rarely been seen in other species may simply be due to the fact that we have not been looking for it the harvard researchers caution that interbreeding of humans and chimpanzees is not possible in the present day they point out that press reports of hybrid humanzees have invariably proven false chapter biogen research incwas housed in a titaniumskinned cube in an industrial park outside westview village in southern california majestically situated above the traffic on the freeway the cube had been the idea of biogens president rick diehl who insisted on calling it a hexahedron the cube looked impressive and hightech while revealing absolutely nothing about what went on insidewhich is exactly how diehl wanted it in addition biogen maintained forty thousand square feet of nondescript shed space in an industrial park two miles away it was there that the animal storage facilities were located along with the more dangerous labs josh winkler an upandcoming young researcher picked up rubber gloves and a surgical mask from a shelf by the door to the animal quarters his assistant tom weller was reading a news clipping taped to the wall lets go tom josh said diehl must be crapping in his pants weller said pointing to the article have you read this josh turned to look it was an article from the wall street journal scientists isolate master gene a genetic basis for controlling other people toulouse francea team of french biologists have isolated the gene that drives certain people to attempt to control others geneticists at the biochemical institute of toulouse university headed by dr michel narcejacboileau announced the discovery at a press conference today the gene dr narcejacboileau said is associated with social dominance and strong control over other people we have isolated it in sports leaders ceos and heads of state we believe the gene is found in all dictators throughout history dr narcejacboileau explained that while the strong form of the gene produced dictators the milder heterozygous form produced a moderate quasitotalitarian urge to tell other people how to run their lives generally for their own good or for their own safety significantly on psychological testing individuals with the mild form will express the view that other people need their insights and are unable to manage their own lives without their guidance this form of the gene exists among politicians policy advocates religious fundamentalists and celebrities the belief complex is manifested by a strong feeling of certainty coupled with a powerful sense of entitlementand a carefully nurtured sense of resentment toward those who dont listen to them at the same time he urged caution in interpreting the results many people who are driven to control others merely want everybody to be the same as they are they cant tolerate difference this explained the teams paradoxical finding that individuals with the mild form of the gene were also the most tolerant of authoritarian environments with strict and invasive social rules our study shows that the gene produces not only a bossy person but also a person willing to be bossed they have a distinct attraction to totalitarian states he noted that these people are especially responsive to fashions of all kinds and suppress opinions and preferences not shared by their group josh said especially responsive to fashionsis this a joke no theyre serious its marketing tom weller said today everything is marketing read the rest although the french team stopped short of claiming that the mild form of the master gene represented a genetic diseasean addiction to belonging as narcejacboileau phrased itthey nevertheless suggested that evolutionary pressures were moving the human race toward evergreater conformity unbelievable josh said these guys in toulouse hold a press conference and the whole world runs their story about the master gene have they published in a journal anywhere nope they just held a press conference no publication and no mention of publication whats next the slave gene looks like crap to me josh said he glanced at his watch you mean we hope its crap yeah thats what i mean we hope its crap because it gets in the way of what biogens announcing thats for sure you think diehl will delay the announcement tom weller asked maybe but diehl doesnt like waiting and hes been nervous ever since he got back from vegas josh tugged on his rubber gloves put on safety goggles and his paper facemask then picked up the sixinchlong compressedair cylinder and screwed on the vial of retrovirus the whole apparatus was the size of a cigar tube next he fitted a tiny plastic cone on top of that pushing it in place with his thumb grab your pda and they pushed through the swinging door into the animal quarters the strong slightly sweet odor of the rats was a familiar smell there were five or six hundred rats here all neatly labeled in cages stacked six feet high on both sides of an aisle that ran down the center of the room whatre we dosing today tom weller said josh read off a string of numbers tom checked his pda listing of numerical locations they walked down the aisle until they found the cages with that days numbers five rats in five cages the animals were white plump moving normally they look okay this is the second dose right okay boys josh said lets be nice for daddy he opened the first cage and quickly grabbed the rat inside he held the animal by the body forefingers expertly gripping the neck and quickly fitted the small plastic cone over the rats snout the animals breath clouded the cone a brief hiss as the virus was released josh held the mask in place for ten seconds while the rat inhaled then he released the animal back into the cage one down tom weller tapped his stylus on the pda then moved to the next cage the retrovirus had been bioengineered to carry a gene known as acmpd n one of the family of genes controlling aminocarboxymuconate paraldehyde decarboxylase within biogen they called it the maturity gene when activated acmpd n seemed to modify responses of the amygdala and cingulate gyrus in the brain the result was an acceleration of maturational behaviorat least in rats infant female rats for example would show precursors of maternal behavior such as rolling feces in their cages far earlier than usual and biogen had preliminary evidence for the maturational gene action in rhesus monkeys as well interest in the gene centered on a potential link to neurodegenerative disease one school of thought argued that neurodegenerative illnesses were a result of disruptions of maturational pathways in the brain if that were trueif acmpd n were involved in say alzheimers disease or another form of senilitythen the commercial value of the gene would be enormous josh had moved on to the next cage and was holding the mask over the second rat when his cell phone went off he gestured for tom to pull it from his shirt pocket weller looked at the screen its your mother he said ah hell josh said take over for a minute would you joshua what are you doing im working mom well can you stop not really because we have an emergency josh sighed what did he do this time mom i dont know she said but hes in jail downtown well let charles get him out charles silverberg was the family lawyer charles is getting him out right now his mother said but adam has to appear in court somebody has to drive him home after the hearing i cant im at work hes your brother josh hes also thirty years old josh said this had been going on for years his brother adam was an investment banker who had been in and out of rehab a dozen times cant he take a taxi i dont think thats wise under the circumstances josh sighed whatd he do mom apparently he bought cocaine from a woman who worked for the dea again joshua are you going to go downtown and pick him up or not long sigh yes mom ill go now will you go now yes mom ill go now he flipped the phone shut and turned to weller what do you say we finish this in a couple of hours no problem tom said i have some notes to write up back in the office anyway joshua turned stripping off his gloves as he left the room he stuck his cylinder goggles and paper mask into the pocket of his lab coat unclipped his radiation tag and hurried to his car driving downtown he glanced at the cylinder protruding from the lab coat which he had tossed onto the passenger seat to stay within the protocol josh had to return to the lab and expose the remaining rats before five pm that kind of schedule and the need to keep to it seemed to represent everything that separated josh from his older brother once adam had had everythinglooks popularity athletic prowess his high school days at the elite westfield school had consisted of one triumph after anothereditor of the newspaper soccer team captain president of the debating team national merit scholar josh in contrast had been a nerd he was chubby short ungainly he walked with a kind of waddle he couldnt help it the orthopedic shoes his mother insisted he wear did not help girls disdained him he heard them giggle as he passed them in the hallways high school was torture for josh he did not do well adam went to yale josh barely got into emerson state how times had changed a year ago adam had been fired from his job at deutsche bank his drug troubles were endless meanwhile josh had started at biogen as a lowly assistant but had quickly moved up as the company began to recognize his hard work and his inventive approach josh had stock in the company and if any of the current projects including the maturity gene proved out commercially then he would be rich and adam josh pulled up in front of the courthouse adam was sitting on the steps staring fixedly at the ground his ratty suit was streaked with grime and he had a days growth of beard charles silverberg was standing over him talking on his cell phone josh honked the horn charles waved and headed off adam trudged over and got in the car thanks bro he slammed the door shut appreciate it no problem josh pulled into traffic glancing at his watch he had enough time to take adam back to their mothers house and get back to the lab by five did i interrupt something adam asked that was the annoying thing about his brother he liked to mess up everyone elses life too he seemed to take pleasure in it yes actually you did sorry sorry if you were sorry youd stop doing this shit hey man adam said how the fuck was i supposed to know it was entrapment man even charles said so the bitch entrapped me charles said he would get me off easy there wouldnt be any entrapment josh said if you werent using oh go fuck yourself dont lecture me josh said nothing why did he even bring it up after all these years he knew nothing he said mattered nothing made a difference there was a long silence as he drove im sorry adam said youre not sorry yeah youre right adam said youre right he hung his head he sighed theatrically i fucked up again the repentant adam josh had seen it dozens of times before the belligerent adam the repentant adam the logical adam the denying adam meanwhile his brother always tested positive every time an orange light came on on the dashboard gas was low he saw a station up ahead i need gas good i got to take a leak you stay in the car i got to take a leak man stay in the fucking car josh pulled up alongside the pump and got out stay where i can fucking see you i dont want to pee in your car man you better not but just hold it adam josh put a credit card in the slot and started pumping gas he glanced at his brother through the rear windshield then looked back at the spinning numbers gas was so damn expensive now he probably should buy a car that was cheaper to run he finished and got back in the car he glanced at adam his brother had a funny look on his face there was a faint odor in the car adam what what did you do nothing he started the engine that smellsomething silver caught his eye he looked at the floor between his brothers feet and saw the silver cylinder he leaned over picked up the cylinder it was light in his hand adam i didnt do anything josh shook the cylinder it was empty i thought it was nitrous or something his brother said you asshole why it didnt do anything its for a rat adam you just inhaled virus for a rat adam slumped back is that bad it aint good by the time josh pulled up in front of his mothers house in beverly hills he had thought it through and concluded that there was no danger to adam the retrovirus was a mouseinfective strain and while it might also infect human beings the dose had been calculated for an animal weighing eight hundred grams his brother weighed a hundred times as much the genetic exposure was subclinical so im okay adam said yeah sure yeah sorry about that adam said getting out of the car but thanks for picking me up see you bro ill wait until you get inside josh said he watched as his brother walked up the drive and knocked on the door his mother opened it adam stepped inside and she shut the door she never even looked at josh he started the engine and drove away chapter at noon alex burnet left her office in her century city law firm and went home she didnt have far to go she lived in an apartment on roxbury park with her eightyearold son jamie jamie had a cold and had stayed home from school her father was looking after him for her she found her dad in the kitchen making macaroni and cheese it was the only thing jamie would eat these days how is he she said fevers down still got a runny nose and a cough is he hungry he wasnt earlier but he asked for macaroni thats a good sign she said should i take over her father shook his head ive got it handled you didnt have to come home you know i know she paused the judge issued his ruling dad when this morning and we lost her father continued to stir we lost everything yes she said we lost on every point you have no rights to your own tissue he ruled them material waste that you allowed the university to dispose of for you the court says you have no rights to any of your tissue once it has left your body the university can do what it wants with it but they brought me back he said a reasonable person would have realized the tissues were being collected for commercial use therefore you tacitly accepted it but they told me i was sick he rejected all our arguments dad they lied to me i know but according to the judge good social policy promotes medical research granting you rights now would have a chilling effect on future research thats the thinking behind the rulingthe common good this wasnt about the common good it was about getting rich her father said jesus three billion dollars i know dad universities want money and basically this judge held what california judges have held for the last twentyfive years ever since the moore decision in just like your case the court found that moores tissues were waste materials to which he had no right and they havent revisited that question in more than two decades so what happens now we appeal she said i dont think we have good grounds but we have to do it before we can go to the california supreme court and when will that be a year from now do we have a chance her father said absolutely notalbert rodriguez said turning in his chair toward her father rodriguez and the other ucla attorneys had come to alexs law offices in the aftermath of the judges ruling you have no chance on further appeal mr burnet im surprised alex said that youre so confident about how the california supreme court will rule oh we have no idea how they will rule rodriguez said i simply mean that you will lose this case no matter what the court holds how is that alex said ucla is a state university the board of regents is prepared on behalf of the state of california to take your fathers cells by right of eminent domain she blinkedwhat should the supreme court rule that your fathers cells are his propertywhich we think is unlikelythe state will take ownership of his property by eminent domain eminent domain referred to the right of the state to take private property without the owners consent it was almost always invoked for public uses but eminent domain is intended for schools or highways the state can do it in this case rodriguez said and it will her father stared at them thunderstruck are you joking no mr burnet its a legitimate taking and the state will exercise its right alex said then what is the purpose of this meeting we thought it appropriate to inform you of the situation in case you wanted to drop further litigation youre suggesting we end litigation she said i would advise it rodriguez said to her if this were my client ending litigation saves the state considerable expense it saves everyone expense rodriguez said so what are you proposing as a settlement for us to drop the case nothing whatever ms burnet im sorry if you misunderstood me this is not a negotiation were simply here to explain our position so that you can make an informed decision in your best interest her father cleared his throat youre telling us that youre taking my cells no matter what youve sold them for three billion dollars no matter what and youre keeping all of that money no matter what bluntly put rodriguez said but not inaccurate the meeting ended rodriguez and his team thanked them for their time said their goodbyes and left the room alex nodded to her father and then followed the other attorneys outside through the glass frank burnet watched as they talked further those fuckers he said what kind of world do we live in my sentiments exactlysaid a voice from behind him burnet turned a young man wearing hornrimmed glasses was sitting in the far corner of the conference room burnet remembered him he had come in during the meeting bringing coffee and mugs which he had put on the sideboard then he had sat down in the corner for the rest of the meeting burnet had assumed he was a junior member of the firm but now the young man was speaking with confidence lets face it mr burnet he said youve been screwed it turns out your cells are very rare and valuable theyre efficient manufacturers of cytokines chemicals that fight cancer thats the real reason you survived your disease as a matter of fact your cells churn out cytokines more efficiently than any commercial process thats why those cells are worth so much money the ucla doctors didnt create anything or invent anything they didnt genetically modify anything they just took your cells grew them in a dish and sold the dish to biogen and you my friend were screwed who are you burnet said and you have no hope of justice the young man continued because the courts are totally incompetent the courts dont realize how fast things are changing they dont understand we are already in a new world they dont get the new issues and because they are technically illiterate they dont understand what procedures are doneor in this case not done your cells were stolen and sold plain and simple and the court decided that was just fine burnet gave a long sigh but the man continued thieves can still get their comeuppance hows that because ucla did nothing to change your cells another company could take those same cells make minor genetic modifications and sell them as a new product but biogen already has my cells true but cell lines are fragile things happen to them what do you mean cultures are vulnerable to fungus bacterial infection contamination mutation all kinds of things can go wrong biogen must take precautions of course but sometimes the precautions are inadequate the man said who are you burnet said again he was looking around through the glass walls of the conference room at the larger office outside he saw people walking back and forth he wondered where his daughter had gone im nobody the young man said you never met me you have a business card the man shook his head im not here mr burnet burnet frowned and my daughter has no idea never met her this is between us but youre talking about illegal activity im not talking at all because you and i have never met the man said but lets consider how this might work okay you cant legally sell your cells at this point because the court has ruled you no longer own thembiogen does but your cells could be obtained from other places over the course of your life youve given blood many times in many places you went to vietnam forty years ago the army took your blood you had knee surgery twenty years ago in san diego the hospital took your blood and kept your cartilage youve consulted various doctors over the years they ran blood tests the labs kept the blood so your blood can be found no problem and it can be acquired from publicly available databasesif for example another company wanted to use your cells and what about biogen the young man shrugged biotechnology is a difficult business contaminations happen every day if something goes wrong in their labs thats not your problem is it but how could i have no idea so many things can happen there was a short silence and why should i do this burnet said youll get a hundred million dollars for what punch biopsies of six organ systems i thought you could get my blood elsewhere in theory if it came to litigation that would be claimed but in practice any company would want fresh cells i dont know what to say no problem think it over mr burnet the young man stood pushed his glasses up his nose you may have been screwed but theres no reason to bend over for it from beaumont college alumni news stem cell debate rages effective treatments decades away prof mckeown shocks audience by max thaler speaking to a packed audience in beaumont hall famed biology professor kevin mckeown shocked listeners by calling stem cell research a cruel fraud what you have been told is nothing more than a myth he said intended to ensure funding for researchers at the expense of false hopes for the seriously ill so lets get to the truth stem cells he explained are cells that have the ability to turn themselves into other kinds of cells there are two kinds of stem cells adult stem cells are found throughout the body they are found in muscle brain and liver tissue and so on adult stem cells can generate new cells but only of the tissue in which they are found they are important because the human body replaces all its cells every seven years research involving adult stem cells is for the most part not controversial but there is another kind of stem cell the embryonic stem cell that is highly controversial it is found in umbilical cord blood or derived from young embryos embryonic stem cells are pluripotent meaning they can develop into any kind of tissue but the research is controversial because it involves the use of human embryos which many people feel for religious and other reasons have the rights of human beings this is an old debate not likely to be resolved soon scientists see a ban on research the current american administration has said that embryonic stem cells can be taken from existing research lines but not from new embryos scientists regard existing lines as inadequate and thus view the ruling a de facto ban on research thats why they are going to private centers to carry out their research without federal grants but in the end the real problem isnt simply a lack of stem cells its the fact that in order to produce therapeutic effects scientists need each person to have his or her own pluripotent stem cells this would allow us to regrow an organ or to repair damage from injury or disease or to undo paralysis this represents the great dream no one is able to perform these therapeutic miracles now no one even has an inkling how it might be done but it requires the cells now for newborns you can collect umbilical cord blood and freeze it and people are doing that with their newborns but what about adults where will we get pluripotent stem cells thats the big question toward the therapeutic dream all we adults have left is adult stem cells which can make only one kind of tissue but what if there were a way to convert adult stem cells back into embryonic stem cells such a procedure would enable every adult to have a ready source of his or her own embryonic stem cells that would make the therapeutic dream possible well it turns out that youcan reverse adult stem cells but only if you insert them into an egg something within the egg unwinds the differentiation and converts the adult stem cell back into an embryonic stem cell this is good news but it is vastly more difficult to do with human cells and if the method could be made to work in human beings it would require an enormous supply of human egg cells that makes the procedure controversial again so scientists are looking for other ways to make adult cells pluripotent it is a worldwide effort a researcher in shanghai has been injecting human stem cells into chicken eggs with mixed resultswhile others cluck in disapproval its not clear now whether such procedures will work its equally unclear whether the stem cell dreamtransplants without rejection spinal cord injuries repaired and so onwill come true advocates have made dishonest claims and media speculation has been fantastical for years people with serious illnesses have been led to believe a cure is just around the corner sadly this is not true working therapeutic approaches lie many years in the future perhaps decades many thoughtful scientists have said in private that we wont know whether stem cell therapy will work until they point out that it took forty years from the time watson and crick decoded the gene until human gene therapy began a scandal shocks the world it was in the context of feverish hope and hype that korean biochemist hwang woosuk announced in that he had successfully created a human embryonic stem cell from an adult cell by somatic nuclear transferinjection into a human egg hwang was a famous workaholic spending eighteen hours a day seven days a week in the lab hwangs exciting report was published in march inscience magazine researchers from around the world flocked to korea human stem cell treatment seemed suddenly on the verge of reality hwang was a hero in korea and appointed to head a new world stem cell hub financed by the korean government but in november an american collaborator in pittsburgh announced that he was ending his association with hwang and then one of hwangs coworkers revealed that hwang had obtained eggs illegally from women who worked in his lab by december seoul national university announced that hwangs cell lines were a fabrication as were his papers in science science retracted the papers hwang now faces criminal charges there the matter stands perils of media hype what lessons can be drawn from this asked professor mckeown first in a mediasaturated world persistent hype lends unwarranted credulity to the wildest claims for years the media have touted stem cell research as the coming miracle so when somebody announced that the miracle had arrived he was believed does that imply there is a danger in media hype you bet because not only does it raise cruel hopes among the ill it affects scientists too they start to believe the miracle is around the cornereven though they should know better what can we do about media hype it would stop in a week if scientific institutions wanted that they dont they love the hype they know it brings grants so that wont change yale stanford and johns hopkins promote hype just as much as exxon or ford so do individual researchers at those institutions and increasingly researchers and universities are all commercially motivated just like corporations so whenever you hear a scientist claim that his statements have been exaggerated or taken out of context just ask him if he has written a letter of protest to the editor ninetynine times out of a hundred he hasnt next lesson peer review all of hwangs papers in science were peerreviewed if we ever needed evidence that peer review is an empty ritual this episode provides it hwang made extraordinary claims he did not provide extraordinary evidence many studies have shown that peer review does not improve the quality of scientific papers scientists themselves know it doesnt work yet the public still regards it as a sign of quality and says this paper was peerreviewed or this paper was not peerreviewed as if that meant something it doesnt next the journals themselves where was the firm hand of the editor of science remember that the journal science is a big enterprise people work on that magazine yet gross fraud including photographs altered with adobe photoshop were not detected and photoshop is widely known as a major tool of scientific fraud yet the magazine had no way to detect it not that science is unique in being fooled fraudulent research has been published in the new england journal of medicine where authors withheld critical information about vioxx heart attacks in the lancet where a report about drugs and oral cancer was entirely fabricatedin that one people in the patient database had the same birth date that might have been a clue medical fraud is more than a scandal its a public health threat yet it continues the cost of fraud the cost of such fraud is enormous mckeown said estimated at thirty billion dollars annually probably three times that fraud in science is not rare and its not limited to fringe players the most respected researchers and institutions have been caught with faked data even francis collins the head of nihs human genome project was listed as coauthor on five faked papers that had to be withdrawn the ultimate lesson is that science isnt specialat least not anymore maybe back when einstein talked to niels bohr and there were only a few dozen important workers in every field but there are now three million researchers in america its no longer a calling its a career science is as corruptible a human activity as any other its practitioners arent saints theyre human beings and they do what human beings dolie cheat steal from one another sue hide data fake data overstate their own importance and denigrate opposing views unfairly thats human nature it isnt going to change chapter in the biogenanimal lab tom weller was going down the line of cages with josh winkler who was dispensing doses of genelaced virus to the rats it was their daily routine toms cell phone rang josh gave him a look josh was his senior josh could take calls at work but tom couldnt weller stripped off one rubber glove and pulled the phone from his pocket hello tom it was his mother hi mom im at work now josh gave him another look can i call you back your dad had a car accident last night she said andhe died whathe felt suddenly dizzy tom leaned against the rat cages took a shallow breath now josh was giving him a concerned look what happened his car hit an overpass around midnight his mother said they took him to long beach memorial hospital but he died early this morning oh god are you at home tom said you want me to come over does rachel know i just got off the phone okay ill come over he said tom i hate to ask you this she said but you want me to tell lisa im sorry i cant seem to reach her lisa was the black sheep of the family the youngest child just turned twenty lisa hadnt talked to her mother in years do

her the funeral is thursday if she wants to come ill tell her he flipped the phone shut and turned to josh josh was looking concerned and sympathetic what was it my father died im really sorry car crash last night i need to go tell my sister you have to leave now ill stop by the office on my way out and send sandy in sandy cant do this he doesnt know the routine josh he said i have to go traffic was heavy on the it took almost an hour before he found himself in front of a ratty apartment building on south acre in torrance pushing the buzzer for apartment the building stood close to the freeway the roar of traffic was constant he knew lisa worked nights but it was now ten oclock in the morning she might be awake sure enough the buzzer sounded and he opened the door the lobby smelled strongly of cat piss the elevator didnt work so he took the stairs to the third floor stepping around plastic sacks of garbage a dog had broken one sack open and the contents spilled down a couple of steps he stopped in front of apartment pushed the doorbell just a fucking minute his sister called he waited eventually she opened the door she was wearing a bathrobe her short black hair was pulled back she looked upset the bitch called she said mom she woke me up the bitch she turned went back into the apartment he followed her i thought you were the liquor delivery the apartment was a mess lisa padded into the kitchen and poked around the pans and dishes stacked in the sink found a coffee cup she rinsed it out you want coffee he shook his head shit lise he said this place is a pigsty i work nights you know that she had never cared about her surroundings even as a child her room was always a mess she just didnt seem to notice now tom looked through the greasy drapes of the kitchen window at the traffic crawling past on the so hows work going its house of pancakes how do you think its going same every fucking night what did mom say she wanted to know if i was coming to the funeral whatd you say i told her to fuck off why should i go he wasnt my father tom sighed this was a longstanding argument within the family lisa believed she was not john wellers daughter you dont think so either she said to tom yeah i do you just say whatever mom wants you to say she fished out a cigarette butt from a heaping ashtray and bent over the stove to light it from the burner was he drunk when he crashed i dont know i bet he was shitfaced or on those steroids he used for his bodybuilding toms father had been a bodybuilder he took it up later in life and even competed in amateur contests dad didnt use steroids oh sure tom i used to look in his bathroom he had needles okay so you didnt like him it doesnt matter anymore she said he wasnt my father i dont care about any of it mom always said that he was your father that you were just saying it because you didnt like him well guess what we can settle it once and for all how do you mean i mean a paternity test lisa he said dont start this im not starting im finishing dont promise me you wont do this come on dads dead moms upset promise me you are a chickenshit pussy you know that that was when he saw she was near tears he put his arms around her and she began to cry he just held her feeling her body shake im sorry she said im so sorry after her brother had gone she heated a cup of coffee in the microwave then sat down at the kitchenette table by the phone she dialed information she got the number for the hospital a moment later she heard the receptionist say long beach memorial i want to talk to the morgue she said im sorry the morgue is at the county coroners office would you like that number someone in my family just died at your hospital where would his body be now one moment please i will connect you to pathology four days later her mother called back what the hell do you think youre doing what do you mean i mean going down to the hospital and asking for blood from your father hes not my father lisa dont you ever get tired of this game no and hes not my father because the genetic tests came back negative it says right hereshe reached for the printed sheetthat there is less than one chance in million that john j weller is my father what genetic test i had a genetic test done youre so full of shit no mom youre the one whos full of shit john wellers not my father and the test proves iti always knew it well see about that her mother said and hung up about half an hour after that her brother tom called hey lise real casual laidback just got a call from mom yeah she said something about a test yeah i did a test tommy and guess what i heard who did this test lise a lab here in long beach whats it called biorad testing uhhuh her brother said you know these labs that advertise on the internet arent very reliable you know that dont you they guaranteed it moms all upset too bad she said you know shell do her own test now and theres going to be lawsuits because youre accusing her of infidelity gee tommy i dont really give a damn you know that lise i think this is causing a lot of needless trouble around dads death your dad she saidnot mine chapter kevin mccormick chief administrator of long beach memorial looked up at the chubby figure coming into his office and said how the hell did this happen he pushed a sheaf of papers across his desk marty roberts the chief of pathology glanced quickly through the document i have no idea he said the wife of the deceased mr john j weller is suing us for unauthorized release of tissue to the daughter whats the legal situation marty roberts said unclear mccormick said legal says the daughter is a family member and has a clear right to be given tissues to test for diseases that may affect her problem is she did a paternity test and it came back negative so shes not his daughter arguably that makes our release of tissues unauthorized we couldnt have known that at the time of course not but were talking about the law the only important question is can the family sue the answer is yes they have grounds to bring a suit and they are wheres the body now marty said buried eight days ago i see marty flipped through the pages and they are asking for besides unspecified damages theyre asking for blood and tissue samples to conduct further testing mccormick said do we have blood or tissue samples from the deceased id have to check marty said but id presume that we do yes we do sure we keep a lot of tissue these days kevin i mean everybody that comes into the hospital we collect as much as we possibly can legally thats the wrong answer mccormick said glowering okay whats the right answer that we dont have any tissues from this guy but theyll know that we do at the very least we did a tox screen on the guy because of the accident so we have his blood that sample was lost okay it was lost but what good does that do they can always dig up the body and get all the tissues they want correct so so let them do that thats legals advice exhumation takes time permits and money were guessing they wont have the time or the moneyand this thing will go away okay marty said and i am here because because i need you to go back to pathology and confirm for me that unfortunately we have no more samples from the deceased and that everything not given to the daughter has been lost or misplaced got it call me within the hour mccormick said and turned away marty roberts entered the basement pathology lab his diener raza rashad a handsome darkeyed man of twentyseven was scrubbing the stainless steel tables for the next post if truth be told raza really ran the path lab marty felt himself burdened by a heavy administrative load managing the senior pathologists the residents the medical student rotations and all the rest hed come to rely on raza who was highly intelligent and ambitious hey raza you remember that fortysixyearold white guy with crush injuries a week back drove himself into an overpass yeah i remember heller or weller the daughter asked for blood yeah we gave her blood well she ran a paternity test and it came back negative guy was not her father raza stared blankly that right yeah now the mothers all upset wants more tissues whatve we got id have to check probably the usual all major organs marty said any chance that material got misplaced so we couldnt find it raza nodded slowly staring at marty maybe so always possible it could be mislabeled then it would be hard to find might take months or years maybe never thatd be a shame marty said now what about the blood from the tox screen raza frowned lab keeps that we wouldnt have access to their storage facility so they still have that blood sample yeah they do and we have no access raza smiled it might take me a couple of days okay do it marty roberts went to the phone and dialed the administrators office when mccormick came on the line he said i have some bad news kevin unfortunately all the tissues have been lost or misplaced sorry to hear that mccormick said and hung up marty raza said coming into the office is there a problem with this weller guy no marty said not anymore and i told you beforedont call me marty my name is dr roberts chapter at the radial genomics lab in la jolla charlie huggins twisted his flatpanel screen around to show henry kendall the headline talking ape claimed fraud whatd i tell you charlie said a week later and we learn the storys a fake okay okay i was wrong henry said i admit it i was worried about nothing very worried its in the past can we talk about something important whats that the noveltyseeking gene our grant application was denied he began typing at the keyboard once again weve been screwedby your personal favorite the pope of dopamine dr robert a bellarmino of the nih for the last ten years brain studies had increasingly focused on a neurochemical called dopamine levels of dopamine seemed to be important in maintaining health as well as in diseases such as parkinsonism and schizophrenia from work in charlie hugginss lab it appeared that dopamine receptors in the brain were controlled by the gened dr among others charlies lab stood at the forefront of this research until a rival scientist named robert bellarmino from the national institutes of health began referring tod dras the novelty gene the gene that supposedly controlled the urge to take risks seek new sex partners or engage in thrillseeking behavior as bellarmino explained it the fact that dopamine levels were higher in men than women was the reason for the greater recklessness of men and their attraction to everything from mountain climbing to infidelity bellarmino was an evangelical christian and a leading researcher at the nih politically skilled he was the very model of an uptodate scientist neatly blending a modest scientific talent with true media savvy his laboratory was the first to hire its own publicity firm and as a result his ideas invariably got plenty of press coverage which in turn attracted the brightest and most ambitious postdocs who did brilliant work for him thus adding to his prestige in the case of d dr bellarmino was able to tailor his comments to the beliefs of his audience either speaking enthusiastically about the new gene to progressive groups or disparaging it to conservatives he was colorful futureoriented and uninhibited in his predictions he went so far as to suggest that there might one day be a vaccine to prevent infidelity the absurdity of such comments so annoyed charlie and henry that six months before they had applied for a grant to test the prevalence of the novelty gene their proposal was simplicity itself they would send research teams to amusement parks to draw blood samples from individuals who rode roller coasters time and again during the day in theory these repeat coasters would be more likely to carry the gene the only problem with applying to the nsf was that their proposal would be read by anonymous reviewers and one of the reviewers was likely to be robert bellarmino and bellarmino had a reputation for what was politely termed appropriation anyway henry said the nsf turned us down the reviewers didnt think our idea was worthy one said it was too jokey uhhuh charlie said what does this have to do with robbin rob remember where we proposed to conduct our study of course charlie said at two of the biggest amusement parks in the world in two different countries sandusky in the us and blackpool in england well guess whos out of town henry said he hit his email button from rob bellarmino nih subject out of office autoreply travel i will be out of the office for the next two weeks if you need immediate assistance please contact my office by phone i called his office and guess what bellarmino is going to sandusky ohioand then to blackpool england that bastard charlie said if youre going to steal somebody elses research proposal you should at least have the courtesy to change it a little bellarmino obviously doesnt care if we know he stole it henry said doesnt that piss you off what do you say we go for it put him up for ethical violations id like nothing better charlie said but no if we formally charge misconduct it means a lot of time and a lot of paperwork our grants could dry up and in the end the complaint goes nowhere robs a major player at nih hes got huge research facilities and he dispenses millions in grants he holds prayer breakfasts with congressmen hes a scientist who believes in god they love him on the hill hed never be charged with misconduct even if we caught him buggering a lab assistant he wouldnt be charged so we just let him do it its not a perfect world charlie said we have plenty to do walk away chapter barry sindlerwas bored the woman before him yammered on she was an obvious typethe richbitch eastern broad who wore pants katharine hepburn with an attitude a trust fund a nasal newport accent but despite her aristocratic airs the best she could manage was to hump the tennis pro just like every la faketit dimwit in this town but she was perfectly suited to the dumbass attorney by her sidethat ivy league jackoff bob wilson wearing a pinstripe suit and a buttondown shirt with a rep tie and those stupid laceup wingtips with the little perforations in the toes no wonder everyone called him whitey wilson wilson never tired of reminding everyone he was a harvardtrained lawyeras if anybody gave a shit certainly barry sindler didnt because he knew wilson was a gentleman which really meant he was chickenshit he wouldnt go for the throat and sindler always went for the throat the woman karen diehl was still talking jesus these rich bitches could talk sindler didnt interrupt her because he didnt want whitey to state on the record that sindler was badgering the woman wilson had said that four times already so fine let the bitch talk let her tell in full exhausting incredibly stupefyingly boring detail why her husband was a lousy father and a total shit heel because the truth wasshe was the one whod had the affair not that that could ever come out in court california had nofault divorce which meant there were no specific grounds for divorce just irreconcilable differences but a womans infidelity always colored the proceedings because in skilled handsbarrys handsthat fact could easily be turned into the insinuation that this woman had more important priorities than her darling children she was a neglectful parent an unreliable custodian a selfish woman who sought her own pleasure while she left the kids all day with the spanishspeaking maid and she was goodlooking at twentyeight he thought that worked against her too indeed barry sindler could see his central theme shaping up quite nicely and whitey wilson looked a bit anxious he probably knew where sindler would take this or maybe whitey was troubled by the fact that sindler was attending the depo at all because ordinarily barry sindler didnt conduct spousal depos he left those to the jerkoff peons in his office while he spent his days downtown racking up expensive courtroom hours finally the woman stopped to catch her breath sindler moved in mrs diehl i would like to hold this line of questioning and go on to another issue we are formally requesting that you undergo a full battery of genetic tests at a reputable facility preferably ucla and the woman sat bolt upright her face colored swiftly no lets not be hasty whitey said putting his hand on his clients arm she angrily pushed him away no absolutely not i refuse how wonderful how unexpected and wonderful in anticipation of your possible refusal sindler continued we have drafted a request that the court order these testshe passed a document to whiteyand we fully expect the judge to agree ive never heard of such a thing whitey said thumbing through the pages genetic testing in a custody case by now mrs diehl was fullbore hysterical no no i will not its his idea isnt it that prick how dare he that sneaking son of a bitch whitey was looking at his client with a puzzled expression mrs diehl he said i think its best if we discuss this in private no no discussion no test thats it no in that case sindler said with a little shrug we have no choice but to go to the judge fuck you fuck him fuck all of you no fucking test and she stood up grabbed her purse and stomped out of the room slamming the door behind her there was a moment of silence sindler said let the record show that at three fortyfive pm the witness left the room thus ending the deposition he began to put his papers into his briefcase whitey wilson said ive never heard of this barry whats genetic testing got to do with child custody thats what the tests are intended to find out sindler said this is a new procedure but i think youll find its the coming thing he snapped his briefcase shut shook whiteys limp hand and left the office chapter josh winkler closed the door to his office and started toward the cafeteria when his phone rang it was his mother she was being pleasant always a danger sign josh dear i want you to tell me what have you done to your brother what do you mean done to him i havent done anything i havent seen him in two weeks since i picked him up from jail adam had his arraignment today she said and charles was there representing him uhhuh waiting for the other shoe to drop and adam came to court on time in a clean shirt and tie clean suit hair cut even his shoes polished he pleaded guilty asked to be put in a drug program said he had not used in two weeks said he had gotten a job what yes hes got a job apparently as a limo driver for his old company been working there steadily for the last two weeks charles says hes gained weight i dont believe this josh said i know she said charles didnt either but he swears its all true adams like a new man hes acquired a newfound maturity its like he suddenly grew up its a miracle dont you think joshua are you there im here he said after a pause isnt it a miracle yes mom a miracle i called adam he has a cell phone now and he answered right away and he says you did something to help him what did you do nothing mom we just had a talk he said you gave him some genetic thing an inhaler oh jesus he thought there are rules against this kind of thingserious rules human experimentation without formal application meetings of the approvals board following the federal guidelines josh would be fired in an instant no mom i think he must be misremembering he was pretty whacked out at the time he said there was a spray no mom he inhaled some mouse spray no mom he said he did no mom well dont be so defensive she said i thought you would be pleased i mean youre always looking for new drugs joshua big commercial applications i mean what if this spray gets people off drugs what if it breaks their addiction joshua was shaking his head mom really nothing happened okay fine you dont want to tell me the truth i get it was it something experimental is that what your spray is mom because the thing is josh i told lois graham about it because her eric dropped out of usc hes on crack or smack or mom and she wants to try this spray on him oh jesus mom you cant talk about this and helen stern her daughter is on sleeping pills she crashed her car

would want it and what if it did more could it cure obsessivecompulsive disorders could it cure attentiondeficit disorders the maturity gene had behavioral effects they already knew that adam sniffing that aerosol was a gift from god and his next thought was whats the state of the patent application on acmpd n he decided to skip lunch and head back to the office mom yes josh i need your help of

we only sign out one at a time i need one more now please im under a lot of pressure light rain was falling the streets were slick with oil and shimmered in rainbow patterns beneath low angry clouds he drove down east thirtyeighth street it was an old section of town bypassed by modern rebuilding farther north here houses built in the s and s were still standing josh drove past several woodframe houses in various states of disrepair one had a blue door none had blue shutters he ended up in the warehouse district the street lined with loading docks he turned around and headed back he drove as slowly as he could and finally he saw the house it was not actually on thirtyeighth but on the corner of thirtyeighth and alameda tucked back behind high weeds and ratty bushes an old mattress streaked with rust lay on the sidewalk in front of the house there was a truck tire on the front lawn a battered vw bus was pulled up to the curb josh parked across the street he watched the house and waited chapter the coffin rose into sunlight it looked the same as it had when buried a week earlier except for the clumps of dirt that dropped from the underside this is all so undignified emily weller said she stood stiffly at the graveside accompanied by her son tom and her daughter rachel of course lisa was not there she was thecause of all this but she could not be bothered to see what she had done to her poor father the coffin swung slowly in the air as the graveside workers guided it to the far side of the pit under the direction of the hospital pathologist a nervous little man named marty roberts he should be nervous emily thought if he was the one who had given the blood to lisa without anybodys permission what happens now emily said turning to her son tom was twentysix dressed in a sharp suit and tie he had a masters degree in microbiology and worked for a big biotech company in los angeles tom had turned out good as had her daughter rachel rachel was a senior at usc studying business administration will they take jacks blood here oh theyll take more than blood tom said emily said what do you mean you see tom said for a genetic test like this where there is a dispute they ordinarily take tissues from several organ systems i didnt realize emily said frowning she felt her heart pounding thumping in her chest she hated that feeling soon there was a squeezing feeling in her throat it was painful she bit her lip you all right mom i should have taken my anxiety pills rachel said will this take long no tom said it should be only a few minutes the pathologist will open the casket to confirm the identity of the body then hell take it back to the hospital to remove the tissues for genetic analysis hell return the body for reburial tomorrow or the next day tomorrow or the next day emily said she sniffled wiped her eyes you mean we have to come back here we have to bury jack again this is all soso i know mom he patted her arm im sorry but there is no other way you see they have to check for something called a chimera oh dont tell me she said waving her hand i wont know what youre talking about okay mom he put his arm around her shoulder in ancient mythology chimeras were monsters composed of different animal parts the original chimera had the head of a lion the body of a goat and a serpents tail some chimeras were part human like the egyptian sphinx with the body of a lion the wings of a bird and the head of a woman but true human chimerasmeaning people with two sets of dnahad been discovered only recently a woman needing a kidney transplant had tested her own children as possible donors only to discover that they did not share her dna she was told the children werent hers and was asked to prove she had actually given birth to them a lawsuit ensued after considerable study doctors realized that her body contained two different strands of dna in her ovaries they found eggs with two kinds of dna the skin cells of her abdomen had her childrens dna the skin of her shoulders did not she was a mosaic in every organ of her body it turned out that the woman had originally been one of a pair of fraternal twins but early in development her sisters embryo had fused with hers so she was now literally herself and her own twin more than fifty chimeras had since been reported scientists now suspected that chimerism was not as rare as they had once thought certainly whenever there was a difficult question of paternity chimerism had to be considered it was possible that lisas father might be a chimera but to determine that they would need tissues from every organ of his body and preferably from several different places on each organ that was why dr roberts was required to take so many tissue samples and why it would have to be done at the hospital not at the grave site dr roberts raised the lid and turned to the family on the opposite side of the grave would one of you make the identification please i will tom said he walked around the grave and looked into the coffin his father appeared surprisingly unchanged except the skin was much grayer a dark gray now and the limbs seemed to have shrunk to have lost mass especially the legs inside the trousers in a formal voice the pathologist said is this your father john j weller yes he is yes all right thank you tom said dr roberts i know you have your procedures butif there is any way you can take the tissues hereso my mother doesnt have to go through another day and another burial im sorry marty roberts said my actions are governed by state law were required to take the body to the hospital for examination if you couldjust this oncebend im sorry i wish i could tom nodded and walked back to his mother and sister his mother said what was all that about just asking a question tom looked back and saw that dr roberts was now bent over his body half inside the casket abruptly the pathologist rose up he walked over to speak in toms ear so no one else could hear mr weller perhaps we should spare your familys feelings if we can keep this between us of course then youll yes well do everything here it should take only a few moments let me get my kit he hurried off to a nearby suv emily bit her lip whats he doing i asked him to do all the tests here mom and he said yes thank you dear she said and kissed her son will he do all the tests that he would do at the hospital no but it should be enough to answer your questions twenty minutes later the tissue samples had been taken and placed in a series of glass tubes the tubes were placed in slots in a metal refrigeration case the casket was returned to the grave disappearing into shadow come on emily weller said to her children lets get out of here i need a damn drink as they drove away she said to tom im sorry you had to do that was jacks poor body very decayed dear no tom said not much no oh thats good emily said thats very good chapter marty roberts was sweating by the time he got back to long beach memorial hospital because of what he had done at the cemetery he could lose his license no problem one of those gravediggers could pick up the phone and call the county the county could wonder why marty had broken protocol especially with a lawsuit pending when you take tissues in the field you risk contamination everybody knew that so the county might start wondering why marty roberts would risk that and before long they might be wondering shit shit shit shit he pulled into the emergency parking next to the ambulances and hurried down the basement hallway to pathology it was lunchtime almost nobody was there the rows of stainless steel tables stood empty raza was washing up you dumb fuck marty said are you trying to get us both in jail raza turned slowly what is the problem he said quietly the problem marty said is that i told you take the bones only on the cremations not the burials the cremations is that so fucking hard to understand yeah well thats what i do raza said no thats not what you do because i just came from an exhumation and you know what i saw when i dug the guy up very fucking skinny legs raza very skinny arms in a burial no raza said thats not what i do well somebody took the bones raza headed to the office whats the name of this guy weller what that guy again hes the guy we lost the tissues for right right so the family exhumed him because he wasburied raza leaned over the desk keyed in the patient name he stared at the screen oh yeah youre right it was a burial but i didnt do that one marty said you didnt do that one who the fuck did raza shrugged my brother came in thats all i had an appointment that night your brother what brother nobody else is supposed to be dont sweat it marty raza said my brother comes in from time to time he knows what to do he works at hilldale mortuary marty wiped sweat from his forehead jesus how long has this been going on maybe a year a year only at night marty late night only he wears my lab coat looks like mewe look the same wait a minute marty said who gave that girl the blood sample that girl lisa weller okay raza said so sometimes he makes mistakes and sometimes he works afternoons only sundays marty if i have appointments is all marty gripped the edge of the desk to steady himself he leaned over and breathed deeply some fucking guy who doesnt even work for the hospital gave unauthorized blood to a woman because she asked for it is that what youre telling me not some fucking guy my brother jesus he said she was cute that explains everything come on marty raza said in a soothing tone im sorry about the weller guy i really am but anybody could have made the switch fucking cemetery could have dug him up and taken the long bones gravediggers working as independent contractors could have done it you know it happens all over they got those guys in phoenix and the ones in minnesota and now brooklyn and theyre all in jail now raza okay raza said thats true the thing is i told my brother to do it you did yeah that particular night the weller body came in we had a stat call for bone and the weller guy typed right so do we fill the order or what because you know those bone guys can take their business elsewhere to them now means now supply or die marty sighed yeah when they call stat you should fill it okay then marty slid into the chair and began typing at the keyboard himself however he said if you extracted those long bones eight days ago i dont see any payment transfer to me dont worry its coming the check is in the mail hey i forgot youll get your taste make sure of it marty said he turned to go and keep your fucking brother out of the hospital from now on you understand me sure marty sure marty roberts went outside to move his car from the emergency space he backed out and drove to the doctors only section of the parking garage then he sat in his car for a long time thinking about raza youll get your taste it seemed that raza was starting to believe that this was his program and that marty roberts worked for him raza was handing out the payments raza was deciding who should come in to help raza was not behaving like an employee he was starting to behave like he was in charge and that was dangerous for all sorts of reasons marty had to do something about it and he had to do it soon or losing his medical license would be the least of his problems chapter at sunset the titanium cube that housed biogen research shimmered with a blinding red glare and bathed the adjacent parking lot in a dark orange color as president rick diehl stepped out of the building he paused to put on his sunglasses then walked toward his brandnew silver porsche carrera sc he loved this car which he had bought the week before in celebration of his impending divorce fuck he couldnt believe his eyes fuck fuck fuck his parking spot was empty the car was gone that bitch he didnt know how she had done it but he was sure she had taken his car probably got her boyfriend to arrange it after all the new boyfriendwas a car dealer moving up from a tennis pro bitch he stomped back inside bradley gordon his chief of security stood in the lobbys waiting area leaning over the counter talking to lisa the receptionist lisa was cute that was why rick had hired her goddamn it brad rick diehl said we need to review security tapes of the parking lot brad turned why what is it somebody stole my porsche no shit brad said when did that happen and rick thought wrong guy for this job it wasnt the first time he had thought it lets check the security tapes brad yeah sure of course brad said he winked at lisa and then headed back through the keycardswipe door into a secure area rick followed fuming at one of the two desks in the little glasswalled security office a kid was minutely examining the palm of his left hand he ignored the bank of monitors before him jason brad said in a warning tone mr diehl is here oh shit the kid snapped upright in the chair sorry got a rash i didnt know if mr diehl wants to review the security cameras which cameras are they exactly mr diehl oh jesus rick said the parking lot cameras the parking lot right jason lets start fortyeight hours back and i drove the car to work this morning diehl said right what time was that i got here at seven right jason lets go back to seven this morning the kid shifted in his chair uh mr gordon the parking lot cameras are out oh thats right brad turned to rick the parking lot cameras are out why not sure we think theres a cable problem how long have they been out well two months the kid said two months brad said we had to order parts what parts from germany what parts id have to look it up the kid said we can still use the roof cameras well then show me the roof cameras diehl said right jason bring up the roof cameras it took them fifteen minutes to rewind the digital storage and begin to run it forward rick watched his porsche pull in he watched himself get out and enter the building what happened next surprised him within two minutes another car pulled up two men jumped out broke into his car quickly and drove it away they were waiting for you brad said or following you looks like it rick said call the police report it and tell lisa i want her to drive me home brad blinked at that the problem rick reflected as lisa drove him home was that brad gordon was an idiot but rick couldnt fire him brad gordon surf bum ski bum travel bum recovering alky and college dropout was the nephew of jack watson a principal investor in biogen jack watson had always looked after brad had always seen that he had a job and brad invariably got into trouble it was even rumored that brad had been fucking the wife of the vice president of genesystems up in palo altofor which he was duly firedbut not without a big stink from his uncle who saw no reason why brad should be let go its the vice presidents own fault watson famously said but now no security cameras in the parking lot for two months it made rick wonder what else was wrong with security at biogen he glanced over at lisa who drove serenely rick had hired her to be the receptionist soon after he discovered his wifes affair lisa had a beautiful profile she could have been a model whoever had refined her nose and chin was a genius and she had a lovely body with a narrow waist and perfectly enhanced breasts she was twenty on her summer break from crestview state and she radiated healthy allamerican sexiness everyone in the company had the hots for her so it was surprising that whenever they made love lisa just lay there after a few minutes she seemed to notice his frustration and would begin to move mechanically and make little panting sounds as if she had been told that was what people did in bed sometimes when rick was worried and preoccupied she would talk to him oh baby yes baby do it baby as if that was supposed to move things along but it was only too obvious that she was unmoved rick had done a little research and discovered a syndrome called anhedonia the inability to feel pleasure anhedonics exhibited a flat affect which certainly described lisa in bed interestingly anhedonia appeared to have a genetic component it seemed to involve the limbic system of the brain so there might be a gene for the condition rick intended to do a full panel on lisa one of these days just to check meanwhile the nights he spent with her might have made him insecure if it were not for greta the austrian postdoc in the microbiology lab greta was chunky and had glasses and short mannish hair but she fucked like a mink leaving them both gasping for breath and covered in sweat greta was a screamer and a writher and a howler he felt great afterward the car pulled up at his new condo rick checked for his keys in his pocket lisa said matteroffactly you want me to come up she had beautiful blue eyes with long lashes beautiful lush lips he thought what the hell sure he said come on up he called his lawyer barry sindler to report that his wife had stolen his car you think so sindler said he sounded doubtful yeah i do she hired some guys i have it on security tape you have her on tape no the guys but shes behind it im not so sure sindler said usually women trash a husbands car not steal it im telling you okay ill check into it but right now there are a few things i want to go over with you about the litigation across the room lisa was stepping out of her clothes she folded each item of clothing and placed it on the back of the chair she was wearing a pink bra and pink briefs that skimmed her pubic bone no lace just stretchy fabric that molded smoothly to her smooth body she reached behind her back to release the bra ill have to call you back rick said blondes becoming extinct endangered species to die out in years according to the bbc a study by experts in germany suggests people with blonde hair are an endangered species and will become extinct by researchers predicted that the last truly natural blonde would be born in finland a country that boasts the highest proportion of blondes but the scientists say too few people now carry the gene for blondes to last much longer the researchers hinted that socalled bottle blondes may be to blame for the demise of their natural rivals not every scientist agrees with the prediction of impending extinction but a study by the world health organization does indicate that natural blondes are likely to become extinct within the next two centuries more recently the probability of extinction was reviewed bythe times of london in light of new data about the evolution of themcr gene for blondeness chapter the junglewas completely silent not a buzzing cicada not a hornbill cry nor a distant chattering monkey utterly silentand no wonder hagar thought he shook his head as he looked at the ten camera crews from around the world now clustered in little groups on the jungle floor protecting their lenses from the dripping moisture as they peered upward into the trees overhead he had told them to be silent and indeed nobody was actually talking the french crew smoked cigarettes although the german crew maintained silence the cameraman kept snapping his fingers imperiously as he gestured to his assistant to do this and that the japanese crew from nhk was quiet but beside them the cnn crew out of singapore whispered and murmured and changed lenses clanking metal boxes the british sky tv crew from hong kong had come inappropriately dressed they now had their running shoes off and were plucking leeches from between their toes swearing as they did so hopeless hagar had warned the companies about conditions in sumatra and the difficulty of filming there he had recommended that they send wildlife photography teams experienced in fieldwork no one had listened instead they had rushed the nearest available crews to berastagi and as a result half the teams had talent standing by microphones held ready as if they were waiting to ambush a head of state they had been waiting for three hours so far the talking orangutan had failed to make an appearance and hagar was prepared to bet he never would hagar caught the eye of one of the french team and gestured for him to put out his cigarette the guy shrugged and turned his back to hagar he continued smoking one of the japanese team slipped through the group and stood beside hagar he whispered when does the animal come when its silent so you mean not today hagar made a helpless gesture palms upward we are too many hagar nodded perhaps tomorrow we will come alone all right hagar said just then a ripple of excitement ran through the crews they jumped to their cameras adjusted their tripods and began to film hagar heard the soft murmur of voices in many languages nearby the sky tv man held his microphone close to his lips and spoke in a stage whisper we are standing here deep in the remote jungles of sumatra and there just across the way we see the creature that has aroused the speculation of the entire worldthe chimpanzee that is said to talk and yes even to swear christ hagar thought he turned to see what they were filming he caught a glimpse of brownish fur and a dark head the animal was clearly no larger than two feet tall and almost immediately gave the low moaning call of the pigtailed macaque the camera crews were electrified microphones pointed like so many gun barrels toward the quickmoving animal they heard more moans from the distant foliage obviously a goodsize troop was here the germans recognized it firstnein nein nein the cameraman stepped irritably away from the cameraes ist ein macaque soon the canopy overhead was thrashing as a dozen macaques swung through the area and headed north one of the brits turned to hagar wheres the chimp then orangutan hagar said whatever where is he his voice was impatient he doesnt keep an appointment calendar hagar said is this where hes usually found yes can we put some food out for him something to attract him make some mating call no hagar said no way to attract him is that it thats it we just sit here and hope for the best the journalist glanced at his watch they want tape by noon unfortunately hagar said were in the jungle it happens when it happens its the natural world not if it talks its not natural the cameraman said and i havent got all fucking day i dont know what to tell you hagar said find me the fucking monkey the guy yelled his shout agitated the macaques in the trees made them scamper and moan hagar looked at the others the french cameraman said perhaps quieter for everybody bugger off you miserable fuckwit the brit said easy mate a huge man from the australian crew stepped forward and put his hand on the brit who swung a roundhouse to his jaw the australian caught his hand twisted it and shoved him into his tripod the tripod went down the cameraman sprawling the rest of the british crew jumped the aussie whose teammates rushed to his defense so did the germans soon three crews were swinging wildly when the french tripod fell and their camera was splattered with mud other crews began to fight as well hagar just stared no orang today he thought chapter rick diehlof biogen was changing in the locker room of the bel air country club he had gone there to play a foursome with some investors who might be interested in biogen one guy from merrill lynch his boyfriend and a guy from citibank rick tried to play it casual but he felt some urgency because ever since he watched his wife walk through the lobby with that asshole in white tennis togs he had been in a panic without karens financial backing rick was exposed to the untender mercies of his other major investor jack watson and that wasnt comfortable he needed fresh money out there on the golf course with the sun shining and a soft breeze blowing he fed them his little speeches about the emerging wonders of biotech and the power of the cytokines manufactured by the burnet cell line biogen had acquired it was a real opportunity to get in on a company that was about to grow fast they didnt see it that way the merrill lynch guy said arent lymphokines the same as cytokines havent there been some unexplained deaths from cytokines rick explained that there had been a few deaths some years back because a handful of physicians had jumped the gun on therapy the merrill lynch guy said i was in lymphokines five years ago never made a dime then the citibank guy said what about cytokine storms cytokine storms christ rick thought he blew his putt well he said cytokine storms are really just a speculative concept the idea is that in certain rare circumstances the immune system overreacts and attacks the body causing multiple organ systems to fail isnt that what happened in the influenza epidemic of a few academics have said so but they all work for drug companies that market competing products youre saying it might not be true you have to be very careful about what universities tell you nowadays even about disinformation takes many forms rick said picking up his ball the truth is cytokines are the wave of the future they are fasttracked for clinical testing and product development and they offer the fastest return on investment of all the product lines out there today thats why i made cytokines my first acquisition at biogen and we have just won the litigation that surrounded they wont appeal i heard they were the judges ruling took the fight out of them but havent people died from gene transfers that provoked a cytokine storm havent alot of people died rick sighed not so many what fifty a hundred something like that i dont know the exact number rick said now realizing that this was not going to be a good day and that was an hour before one of them finally said that in his opinion only an idiot would invest in cytokines nice and so he felt exhausted and defeated sitting slumped in the locker room afterward when jack watson suntanned and resplendent in tennis whites dropped onto the bench beside him and said so useful game he was the last person diehl wanted to see not bad any of those guys going to come in maybe well wait and see watson said those merrill lynch guys have no balls their idea of taking a risk is peeing in the shower i wouldnt hold my breath what do you think about the radial genomics business what radial genomics business i guess word hasnt gotten around i figured youd know about it he bent over began to unlace his shoes i just thought youd be concerned he said didnt you have a robbery recently yes my car was stolen from the parking lot diehl said but im going through a divorce and its pretty bitter just now so you assume your wife took your car well yes do you know that for a fact no diehl said frowning i just assumed because thats how it started at radial genomics minor thefts of physical property a lab assistants car from the lot a purse from the company dining room an id card from the bathroom nobody thought much about italthough in retrospect it was someone probing the system for weaknesses they understood that after the massive databank theft databank theft diehl said frowning that was potentially very serious he knew charlie huggins down at genomics hed call him and get the full story of course watson said hugginss not admitting anything happened theyve got an ipo in june and he knows itd kill the offering but the story is last month they had four cell lines taken from their labs and fifty terabytes of network data removed including backups of that data from offsite storage very professional job really set them back no kidding im sorry to hear that of course i put charlie in contact with bdg biological data group its a security outfit im sure you know them bdg diehl couldnt remember that name but it seemed he ought to know it of course i know bdg right theyve done security for genentech wyeth biosyn a dozen other places not that any of those guys will ever talk about what happened but bdg is unquestionably the best when you have problems they come in analyze your security setup id your vulnerabilities and close the network holes quiet fast confidential diehl was thinking the only security problem he had was jack watsons nephew but what he said was maybe i should talk to them which was howrick diehl found himself sitting in a restaurant across from an elegant blonde in a dark business suit she had introduced herself as jacqueline maurer she had short hair and a brisk manner she shook hands firmly and handed him her business card she couldnt have been more than thirty she had the tight body of a gymnast she looked him in the eye when she spoke and was very direct rick glanced at the card it had bdg in blue and beneath in small lettering was her name and a phone number nothing else he said bdg has its offices where many cities around the world and you i am based in san francisco at the moment before that zurich he was listening to her accent he had thought it was french but it was probably german you are from zurich no i was born in tokyo my father was in the diplomatic corps i traveled a lot when i was young i attended school in paris and cambridge i worked first for crdit lyonnais in hong kong because i speak mandarin and cantonese then i went to lombard odier in geneva private bank the waiter came she ordered mineral water a brand he did not know what is that he said its norwegian very good he ordered the same and how did you get to bdg he asked two years ago in zurich rick said what were the circumstances im sorry i cant say a company had a problem bdg was brought in to solve it i was asked to helpsome technical issues i subsequently joined them a company in zurich had a problem she smiled im sorry what companies have you worked with since joining bdg im not free to say rick frowned he was thinking this was going to be a very weird interview if she couldnt tell him anything you realize she said that data theft is a global concern it affects companies around the world estimated losses of one trillion euros annually no company wishes its problems made public so we respect the privacy of our clients rick said what exactly can you tell me think of any large banking or scientific or pharmaceutical firm we have probably done work for them very discreet as we will be discreet with you we will send only three persons to your company including me we will identify ourselves as duediligence accountants for a vc firm that is thinking of investing we will spend one week reviewing your status and then report to you very straightforward very direct he tried to focus on what she was saying but he found her beauty distracting she did not make the slightest sexual gesturenot a glance not a body movement not a touchyet she was immensely sexy no bra he could see that firm breasts beneath a silk blouse mr diehl she said she was staring at him he must have drifted off im sorry he shook his head its been a very difficult time we are aware of your personal stresses she said and also of your security issues i mean the political aspects of your security yes he said we have a head of security a man named bradley he must be replaced immediately she said i know he said but his uncle leave all that to us she said the waiter came back and she ordered lunch as the conversation continued he felt more and more drawn to her jacqueline maurer had an exotic quality and a personal reserve that he found challenging it was not difficult to decide to hire her he wanted to see her again at the end of the meal they walked outside she shook hands firmly when will you start he said immediately today if you like yes good he said all right then we will visit your headquarters in four days not today oh no we start today but we must address your political problem first then we will come a black town car pulled up the driver came around to open the door for her oh and by the way she said your porsche has been located in houston we are quite certain your wife did not take it she slipped into the town car her skirt riding up she didnt pull it down she waved to rick as the driver closed the door as the limousine pulled away rick realized he was breathless chapter it wasjust his way of relaxing brad gordon knew but try explaining that to anyone else a single guy had to be careful these days that was why he always brought a pda and a cell phone whenever he sat in the school bleachers hed pretend to send messages and talk on the cell phone like a busy parent maybe an uncle and he didnt come all the time just once or twice a week during soccer season when he didnt have anything else to do in the afternoon sun the girls running around in their shorts and knee socks looked lovely seventhgraderscoltish legs budding breasts that hardly bounced as they ran some of them had real racks on them and butts that were developed but most retained an endearing childlike quality not yet women but no longer girls innocent at least for a while brad took his usual seat halfway up the bleachers and over to one side as if he were keeping some distance for his private business calls he nodded to the other regulars grandparents and hispanic maids as he took out his pda and set his cell phone on his knee he got his stylus and began to peck at the pda acting as if he were too busy to look at the girls excuse me he looked up an asian girl was sitting down next to him he had never seen her before but she was cute maybe eighteen or so im really really sorry she said but i have to call emilys parentsshe nodded toward one of the girls on the fieldand my battery died could i possibly use your phone just for a minute uh sure he said handing her the phone its just a local call no problem she called quickly saying something about it being the third quarter and they could come and pick her up soon he pretended not to listen she handed the phone back to him her hand touching his hey thanks youre welcome i havent seen you at any of the games before she said do you come a lot not as often as id like work you know bradley pointed to the field which one is emily the center forward she pointed to a black girl on the other side of the field im her friend kelly she extended her hand shook his brad he said nice to meet you brad and youre here with oh my niece is at the dentist today he said i didnt find out until i was already here he shrugged nice uncle she must really appreciate you coming but you dont seem old enough to be the uncle of one of the girls he smiled for some reason he felt nervous kelly was sitting very close her thigh almost touching his he couldnt use his pda or his phone nobody ever sat close like that my parents are so old kelly said my dad was fifty when i was born she stared out at the field i guess thats why i like older guys he thought how old is she but he couldnt think of a way to ask her without being obvious she held her hands up scrutinized them fingers spread wide i just got my nails done she said you like this color yes very good color my dad hates it when i get my nails done he thinks it makes me look too mature but i think its a good color hot love thats the name of the color yes anyway all the girls get their nails done i mean comeon i was getting my nails done in seventh grade and besides i graduated oh you graduated yes last year she had opened her purse and was rummaging around inside it along with the lipstick car keys ipod and makeup cases he noticed a couple of joints wrapped in plastic and a ribbon of colored condoms that made a crackling sound when she pushed them around he looked away so are you in college now no she said i took a year off she smiled at him my grades werent too good having too much fun she pulled out a small plastic bottle of orange juice do you have any vodka not on me he said surprised gin uh no but you could get some right she smiled at him i suppose i could he said i promise id pay you back she said still smiling that was how it started they left the playing field separately several minutes apart bradley went first and he waited in his car in the parking lot watching her walk toward him she was wearing flipflops a short skirt and a lacy top that looked like something you would wear to bed but all the girls dressed that way these days her huge bag banged against her side as she walked she lit a cigarette and then climbed into her car she was driving a black mustang she waved to him he started his engine pulled out and she followed him he thoughtdont get your hopes up but the truth was he already had chapter marilee hunter the pedantic director of the long beach memorial genetics lab liked to hear herself talk marty roberts did his best to appear interested marilee had a fussy pinched demeanor like a librarian in an old forties movie she delighted in catching errors among hospital staff she had called marty to say she needed to see him right away correct me if im wrong on the basics marliee hunter said mr wellers daughter obtains a postmortem paternity test that indicates she and her father do not share dna nevertheless the widow insists weller is the father and demands further testing you provide me samples of blood spleen liver kidney and testes although all have been compromised from funeral home infusation you are looking for a chimera obviously yes or an error in the original test marty said we dont know where the daughter took the blood for testing paternity tests have a nontrivial error rate marilee said especially in online establishments my lab does not make errors we will test all these tissues martyas soon as you provide buccal cells from the daughter right right he had forgotten all about that they needed cheek cells from the daughter to compare dna she may not cooperate in that case marilee said we will test the son and the other daughter but you realize these tissue tests take time weeks of course yes marilee opened the weller patient file which was stamped deceased she thumbed through the pages meanwhile i cant help but wonder about your original autopsy marty jerked his head up what about it it shows here you ran a tox screen that came back negative we do a tox screen in every automobile fatality its routine umm hunter said pursing her lips the thing is we repeated the tox screen in our lab and the result is not negative oh he said controlling his voice thinking what the fuck its difficult to run a tox panel after all the funeral preservatives have been infused but we have experience dealing with that and we determined that the deceased mr weller had elevated intracellular levels of calcium and magnesium marty thought oh boy along with significant hepatic elevation of ethanol dehydrogenase implying a high bloodalcohol level at the time of the accident marty groaned inwardly who had done the original tox screen had fucking raza sent it out or onlysaid that he had and finally marilee said we found trace levels of ethacrynic acid ethacrynic acid marty was shaking his head that makes no sense at all thats an oral diuretic correct the guy was fortysix years old his injuries were severe but even so i could tell he had been in fantastic physical shapelike he was a bodybuilder or something bodybuilders take those drugs if he was taking an oral diuretic that was probably why youre assuming that he knew he was taking it hunter said possibly he didnt know you think somebody poisoned him marty said she shrugged toxic reactions include shock hypotension and coma it could have contributed to his death i dont know how you would determine that you did the post she reminded him thumbing through the chart yes i did wellers injuries were massive crush trauma to face and chest pericardial rupture fracture of hip and femur his air bag didnt open the car was checked of course marty sighed ask the cops not my job it should have been checked look marty said this was a singlecar fatality there were witnesses the guy is not drunk or in a coma he drives straight into a freeway overpass at ninety miles an hour nearly all singlecar fatalities are suicides no surprise the victim turned off the air bag first but you didnt check marty no because we had no reason the guys tox screen was negative and his electrolytes were essentially normal given his injuries and time of death except they werent normal marty our tests came back normal umm she said are you sure the tests were actually done and that was when marty roberts began to think seriously about raza raza had said there was a rush order from the bone bank that night raza wanted to fill the order so raza would not have wanted wellers body to lie in a locker for four or six days while the abnormal tox findings were analyzed ill have to check marty said to make sure the tests were done i think we ought to marilee said because according to the hospital file the deceaseds son works for a biotech company and the wife works in a pediatricians office i assume both have access to biologicals at this point we cant be certain that mr weller wasnt poisoned possible marty said though unlikely she gave him a frosty look ill get right on it marty roberts said walking back to the lab he tried to decide what to do about raza the guy was a menace marty was certain now that raza had never ordered the tox screen which meant that the lab report had been faked either raza had faked it himself xeroxing another report and changing the name or he had an accomplice in the lab who faked it for him probably the latter dear god another person involved in all this and now miss prissypants was on the hunt for wrongdoers because of trace ethacrynic acid ethacrynic acid if john weller really had been poisoned marty had to admit it was a clever choice the guy was clearly vain about his body at his age he had to spend a couple of hours a day in the gym probably took a ton of supplements and shit so it would be hard to prove that he hadnt taken the diuretic himself hard but not impossibleethacrynic acid was a prescription drug there would be paper trails even if he got it from somebody another bodybuilder or a web site in australia all that would take days to check out it wouldnt be long before somebody decided to take another look at the body and discovered the corpse had no arm and leg bones shit fucking raza marty started thinking about a fortysixyearold bodybuilder guy that age grown familyworks his ass off to get a body like that theres only two reasons hes gay or hes got a girlfriend either way hes not humping his wife so how does she feel about that pissed off probably yeah enough to poison the buff hubby couldnt rule it out people killed their spouses for less marty found himself thinking hard about mrs weller recalling everything that had happened at the exhumation he saw it in his mind the tearful widow leaning against her tall son with the dutiful daughter standing beside holding tissues for mom all very touching except the minute the casket came out of the ground emily weller got nervous suddenly the grieving widow wanted everything done fast dont take the body back to the hospital dont take too many tissue samples the woman who had demanded a thorough dna analysis suddenly seemed to change her mind why he wondered had she done that he could think of only one possible answer mrs weller wanted her paternity test but she never imagined the body would be taken back to the hospital for examination she never thought they would take tissues from multiple organs she thought they would just grab a blood sample put the body back in the ground and go home anything more than that seemed to make mrs weller nervous maybe there was hope after all he went into his office and closed the door he needed to call mrs weller it was a delicate call there would be a hospital record of the date and time of the call so why was he calling her he frowned oh yes because he had to collect her dna and that of her children okay fine but why hadnt he collected the dna from the family at the grave site it was just a matter of cheek swabs it would have taken only a moment answer because he thought the dna had already been collected by miss prissypantss lab marty considered that rolled it over in his mind he could find nothing wrong with it he had a perfectly good reason to call he picked up the phone and dialed mrs weller this is dr roberts at memorial hospital marty roberts yes dr roberts a pause is everything all right yes mrs weller i just want to schedule you and your children to come in and give us blood and cheek tissue samples for the dna test we already did that for that woman at the lab oh i see you mean dr hunter im sorry i didnt know there was a pause emily said are you uh doing the tests on jack now yes we do some of the tests here and the lab does some have you found anything yet i mean are you finding what you expected marty smiled as he listened she wasnt asking about paternity she was worried about something else they might find well actually mrs weller yes there does seem to be a slight complication nothing important what kind of a complication the genetics lab found traces of an unusual chemical in mr wellers tissues its probably a lab error contamination what kind of a chemical i only mention it because i know you wanted your husband to have his final rest as soon as possible thats right i want him left undisturbed she said of course i would hate to see his final rest delayed for days or even weeks marty said while questions were asked about this chemical and how it came to be found in his body because even if it is a lab error everything from this point on is required as a matter of law mrs weller i shouldnt even be making this call to you but ii guess i feel responsible as i say id hate to see your husbands final rest delayed for something like a coroners inquest i understand she said of course i would never advise you to do anything but follow the law mrs weller but i sensed that disinterment of your husband was an emotionally exhausting experience for you yesyes and if you didnt want the further emotional exhaustion of reintermentto say nothing of the expenseyou might elect a less emotional solution and less expensive if you were short of fundsyou have the right to order the body cremated i didnt realize that she said im sure you never imagined that taking your husbands body out of the ground would be so traumatic no i didnt you might decide not to put yourself through it again thats just how i feel she said marty thought ill bet you do of course if you knew there was going to be an investigation you would not be permitted to cremate the body certainly i would never suggest you cremate but you might decide on cremation yourself for your own reasons and if that happened soonlater today or tomorrow morningthen it would just be one of those things the body was unfortunately cremated before the inquest was called i understand i have to go he said i appreciate your taking the time to call me she said was there anything else no thats everything he said thank you mrs weller youre welcome dr roberts click marty roberts leaned back in his chair he was very pleased with how that call had gone very pleased indeed just one more thing for the moment remained to be done fifthfloor lab this is jennie jennie this is dr roberts down in pathology i need you to check on a lab result for me is it stat dr roberts no its an old test tox screen that was ordered eight days ago patient name is weller he read off the serial number there was a brief pause he heard the clicking of keys john j weller white male age fortysix yes we did a fullpanel tox screen at three thirtyseven am on sunday may eighth tox screen and uh nine other tests and you kept the blood sample yes im sure we did we keep all tissues these days would you check for me dr roberts these days we keep everything we even keep the heel stick cards whenever a child is born its pku testing required by law but we keep the cards anyway we keep cord blood we keep placenta tissue we keep surgical excisions we keep everything i understand but would you mind checking i can see its registered right here on my screen she said we have the frozen sample stored in freezer locker b itll be taken to the offsite storage at the end of the month im sorry marty said but this involves a potential legal issue would you physically check to make sure the sample is where its supposed to be of course ill send somebody down there and call you back thank you jennie he hung up and leaned back in his chair again through the glass wall he watched raza scrubbing down a steel table in preparation for the next autopsy raza did a thorough job of cleaning marty gave him that the guy was thorough he paid attention to details which meant that he was not above changing the hospital database to indicate the storage of a nonexistent sample either he did it or he had someone do it for him the phone rang dr roberts its jennie yes jennie im afraid i spoke too soon the sample for weller is thirty ccs of venous blood frozen but its not in b it seems to have been misplaced i have a trace on it now i will let you know as soon as its found was there anything else no marty said thank you very much jennie chapter finally ellis levine found his mother on the second floor of the polo ralph lauren store on madison and seventysecond just as she came out of the dressing room she was wearing white linen pants and a colorful wraparound top she stepped in front of the mirror turning this way and that then she saw him hello dear she said what do you think mom he said what are you doing here buying my cruise wardrobe dear but youre not going on a cruise ellis said oh yes his mother said we take a cruise every year do you like the cuffs on the trousers mom she frowned and fluffed her white hair absently and im not sure about this top she said does it make me look like a fruit salad we have to talk ellis said good do you have time for lunch no mom i have to get back to the office ellis was an accountant for an advertising agency he had left the office and hurried uptown because he had gotten a panic call from his brother he walked over to his mother and said quietly mom you cant shop now dont be silly dear mom we had a family meeting ellis and his two brothers had met with his parents the weekend before a difficult painful meeting at the house in scarsdale his father was sixtythree his mother fiftynine the brothers had gone over the finances with them you cant be serious she said to him now i am he squeezed her arm ellis jacob levine she said you are being inappropriate mom dad lost his job i know but we have plenty and his pension tanked its only temporary no mom it is not temporary but we have always had plenty of not anymore you dont not anymore she glared at him your father and i talked after you boys left he said we would be fine all that business about selling the house and the jag thats all ridiculous dad said that he certainly did ellis sighed he was trying to keep you from worrying im not worried and he loves that jag your father always gets a new jag every year ever since you were babies the salespeople were staring at them ellis steered his mother off to one side mom things have changed oh please ellis looked away from his mothers face he could not meet her eyes all his life he had looked up to his parents they were successful stable solid he and his brothers had their ups and downshis older brother was already divorced for gods sakebut his parents were from an earlier generation that was stable you could count on them even when his father lost his job nobody worried true at his age there was no chance he would get another but they had investments stocks land in montana and the caribbean an ample pension there was no reason to worry his parents did not change their lifestyle they continued to entertain travel spend but now he and his brothers were paying the mortgage in scarsdale and trying to sell the condo in charlotte amalie and the town house in vail mom he said ive got two kids in preschool jeff has one in first grade you know what it costs private school in the city aaron has alimony we have lives of our own we cant keep paying for yours you are not paying for me or your father she snapped yes we are mom and i am telling you that you cannot buy these clothes please go back and take them off suddenly to his horror she burst into tears throwing her hands over her face imso afraid she said what will happen to us her body shook he put his arm around her itll be fine he said gently go get dressed ill take you to lunch but you dont have time she was sobbing now you said so yourself its okay well have lunch mom well go to the carlyle itll be fine she sniffled and wiped her eyes she headed back to the dressing room head high ellis flipped open his phone called his office to say he would be late chapter at the congressional biotechnology prayer breakfast in washington dr robert bellarmino waited impatiently for his introduction to end congressman henry waters famously longwinded droned on dr bellarmino is known to all of us he said as a physician with a conscience a man of science and a man of god a man of principle in an age of expediency a man of rectitude in a hedonistic era where anything goes especially on mtv dr bellarmino is not only a director of the national institutes of health but also a lay pastor of the thomas field baptist church of houston and the author of turning points his book of spiritual awakening to the healing message of jesus christ our lord and i knowwell hes looking at me and he has to be at the congressional hearing room in one hour so let me present our man of god and science dr robert a bellarmino handsome and assured bellarmino stepped to the lectern his topic according to the printed schedule was gods plan for mankind in genetic science my thanks to congressman waters and to all of you for coming today some of you may wonder how a scientistespecially a genetic scientistcan reconcile his work with the word of god but as denis alexander points out the bible reminds us that god the universal creator is separate from his creation but that he also actively sustains it moment to moment thus god is the creator of dna which underlies the biodiversity of our planet that may be why some critics of genetic engineering say we shouldnt do it because it involves playing god some ecological doctrines hold a similar view that nature is sacred and inviolable such beliefs are of course pagan bellarmino paused letting his audience savor the word he considered saying more about pagan beliefs particularly the pantheistic nature worship that some called california cosmology but not today he thought press on the bible tells us clearly in genesis and that god has given human beings the task the responsibility to care for the earth and all the creatures on it we are not playing god we are answerable to god if we are not responsible stewards of what god has given us in all its majesty and biodiversity this is our godgiven assignment weare the stewards of the planet genetic engineering uses the tools the creator has given us to carry out good works on the planet unprotected crops are eaten by pests or die of frost and drought genetic modification can prevent that use less crop acreage leave more untouched wilderness and still feed the hungry genetic engineering allows us to distribute the munificence of god to all his creatures as he would want genetically modified organisms make pure insulin for diabetics pure clotting factors for hemophiliacs previously these patients often died of contamination surely for us to create this purity is gods work who will say it is not critics charge that genetic engineering is unnatural because it changes the very essence of an organism its deep and profound nature that idea is greek and pagan but the plain fact is that domestication of plants and animals as practiced for thousands of years does change the deep and profound nature of an organism a domestic dog is no longer a wolf corn is no longer a stunted largely inedible weed genetic engineering is simply another step in this longaccepted tradition it does not mark a radical departure from the past sometimes we hear that we shouldnt change dna period but why not dna is not fixed dna changes over time and dna interacts constantly with our daily existence should we tell athletes not to lift weights because it will change the size of their muscles should we tell students not to read books because that will change the structure of their developing minds of course not our bodies are constantly changing and our dna with them but more directlythere are five hundred genetic diseases that can potentially be cured by gene therapy many of these diseases cause terrible suffering in children early and agonizing death other diseases hang over a persons life like a prison sentence the person must wait for the disease to come and strike him down should we not cure these diseases if we can should we not alleviate suffering whenever we can if so we must change dna simple as that so do we modify dna or not is this gods work or mans hubris these are not decisions to be taken lightly and so it is with that most sensitive subject the use of germ cells and embryos many in the judeochristian tradition are unequivocally opposed to embryo use but such views will eventually conflict with the goal of healing the sick and alleviating suffering not this year not next year but the time will come careful thought and much prayer are needed to arrive at our answer our lord jesus made men walk again does that mean we should not do likewise if we can it is most difficult for we know mans hubris takes many formsnot only overreaching but also stubbornly holding back we are put here to reflect the glory of god in all his works and not the willful ego of man i myself have no answer as i stand before you today i confess i am troubled in my heart but i have faith that god shall lead us in the end to the world that he wants for us i have faith that we shall be guided to wisdom that we shall be cautious and that we shall not be willful in tending his works his suffering children and all the creatures in his creation and for this i pray most humbly in the name of god amen the speech worked of courseit always worked bellarmino had been giving it in various versions for a decade and each time he pushed forward a little harder spoke a little more firmly five years ago he did not use the wordembryo now he did cautiously and briefly he was laying the groundwork he was getting them thinking the thought of suffering made them uneasy so did the thought of enabling the crippled to walk again of course no one knew whether that would ever happen personally bellarmino doubted it ever would but let them think it was coming let them worry they should the stakes were high and the pace of advance rocketfast any research that washington blocked would take place in shanghai or seoul or so paulo and bellarmino skilled and sanctimonious intended to make sure that never occurred nothing in short that would interfere with his lab his research and his reputation he was very good at protecting all three an hour later in the woodpaneled hearing room bellarmino gave testimony before the house select committee on genetics and health the hearing had been called to consider whether it was appropriate for the patent office to grant patents for human genes thousands of such patents had already been issued was this a good idea there is no question we have a problem dr bellarmino said not looking at his notes he had memorized his testimony so he could deliver it while facing the television cameras for greater impact gene patentsby industr y pose a significant problem for future research on the other hand gene patenting by academic researchers causes far less concern since the work is freely shared of course this was nonsense dr bellarmino did not mention that the distinction between academic and industry workers had long since been blurred twenty percent of academic researchers were paid by industry ten percent of academics did drug development more than percent had a product already on the market more than percent had applied for patents in the course of their careers nor did bellarmino mention that he too pursued gene patents aggressively in the last four years his laboratory had filed patent applications covering a wide spectrum of conditions from alzheimers and schizophrenia to manic depression anxiety and attentiondeficit disorders he had secured patents for dozens of genes for specific metabolic disorders ranging from deficiency of lthyroxyhydrocambrine associated with restless leg disorder of sleep to an excess of paraamino dihydroxybenthamine causing urinary frequency in sleep however dr bellarmino said i can assure this committee that gene patenting in general is a system that serves the common good our procedures to protect intellectual property work well important research is protected and the consumer the american patient is the beneficiary of our efforts he did not tell them that more than four thousand dnabased patents were granted each yeartwo every hour of each working day since there were only thirtyfive thousand genes in the human genome most experts estimated that more than percent of the genome was already privately owned bellarmino did not point out that the biggest patent owner was not some industrial giant but the university of california uc owned more gene patents than pfizer merck lilly and wyeth combined they owned more patents than the us government the notion that someone owns part of the human genome strikes some people as unusual bellarmino said but its what makes america great and keeps our innovation strong true it causes the occasional glitch but over time all that will get resolved gene patenting is the way to go at the conclusion of his testimony dr bellarmino left the hearing and headed for reagan airport where he would fly back to ohio to resume his research on the novelty gene research being conducted at an amusement park there bellarmino had a film crew from minutes following him around putting together a segment that would show his varied and important genetic research and also tell his personal story time spent in ohio was a significant part of the final film because there he interacted with ordinary people and as the filmmakers said the human touch was what was really important especially with a man of science and especially on television massachusetts office of university technology transfer government center boston for immediate release scientists grow miniature ear in lab first partial life form at mit possible applications in hearing technology mit scientists have grown a human ear in tissue culture for the first time australian performance artist stelarc collaborated with labs at the massachusetts institute of technology to produce an extra ear for himself the ear was onequarter scale slightly larger than a bottle cap the tissue taken from stelarc was cultured in a rotating microgravity bioreactor while growing mit issued a statement that the extra ear could be considered a partial life formpartly constructed and partly grown the ear fits comfortably in the palm of the hand last year the same mit lab made steaks of frog tissue grown over biopolymer mesh they had also grown steak from the cells of an unborn sheep and they created what they referred to as victimless leather this was skin that had been artificially grown in the laboratory and was suitable for shoes purses belts and other leather goodspresumably with an eye to the robust vegan market several hearingaid companies have opened talks with mit about licensing their earmaking technology according to geneticist zack rabi as the american population ages many senior citizens may prefer to grow slightly enlarged genetically modified ears rather than rely on hearingaid technology a spokesperson for audion the hearingaid company noted were not talking about dumbo ears just a small increase of percent in pinna size would double auditory efficiency we think the market for enlarged ears is huge when lots of people have them no one will notice anymore we believe big ears will become the new standard like silicon breast implants chapter it was a bad day for marty roberts made much worse by a phone call from emily weller dr roberts im calling you from the mortuary it seems theres a problem with my husbands cremation what kind of problem marty roberts said sitting in his office in the pathology lab theyre saying they cant cremate my jack if he contains metal metal what do you mean metal your husband didnt have any hip replacements or war injuries did he no no they are saying that his arms and legs have metal pipes in them and the bones have been removed really marty stood up in his chair and snapped his fingers in the air getting razas attention in the autopsy room outside i wonder how that could have happened i was calling to ask you the same thing i dont know what to say its quite beyond me mrs weller i must say im shocked by then raza had come in the room im going to put you on speaker mrs weller so i can make some notes as we speak are you with your husband at the crematorium now yes she said and they are saying he has lead pipes in his arms and legs so they cant cremate him i see marty said looking at raza raza shook his head he scrawled on a pad we just took one leg put in wood dowel marty said mrs weller i cant imagine how this might have happened there may have to be an inquiry i am concerned that the funeral home or perhaps the cemetery may have done something improper well she said they say he has to be reburied but they also say maybe i should call the police because it looks like his bones were stolen but i dont want to go through the ordeal of the police and everything a long pregnant pause what do you think dr roberts mrs weller he said let me call you right back marty roberts hung up the phone you dumb fuck i told you wood always wood i know it raza said we didnt do that lead job i swear we didnt we always use wood lead pipe marty said shaking his head thats crazy it wasnt us marty i swear it wasnt us must have been those bastards at the cemetery you know how easy it is they hold the ceremony the family shovels a little dirt and everybody goes home coffin isnt buried they dont do the actual burial sometimes for a day or so that night they come in take the bones you know how it works how do you know marty said glaring at him because one time last year woman calls her husband is buried with the wedding ring and she wants the ring wants to know if we took it off him for the autopsy i said we didnt have any effects but i would call the cemetery and they hadnt buried him yet and she got the ring back marty roberts sat down look he said if there is an investigation if they start looking at bank accounts no no trust me thats a laugh marty im telling you we didnt do it no metal pipe no okay i heard you i just dont believe you raza tapped the desk youd better use the prescription with her i will now get out of here while i call her back raza crossed the autopsy room and went into the changing room no one was there he dialed his cell phone jesu he said what the fuck you doing man you put lead pipes in that car crash guy shit martys mad theyre trying to cremate the dude hes got lead pipes in himman how many times do i have to tell you use wood mrs wellermarty roberts said i think you better rebury your husband that seems to be your only option you mean unless i go to the police about the stolen bones i cant tell you what to do he said youll have to decide the best course of action but im sure a prolonged police investigation will turn up a prescription in your name for ethacrynic acid from longwood pharmacy on motor drive that was for my personal use oh i know that its just a question of how ethacrynic acid happened to end up in your husbands body that could be awkward your hospital lab has found traces of that yes but i am sure the hospital would stop the lab work as soon as you dropped your lawsuit against them let me know what you decide to do mrs weller goodbye for now he hung up and looked at the thermometer in the autopsy room the temperature was degrees but marty was sweating i was wondering when youd show up marilee hunter said in the genetics lab she didnt look happy id like to know exactly what part you played in all this in all what he said kevin mccormick called today theres another lawsuit from that weller family this time its the son of the deceased tom weller the one who works for a biotech company whats his suit about i was only following protocol marilee said uhhuhwhats the suit about apparently his health insurance was canceled because his father has the bnb gene for heart disease he does that makes no sense the guy was a health nut he had the gene doesnt mean it was expressed we found it in the tissues and that fact was duly noted the insurance company picked it up and canceled the son as preill how did they get the information its online she said its online this is a legal inquiry she said under state law its all discoverable were required to post all lab findings to an ftp address in theory its passwordprotected but anyone can get to it you put genetic data online not everyones data just the lawsuits anyway the son is saying he did not authorize the release of genetic information about himself which is true but if we release the fathers information as were required by state law to do we also release the sons which were required by lawnot to do because his children share half the same genes as the father one way or another we break the law she sighed tom weller wants his insurance back but he wont get it marty roberts leaned against the desk so where does it stand mr weller sued me along with the hospital legal is insisting this lab no longer touches any material from the wellers marilee hunter sniffed were off the case off the case no more investigation no digging up the body marty roberts felt nothing but relief although he did his best to appear distressed its so unfair he said the way lawyers just run our society doesnt matter its over marty she said its done marty went back to the pathology lab later that day raza he said one of us has to leave this lab i know raza said and im going to miss you marty what do you mean i got a new job he said smiling hamilton hospital in san francisco their diener just had a heart attack i start day after tomorrow so with packing and everything this is my last day on the job marty roberts stared well he said he didnt know what else to say i know you get two weeks raza said but i told the hospital this was a special case and you would understand by the way i have a guy who would be a good replacement hes a friend of mine jesu very good guy works in a funeral home right now so it would not be a big transition ill meet with him marty said but i think maybe i will pick my own guy hey sure no problem raza said he shook hands with marty thanks for everything dr roberts you remembered marty smiled raza turned and left the lab chapter josh winkler was staring out his office window that overlooked the reception area at biogen things were up in the air joshs assistant tom weller had taken the week off because his father had died in a car crash in long beach and now there was a problem with his health insurance as well which meant josh had to work with another assistant who didnt know the routines outside repair crews were fixing the surveillance cameras in the parking lot at the reception desk below brad gordon was again chatting up the beautiful lisa josh sighed what kind of juice did brad have that he could do whatever he wanted including chasing the bosss trim because brad was clearly never going to be fired lisa had beautiful breasts josh are you listening to me yes mom is something on your mind no mom from above he could look down at lisas scoopneck blouse which revealed the smooth contours of her firm breasts undoubtedly too firm but that didnt bother josh everybody and everything was surgically enhanced these days including guys even guys in their twenties were getting facelifts and penile implants then what about it his mother said what sorry mom what were you saying about the levines my cousins i dont know where do they live again scarsdale dear he remembered now the levine family had parents that spent too much mom this is not legal you went and did it to loiss boy you did it yourself thats true but he had only done it because he thought nobody would ever catch him and now that boy has quit drugs and is workingat a bank josh abank as what i dont know a teller or something thats great mom its more than great his mother said this spray of yours could be a real moneymaker josh its the drug everybody wants you could finally make something of yourself nice mom you know what i mean the spray could be great she paused but you need to know how it affects older people dont you he sighed it was true yes thats why the levines might work out for you okay he said ill try to get a canister for both parents yes mom for both he flipped the phone shut he was contemplating what exactly he should do about thisand deciding to do something else entirelywhen he heard the sound of sirens a moment later two blackandwhite police cars pulled up in front of the building four cops piled out of the cars entered the building and walked right up to brad who still leaned on the counter talking to lisa are you bradley a gordon a moment later one spun him around pulled his arms back and handcuffed him holy shit josh thought brad was bellowingwhat the hell is this what the hell is this mr gordon you are under arrest for aggravated assault and rape of a minor what you have the right to remain silent what he was shouting what minor goddamn it i dont know any fucking minor the cop stared at him okay waitwrong word i dont know any minor i think you do sir you guys are making one bigass mistake brad said as they started to lead him away just come with us sir im going to sue your freaking asses off this way sir they said and he went through the doors to the sunlight outside when bradhad gone josh looked over at the other people standing at the railing half the office was looking down talking whispering and at the far end of the balcony he saw rick diehl the head of the company just standing there with his hands in his pockets watching the whole thing play out if diehl was upset he certainly didnt show it chapter brad gordon frowned unhappily at the toilet in his jail cell a strip of damp toilet paper clung to the side of the metal bowl there was a puddle of brownish liquid in front of the seat it had flecks of stuff floating in it brad wanted to pee but he wasnt going to step in that liquid whatever the hell it was he didnt even like to think about it a key turned in the lock behind him he stood the door swung open gordon lets go what is it attorneys here the cop pushed brad down a hallway and into a small room there was an older man in a pinstripe suit and a younger kid in a dodgers jacket sitting at a table with a laptop the kid had thick hornrim glasses which made him look like an owl or harry potter or something they both stood up shook his hand he didnt catch their names but he knew they were from his uncles law firm whats going on here he said the older lawyer opened a folder her name is kelly chin he said you met her at a soccer game you came on to her i came on to her and then you took her to the westview plaza hotel room fourthirteen you dont have this story right and once in the room you had oral genital and anal sex with her and shes sixteen christ he said it never happened the older attorney just stared at him youre in very deep shit my friend im telling you it never happened i see the two of you were photographed on hotel security cameras in the lobby and again in the elevator hallway cameras on the fourth floor recorded you with miss chin as you entered room fourthirteen you were there one hour and seven minutes then she left by herself yeah sure but she was crying in the elevator what she drove to the westview community hospital and reported she had been assaulted and raped she was examined at that time and photographs were taken she had vaginal tears and contusions and anal tears semen was obtained from her rectum it is being analyzed now but she says its yours is it oh shit brad said softly its best to come clean the attorney said tell me exactly what happened that little bitch lets begin with the soccer game where you met her witnesses say that you have been seen at girls soccer games before what are you doing at those games mr gordon oh jesus he said brad told the story but the older man interrupted a lot it took nearly half an hour to explain exactly what had happened and to get to the hotel room you say this girl was turned on to you the attorney said yeah she sure was there was no kissing or signs of affection in the elevator going up no she had that reserved exterior you know the asian thing i see the asian thing unfortunately on the cameras it doesnt appear that she was an entirely willing participant i think she got cold feet he said when was that well we were in the bedroom making out and she was kind of hot but also a little weird you know backing off like shed want to do it and then not want to but mostly she was going for it i mean she put the rubber on me i was ready and she lies back with her legs open and suddenly she goes no i dont want to do it im beside her with my pecker sticking up and i started to get peeved so she says shes really sorry and she goes down on me and i come in the rubber she was as good as a pro but you know young chicks today anyway she takes it off me carries it into the bathroom and i hear her flushing the toilet she comes back with a hot washcloth wipes me down says shes sorry but she thinks she needs to go home now im like hey whatever because by now i figure somethings wrong with this chick shes kinky or something maybe shes a tease i seen that beforeor mentally disturbed in which case i want her the hell out of my room so i say sure go sorry it wasnt comfortable for you and she tells me maybe i should wait a while before i leave i say sure okay she leaves i wait then i left too and i swear he said thats all there was to it she never told you her age no you never asked no she said she was out of high school shes not shes a sophomore oh fuck a silence the attorney thumbed through the pages of the folder in front of him so your story is this girl seduced you at the soccer game you took her to a hotel room she collected your sperm in a condom left you gave herself selfinflicted genital injuries put your sperm up her rectum drove to the hospital and reported a rape is that it it had to be that way brad said thats a difficult story mr gordon but it had to be that way do you have any proof at all that your story is true brad fell silent thinking no he said finally i dont have anything thats going to be a problem the attorney said after brad was taken back to his cell the attorney turned to the young man in the dodgers jacket and hornrim glasses you have anything to contribute here yes he flipped his screen around so the senior man could see a series of jagged black lines audio stress meters remained in the normal range hesitation patterns that indicate prefrontal interference with cognition were absent at all times the guy isnt lying or at least hes convinced it happened his way interesting the attorney said but it doesnt matter theres not a chance in hell well ever get this guy off chapter henry kendall parked in the long beach memorial parking lot and walked into the side door of the hospital carrying a tissue container he went down to the basement to the pathology lab and asked to see marty roberts they had been high school friends in marin county marty came out at once oh my god he said i heard your name and i thought you were dead not yet henry said shaking his hand you look good i look fat you look good hows lynn good kids are good hows janice she took off with a cardiac surgeon a couple of years ago sorry i didnt know im over it marty roberts said life is good been hectic around here but things are good now he smiled anyway arent you a ways from la jolla isnt that where you are now right right radial genomics marty nodded so uhwhats up i want you to look at something henry kendall said some blood okay no problem can i ask whose it is you can ask henry said but i dont know i mean im not sure he handed marty the tissue container it was a small styrofoam case lined with insulation in the center was a tube of blood marty slid the tube out packing label says from the laboratory of robert a bellarmino hey the big time henry he peeled it back looked closely at the older label beneath and whats this a number looks like f i cant quite make it out i think thats right marty stared at his old friend okay level with me what is this i want you to tell me henry said well let me tell you straight off marty said i wont do anything illegal we just dont do things like that here its not illegal uhhuh you just dont want to analyze it at your lab thats right so you drive two hours up here to see me marty he said just do it please marty roberts peered through the microscope then adjusted the video screen so they could both look okay he said red cell morphology hemoglobin protein fractions all completely normal its just blood whose is it is it human blood hell yes marty said what you think its animal blood im just asking well if its certain kinds of ape blood we cant distinguish it marty said chimps and people we cant tell the difference bloods identical i remember cops arrested a guy worked in the san diego zoo covered in blood they thought he was a murderer turned out to be menstrual blood from a female chimpanzee i had that one when i was a resident you cant tell what about sialic acid sialic acids a marker for chimp bloodso you think this is chimp blood i dont know marty we cant do sialic acid at our lab no call for it i think radial genomics in san diego can do it though very funny you want to tell me what this is henry no he said but i want you to do a dna test on it and on me marty roberts sat back youre making me nervous he said you getting into anything kinky no no nothing like that it was a research project from a few years ago so you think this might be chimp blood or your blood yeah or both will you do the dna test for me sure ill take a buccal swab and get back to you in a few weeks thanks can we keep this between us jesus marty roberts said youre scaring me again sure we can keep it between us he smiled ill call you when its done chapter were talking submarines the patent attorney said to josh winkler significant submarines go on josh said smiling they were in a mcdonalds outside town everyone else in the place was under seventeen no chance that word of their meeting would get back to the company the attorney said you had me search for patents or patent applications related to your socalled maturity gene i found five going back to uhhuh two are submarines thats what we call vague patents that are applied for with the intention of letting them lie dormant until somebody else makes a discovery that activates them the classic being cox got it josh said old news thecox inhibitor patent fight was famous in the university of rochester was granted a patent for a gene calledcox which produced an enzyme that caused pain the university promptly sued the pharmaceutical giant searle which marketed a successful arthritis drug celebrex that blocked thecox enzyme rochester said celebrex had infringed on its gene patent even though their patent only claimed general uses of the gene to fight pain the university had not claimed a patent on any specific drug and that was what the judge pointed out four years later when rochester lost the court ruled that rochesters patent was little more than a research plan and ruled that its claim against searle was invalid but such rulings did not alter the longstanding behavior of the patent office they continued to grant gene patents that included lists of vague claims a patent might claim all uses of a gene to control heart disease or pain or to fight infection even though the courts ruled that these claims were meaningless the patent office granted them anyway indeed the grants accelerated your tax dollars at work get to the point josh said the attorney consulted a notepad your best candidate is a patent application from for aminocarboxymuconate methaldehyde dehydrogenase or acmmd the patent claims effects on neurotransmitter potentials in the cingulate gyrus thats the mode of action josh said for our maturity gene exactly so if you owned acmmd you would effectively control the maturity gene because you would control its expression nice huh josh said who owns the acmmd patent the attorney flipped pages patent filed by a company called gencocom based in newton mass filed for chapter in as part of the settlement all patent apps went to the principal investor carl weigand who died in patents passed to his widow she is ill with terminal cancer and intends to give all the patents to boston memorial hospital can you do anything about that just say the word he said do it josh said rubbing his hands chapter rick diehl approached the whole thing like a research project he read a book on the female orgasm two books actually one with pictures and he watched a video he ran it three times and even took notes because one way or another he had sworn he would get a reaction from lisa now he was down there between her legs hard at work for the last half hour his fingers stiff tongue aching knees sorebut lisas body remained completely relaxed indifferent to his every attention nothing the books predicted had occurred no labial tumescence no perineal engorgement no retraction of the clitoral hood no change in breathing abdominal tension moans or groans nothing he was exhausting himself while lisa stared at the ceiling zoned out like she was at the dentists like a person waiting for something vaguely unpleasant to be over and thenwait a minuteher breathing changed only slightly at first but then distinctly sighing and her stomach was tensing rhythmically tensing she began to squeeze her breasts and moan softly it was working rick redoubled his efforts she responded strongly it certainly was workingworkingshe was grunting nowgasping writhing building stronglyher back archedand suddenly she heaved and screamedyes yes brad yessss rick rocked back on his heels as if he had been hit lisa threw her hand over her mouth and twisted away from him on the bed she shuddered briefly then sat up pushed the hair out of her eyes looked down at him her cheeks were flushed her eyes dark with arousal gee she said im really sorry at this awkward moment ricks phone rang lisa lunged for it on the bedside table and handed it to him quickly yes what is it rick snapped he was angry mr diehl its barry sindler here oh hi barry something wrong no no lisa was off the bed getting dressed her back to him well i have good news for you whats that as you know last week your wife refused to undergo genetic testing so we got a court order came through yesterday yes and confronted with the order your wife fled rather than submit to testing what do you mean rick said shes gone left town no one knows where what about the kids she abandoned them well whos taking care of them the housekeeper dont you call your kids every day yeah usually i do but its been busy at work when was the last time you called them i dont know maybe three days ago you better get your ass over to your house right now sindler said you wanted custody of your kids and you got it youd better show the court some parental responsibility and he hung up hed sounded pissed rick diehl leaned back on his knees and looked at lisa i gotta go he said okay she said im sorry see you chapter bail was setat half a million dollars brad gordons attorney paid it brad knew it was his uncles money but at least he was free to go as he was leaving the courtroom the funnylooking kid in the dodgers jacket sidled up to him and said we need to talk about what you were set up i know exactly what happened oh yeah yeah we need to talk the kid had booked an interview room in another part of the courthouse it was just brad and him the kid shut the door flipped open his laptop and waved brad into a chair he turned the laptop so brad could see it someone accessed your phone records how do you know we have contacts with the carrier and they accessed your cellphone records when you were off work why as you probably know your phone contains gps technology that means your location is recorded whenever you make a call he tapped a key graphing your locations over a thirtyday period we find this the map showed red dots all over town but a cluster of dots in one part of westview the kid zoomed in thats the soccer field you mean they knew i went there yeah tuesdays and thursdays somebody knew that two weeks ago so thiswas a setup brad said thats what i have been telling you yes what about the girl were working on her shes no ordinary teenager we think shes a philippine national shes appeared on a webcam masturbating for money anyway whats relevant now are the inconsistencies in her story if you look at the hotel security camerahe tapped another keyyou see here that she turns her body away from the camera while waiting for the elevator opens her purse and touches her face we think she is putting drops or some irritant in her eyes when she gets in the elevator a moment later she is visibly crying but notice as a supposed rape victim crying in the elevator apparently very upset she doesnt go right to the hotel desk to report that she has been raped you have to wonder why not uhhuh brad said eyes narrowing instead she goes straight through the lobby to her car security camera in the parking lot shows her driving away at fiveseventeen pm depending on traffic the drive from the hotel to the hospital is between eleven and seventeen minutes she doesnt show up until sixohfive pm fortyfive minutes later what was she doing during that time injuring herself no weve had several experts look at the pictures from the hospital and the nurse who examined her was an experienced trauma nurse the pictures are very clear we think she met an accomplice who produced the injuries for her you mean some guy yes then he would have left his dna right he wore a condom so at least two people were involved in this actually we think a whole team was involved the kid said you were very professionally set up who would do this to you brad had been thinking about that while he sat in his jail cell and he knew there was only one answer rick the boss hes wanted me out of there ever since i started and you were trying to boff his girl hey i wasnt trying i was doing it and now youre suspended from your job youve got nine months minimum before you go to trial and youre looking at ten to twenty if you lose in court nice the kid flipped his laptop shut and stood so what happens now well work on the girl if we can get a prior history maybe some video of her on the internet we can press the da to drop the charges but if this thing goes to trial its not good fucking rick yeah you owe him buddy he headed for the door just do yourself a favor okay stay away from that soccer field fromscience magazines news of the week neanderthal man too cautious to survive scientist finds a species death gene an anthropologist has extracted a gene from neanderthal skeletons that he says explains the disappearance of this sub species people dont realize that neanderthals actually had larger brains than the modern cromagnon men they were stronger and tougher than cromagnons and they made excellent tools they survived several ice ages before the cromagnons came on the scene why then did neanderthals die out the answer according to professor sheldon harmon of the university of wisconsin was that the neanderthals carried a gene that led them to resist change neanderthals were the first environmentalists they created a lifestyle in harmony with nature they limited game hunting and they controlled tool use but this same ethos also made them intensely conservative and resistant to change they disapproved of the newcomer cromagnons who painted caves made elaborately decorated tools and who drove whole herds of animals over cliffs causing species extinction today we consider the cave paintings a wondrous development but the neanderthals regarded them as so much graffiti they saw it as prehistoric tagging and they viewed the elaborate cromagnon tools as wasteful and destructive of the environment they disapproved of these innovations and they stuck to the old ways eventually they died out as a species however harmon insists that the neanderthals bred with the modern cromagnons they unquestionably did because we have identified this same gene in modern human beings this gene is clearly a neanderthal remnant and it promotes cautious or reactionary behavior many of the people who today wish to return to the glorious past or at the very least to keep things as they are are driven by this same neanderthal gene harmon described the gene as modifying dopamine receptors in the lateral posterior cingulate gyrus and in the right frontal lobe theres no question about its mode of action he said harmons claim has provoked a firestorm of criticism from academic colleagues not since e o wilson published his sociobiology thesis two decades ago has such furious controversy erupted according to columbia university geneticist vartan gorvald harmon was injecting politics into what should be a purely scientific inquiry not at all harmon said the gene is present in both neanderthals and modern humans its action has been confirmed in scans of brain activity the correlation between this gene and reactionary behavior is indisputable its not a matter of politics of left or right its a question of basic attitudewhether you are open to the future or fearful of it whether you see the world as emergent or deteriorating we have long known that some people favor innovation and look positively toward the future while others are frightened of change and want to halt innovation the dividing line is genetic and represents the presence or absence of the neanderthal gene the story was picked up in the new york times the next day neanderthal gene proves environmental agenda fears of rampant technology justified stuttgart germany anthropologist sheldon harmons discovery of a neanderthal gene which promotes environmental preservation proves the need for sound environmental policy said greenpeace spokesperson marsha madsden the fact that neanderthals lost the battle for the environment should serve as a warning to us all like the neanderthals we will not survive unless we take radical global action now and in the wall street journal caution killed the neanderthals is the precautionary principle lethal oppose free markets at your peril club for growth notes bysteveweinberg an american anthropologist has concluded that neanderthals died from a genetic predisposition to resist change in other words neanderthals applied the precautionary principle so dear to illiberal reactionary environmentalists that was the view of jack smythe of the american competitive institute a progressive washington think tank smythe said the extinction of neanderthals serves as a warning to those who would halt progress and take us back to a life that is nasty brutish and short chapter in the corner of the office the tv showed sheldon harmon professor of anthropology and selfproclaimed discoverer of the neanderthal gene being assaulted during a lecture with a bucket of water poured over his head onscreen the event was shown repeatedly in slow motion the water sloshing over a skinny bald guy who looked oddly amused see hes smiling rick diehl said this is all a publicity stunt to promote the gene probably josh winkler said they had cameras there to catch it exactly diehl said and aside from the publicity this guy is getting for his damn neanderthal gene he is claiming a mode of action closely related to our maturity gene activation of the cingulate gyrus and so on could steal our thunder i doubt it josh said dozens of genes work in the cingulate gyrus even so rick said i think we ought to announce soon i want to get the maturity gene out there josh said with all due respect rick wed be premature youve tested the gene in rats thats gone well yes but its not exactly newsworthy showing baby rats pushing turds in a cagethat wont make the evening news diehl nodded slowly yeah true we need something better josh said whats the urgency the board ever since brad got arrested his uncle has been pissed seems to think brads problems are our fault anyway hes pressing us to put the company on the map with a big announcement fine but were not there yet i know but what if we justwhat if we justsay that were ready to start human testing josh shivered i wouldnt he said i mean we havent even applied to the fda for i know stage one so lets make the application rick you know what a stageone application requires its a stack of research data and forms ten feet high thats just to start the process and we would have to lay out a timetable of milestones rick waved his hand impatiently i know im saying we just announce it you mean announce it when were not doing it no announce that were going to do it but thats my point josh said itd be months before we could even file reporters dont care we just say that biogen research in westview village is ready to begin stageone testing and is in the process of making an application to the fda for the maturity gene yes to be inserted with a retrovirus vector and what will we say the maturity gene does josh said i dont know we could say thatit cures drug addiction josh felt a chill why would we say something like that well it makes sense dont you think rick diehl said the maturity gene promotes balanced mature behavior which is by definition addictionfree behavior i guess you guess diehl turned to face him lets show a little enthusiasm here josh im telling you this is a great idea whats the recidivism rate in addictiontreatment programs today eighty percent ninety percent a hundred percent most rehab doesnt work for most people thats a fact how many addicts are there in this country christ we got more than a million in prisons so how many are on the streets twenty million thirty million josh was beginning to sweat that would be like eight or ten percent of the population sounds about right id bet ten percent of the american population is addicted to drugs when you include alcohol ten percent easy which makes the maturity gene a hell of a product josh was silent what do you have to say josh uh i guess its a good idea you wouldnt be fucking with me would you no josh said of course not you wouldnt be holding out on me striking out on your own no he said why would you say that your mother called today diehl said oh shit shes very proud of what youve done and doesnt understand why i havent given you a promotion josh sank into a chair he felt drenched in cold sweat so what are you going to do he said rick diehl smiled give you a promotion of course he said did you keep records of the dosages you administered chapter in a glasswalled conference room on madison avenue the marketing firm of watson amp naeme was engaged in naming a new product the room was packed with hip young people in their teens and twenties all casually dressed as if they were attending a rock concert instead of a dry lecture from a professor standing at a lectern wearing a bowtie and talking about a gene calleda b the professor was now showing graphs of enzymatic action black squiggly lines on white the kids sagged slumped in their seats thumbed their blackberrys only a few tried to focus on the material sitting in the back of the room the team leader a psychologist named paul gode spun his finger in the air signaling the professor to wind it up bowtie looked surprised but he concluded smoothly in summary the professor said our team at columbia university has isolated a gene that promotes social harmony and group cohesion it does this by activating the prefrontal cortex of the brain an area known to be important in determining belief and credence we have demonstrated this gene action by exposing experimental subjects to both conventional and controversial ideas controversial ideas produce a distinctive prefrontal signature whereas conventional ideas create a diffused activationwhat you might call a warm glow thus subjects with the gene show a marked preference for conventional thinking and familiar ideas they also show a preference for group thinking of all kinds they like television they like wikipedia they like cocktail parties they like small talk they like to be in agreement with people around them our gene is an important force for social stability and civilization since its the gene that promotes conventional wisdom we call it the conventional gene the audience sat silent stunned finally one of them said you call itwhat the conventional gene jesus thats terrible suicide forget it or the professor said quickly we call it the civilizing gene groans in the room the civilizing gene thats worse worse horrible argh jump off a bridge the professor looked nonplussed whats wrong with that name civilization is a good thing isnt it of course said the team leader coming forward from the back paul gode stepped up to the lectern the only trouble is nobody in this country wants to think of themselves as joiners or civilizers just the oppositewere all rugged individualists were all rebels were antiestablishment we stand out we strike out we do our own thing go our own way the herd of independent minds somebody called it nobody wants to feel theyre not a rebel nobody wants to admit that they just want to fit in but in truth everybody does want to fit in the professor said at least almost everybody about ninetytwo percent of people have the conventionalwisdom gene the real rebels lack it and they are stop right there the team leader said holding up his hand just stop you want to make your gene valuable that means your gene creates something people want to possesssomething exciting and desirable conventional wisdom is not exciting or desirable its mundane its buttered toast with grape jelly thats what the group is telling you he gestured to a chair you might want to take a seat professor gode turned to the group which now looked slightly more alert all right people blackberrys away lets hear it how about the smart gene someone said good but inaccurate simplicity gene good direction social gene oversell socializing gene therapeutic wisdom gene wise gene wise gene good very good rightthinking gene too maoist or buddhist come on wake up here party gene fun gene stonewashed genes hiphugger genes happy gene liveitup gene gode was frowning and held up his hand again redirect he said back up rewind rethink whats our problem this gene is really the gene for conventional wisdomthe conventionalwisdom genebut we dont want to say that so whats good about conventional wisdom what does embracing conventional wisdom do for a person quickly now makes you belong you dont stand out you think like everybody else reduces friction you fit in means you read the times nobody looks at you funny makes your life simpler no arguments feel safe expressing an opinion everybody agrees with you youre a good person you feel good makes you comfortable gode snapped his fingers and pointed good conventional thinking makes us comfortableyes no surprises no distress in the world out there everything is constantly changing every minute its not a comfortable place and everybody wants to feel comfortable right old pair of shoes comfortable sweats favorite chair comfortable gene comfy gene comfort gene the comfort gene warm and fuzzy gene warm gene happy gene friendly gene easy gene soothing gene smooth gene calm gene balm gene this went on for a while until finally there were nine candidates scrawled on the whiteboard a furious argument ensued as names were deleted though of course all the names would be concepttested with focus groups in the end everybody agreed the winner would be the comfort gene lets test it in the field gode said professor tell us where is this gene going commercially it was too early to say the professor explained they had isolated the gene but they didnt yet know the full range of diseases associated with it however since nearly everybody in the world carried the comfort gene they believed that many people probably suffered from genetic anomalies involving the gene for example people who were overly desirous of joining the majoritythat might prove to be a genetic disorder and people who felt depressed when they were alone by themselvesconceivably another disorder people who joined protest marches went to sports games who sought out situations where they would be surrounded by lots of likeminded peoplea potential genetic disorder then there were people who felt obliged to agree with whomever they were with no matter what was saidyet another disorder and what about people who were afraid to think for themselves fear of independence from the surrounding group lets face it thats a lot of people the professor said nobody thinks for themselves if they can help it you mean all this behavior is going to be considered pathological someone asked any compulsive behavior is pathological the professor answered but positive behavior protest marches our position the professor said is that we are on the verge of identifying a range of disease states all related to sociability these genetic anomalies involving the comfort gene had not yet been definitively established but columbia university had applied for a patent on the gene itself meaning that the gene would have increasing value as disorders involving it were identified with certainty gode coughed weve made a mistake these are all disorders of sociability this needs to be the sociability gene and so it was from business online scientists find gene for sociability is the tendency to sociability inherited scientists at the morecomb laboratories at columbia university believe that it is they report they have found the gene that regulates it and they have applied for a patent on the gene oped commentary from the new york times a sociability gene when will this nonsense stop columbia university researchers now claim to have found a sociability gene whats next the shyness gene the reclusive gene the monastic gene how about the getoffmyback gene in truth researchers are taking advantage of the publics lack of knowledge about how genes actually operate no single gene controls any behavioral trait unfortunately the public doesnt know that they think theres a gene for eye color for height and for hair curliness so why not one for sociability geneticists will not speak out they all sit on the boards of private companies and are in a race to identify genes they can patent for their own profit will this ever stop evidently not from grist online feeling sociable thats patented the research office of columbia university has applied for a patent on a gene that it says controls sociability does this mean that one day everyone on antidepressants or add medications or anxiety medications will have to pay a royalty to columbia reportedly pharmaceutical giants in switzerland are bidding frantically to license the gene chapter the factfinding hearing of the bioethics review panel at the national institutes of health in bethesda was carefully structured to feel collegial and unintimidating everyone sat at the same long table in the thirdfloor conference room of the main building a familiar setting with notices for upcoming seminars tacked on the walls and the aging coffeemaker sputtering in the corner the coffee was notoriously awful nobody drank it the six scientists on the review panel dressed a little more formally for this meeting most had put on jackets one even wore a tie but they sat slouched and relaxed as they talked to the person being investigated dr ronald marsh fortyone who sat at the same table with them and how exactly did this twelveyearold girl die dr marsh was a professor of medicine at the university of texas in austin she suffered from congenital transport factor deficiency ctfd was a fatal genetic deficiency this girl was treated with diet and renal dialysis from the age of nine months she showed some stunting of growth but no mental retardation she and her family both wanted this procedure in the hope that she could have a normal life not be tied to a machine forever as you know its not much of a life especially for a young kid those around the table listened impassively and looking to the future marsh continued we all recognized that she could not be maintained through adolescence hormonal changes were already affecting her metabolism she was certain to die in the next three to four years it was on that basis that we undertook the procedure to insert the gene into her body he paused the risks were known one of the scientists said these risks were discussed with the family of course in detail and with the patient yes she was a bright girl she was the one who first proposed the procedure she read about it on the internet she understood that the risks were enormous did you give the family an estimate of those risks we did we told them the chances of success were on the order of three percent and they went ahead anyway yes the daughter pushed them she felt that if she was going to die anyway she might as well take the chance she was a minor yes marsh said but she was also the one with the disease you got signed releases yes weve read those releases some of us felt the releases struck an unrealistic positive tone minimizing risks the releases were prepared by the hospitals legal department marsh said and you will notice the family signed off on a statement that they had been fully informed of the risks what they were told is also noted in the patients charts we would not have proceeded without fully informed consent during that speech the head of the panel dr robert bellarmino slipped into the room and eased into a seat at the end of the table so you did the procedure dr marsh was asked we did what vector was used modified adenovirus infusion in combination with standard barlow immunosuppression protocols and the outcome she spiked a fever almost at once it ran to degrees she had signs of multiple organ system failure on the second day liver and kidney function did not recover she died on the third day there was a short silence if i may make a personal comment marsh said this has been a shattering experience for all of us at the hospital and shattering for me personally we had cared for this girl since infancy she wasbeloved by everyone on the staff she was a little ray of sunshine whenever she came into the clinic we attempted this risky procedure because she wanted it but at night i ask myself was it the right thing to do and i always feel i had an obligation to take that risk with the patient if that was what she wanted she wanted life how could i deny her that chance a cough but uh your team had no experience with gene transplantation no we considered sending her to another team why didnt you no one else would do the procedure what did that tell you marsh sighed have any of you seen a patient die of ctfd their kidneys necrose their livers shut down their bodies swell turn a purplegray color they cant breathe theyre in agony they take days to die should i have waited for that to happen to this lovely girl i didnt think so there was another moment of silence at the table the mood was distinctly disapproving why is the family suing now marsh shook his head i havent been able to speak to them they have stated in court documents that they werent informed they were marsh said look we all hoped it would work everybody was optimistic and parents cant really accept the truththat a three percent success rate means ninetyseven percent of the patients die ninetyseven percent its almost certain death they knew that and when their hopes were dashed they felt cheated but we never misled them after dr marshleft the room the panel met in closed session of the seven members on the panel six were outraged they argued that marsh was not telling the truth now and had not told the truth before they said he was reckless they said that he gave genetics a bad name which the field now had to overcome they spoke of the wild west of his going off halfcocked they were clearly moving toward censure of marsh and recommending that he lose his license and his ability to apply for government grants the head of the panel rob bellarmino said nothing for a long time finally he cleared his throat i cant help but reflect he said that these arguments were exactly the same as those first voiced when christiaan barnard did the first heart transplant but this isnt the first of anything going off halfcocked not seeking proper authorization liable to lawsuits let me remind you bellarmino said what barnards original statistics were his first seventeen patients died almost immediately he was called a killer and a charlatan but now more than two thousand heart transplants are performed every year in this country most live five to fifteen years kidney transplants are routine lung and liver transplants that were considered outrageous a few years ago are accepted now every new therapy passes through a hazardous pioneering stage and we will always rely on courageous individuals such as dr marsh to take risks but so many rules were broken what would you do to dr marsh bellarmino said the man cant sleep at night you see it in his face his beloved patient died under his care what greater punishment will you inflict and who are you to tell him he did the wrong thing the ethics rules none of us looked in that little girls eyes none of us knew her life her pain her hopes marsh did he knew her for years will we now stand in judgment of him the room was quiet in the end they voted to censure the university of texas legal staff with no penalty for dr marsh bellarmino had turned them around one of the panel said later it was classic rob bellarmino talking like a preacher subtly invoking god and somehow getting everyone to push the envelope no matter who got hurt no matter what happened rob can justify anything hes brilliant at it but in fact before the final vote was taken bellarmino had left the room because he was late for his next meeting from the bioethicspanel meeting bellarmino returned to his lab where he was meeting with one of his postdocs the kid had come to him from cornell medical center where he had done remarkable work on the mechanisms that controlled chromatin formation normally the dna of a cell was found inside the nucleus most people imagined dna in the form of a double helix the famous twisting staircase discovered by watson and crick but that staircase was only one of three forms that dna might take within the cell dna could also form a single strand or a more condensed structure called a centromere the particular form was dependent on the proteins associated with the dna this was important because when dna was compressed its genes were unavailable to the cell one way to control genes was to change the chromatin of various sections of dna so for example when genes were injected into new cells steps also had to be taken to keep the chromatin in an available form through the use of added chemicals bellarminos new postdoc had done breakthrough research on methylation by certain proteins and their effect on chromatin structure the kids paper genomeprotein accessibility control and adenine methyltransferase was a model of clear writing it was bound to be important and would make the kids reputation bellarmino was sitting in his office with the kid who was looking eager as bellarmino scanned the paper excellent just excellent he tapped the paper i think this work does great credit to the lab and of course to you thank you rob the kid said and you have the seven coauthors in place and i am appropriately high on the list bellarmino said third the kid said but if you felt second position was warranted actually i am remembering a conversation we had a few months back in which we discussed possible methylation mechanisms and i suggested to you yes i remember the very mechanisms you elucidate here i feel rather strongly that i should be the lead author the kid blinked umm he swallowed that ensures the paper will be cited more often bellarmino said which is important for a contribution of this magnitude and of course the exact listing is just a formality as second author you will be understood to have done the footwork here the fillinthegaps labor from your standpoint its really a winwin you will get greater citations and you will see much larger grants coming your way he smiled i can assure you of that your next work will be entirely independent and in a year or two ill be supporting you for a lab of your own i uh the kid gulped i understand good good make these changes shoot it back to me and ill submit it to nature i think this deserves a better platform than science which is a little down at the heels these days ill call over to nature and make sure the editor understands the importance of this paper and see that we get immediate publication thanks rob the kid said anytime rob bellarmino said wet art on display transgenic organisms in galleries living creatures for sale in london south african artist laura cinti displayed a transgenic cactus that contained human genetic material and grew human hairs cinti said the cactus with all its hairs coming out is showing all the desires all the signs of sexuality it doesnt want to be trapped it wants to be released when asked about the public reaction to the cactus cinti said bald men are particularly interested artist marta de menezes created modified butterflies where one wing was different from the other she said people were very shocked at first they didnt think it was a good idea she said that next she would make the stripes of zebra fish vertical instead of horizontal so the fish would look more like zebras these changes would be inherited finnish artist oron catts grew pig wings in culture from pig bone marrow stem cells he said the artists team played music to the pig cells to make them grow we downloaded lots of pig songsand played them to the cells he said the cells seemed to do better with music chicagobased artist eduardo kac created a transgenic rabbit called alba that glowed green the fertilized egg of an albino rabbit was injected with gpf the gene for green fluorescent protein from a pacific northwest jellyfish the animal that grew from the egg now glows a furor resulted kac observed that the rabbit does make some people uncomfortable but noted that gpf is a common research tool and has been injected into yeast molds plants fruit flies mice and cow embryos kac said he was looking forward to making a fluorescent dog alba died prematurely of unknown causes so did the transgenic cactuses in the first transgenic pet was offered for sale to the public a redfluorescing zebra fish it was created by dr zhiyuan gong in singapore and licensed to a company in austin texas it was marketed under the name glofish after two years of review by federal and state agencies which concluded the fish were safe so long as they were not eaten chapter madame bondthe firstgrade teacher said your son is a delightful boy but he is having trouble with his math addition comes slowly to him subtraction is even more difficult however his french is much improved i am glad to know that gail bond said the move here from london was hard for him but i must admit im surprised about his difficulty with math because you are a scientist you mean i suppose so yes i work at the institut national here in paris she said and evans father is an investment banker he works all day with numbers well the teacher replied as you are a geneticist i am sure you know everything is not in the genes sometimes the child of a great artist cannot draw but i must tell you that it does your son no good if you do his homework for him sorry gail bond said do his homework well this must be the case the teacher said you or someone else in the household i dont understand evans homework is always perfect but when there is a quiz in class he does poorly evidently someone is doing his homework for him gail bond shook her head but i dont know who it could be she said my son comes home from school and only the housekeeper is there when he does his homework she doesnt speak much french i return at five and by then his homework is finished or so he tells me you do not review it no never he says there is no need well the teacher said he is getting help from somewhere she took out the homework sheets and spread them on the desk you see every problem on every sheet perfect i see gail said staring at the papers and these stains there were small green and white stains on the paper droplets often these marks are present usually at the bottom of the sheet as if something were spilled i think i know who is helping him gail bond said who its someone from the lab she unlocked the door to the apartment and heard gerard call hello sweetheart exactly as her husband did hi gerard she said whats new with you i need a bath ill see that you get one she said she walked into the hallway where gerard was standing on his perch he was a transgenic african grey parrot now two years old while he was a chick he had received a variety of human genes so far with no noticeable effect you look good baby ive missed you gerard said again imitating her husbands voice thank you she said i have a question for you gerard okay if you insist tell me what is the answer to thirteen minus seven i dont know she hesitated what is the answer to thirteen take away seven that was how evan would phrase it promptly the bird said six eleven take away four seven twelve take away two ten she frowned twentyfour take away eleven oh oh oh the parrot said moving on the perch you try to trick me thirteen whats oneohone take away seventy thirtyone but we never get so many numbers most is two numbers we gerard said nothing he ducked his head rhythmically he began to sing i love a parade gerard gail said does evan ask you for help oh sure and then a perfect imitation of evan hey gerrie come and help me its too hard for me then a whine its too haaard gail said i have to get the video camera am i a star am i a star yes she said you are a star he spoke in an american drawl were sorry were late but we had to pick up our son hank what movie is that she said the same drawl now jo just take it easy youre not going to tell me are you she said i need a bath gerard said before any filming you promised me a bath gail bond hurried off to get the camera during his first year of life gerard showed little effect from the human transgenes that had been injected into him as a chick by yoshi tomizu and gail bond in the laboratory of maurice grolier at the institut national in paris this was not surprising the successful injection of transgenes was a tricky business and required dozens even hundreds of attempts before it worked properly that was because multiple conditions had to be fulfilled for the gene to work in a new environment first the gene had to be incorporated correctly into the existing genetic material of the animal sometimes the new gene was incorporated backward which had a negative effect or none at all sometimes it was inserted into an unstable region of the genome and triggered lethal cancer in the animal that was rather common furthermore transgenics was never a matter of inserting a single gene researchers also had to insert the associated genes necessary for the primary gene to function for example most genes had insulators and promoters the promoters might make proteins that switched off the animals own genes to allow the new addition to take over or they might enhance the workings of the injected gene itself the insulators kept the new gene separated from the genes around it they also made sure the new genetic material remained available within the cell complex as they were these considerations didnt take into account the further intricacies that might arise from messenger rnas within the cell or from the genes that controlled translation and so on in reality the task of injecting a gene into an animal and making it work more closely resembled debugging a computer program than it did any biological process you had to keep fixing the errors making adjustments eliminating unwanted effects until you got the thing working and then you had to wait for downstream effects to show up sometimes years later that was why the lab felt that gail bond should take gerard home and keep him as a pet for a while to see if any positive or untoward effects showed up home rearing was especially important because african greys were highly intelligentgenerally considered as intelligent as chimpanzeesand with a far greater capacity for language using sign language or computer keyboards a few nonhuman primates had mastered about words but that was merely average for a grey parrot some grey parrots had as many as a thousand words so they needed the kind of interaction and stimulation found in a human environment they couldnt be left in an animal holding facility around mice and hamsters or they would go mad from lack of stimulation indeed animal activists believed that many grey parrot pets were mentally disturbed as a result of insufficient interaction it was as if they had been held in solitary confinement year after year a grey parrot required at least as much interaction as a human being more some scientists argued gerard was fingertrained as a chick and began talking early he already had quite a vocabulary when gail who was thirtyone and married to an investment banker brought him home to her apartment as gerard came into the living room he said hey nice place gail way to go he had unfortunately picked up bits of american slang from watching television at the lab im glad you like it gerard she said i was just saying that the parrot said you mean you dont like it i mean i was just saying that okay just an observation right fine she immediately made notations in a logbook gerards speech might prove highly significant one of the goals of the transgenic experiment was to see to what extent scientists could modify the intelligent behavior of nonhuman animals primates were offlimitstoo many rules and regulationsbut people werent so sensitive about parrots there were no ethics committees to supervise parrot experimentation so the grolier lab worked with african greys among the things they were looking for was evidence of selfawareness in the parrots speech parrots were known to be selfaware they recognized themselves in mirrors but speech was different parrots did not reliably use the word i when referring to themselves generally when they used the personal pronoun it was to quote someone else the question was whether a transgenic parrot would ever use the word i unambiguously and it seemed to gail bond that gerard had just done exactly that it was a good start her husband richard showed little interest in the new arrival his sole reaction was to shrug and say dont look for me to clean that cage gail said she would not her son was more enthusiastic evan immediately began to play with gerard putting him on his finger and later on his shoulder as the weeks went on it was evan who spent time with the bird who bonded with it who kept it on his shoulder much of the time and it seemed who got help from the bird gail set up the video camera on a tripod adjusted the frame and turned the camera on some grey parrots were able to count and there were claims that some had a rudimentary understanding of the concept of zero but none was able to do arithmetic except gerard she had to work very hard to conceal her excitement gerard she said in her calmest voice i am going to show you a picture and i want you to tell me what it says she showed him one sheet from her sons homework folding it to reveal a single problem she covered the answer with her thumb i did that already but what does this say gail asked pointing to the problem it was fifteen minus seven you have to say it can you look at this paper and tell me the answer she said you have to say it gerard repeated he was hopping from one leg to the other on his perch getting irritable he kept glancing at the camera gerard didnt like to be embarrassed gail said it says fifteen take away seven eight the parrot replied at once gail resisted the temptation to turn to the camera and shriek with delight instead she calmly turned the page to reveal another problem now what is twentythree take away nine fourteen very good and now you promised me gerard said i promised you yes you promised me he said you know he meant the bath ill do that later she said for now you promised me sulky tone my bath gerard i am going to show you this next problem and ask you what is twentynine take away eight i hope they are watching he said in an odd voice theyll see theyll see and theyll know and theyll say why she wouldnt even harm a fly gerard now please pay attention what is twentynine take away eight gerard opened his mouth the front doorbell rang gail was close enough to the bird to know that gerard himself had made the sound he could imitate all sorts of sounds perfectlydoorbells phone rings toilet flushes gerard please the sound of footsteps a click and a creak as the front door opened you look good baby ive missed you gerard said imitating her husbands voice gerard she began a womans voice oh richard its been so long silence sound of kissing gail froze watching gerard the parrot continued his beak hardly moving he was like a tape recorder the womans voice are we alone yes her husband said kid doesnt come back until three and what about uh gail is at a conference in geneva oh so we have all day oh god more kissing two pairs of footsteps crossing the room her husband you want something to drink maybe later baby right now all i want is you gail turned and switched the video off gerard said now will you give me my bath she glared at him the bedroom door slammed shut creaking of the bedsprings a woman squealing laughing more creaking springs stop it gerard gail said i knew you would want to know he said i hate that fucking bird her husband said later that night they were in the bedroom thats not the point she said youll do what you want richard but not in my house not in our bed she had already changed the sheets but even so she didnt want to sit on the bed or go near it she was standing on the other side of the room by the window paris traffic outside it was just that one time he said she hated it when he lied to her when i was in geneva she said do you want me to ask gerard if there were other times no leave the bird out of it there were other times she said what do you want me to say gail im sorry all right im sorry i dont want you to say anything she said i want you not to do it again i want you to keep your fucking women out of this house right fine i will do that can we drop it now yes she said we can drop it now i hate that fucking bird she walked out of the room if you touch him she said ill kill you where are you going out she met yoshi tomizu at his apartment they had begun their affair a year before and had resumed it again in geneva yoshi had a wife and child in tokyo and he would be returning there in the fall so it was just a friendship with privileges you feel tense he said stroking her back he had wonderful hands did you argue with richard not really a bit she looked at the moonlight coming in through the window surprisingly bright then what is it yoshi asked im worried about gerard why richard hates him really hates him oh he wouldnt do anything its such a valuable animal he might she said she sat up in bed maybe i should go back yoshi shrugged if you think im sorry she said he kissed her lightly do what you think is best gail sighed youre right she said im being silly she slid back down under the covers tell me i am being silly please chapter brad gordon clicked off the tv and yelled its open come in it was noon he was lounging in his thirdfloor apartment in sherman oaks watching the ball game and waiting for the pizza delivery guy but to his surprise the door opened and in walked the bestlooking woman he had ever seen in his life she had elegance written all over herthirtyish tall slim european clothing heels that were not too high sexy but in control brad sat forward in his lounger chair and ran his hand over his chin feeling the stubble im sorry he said i didnt expect any visitors your uncle mr watson sent me the woman said walking directly toward him he hastened to stand my name is maria gonzales she had a slight accent but it didnt sound spanish more german im involved with the firm that does your uncles investment work she said shaking his hand brad nodded inhaling her light perfume he wasnt surprised to hear she worked for uncle jack the old guy surrounded himself with goodlooking extremely competent businesswomen he said what can i do for you ms gonzales nothing for me she answered smoothly looking around the apartment for a place to sit she decided to remain standing but you can do something for your uncle well sure anything i dont need to remind you that your uncle has paid your bail and will be assuming the cost of your legal defense since the charge involves sex with a minor the defense will be difficult but i was set up she raised her hand its none of my affair the point is this your uncle has helped you many times over the years now he needs your helpconfidentiallyin return uncle jack needs my help he does okay sure in strict confidence right yes you will discuss this with no one ever right understood word of this must never get out if it did you would lose your legal defense funding youd spend twenty years in prison as a child molester you know what that means yes he wiped his hands on his trousers i understand no screwups this time brad okay okay just tell me what you want me to do your favorite company biogen is about to announce an important new discoverya gene that cures drug addiction its the first step toward a huge commercial product and it will attract a lot of financing your uncle currently holds a large position in the company and he does not want his position diluted by additional investors he wants them scared off yes by some bad news coming out of biogen what kind of bad news at the moment maria gonzales said biogens most important commercial product consists of a cell line the burnet line which the company bought from ucla the cell line produces cytokines important in cancer treatment yeah contamination of those cell lines would be disastrous she reached into her purse and brought out a small plastic bottle of a wellknown brand of eye drops the bottle contained clear liquid she unscrewed the cap and put a single drop of liquid on the tip of each finger of her other hand got it yes he said one drop on each finger let it dry okay go into biogen your swipe cards still work check the database for storage locations and research lockers containing the burnet line the storage number is on this card she handed him a small card with the number bgoxqd there are frozen samples and there are live invitro incubators you go to each one andjust touch them just touch them brad looked at the bottle what is that stuff nothing that will hurt you but the cells wont like it the security cameras will record me card swipes are recorded theyll know who did it not if you go in between one and two am the systems are down for backup no theyre not yes they are this week only brad took the plastic bottle from her and turned it over in his hand you realize he said they have offsite storage for that cell line too just do what your uncle asks she said and leave the rest to him she closed her purse and one final thing do not call or contact your uncle about this or any other matter he wants no record ofany contact with you clear clear good luck and on behalf of your uncle thank you she shook his hand again and left no blonde extinction after all bbc reported false story absent fact check no who study no german study a bad blonde joke for years the world health organization who today denied it had ever conducted or published any study predicting the extinction of the blonde hair gene according to the un group spokesman who has no knowledge of how these news reports originated but would like to stress that we have no opinion on the future existence of blondes according to the washington post the bbc story stemmed from a german wire service account that story in turn was based on an article published two years before in the german womens magazine allegra which cited a who anthropologist as its source but no record of the anthropologist exists the story would never have run said georgetown media professor len euler if even minimal factchecking had been done by bbc editors some media observers noted that news organizations no longer check anything we just publish the press release and move on one reporter observed another reporter speaking on condition of anonymity said lets face it its a good story accuracy would kill it further inquiry by the urban legend site snopescom uncovered multiple versions of the extinct blonde story going back years to the time of abraham lincoln in every instance scientific validity was claimed to bolster the storys credibility a typical example dates from blondes doomed to vanish from earth major woodruff sounds their deathknellits science the girl with the golden tresses is doomed and within six hundred years blondes will be extinct the fate of the blonde was foretold today by major c e woodruff in a lecture at the association for the advancement of science at columbia university clearly blondes will not become extinct but neither will the news stories that predict their demise since the stories have been repeated for a century and a half with no basis whatsoever said professor euler chapter henry kendalls wife lynn designed web sites for a living so she was usually at home during the day around three in the afternoon she got an odd call this is dr marty roberts at long beach memorial a voice said is henry there hes at a soccer game she said can i take a message i called his office and i called his cell but there was no answer dr robertss tone made it sound urgent ill see henry in an hour lynn said is he all right dr roberts oh sure hes finehes perfectly fine just ask him to call me would you lynn said she would later when henry came home she went into the kitchen where he was getting cookies and milk for their eightyearold son jamie lynn said do you know somebody at long beach memorial hospital henry blinked did he call this afternoon who is he hes a friend of mine from school a pathologist what did he say nothing he wanted you to call him back she somehow managed not to ask her husband what it was all about okay he said thanks she saw henry glance at the phone in the kitchen then turn on his heel and walk into the little study that they both shared he closed the door she heard him speaking softly on the phone she couldnt make out the words jamie was eating his snack tracy their thirteenyearold was playing her music very loud upstairs lynn yelled up the stairwell a little less noise please tracy didnt hear her there was nothing to do but go upstairs and tell her when she came back down henry was in the living room pacing i have to take a trip he said okay where i have to go to bethesda something at the nih the national institutes of health were in bethesda henry went there a couple of times a year for conferences yes she watched him pace henry she said are you going to tell me what this is about i just have some researchi just have to check on somethingi justim not sure you have to go to bethesda but youre not sure why well of course im sure its um its to do with bellarmino robert bellarmino was the head of genetics at nih and no friend of her husband what about him i have to uh deal with something he has done she sat down in a chair henry she said i love you but i am really confused here why arent you telling me look he said i dont want to talk about it i just have to go back there thats all just for a day are you in trouble i said i dont want to talk about it lynn i have to go back okaywhen tomorrow she nodded slowly all right do you want me to book ive already done it i have it handled he stopped pacing and went over to her look he said i dont want you to worry thats pretty hard under the circumstances its fine he said its just something i have to take care of and then itll be taken care of and that was all he would say lynn had been married to henry for fifteen years they had two children together she knew better than anyone that henry was prone to nervous tics and flights of fancy the same imaginative leaps that made him such a good researcher also made him a bit of a hysteric he was inclined to frequent selfdiagnoses of dreaded diseases he visited his doctor every couple of weeks and telephoned more often than that he was plagued by aches itches rashes and sudden fears that woke him in the middle of the night he dramatized small concerns a minor accident was a brush with death the way henry told it so even though his behavior about a trip to bethesda was odd she was inclined to regard it as probably minor she glanced at her watch and decided it was time to defrost the spaghetti sauce for dinner she didnt want jamie eating too many cookies or it would spoil his appetite tracy had turned her music up louder again in short daily events took over and pushed henry and his odd trip from her mind she had other things to do and she did them chapter henry kendall left dulles airport and drove north on heading toward the primate facility in lambertville it was almost an hour before he saw the chainlink fence and the guardhouse behind the double gates beyond the gates he saw huge maple trees that obscured the complex of buildings farther back lambertville was one of the largest primateresearch facilities in the world but the national institutes did not publicize that fact or its location partly because primate research was so politically charged and partly out of concern for vandalism by activists henry pulled up at the outer gate pushed the button and said henry kendall and gave his code number he hadnt been here for four years but the code was still good he leaned out of the car so the camera could see his face clearly thank you dr kendall the gate opened he pulled through to the second gate the first closed behind him a guard came out and checked his id he vaguely remembered the guy didnt expect you today dr kendall he handed him a temporary swipe card they want me to clear out some things from my storage locker yeah ill bet things are getting tighter around here since you know yeah i know he meant bellarmino the inner gate opened and henry drove through he passed the admin building and went straight to the holding facilities the chimps were formerly in building b he assumed they still were he opened the outer door and swiped his card on the inner door he went down a corridor to the b monitor room it was a room filled with display screens showing all the chimpanzees on two floors of the facility there were about eighty animals of various ages and sexes the onduty veterinary assistant was there in khaki uniform but also there was rovak the head of the facility he must have been notified by the front gate rovak was fifty steel gray hair military bearing but he was a good scientist i wondered when youd show up rovak said he shook hands he seemed friendly you got the blood yes henry nodded fucking bellarmino had a cow rovak said he hasnt been out here yet and we think we know why what do you mean henry said lets take a walk rovak said henry consulted his paper im looking for female f no rovak said youre looking for the offspring of female f hes this way they started down a side corridor this led to a small training facility that was used for shortterm teaching experiments with animals you keep him here have to youll see they came into the training facility at first glance it looked like a kindergarten play room brightly colored toys scattered around blue carpet on the floor a casual visitor might not notice that the toys were all made of highimpact durable plastic there were observation glass walls on one side mozart was playing over the speakers likes mozart rovak said shrugging they went into a smaller room off to the side a shaft of sunlight came down from the ceiling there was a fivebyfive cage in the center inside sat a young chimpanzee about the size of a fouryearold child the chimps face was flatter than usual and the skin was pale but it was clearly a chimp hello dave rovak said hello the chimp said his voice was raspy he turned to henry are you my mother he said henry kendall could not speak his jaw moved but no words came out rovak said yes he is dave he turned to kendall his name is dave the chimp was staring at henry just staring silently sitting there in the cage holding his toes in his fingers i know its a shock rovak said think how people here felt when they found out vet almost passed out nobody had any idea he was different until out of the blue he came up negative on a sialic acid test they repeated it because they assumed it was an error but it wasnt an error and then he started talking about three months ago henry sighed he speaks well rovak said has a little trouble with verb tenses but nobody has been instructing him in fact hes been kept away from everybody around here you want to let him out kendall hesitated is he uh chimps could be nasty and aggressive even small ones might be dangerous oh sure hes very docile hes not a chimp right he opened the cage come on out dave dave came out hesitantly like a man released from jail he seemed frightened to be outside the cage he looked at henry am i going to live with you i dont know henry said i dont like the cage he reached out and took henrys hand can we go play they went into the playroom dave led henry said is this his routine right he gets about an hour a day mostly with the vet sometimes me dave went over to the toys and began to arrange them into shapes a circle then a square im glad you came to see him rovak said i think its important whats going to happen to him what do you think this is illegal as shit henry a transgender higher primate you know hitler tried to cross a human and a chimp and stalin tried you might say they defined the field lets see hitler stalin and now an american researcher at the nih no way my friend so what are you this represents an unauthorized experiment it has to be terminated are you kidding youre in washington rovak said and youre looking at political dynamite nih funding is already flat from the current administration itd be cut to a tenth if word of this got out but this animal is extraordinary henry said but unauthorized thats all anybody cares about rovak shook his head dont get sentimental you have a transgenic experiment that was never authorized and the rules state explicitly that any experiment not approved by the boards will be terminated and there will be no exceptions what will you uh morphine drip intravenously wont feel a thing rovak said you dont need to worry well take good care of him and after incineration there will be no evidence at all that it ever happened he nodded to dave why dont you go play with him for a while hed like the company hes bored with all of us they played a sort of impromptu game of checkers using toy blocks jumping over each other while they both sat on the floor henry noticed detailsdaves hands which were the proportion of human hands his feet which were prehensile like a chimps his eyes which had flecks of blue and his smile which was not quite human not quite apelike this is fun dave said thats because you are winning henry didnt really understand the rules but he thought he should let dave win thats what he had done with his own kids and then he thought this is my own kid he wasnt thinking clearly he knew that he was acting by instinct he was aware of watching intently as dave was returned to his cage of the way he was locked in with a keypress padlock of the way let me shake his hand again henry said open it up again look rovak said dont do this to yourself or him i just want to shake his hand rovak sighed unlocked the lock henry watched he shook daves hand and said goodbye are you coming tomorrow dave said soon henry said dave turned away not looking at him as henry left the room and closed the door listen rovak said you ought to be grateful youre not being prosecuted and thrown into jail now dont be foolish about this well handle it you go on about your business okay henry said thank you he asked to stay at the facility until it was time for his plane home they put him in a room with a terminal for researchers he spent the afternoon reading about dave and all the annotations in his file he printed the entire file out he walked around the facility went to the bathroom several times so that the guards would be accustomed to seeing him on the monitors rovak went home at four stopping in to say goodbye on his way out the vets and guards changed shifts at six at fivethirty pm henry went back into the training facility and headed straight for daves room he unlocked the cage hello mother dave said hi dave would you like to take a trip yes dave said okay do exactly what i say researchers frequently walked with the tamer chimps sometimes holding their hands henry walked with dave down the training corridor moving at a casual pace ignoring the cameras they turned left into the main corridor and headed for the exterior door he swiped the inner door led dave through and opened the outer door as he expected there were no alarms the lambertville facility had been designed to keep intruders out and to keep animals from escaping but not to prevent researchers from removing animals indeed for a variety of reasons researchers sometimes needed to remove animals without going through extensive red tape and so it was that henry put dave on the floor of the backseat of his car and drove to the exit gate it was now shift change with a lot of cars coming and going henry turned in his swipe card and his badge the guard on duty said thanks dr kendall and henry drove out into the rolling green hills of western maryland youre driving backlynn said why its a long story why henry i have no choice i have to drive henry she said youre behaving very strangely you know that it was a moral issue what moral issue i have a responsibility what responsibility goddamn it henry honey he said its a long story you said that believe me i want to tell you everything he said i really do but itll have to wait until i get home dave said is that your mother lynn said whos in the car with you nobody who was talking that raspy voice i really cant explain it he said youll just have to wait until i get home and then youll understand henry gotta go lynn love to the kids he hung up dave was watching him with patient eyes was that your mother no somebody else is she angry no no are you hungry dave soon okay well find a drivein but meantime you have to wear your seat belt dave looked puzzled henry pulled over and clipped the seat belt around him it didnt really fit he was only slightly larger than a child i dont like it he started to tug at the harness you have to wear it no sorry i want to go back cant go back dave dave stopped struggling he stared out the window its dark henry ran his hand over the animals head feeling the short fur he could feel dave relax when he did it its okay dave everything is going to be fine now henry pulled back onto the road and headed west chapter what are you talking about lynn kendall said staring at dave who sat quietly on the living room couch this monkey is your son well not exactly not exactly she paced around the living room what the hell does that mean henry it had been a normal saturday afternoon their teenage daughter tracy was in the backyard sunbathing and talking on the telephone and not doing her homework her brother jamie was splashing in the wading pool lynn had spent the day inside the house finishing a job on a tight deadline shed been working hard on it for the last three days so she was surprised when she opened the front door and her husband had walked in leading a chimpanzee by the hand henry is he your son or not he is in a way in a way thats clear im glad you cleared that up she spun glared at him an awful thought occurred to her wait a minute wait just a minute are you trying to tell me that you had sex with a no no her husband said holding up his hands no honey nothing like that it was just an experiment just an experiment jesus an experiment what kind of experiment henry the monkey sat curled up holding his toes in his hand looking up at the two adults try to keep your voice down henry said youre upsetting him im upsetting him im upsetting him hes a fucking monkey henry ape ape monkeyhenry what is he doing here why is he in our house wellim notactually hes come to live with us hes come to live with us out of the blue you have a monkey son and you never knew about it he just suddenly arrives with you great that makes sense that makes perfect sense anybody can understand that why didnt you tell me henry oh never mind let it be a surprise im driving home with my monkey son but ill tell you about it when i walk in the door thats great henry im glad we had all those therapy sessions about intimacy and communications lynn im sorry youre always sorry henry what are you going to do with him are you going to take him to the zoo or what i dont like the zoo dave said speaking for the first time i didnt ask you lynn said you keep out of this and then she froze she turned she stared he talks yes dave said are you my mother lynn kendall didnt actually pass out but she began to tremble and when her knees buckled henry caught her and helped her to sit in her favorite chair facing the coffee table next to the couch dave didnt move he just stared with wide eyes henry went into the kitchen and got his wife some lemonade and brought it back to her here he said drink this i want a damn martini honey those days are over lynn was aa i dont know what days are what she said she was staring at dave he talks the monkey talks ape im sorry i upsetted you dave said to her thank you uh his name is dave henry said he doesnt always get his tenses right dave said sometimes people get upsetted by me they feel bad dave she said this is not about you honey you seem to be very nice this is about him she jerked her thumb toward henry the asshole what is ahsole hes probably never heard swearing henry said you need to watch your language how do you watch language dave said its noises you cant watch noises im very confused lynn said sinking into her chair its an expression henry said a figure of speech oh i see dave said there was a silence his wife sighed henry patted her arm do you have any trees dave said i like to climb trees at that moment jamie came into the house hey mom i need a towel he broke off and stared at the chimp hello dave said jamie blinked recovered fast hey neat he said im jamie my name is dave do you have any trees to climb sure a big one come on jamie headed for the door dave looked questioningly at lynn and henry go ahead henry said its okay dave leapt off the couch and scampered to the door following jamie how do you know he wont run away lynn said i dont think he will because hes your son the door banged shut outside they heard their daughter screaming and shrieking what is that they heard jamie say hes a chimp and were climbing trees whered you get him jamie hes dads does he bite they couldnt make out jamies answer but through the window they saw the tree branches swaying and moving giggles and laughter from outside what are you going to do with him lynn said i dont know henry said well he cant stay here i know that i wont have a dog in the house i certainly wont have an ape i know and besides theres no room for him i know this is really a mess she said he said nothing just nodded how the hell did this happen henry she said its a long story he said im listening when the human genome was decoded he explained scientists discovered that the genome of a chimpanzee was nearly identical to that of a man all that separates our two species he said is five hundred genes of course that number was deceptive because human beings and sea urchins also shared a lot of genes in fact nearly every creature on the planet shared tens of thousands of the same genes there was a great underlying unity of all life genetically speaking so that created a lot of interest in what had caused the differences in different species five hundred genes werent a lot yet a great chasm seemed to separate chimps from human beings many species can crossbreed to produce hybridslions and tigers leopards and jaguars dolphins and whales buffalo and cattle zebras and horses camels and llamas grizzlies and polar bears sometimes mate in the wild producing grolars so there was a question of whether chimps and humans could hybridize to make a humanzee the answer seems to be no somebody has tried many times starting back to the s but even if hybridization were impossible henry explained one might still insert human genes directly into a chimp embryo to create a transgenic animal four years back when henry was on sabbatical at the national institutes of health he was studying autism and he wanted to know which genes might account for the difference in communication abilities between people and apes because chimps can communicate he said they have a range of cries and hand gestures they can organize themselves into very effective hunting parties to kill small animals so they have communication but no language like severe autistics thats what interested me and what did you do his wife asked in the laboratory under a microscope he inserted human genes into a chimpanzee embryo his own genes including the genes for speech she asked actually all of them you inserted all your genes look i never expected the experiment to go to term he said i was looking to retrieve a fetus a fetus not an animal if the transgenic fetus survived eight or nine weeks before it spontaneously aborted there would be enough differentiation that he could dissect the fetus and advance his understanding of speech in apes you expected the fetus to die yes i was just hoping that it would carry long enough and then you were going to cut the fetus up dissect it yes your own genes your own fetusyou did this in order to have something to dissect she was looking at him like he was a monster lynn it was an experiment we do this kind of thing all the he broke off no point going there look he said the genes were close at hand i didnt have to get anybodys permission to use them it was an experiment it wasnt about me it is now she said the question henry was trying to answer was fundamental chimps and humans had split from a common ancestor six million years ago and scientists had long ago noticed that chimpanzees most closely resemble human beings at their fetal stage this suggested that human beings differed from chimps in part because of difference in intrauterine development human development could be thought of as having been arrested at the chimp fetal stage some scientists felt it was related to the eventual growth of the human brain which doubled in the first year after birth but henrys interest was in speech and for speech to occur the vocal cords had to move down the throat from the mouth creating a voice box that happened in humans but not in chimps the entire developmental sequence was immensely complicated henry hoped to harvest a transgenic fetus and from that to gain some knowledge of what drove the change in human development that made speech possible at least that was his original experimental plan why didnt you remove the fetus as you intended she asked him because that summer several chimps contracted viral encephalitis and the healthy chimps had to be moved away for quarantine they were taken to different labs around the east coast i never heard anything about the embryo i implanted i just assumed that the female had spontaneously aborted in a quarantine facility somewhere and the fetal material was discarded i couldnt inquire too closely because what you did was illegal well thats a strong word i assumed the experiment had failed and it was over guess not no he said i guess not what happened was that the female gave birth to a fullterm infant and the two were returned to bethesda the infant chimp appeared to be normal in every respect its skin was somewhat pale especially around the mouth where there was no hair but chimps varied widely in the amount of pigmentation they showed no one thought anything of it as the infant grew it appeared less normal the face which was originally flat did not bulge outward with age the facial features remained rather infantile still nobody thought to question the babys appearanceuntil they discovered on a routine blood exam that the infant tested negative for the gc sialic acid enzyme since all apes carry this enzyme the test was obviously wrong and repeated it again came back negative the infant chimp did not have the enzyme absence of that enzyme is a human trait henry said sialic acid is a kind of sugar no humans have the gc form of sialic acid all apes have it but this infant didnt right so they did a dna panel and quickly realized that the infant didnt have the usual percent difference in genes from a human being it had many fewer differences and they started to put it all together and tested the chimps dna against everybody who had worked in the lab yes and found he matched your dna yes bellarminos office sent me a sample a few weeks ago i guess to give me a headsup whatd you do took it to a friend for analysis your friend in long beach yes and bellarmino he just doesnt want to be responsible when word gets out he shook his head i was driving home and i was just west of chicago when i got a call from this guy rovak at the animal lab and he says youre on your own with this one pal thats their attitude my problem not theirs lynn frownedwhy isnt this a major discovery shouldnt this make you famous around the world youve created the first transgenic ape the problem henry said is that i can be censured for it or even put in jail because i didnt have permission from the committees that oversee primate research because the nih now forbids transgenic work on any animal other than rats because all the antigm whackos and frankenfood nuts will be up in arms over this because the nih doesnt want any involvement in this and will deny any knowledge of it so you cant tell anyone where dave came from thats a problem henry because youll never keep him a secret i know he said miserably tracys on the phone right now telling all her friends about the cute little ape in her backyard yes her girlfriends will be over here in a few minutes how are you going to explain dave to them because after the girls will come the reporters lynn glanced at her watch in one two hours max whatll you say i dont know maybeill say the work was done in another country in china or in south korea and they sent him here and what will dave say when the reporters talk to him ill ask him not to talk to them reporters wont leave this alone henry theyll be camped outside the house with long lenses theyll be circling in helicopters overhead theyll be on the next plane to china or korea to talk to the person who did this and when they dont find that personthen what she stared at him then walked to the door she looked into the backyard where dave was playing with jamie the two of them yelling and swinging through the trees she was silent for a moment then she said you know his skin really is quite pale i know his face is flat almost human what would he look like with a haircut and so was born gandlerkreukheim syndrome a rare genetic mutation causing short stature excessive body hair and facial deformities that yielded a rather apelike appearance the syndrome was so rare it had only been documented four times in the last century first in an aristocratic hungarian family in budapest in two children were born with the syndrome described in the medical literature by an austrian physician dr emil kreukheim the second appearance occurred in an inuit child born in northern alaska in a third child a girl was born in so paulo in but she died of infection a few weeks after birth a fourth child in bruges belgium in was briefly seen by media but subsequently vanished his whereabouts were now unknown i like this lynn said she was typing on her portable whats the name of that hairy syndrome excessive familial hairiness hypertrichosis henry said right she kept typing so gandlerkreukheim is relatedto hypertrichosis actuallycongenital hypertrichosis langinosa and thereve only been fifty cases reported in the last four hundred years are you writing that or reading that both she sat back okay she said thats all i need for now you better go tell dave tell him what that hes human he probably thinks he is anyway okay as henry walked to the door he said you really think this will work i know it will lynn said california has laws against invading the privacy of special children many of these kids have serious deformities theyve got enough challenges growing up and going to school without the added burden of media exposure big fines if the media do it they wont maybe he said its the best we can do for now she said she was typing again he paused at the door if dave is a human being he said we cant very well send him to a circus oh no lynn said no no dave lives with us hes part of our family nowthanks to you we have no choice henry went outside tracy and her friends were standing beneath the tree pointing into the branches look at the monkey look at him no henry said to them hes not a monkey and please dont embarrass him dave suffers from a rare genetic syndrome and he explained it to them as they listened wideeyed jamie had a trundle bed that he used when friends slept over lynn pulled it out and dave slept on it alongside jamie his last words were its very soft and almost immediately he was asleep while lynn ran her hands soothingly through his hair jamie said this is so neat mom its like having a brother it is isnt it she said she turned out the light and closed the door when she looked back in on them later she found that dave had twisted his sheets into a circle around him making a kind of nest in the middle of the bed no tracy said standing in the kitchen hands on hips no he cannot live in our house how could you do this to me dad do what you know what the other kids are going to say hes a monkey that looks like a person dad and he sounds like you with a stuffy nose she was near tears hes related to you isnt he he has your genes now tracy i amso embarrassed she started to sob i had a chance to be a freshman cheerleader tracy he said im sure you will this was my year dad its still your year not if i have a monkey in my house she went to the refrigerator for a coke came back still sobbing that was when her mother walked in hes not a monkey lynn said firmly he is an unfortunate young boy who suffers from a serious disease oh sure mom go look it up yourself google it i will still sobbing she walked over to the computer henry glanced at lynn then moved to look over his daughters shoulder hypertrichosis variant

staring at the screen there have only been four or five cases in all of history that poor kid hes very special henry said i hope you will treat him better now he put his hand on tracys shoulder and glanced back at his wife all this in a couple of hours ive been busy she said chapter there were fifty reporters in the conference room of shanghais hua ting hotel sitting at row after row of green feltcovered tables the tv cameras were all at the back of the room and sitting on the floor up front were the cameramen with their bulky telephoto lenses strobes flashed as professor shen zhihong head of the institute of biochemistry and cell biology in shanghai stepped up to the microphones wearing a black suit shen was a distinguishedlooking man and his english was excellent before becoming the head of ibcb he had spent ten years in cambridge massachusetts as a professor of cell biology at mit i do not know whether i am telling you good news or bad news he said but i suspect it may be disappointing news nevertheless i will set certain rumors finally to rest for some reason he explained rumors of unethical research in china began to circulate after the th east asia joint symposium on biomedical research at shaoxing city in zhejiang province i have no idea why shen said the conference was quite ordinary and technical in nature however at the next conference in seoul reporters from taiwan and tokyo were asking pointed questions i was therefore advised by byeong jae lee the head of molecular biology at seoul national university to address this matter directly he has some experience with the power of rumors there were knowing chuckles in the audience shen was referring of course to the worldwide scandal that had erupted around the eminent korean geneticist hwang woosuk therefore i shall come directly to the point he said for many years there have been rumors that chinese scientists were attempting to create a hybrid of human and chimpanzee according to the story back in a surgeon named ji yongxiang fertilized a female chimpanzee with human sperm the chimp was in the third month of pregnancy when outraged citizens stormed his lab and ended the experiment the chimpanzee later died but researchers at the chinese academy of science supposedly said they would continue the research shen paused that is the first story it is entirely untrue no chimpanzee was ever impregnated by dr yongxiang or anyone else in china nor has a chimpanzee been impregnated anywhere in the world if it had happened you would know about it then in a new story circulated that italian researchers had seen humanchimp embryos in a beijing laboratory i heard this story when i was a professor at mit i asked to meet the italian researchers in question they could never be found they were always the friend of a friend shen waited while strobes flashed again the cameramen crawling around at his feet were annoying after a moment he continued next a few years ago was the story that a mongolian prostitute gave birth to a baby with the features of a chimpanzee this chimpman was said to look like a human being but was very hairy with large hands and feet the chimpman drank whiskey and spoke in sentences according to the story this chimp is now at the chinese space agency headquarters in chao yang district he can sometimes be seen at the windows reading a newspaper and smoking a cigar supposedly he will be sent to the moon because it is too dangerous to send a human this story too is false all the stories are false i know these stories are tantalizing or amusing but they are not true why they should be located in china i am not sure especially since the country with the least regulation of genetic experiments is the united states you can do almost anything there it was there that a gibbon was successfully mated with a siamangprimates that are genetically more distant than a human and chimp several live births resulted this happened at georgia state university almost thirty years ago he then opened the floor to questions according to the transcript question dr shen is the us working on a chimp hybrid dr sheni have no reason to think so i am merely observing that the us has the fewest rules question is it possible to fertilize a chimpanzee with human sperm dr sheni would say no that has been tried for nearly a century going back to the s when stalin ordered the most famous animal breeder in russia to do it to make a new race of soldiers for him his name was ivanov and he failed and was thrown in jail a few years later hitlers scientists tried it and also failed today we know that the genomes of humans and chimps are very close but the uterine conditions are considerably different so i would say no question could it be done with genetic engineering dr shen that is difficult to say it would be extremely difficult from a technical standpoint from an ethical standpoint i would say it is impossible question but an american scientist already applied to patent a human hybrid dr shen professor stuart newman of new york was refused a patent on a parthuman hybrid but he did not make a hybrid dr newman said he applied for the patent to draw attention to the ethical issues involved the ethical issues remain unresolved question dr shen do you think a hybrid will eventually be created dr sheni called this press conference to end speculation not to increase it but if you ask my personal opinion i think yesit will eventually be done chapter the memory haunted mark sangerthe image burned in his mind of that poor animal stranded on the beach at night in costa rica helpless as the jaguar pounced bit off her head and proceeded to eat the flesh while her legs still kicked feebly and all with the sound of crunching bones the bones of her head mark sanger had not expected to see anything so horrific he had come to the beach at tortuguero to witness the giant leatherback turtles crawling out of the ocean to lay their eggs in the sand as a biologist he knew this was a great migration the planet had witnessed for countless eons the female turtles were engaged in one of the great demonstrations of maternal caring crawling high onto the beach depositing their eggs deep in the ground covering them with exhausted flippers then carefully sweeping the sand clean obliterating any trace of the eggs beneath it was a slow gentle ceremony directed by genes that survived from millennia past then came the jaguar a black streak in the night and suddenly last summer everything changed for mark sanger the brutality of the attack its speed and viciousness shocked him profoundly it confirmed his suspicion that the natural world had gone badly wrong everything that mankind was doing on the planet had upset the delicate balance of nature the pollution the rampant industrialization the loss of habitatwhen animals were squeezed and cornered they behaved viciously in a desperate effort to survive that was the explanation for the ghastly attack he had witnessed the natural world was in collapse he mentioned this to the very handsome naturalist ramon valdez who had accompanied him valdez shook his head no seor sanger this is always the way it has been since my father and grandfather and grandfather before they always spoke of the jaguar attacks in the night it is part of the cycle of life but there are more attacks now sanger said because of all the pollution no seor there is no change every month the jaguars take two to four turtles we have records going back many years the violence we see here is not normal a short distance away the jaguar was still eating the mother bones still crunching but itis normal ramon valdez said it is the way things are sanger did not want to talk about it anymore clearly valdez was an apologist for the industrialists and polluters the big american companies that dominated costa rica and other latin american countries not surprising to find such a person here since the cia had controlled costa rica for decades this wasnt a country it was a subsidiary of american business interests and american businesses did not give a damn for the environment ramon valdez said the jaguars must eat too i think better a turtle than to take a human baby that mark sanger thought was a matter of opinion back at home in berkeley sanger sat in his loft and pondered what to do although sanger told people he was a biologist he had no formal training in the field he had attended one year of college before dropping out to work briefly for a landscape architecture firm cather and holly the only biology he had taken was a course in high school the son of a banker sanger possessed a substantial trust fund and did not need to work to support himself he did however need a purpose in life wealth in his experience made the quest for selfidentity even more difficult and the older he got the harder it was to think about going back and finishing college recently he had started to define himself as an artist and artists did not need formal training in fact formal education interfered with the artists ability to feel the zeitgeist to ride the waves of change rolling through society and to formulate a response to them sanger was very well informed in his opinion he read the berkeley papers and sometimes magazines like mother jones and several of the environmental magazines not every month but sometimes true he often just looked at the pictures skimming the stories but that was all that was necessary to track the zeitgeist art was about feeling about how it felt to live in this materialistic world with its gaudy luxuries false promises and profound disappointments what was wrong with people today was that they ignored their feelings it was the job of art to bring true feelings alive to shock people into awareness that was why so many young artists were using genetic techniques and living material to create art wet art they called it tissue art many artists now worked fulltime in science labs and the art that resulted was distinctly scientific one artist had grown steaks in a petri dish and then ate them in public as a performance supposedly they tasted awful anyway they were genetically modified ugh an artist in france had made a glowing bunny rabbit by inserting luminescent genes from a firefly or something and still other artists had changed the hair color of animals giving them rainbow hues and had grown porcupine quills on the head of a cute puppy these works of art provoked strong feelings many people were disgusted but then sanger thought they should be disgusted they should feel the same revulsion that he himself had felt watching the slaughter of a mother turtle by a jaguar on a beach in costa rica that horrid perversion of nature that repellent savagery that he could not put out of his mind and that of course was the reason to make art not art for arts sake rather art to benefit the world art to help the environment that was mark sangers goal and he set about to attain it local doctor arrested for organ theft long beach memorial hospital staffer implicated thieves sold bones blood organs a prominent long beach physician has been arrested for selling organs illegally removed from dead bodies at long beach memorial hospital dr martin roberts chief administrator of the pathology laboratory which conducts autopsies at the hospital was charged on counts of illegally harvesting body parts from cadavers and selling the contraband to tissue banks said long beach district attorney barbara bates this indictment reads like a bmovie horror story bates also alleged in her indictment that dr roberts forged death certificates falsified lab results and colluded with local funeral homes and cemeteries to conceal his reign of error the case is only the most recent episode in a nationwide pandemic of modernday bodysnatching other cases include dr mike mastromarino a millionaire brooklyn ny dentist who over a fiveyear period purportedly stole organs from thousands of cadavers including bones from the yearold alastair cooke a fort lee nj biomedical firm that sold mastromarinos body parts to tissue banks across the united states a crematorium in san diego alleged to have stolen body parts from the cadavers entrusted to it another in lake elsinore california where body parts were kept in huge freezers prior to sale and ucla medical center where bodies were cut up and sold for some to the firm of johnson amp johnson the problem is worldwide said da bates tissue theft has been reported in england canada australia russia germany and france we believe such thefts now occur everywhere in the world bates added patients are very concerned dr roberts pleaded innocent to all charges in superior court and was released on a million bond also indicted were four other long beach memorial hospital staffers including marilee hunter the head of the hospital genetics lab long beach memorial administrator kevin mccormick expressed shock at the indictments and said that dr robertss behavior contravenes everything that our institution stands for he said he had ordered a thorough review of hospital procedures and would make the report public when it was completed prosecutors say the events were brought to their attention by a whistleblower raza rashad mr rashad is a firstyear medical student in san francisco who had previously worked in dr robertss pathology lab where he had witnessed firsthand numerous illegal activities there mr rashads testimony was vital to building the prosecutors case bates said chapter josh winkler hurried into the animal facility to see what tom weller was talking about how many rats died he said nine the stiff bodies of nine dead rats lying on their sides in nine successive cages made josh winkler start to sweat well have to dissect them he said when did they die must have been during the night tom said they were fed at six no notation of problems then tom was looking at a clipboard what study group were they in josh said fearing he already knew the answer a tom said the maturity gene study jesus josh tried to remain calm and how old were they ummmlets see thirtyeight weeks and four days oh god the average life span of a lab rat was weeksa little over three years these rats had died in a quarter of that time he took a deep breath and what about the others in the cohort there were twenty in the original study group tom said all identical all the same age two of them died a few days ago of respiratory infection i didnt think much about it at the time as for the otherswell you better see for yourself he led josh down the row of cages to the other rats it was immediately clear what their condition was ragged coats inactive excessive sleeping trouble standing on their hind legs muscle wasting hind leg paralysis in four of them josh stared theyre old he said theyre all old yes tom said its unmistakable premature aging i went back and checked the dead rats from two days ago one had a pituitary adenoma and the other had spinal cord degeneration signs of age right tom said signs of age maybe this gene wont be the wonder product rick is counting on after all not if it causes early death itd be a disaster how am i feelingadam said as they sat together at lunch i feel fine josh thanks to you im a little tired sometimes and my skin is dry im getting a few wrinkles but i feel okay why just wondered josh said as casually as he could he tried not to stare at his older brother in fact adams appearance had changed dramatically where he once had a touch of gray at the temples he now had a full head of saltandpepper hair his hairline had receded the skin around his eyes and lips was noticeably wrinkled his forehead was deeply creased he looked much older adam was thirtytwo jesus no uh drugs josh asked no no thats over thank god adam said he had ordered a hamburger but he put it down after a few bites doesnt taste good got a sore tooth i need to see the dentist adam touched his cheek i hate complaining actually i was thinking id better get some exercise i need exercise sometimes i get constipated you going to join your old bball group josh said brightly his brother used to play basketball twice a week with the investment bankers uh no adam said i was thinking doubles tennis or maybe golf good idea josh said a silence fell over the table adam pushed his plate aside i know i look older he said you dont need to pretend you havent noticed everybodys noticed it i asked mom and she said that dad was the same way he just suddenly looked older in his thirties almost overnight so maybe its genetic yeah could be why adam said do you know something me no you just suddenly wanted to have lunch urgently today couldnt wait i hadnt seen you in a while thats all cut the crap josh he said you were always a shitty liar josh sighed adam he said i think we should do some tests for what bone density lung capacity and an mri for what what are these tests for he stared at josh for aging yes im aging too fast is it that gene spray we need to find out josh said i want to call ernie ernie lawrence was the family physician okay set it up chapter speaking in washington at a noon briefing for congressmen professor william garfield of the university of minnesota said despite what you hear nobody has ever proven a single gene causes a single human behavioral trait some of my colleagues believe such associations may eventually be found others dont think it will ever happen that the interaction of genes and environment is just too complex but in any case we see reports of new genes for this or that in the papers every day and none of them has ever proven true in the end what are you talking about said the aide to senator wilson what about the gay gene that causes gayness a statistical association not causal no gene causes sexual orientation what about the violence gene not verified in later research a sleep gene was reported in rats the gene for alcoholism didnt hold up what about the diabetes gene so far he said weve identified ninetysix genes involved in diabetes well undoubtedly find more there was a stunned silence finally one aide said if no gene has been shown to cause behavior what is all the fuss about professor garfield shrugged call it an urban legend call it a media myth blame public education in science because the public certainly believes that genes cause behavior it seems to make sense in reality even hair color and height are not simple traits fixed by genes and conditions like alcoholism certainly arent wait a minute height isnt genetic for individuals yes if youre taller than your friend its probably because your parents are taller but for populations height is a function of environment in the last fifty years europeans have grown an inch every decade so have the japanese thats too fast for a genetic change its entirely an effect of environmentbetter prenatal care nutrition health care and so on americans by the way havent grown at all in this period theyve shrunk slightly possibly because of poor prenatal care and junk food diets the point is that the actual relationship of genes and environment is very complicated scientists dont yet have a good understanding of how genes work in fact theres no general agreement about what a geneis say that again among scientists garfield said there is no single agreedupon definition of what a gene is there are four or five different definitions i thought a gene was a section of the genome someone said a sequence of base pairs atgc that codes for a protein thats one definition garfield said but its inadequate because a single atgc sequence can code for multiple proteins some sections of code are basically switches that turn other sections on and off some sections lie silent unless activated by specific environmental stimuli some sections are active only during a period of development and never again others turn on and off constantly throughout an individuals life as i said its complicated a hand went up an aide for senator mooney who received substantial contributions from drug companies had a question professor i gather yours is a minority opinion most scientists wouldnt agree with your view of the gene actually most scientists do agree garfield said and with good reason when the human genome was decoded scientists were startled to find that it contained only about thirtyfive thousand genes they had expected far more after all a lowly earthworm had twenty thousand genes that meant that the difference between a human being and a worm might be only fifteen thousand genes how then could you explain the huge difference in complexity between the two that problem vanished as scientists began to study the interactions among genes for example one gene might make a protein and another gene could make an enzyme that snipped out part of the protein and thus changed it some genes contained multiple coding sequences separated by regions of meaningless code that gene could use any of its multiple sequences to make a protein some genes were activated only if several other genes were activated first or when a number of environmental changes occurred this meant that genes were far more responsive to the environment both inside and outside the human being than anyone had anticipated and the fact of multiple gene interactions meant there were billions of possible outcomes its not surprising garfield said that researchers are moving toward what we call epigenetic studies which look at exactly how genes interact with the environment to produce the individual we see this is an extremely active area he started to explain the intricacies one by one the congressional aides finished eating and left only a handful remained and they were checking messages on their cell phones neanderthals were the first blondes stronger biggerbrained smarter than us genetic mutations for hair color indicate that the first blondes were neanderthals not homo sapiens the blonde gene emerged sometime in the wrm glaciation perhaps in response to the relative lack of sunlight in the ice age the gene spread among neanderthals who were mostly blonde researchers say neanderthals had brains onefifth larger than ours they were taller than we were and stronger they were undoubtedly smarter too says marco svabo of the helsinki genetics institute in fact there is little doubt that modern man is a domesticated version of the neanderthal as the modern dog is a domesticated version of the stronger and more intelligent wolf modern man is a degraded inferior creature neanderthals were intellectually superior and better looking with blonde hair high cheekbones and strong features they would have appeared as a race of supermodels homo sapiensskinnier and uglier than neanderthalswould naturally have been attracted to the beauty strength and intelligence of blondes apparently a few neanderthal women took pity on the puny cromagnons and bred with them its a good thing for us we are lucky that we carry blonde neanderthal genes to prevent our species from becoming hopelessly stupid although we demonstrate plenty of stupidity anyway he said that pretending blondes were stupid was a darkhaired prejudice designed to deflect attention from the real problem of the world which is darkhaired shortcomings he added make a list of the stupidest people in history you will find they are all darkhaired dr evard nilsson a spokesperson for the marburg institute in germany which has been sequencing the entire neanderthal genome said the blonde theory was interesting nilsson said my wife is a blonde and i always do what she tells me to do and our children are blonde and quite intelligent so i agree there is something to this theory chapter daves firstfew days in the kendall household went surprisingly well when he went outside he wore a baseball cap which helped his appearance a lot with his hair trimmed wearing jeans and sneakers and a quicksilver shirt he looked much like any other kid and he learned quickly he had good coordination and writing his name proved easy under lynns instruction reading was harder for him dave did well at weekend sports though sometimes it was disconcerting at a little league game a high pop fly flew off the field toward the twostory school building dave ran over scaled the wall and caught the ball at the secondstory window the kids viewed this accomplishment with a mixture of admiration and resentment it wasnt fair and they had wanted to see the window shatter on the other hand everybody wanted dave on their team so lynn was surprised when one saturday afternoon dave came home early he looked sad what is it she said i dont fit everybody feels that way sometimes she said he shook his head they look at me she paused youre not the same as the other kids yes do they make fun of you he nodded sometimes what do they do throw things call me names what names he bit his broad lip monkeyboy he was on the verge of tears that feels bad she said im sorry she took his baseball cap off and began to stroke his head the back of his neck kids can be mean sometimes my feelings hurt he said sad he turned his back to her he pulled his shirt off she ran her fingers through his hair looking for bruises and other signs of injury as she did so she felt him relax his breathing slowed his mood seemed to improve only later did she realize she was grooming him like monkeys in the wild one turned its back to the other while the other picked through the fur she decided she would do it every day just to make dave more comfortable since daves arrivaleverything in lynns life had changed although dave was clearly henrys responsibility the chimp showed little interest in him he was immediately drawn to her and something about his manner or his appearancethe soulful eyes the childish demeanortugged at her heart shed started reading about chimps and learned that because chimpanzee females took multiple sexual partners they did not know which male fathered their infant and thus chimpanzees showed no notion of fatherhood or fathers chimps had only mothers dave seemed to have been an abused child uncared for by his actual chimp mother he looked to lynn with open longing and she responded it was all deeply emotional and entirely unexpected mom hes not your kid tracy had snapped tracy was at the age when she craved her parents attention she was jealous of any dis traction i know trace lynn said but he needs me mom hes not your responsibility she threw up her hands in a theatrical gesture i know well can you leave him alone is he getting too much attention well duh yes im sorry i didnt realize she put her arm around her daughter gave her a hug dont treat me like a monkey tracy said and pushed her away but they were after all primates human beings were apes her experience with dave was giving lynn an uncomfortable awareness of what humans shared with other apes grooming touching physical attention as a source of relaxation eyes lowered under threat or displeasure or as a sign of submission tracy around her boy friends flirting with downcast eyes direct eye contact meant intimidation a sign of anger goose bumps for fear and angerthose same skin muscles made a primates hair fluff up to create a bigger appearance in the presence of threat sleeping communally curling up in a kind of nest on and on apes they were all apes more and morethe biggest difference seemed to be hair dave was hairy those around him werent according to her reading the loss of hair had occurred after human beings separated from chimps the usual explanation was that human beings had become for a time swamp creatures or water creatures because most mammals were hairytheir coats of fur were necessary to help maintain their internal temperature but water mammals such as dolphins and whales had lost their hair in order to be streamlined and people too had lost their hair but for lynn the strangest thing was the persistent sense that dave was both human and not human she didnt quite know how to deal with that feeling and as the days passed it did not get any easier canavan gene litigation ends ethics of gene patenting disputed canavan disease is an inherited genetic disorder that is fatal to children in the first years of life in dan greenberg and his wife learned their ninemonthold son had the disease since no genetic test was available the greenbergs had another child a daughter who also was diagnosed with the disease the greenbergs wanted to make sure other families were spared this heartbreak and so they convinced reuben matalon a geneticist to work on a prenatal test for canavan disease the greenbergs donated their own tissues the tissues of their dead children and they worked to obtain tissues from other families with canavan disease around the world finally in the gene for canavan disease was discovered a free prenatal test was at last made available for families worldwide unknown to the greenbergs dr matalon patented the gene and then demanded high fees for further tests many families that had contributed tissues and money to help discover the gene now could not afford the test in the greenbergs and other concerned parties sued matalon and miami childrens hospital claiming breach of informed consent unjust enrichment fraudulent con cealment and misappropriation of trade secrets the suit was settled out of court as a result the test is more widely available although fees must still be paid to miami childrens hospital the ethics of the behavior of physicians and institutions involved in this case are still hotly debated psychology news adults dont grow up anymore british researcher blames formal education professors scientists strikingly immature if you believe the adults around you are acting like children youre probably right in technical terms it is called psychological neoteny the persistence of childhood behavior into adulthood and its on the rise according to dr bruce charlton evolutionary psychiatrist at newcastle upon tyne human beings now take longer to reach mental maturityand many never do so at all charlton believes this is an accidental byproduct of formal education that lasts well into the twenties formal education requires a childlike stance of receptivity which counteracts the attainment of psychological maturity that would normally occur in the late teens or early twenties he notes that academics teachers scientists and many other professionals are often strikingly immature he calls them unpredictable unbalanced in priorities and tending to overreact earlier human societies such as huntergatherers were more stable and thus adulthood was attained in the teen years now however with rapid social change and less reliance on physical strength maturity is more often postponed he notes that markers of maturity such as graduation from college marriage and first child formerly occurred at fixed ages but now may happen over a span of decades thus he says in an important psychological sense some modern people never actually become adults charlton thinks this may be adaptive a childlike flexibility of attitudes behaviors and knowledge may be useful in navigating the increased instability of the modern world he says where people are more likely to change jobs learn new skills move to new places but this comes at the cost of short attention span frenetic noveltyseeking ever shorter cycles of arbitrary fashion anda pervasive emotional and spiritual shallowness he added that modern people lack a profundity of character which seemed commoner in the past chapter ellis mrs levine saidwhat is that tube her son was holding a silver canister with a little plastic cup at the tip they were in the living room of his parents house in scarsdale outside workmen were hammering on the garage making repairs getting the house ready to sell whats in the tube she said again its a new genetic treatment mom i dont need it it rejuvenates your skin makes it young thats not what you told your father she said you told your father that it would improve his sex life well he put you up to this didnt he no mom listen to me she said i dont want to improve my sex life i have never been happier than i am right now the two of you sleep in separate rooms because he snores mom this spray will help you i dont want any help it will make you happier i promise you never did listen even as a child now mom and you never got any better your whole adult life mom please ellis was starting to get angry he wasnt supposed to be the one doing this to her anyway his brother aaron was supposed to do it aaron was his mothers favorite but aaron had a court date hed said so ellis was stuck with it he moved toward her with the canister get away from me ellis he continued to approach i amyour mother ellis she stamped on his toe he howled in pain and in the next moment grabbed her by the back of the head pushed the canister over her nose and squeezed she writhed and twisted i will not i will not but she was breathing it in even as she protested no nono he held it there for a while it was as if he were strangling her the same sort of grip the same sensation as she struggled in his arms it made him incredibly uncomfortable the flesh of her cheeks against his fingers as she twisted and protested he smelled the powder of her makeup finally ellis stepped away from her how dare you she said howdare you she hurried from the room swearing ellis leaned against the wall he felt dizzy to have physically accosted his mother like that but it had to be done he told himselfit had to be done chapter things were notgoing well rick diehl thought as he wiped pured green peas off his face and paused to clean his glasses it was five in the afternoon the kitchen was hot his three kids were sitting at the kitchen table screaming and hitting one another they were throwing hot dog relish and mustard the mustard stained everything the baby in the high chair refused to eat and spat her food right back out conchita should have been feeding her but conchita had vanished that afternoon she had become increasingly unreliable ever since ricks wife left broads stick together probably he would have to replace conchita which was a big pain in the neck to hire somebody new and of course she would sue him maybe he could negotiate a settlement with her before she went to court you want it take it jason his oldest mashed the hot dog with the bun into sams face sam howled and acted like he was choking now they were rolling on the floor dad dad stop him hes choking me jason dont choke your brother jason paid no attention rick grabbed him by the collar and pulled him off sam i said dont choke him i wasnt he asked for it you want to lose tv tonight no then eat your own hot dog and let your brother eat his rick picked up the spoon to feed the baby but she closed her mouth stubbornly staring at him with beady little hostile eyes he sighed what was it that made kids in high chairs refuse to eat and throw all their toys on the floor maybe it wasnt such a good idea for his wife to have gone away he thought as for the office the situation was even worse his exsecurity guy had been humping lisa and now that he was out of jail he was undoubtedly humping her again that girl had zero taste if brad was convicted of pedophilia that would be bad publicity for the company but even so rick hoped for it josh winklers wonder drug was apparently killing people josh had gone way out on a limb doing his own unauthorized human testing but if he were sent to jail that would reflect badly on the company too he was poking at his daughter with the spoon when the phone rang and things became much much worse son of a bitch rick diehl turned away from the banks of security screens i cant believe it he said on the screens the hated brad gordon was swiping open doors to the labs touching petri dishes everywhere and moving on brad had been recorded as he went methodically through all the labs in the building rick bunched his fists he came into the building at one in the morning the security temp said he must have had an admin card we didnt know about because his was disabled he went to all the storage points and he contaminated every single culture in the burnet cell line rick diehl said hes an asshole but theres no problem we have offsite biostorage in san jose london and singapore actually those samples were removed yesterday the security temp said someone picked up the cell lines and left they had proper authorization secure etransmission of codes who authorized it you did it came from your secure account oh christ he spun how didthat happen were working on it but the cell line rick said we have other sites unfortunately it seems well then we have customers who have leased im afraid we dont what are you saying rick said he was starting to scream are you saying every fucking burnet culture is gone in the entire fucking world gone as far as we know yes this is a goddamndisaster evidently this could be the end of my company that was our safety net those cells we paid a fortune to ucla for them youre saying theyre gone rick frowned angrily as the reality hit him this is an organized coordinated attack on my company they had people in london and singapore they had everything arranged yes we believe so to destroy my company possibly i need to get those cell lines back now no one has them except of course frank burnet then lets get burnet unfortunately mr burnet seems to have vanished too we cant seem to locate him great rick said just great he turned and yelled to his assistant get the fucking lawyers get fucking ucla here and get everybody here by eight oclock tonight i dont know if do it chapter gail bondfell into a routine she would spend the night with yoshi then come home at six in the morning to wake up evan give him breakfast and see him off to school one morning as soon as she unlocked the door she saw that gerard was gone his cage stood uncovered in the hallway his perch unoccupied gail swore she went into the bedroom where richard was still sleeping she shook him awake richard wheres gerard he yawned what gerard wheres gerard im afraid theres been an accident what accident what have you done the cage was being cleaned in the kitchen and the window was open he flew out he did not his wings were clipped i know that richard said yawning again he did not fly out all i can tell you is that i heard nadezhda shriek and when i came to the kitchen she was pointing out the window and when i looked the bird was fluttering awkwardly to the ground of course i ran downstairs to the street at once but he was gone the bastard was trying not to smile richard this is very serious that is a transgenic animal if he escapes he may transmit his genes to other parrots i am telling you it was an accident where is nadezhda she comes in at noon now i thought i would cut back does she have a cell you hired her pet dont call me pet i dont know what you have done with that grey but this is extremely serious richard he shrugged i dont know what to tell you of course it ruinedall her plans they had intended to publish online the following month and inevitably there would be cries from around the world that their claim was untrue scientists would call it the clever hans effect mere mimicry god knows what else everyone would demand to see the bird and now the bird was gone i could kill richard she said to maurice the head of the lab and i will hire the bestavocat for your defense he said not smiling do you think he knows where the bird is probably but hell never tell me he hated gerard youre having a custody fight over a bird ill talk to nadezhda but he has probably paid her off did the bird know your name the name of the lab phone numbers no but he memorized the tones for my cellular phone he used to make them as a sequence of sounds then perhaps he will call us one day gail sighed perhaps chapter alex burnetwas in the middle of the most difficult trial of her career a rape case involving the sexual assault of a twoyearold boy in malibu the defendant thirtyyearold mick crowley was a washingtonbased political columnist who was visiting his sisterinlaw when he experienced an overwhelming urge to have anal sex with her young son still in diapers crowley was a wealthy spoiled yale graduate and heir to a pharmaceutical fortune he hired notorious dc attorney abe it aint there ganzler to defend him it turned out that crowleys taste in love objects was well known in washington but ganzleras was his customtried the case vigorously in the press months before the trial repeatedly characterizing alex and the childs mother as fantasizing feminist fundamentalists who had made up the whole thing from their sick twisted imaginations this despite a welldocumented hospital examination of the child crowleys penis was small but he had still caused significant tears to the toddlers rectum it was in the midst of frantic preparation for the third day of the trial that amy alexs assistant buzzed her to say that her father was on the phone alex picked up pretty busy dad i wont take long im going away for a couple of weeks okay fine one of the other lawyers came in and dropped the latest newspapers on her desk thestar was running photographs of the raped child the hospital in malibu and unflattering pictures of alex and the kids mother squinting in hard sunlight where are you going dad dont know yet her father said but i need some time alone cell phone probably wont work ill send you a note when i get there and a box of some stuff in case you need it okay dad have fun she thumbed through thela times as she talked to him for years thetimes had fought for the right to access and print all court documents however preliminary private or speculative california judges were extremely reluctant to seal even those documents that involved the home addresses of women being stalked or the anatomical details of children who had been raped thetimes policy of publishing everything also meant that attorneys could put gross and unfounded allegations in their pretrial filings knowing thetimes would print them and it invariably did the publics right to know yes the public really needed to know exactly how long the tear was in the poor little boys you holding up all right her father said yeah dad im okay theyre not getting to you no im waiting for help from the child welfare organizations but theyre not issuing any statements strangely silent im sure youre shocked by that he said the weasel is politically connected right little dickhead gotta go lexie bye dad she turned away the dna matches were due today but they hadnt arrived yet the samples obtained had been small and she was worried about what they would show chapter the lightsdimmed smoothly in the plush presentation room at selat anney koss ltd the preeminent london advertising agency on the screen an image of an american strip mall blurred traffic rushing past a wretched cluster of signs gavin koss knew from experience this image was an immediate rapportbuilder anything critical of america was surefire american businesses spend more on advertising than any other country in the world koss said of course they must do given the quality of american products snickers floated through the darkness and the intelligence of the american audience mild muted laughter as one of our columnists recently noted the great majority of americans couldnt find their own behinds with both hands open laughter they were warming to him a crude cultureless people slapping each other on the back as they drift ever deeper into debt that should suffice he thought he changed his tone but what i wish to draw to your attention is the sheer volume of commercial messages as you see them here arranged in space along the motorway and every vehicle driving past has its radio on sending out even more commercial messages in point of fact its estimated that americans listen to three thousand messages every dayor what is more probable they dont listen to them psychologists have determined that the sheer volume of messages creates a kind of anesthesia which becomes ingrained over time in a saturated media environment all messages lose impact the image changed to times square at night then shinjuku in tokyo then piccadilly in london the saturation today is global huge messages including largescreen video appear in public squares along motorways in tube stations train depots we place videos at pointofsale in retail stores in toilets in waiting rooms pubs and restaurants in airport lounges and aboard aircraft furthermore we have conquered personal space logos brands and slogans appear on ordinary objects from knives to tableware to computers they appear on all our possessions consumers wear logos on their clothing handbags shoes jewelry indeed it is rare for a person to appear in public without them thirty years ago if anyone predicted that the entire global public would turn themselves into sandwich boards walking about advertising products the idea would have seemed fantastical yet it has happened the result is an imagistic glut sensory exhaustion and a diminution of impact what can we do now how can we move forward in the new era of technology the answer may be heretical but it isthis the screen changed dramatically to a forest image huge trees rising toward the sky shade beneath then a snowy mountain peak a tropical island an arc of sand crystalline water palm trees and finally an underwater reef with fish swimming among coral heads and sponges the natural world koss intoned is entirely without advertising the natural world has yet to be tamed colonized by commerce it remains virgin from the darkness isnt that rather the point conventional wisdom would put it so yes but conventional wisdom is invariably out of date because in the time it has taken to become conventionalto become what everyone believesthe world has moved on conventional wisdom is a remnant of the past and so it is in this case on the screen the reef scene was suddenly branded coral branches had lettering that readbp clean a school of small fish wriggled by each winkingvodafone vodafone a slithering shark withcadbury curving across the snout a puffer fish withlloyds tsb group in black lettering swam over convoluted heads of brain coral withscottish power printed along the ridges in orange and finally a moray eel poked its head out of a hole its greenish skin pattern saidmarks amp spencer think of the possibilities koss said the audience was stunnedas he had expected it would be he pressed on with the argument the slide now showed a desert scene with spires of red rock rising against a blue sky laced with clouds after a moment the clouds coalesced into a larger misty cloud that hung above the landscape and said bp meanscleanpower those letters koss said are nine hundred feet high they stand a quarter of a mile above the landscape they are clear to the naked eye and they photograph well at sunset they become quite beautiful the image changed here you see their appearance as the sun goes downthe lettering changes from white to pink to red and finally deep indigo so it has the quality the feeling of being a natural element within the natural landscape he returned to the original cloud image in daylight these letters are generated by a marriage of nanoparticles and genetically modified clostridium perfringens bacteria the image is in effect a nanoswarm and it will remain visible in the air for a variable period of time depending on conditionsjust as any cloud would it may appear for only a few minutes at other times it may appear for an hour it may appear in multiples on the screen the fluffy clouds became the bp slogan repeated infinitely in cloud after cloud stretching away to the horizon i think everyone will recognize the impact of this new medium thenatural medium he had expected spontaneous applause for this dramatic visual but there was still only silence in the darkness yet surely they would be experiencing some sort of reaction by now an infinitely repeated advert hanging in the sky surely it must arouse them but these clouds are a special case he said he returned tothe underwater image fishes moving over the coral reef in this case he said signage and adverts are borne by the living creatures themselves through direct genetic modification of each species we call this genomic advertising to capture this new medium speed is of the utmost importance there are only a limited number of reef fishes common to tourist waters some fish are more incandescent than others many are a bit drab so we want to choose the best and the genetic modifications will require patenting the marine animal in each case thus we will patent the cadbury clown fish the british petroleum stag coral the marks and spencer moray eel the royal bank of scotland angelfish and gliding silently overhead the british airways manta ray koss cleared his throat speed matters because we are entering a competitive situation we want our cadbury clown fish out there before the clown fish is patented by hersheys or mcdonalds and we want a strong creature since in the natural environment the cadbury clown fish will compete against ordinary clown fish and hopefully triumph over them the more successful our patented fish the more frequently our message shall be seen and the more completely the original messageless fish will be driven to extinction we are entering the era of darwinian advertising may the best advert win a coughfrom the audience gavin forgive me came a voice but this appears to be an environmental nightmare brand names on fish slogans in clouds and what else rhinos in africa that carry the land rover logo if you go about branding animal species every environmentalist in the world will oppose you actually they will not koss said because were not suggesting that corporationsbrand species we ask corporations tosponsor species as a public service he paused think how many museum exhibitions theater companies and symphony orchestras are entirely dependent on corporate sponsorship even sections of roadway are sponsored today why shouldnt the same philanthropic spirit be directed toward the natural worldwhich surely would benefit far more than our roads endangered species could be attractively sponsored corporations can stake their reputations on the survival of animal species as they once staked their reputations on the quality of dull television programs and it is the same for other animals that are not yet endangered for all the fish in the sea we are talking about an era of magnificent corporate philanthropyon a global scale so this is the black rhino brought to you by land rover the jaguar brought to you by jaguar i shouldnt put it so crudely but yes thats what we are proposing the point he continued is that this is a winwin situation a win for the environment for corporations and for advertising gavin koss had done hundreds of presentations in his career and his feeling for the audience had never failed him he could feel now that this group was not buying it it was time to bring the lights up and take questions he stared at the rows of frowning faces i admit my notion is radical he said but the world is changing rapidly someone is going to do this this colonization of naturewill happenthe only question is by whom i urge you to consider this opportunity with the greatest care and then decide if you want to be a part of it from the back garth baker the head of midlands media associates ltd stood its quite a novel idea gavin he said but i must tell you with some assurance that it will not work oh why is that because someone has already done it chapter there was no moon and no sound except the booming of the surf in the darkness and the whine of the damp wind tortuguero beach extended for more than a mile along the rough atlantic coast of costa rica but tonight it was no more than a dark strip that merged with a black starry sky julio manarez paused waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark a man can see by starlight if he takes the time soon he could make out the palm trunks and debris scattered over the dark sand and the low scrubby plants whipped by the wind off the ocean he could just see whitecaps in the churning seas the ocean he knew was filled with sharks this stretch of the atlantic coast was bleak and inhospitable a quarter mile down the beach he saw manuel a dark shape hunched beneath the mangroves he was keeping out of the wind there was no one else on the beach julio started toward him passing the deep pits dug by the turtles in previous days this beach was one of the breeding grounds for leatherback turtles which came up from the ocean in darkness to lay their eggs the process took most of the night and the turtles were vulnerablein the old days to poachers and now mostly to the jaguars that roamed the beach black as the night itself as the newly appointed conservation chief of the region julio was well aware that turtles were killed every week along this coast tourists helped prevent this if tourists were walking the beach the jaguars stayed away but often the cats came after midnight when the tourists had gone home to their hotels it was possible to imagine an evolutionary selection pressure producing some defense against the jaguar when he was in graduate school in san juan he and the other students used to joke about it were tourists agents of evolution tourists changed everything else about a country why not its wildlife because if a turtle happened to possess some qualityperhaps a tolerance for flashlights or the ability to make a plaintive pained mothering soundif they had something that drew tourists and kept them hanging around into the night then those turtles would be more likely to survive and their eggs more likely to survive and their offspring more likely to survive differential survival that resulted from being a tourist attraction that had been the joke in school but of course it was theoretically possible and if what manuel was telling him was true manuel saw him and waved he stood as julio approached this way he said and started down the beach you find more than one tonight julio just one of that kind i was speaking of muy bien they walked down the beach in silence but they had not gone farperhaps a hundred yards or sowhen julio saw the faint purple glow low to the sand and pulsing slightly thats it thats it manuel said she was a femaleof perhaps one hundred kilos a meter and a quarter long she had characteristic shell plates about the size of his palm brownish streaked with black she was half buried in the sand digging a pit at the rear with her flippers julio stood over her and watched it starts and stops manuel said and then it began again a purple glow that seemed to emanate from within the individual plates of the shell some plates did not have the glow and were dark some glowed only occasionally others glowed each time each pulse seemed to last about a second rising quickly fading slowly so how many turtles like this have you seen julio said this is the third and this light keeps the jaguars away he continued to watch the soft pulsing he felt that the quality of the glow was oddly familiar almost like a firefly or a glowing bacterium in the surf something he had seen before yes the jaguars keep their distance wait a minute julio said what is this he pointed to the shell where a pattern of light and dark plates emerged it only happens sometimes but you see it yes i see it it looks like a hexagon i dont know but it is like a symbol wouldnt you say of a corporation perhaps yes it is possible what about the other turtles they show this pattern no each one is different so this might be a random pattern that just happens to look like a hexagon yes julio i believe it is because you see the image on the shell is not so good it is not symmetrical even as he spoke the image faded the turtle was dark again can you photograph this pattern i already have it is a time exposure without the flash so there is some blurring but yes i have it good julio said because this is a genetic change lets review the visitor log and see who might have done this chapter joshit was his mother on the phone yes mom i thought you should know you remember lois grahams son eric who was on heroin theres been a terrible tragedy he died josh gave a long sigh he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes how in a car crash but then they did the autopsy or whatever eric had a fatal heart attack he was twentyone josh was it in the family some congenital thing no erics father lives in switzerland hes sixtyfour he climbs mountains and lois is fine of course shes crushed were all crushed josh said nothing things were going so well for eric he was off drugs he had a new job hed applied to go back to school in the fallhe was getting bald was the only thing people thought hed had chemo hed lost so much hair and he walked stooped over josh are you there im here i saw him last week he looked like an old man josh said nothing the familys sitting you ought to go ill try josh your brother looks old too i know i tried to tell him it was like his father to cheer him up but adam just looksso old i know whats going on she said what have you done to him what havei done yes josh you gave these people some gene or whatever that spray was and theyre getting old mom adam did it to himself he sucked down the spray himself because he thought itd get him high i wasnt even with him at the time and you asked me to give the spray to lois grahams son i dont know how you could think such a thing you called me up josh youre being ridiculous why would i call i dont know anything about your workyou calledme and asked where eric lived and you asked me not to tell his mother thats what i remember josh said nothing he pressed the tips of his fingers against his closed eyes until he saw bright patterns he wanted to escape he wanted to leave this office this company he wanted none of this to be true mom he said finally this could be very serious he was thinking that he could go to jail of course its serious im very frightened now josh whats going to happen am i going to lose my son i dont know mom i hope not i think theres a chance she said because i called up the levines in scarsdale theyre already old the two of them past sixty and they sounded just fine helen said she was never better george is playing a lot of golf thats good he said so maybe theyre okay i think so then maybe adam will be okay too i really hope so mom i really do he got off the phone of course the levines were fine he had sent sterile saline in the spray tubes they hadnt gotten the gene he wasnt about to send his experimental genes to some people in new york he didnt know and if this gave his mother hope then fine keep it that way because right now josh didnt hold out much hope not for his brother and ultimately not for himself he was going to have to tell rick diehl but not now not right now chapter gail bondshusband richard the investment banker often worked late entertaining important clients and none was more important than the american sitting across the table from him now barton williams the famous cleveland investor you want a surprise for your wife barton richard bond said i believe i have just the thing hunched down over the dinner table williams looked up with only slight interest barton williams was seventyfive and closely resembled a toad he had a jowly droopy face with large pores a broad flat nose and bug eyes his habit of placing his arms flat on the table and resting his chin on his fingers made him look even more like a toad in fact he was resting an arthritic neck since he disliked wearing a brace he felt it made him look old he could lie flat on the table as far as richard bond was concerned williams was old enough and rich enough to do whatever he wanted and what he had always wanted all his life was women despite age and appearance he continued to have them in prodigious quantities at all times of day richard had arranged for several women to drop by the table at the end of the meal they would be members of his staff dropping off papers for him or old girlfriends coming by for a kiss and an introduction a few would be other diners admirers of the great investor and so dazzled they had to come and meet him none of this fooled barton williams but it amused him and he expected his business partners to go to a little trouble for him when you were worth ten billion dollars people made an effort to keep you happy that was how it worked he viewed it as a tribute yet at this particular moment more than anything else barton williams wanted to placate his wife of forty years for inexplicable reasons evelyn at age sixty was suddenly dissatisfied with her marriage and with bartons endless escapades as she referred to them a present would help but it better be damn good barton said shes accustomed to everything villas in france yachts in sardinia jewelry from winston chefs flown in from rome for her dogs birthday thats the problem i cant buy her off anymore shes sixty and jaded i promise you this present is unique in the world richard said your wife loves animals does she not has her own damn zoo right on the property and she keeps birds christ must be a hundred we got finches in the damn sun room chitter all day she breeds em and parrots every kind none talk thank god she never had much luck with parrots her luck is about to change barton sighed she doesnt want another damn parrot she wants this one richard said its the only one like it in the world im leaving at six tomorrow morning barton grumbled itll be waiting on your plane richard said chapter rob bellarminosmiled reassuringly just ignore the cameras he said to the kids they had set up in the school library of george washington high in silver spring maryland three semicircles of chairs around a central chair where dr bellarmino sat while he talked to the students about the ethical issues of genetics the tv people had three cameras going one at the back of the room one at the side close on bellarmino and one facing the kids to record their expressions of fascination as they heard about the life of a working geneticist at the nih according to the shows producer it was important to show bellarminos interaction with the community and he could not have agreed more the kids were specially picked to be bright and knowledgeable he thought it would be fun he spoke about his background and training for a few minutes and then took questions the first one made him pause dr bellarmino a young asian girl asked what is your opinion of that woman in texas who cloned her dead cat in fact bellarmino thought the whole deadcat business was ridiculous he thought it diminished the important work he and others were doing but he couldnt say that of course this is a difficult emotional situation bellarmino said diplomatically we are all fond of our pets but he hesitated this work was done by a california company called genetic savings and clone and it was reported that the cost was fifty thousand dollars do you think its ethical to clone a pet cat the girl asked as you know he said quite a few animals have now been cloned including sheep mice dogs and cats so it has become rather unremarkableone concern is that a cloned animal does not have the same life span as a normal animal another student said is it ethical to pay fifty thousand dollars to clone a pet when so many people are starving in the world bellarmino groaned inwardly how was he going to change the subject i am not enthusiastic about this procedure he said but i would not go so far as to call it unethical isnt it unethical because it makes a climate of normality to clone a human being i dont think cloning a pet has any effect on the issues concerning human cloning would it be ethical to clone a human being fortunately bellarmino said that issue is quite far in the future today i hope we might consider real contemporary issues we have people who express concerns about genetically modified foods we have concerns about gene therapy and stem cells and these are real issues do any of you share that concern a young boy in the back raised his hand yes do you think it is possible to clone a human being the boy asked yes i think it is possible not now but eventually when i wouldnt want to guess when are there questions on a different subject another hand yes in your opinion is human cloning unethical again bellarmino hesitated he was acutely aware his response was going to be broadcast on television and who could know how the network would edit his remarks theyd probably do their best to make him look as bad as possible reporters had a distinct prejudice against people of faith and his words also carried professional weight because he ran a division of nih youve probably heard a lot about cloning and most of it is untrue speaking as a scientist i must admit i see nothing inherently wrong with cloning i see no moral issue it is just another genetic procedure we already have done it with a variety of animals as i have mentioned however i also know that the procedure of cloning has a high failure rate many animals die before one is successfully cloned clearly that would be unacceptable for human beings so for the moment i regard cloning as a nonproblem isnt cloning playing god i personally wouldnt define the issue that way he said if god has made human beings and made the rest of the world then clearly god has made the tools of genetic engineering so in that sense god has already made genetic modification available that is the work of god not man and as always it is up to us to use wisely what god has given us he felt better after this it was one of his stock answers so is cloning a wise use of what god has given us against his every instinct he wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his jacket he hoped they wouldnt use that bit of film although he was sure they would young kids sweat the head of nih some people think they know what god intends he said but i dont believe i know i dont believe anyone can know that except god i think anyone who says he knows gods intention is showing a lot of very human ego he wanted to glance at his watch but he didnt the kids were looking quizzical not enraptured as he had expected theres a great range of genetic issues he said lets move on dr bellarmino said a kid to the left i wanted to ask about antisocial personality disorder ive read there is a gene for it and its associated with violence and crime sociopathic behavior yes thats true the gene appears in about two percent of the population around the world what about new zealand it is in thirty percent of the white new zealand population and sixty percent of the maori population thats been reported but you must be careful but doesnt that mean violence is hereditary i mean shouldnt we be trying to get rid of this gene the way we got rid of smallpox bellarmino paused he was starting to wonder how many of these kids had parents who worked in bethesda he hadnt thought to ask for the names of the kids in advance but the questions from these kids were too knowledgeable too relentless was one of his many enemies trying to discredit him by using these kids was the whole network plan a trap to make him look bad the first step toward pushing him out of nih this was the information age it was how such things were done today arrange to make you look bad make you look weak push you to say something foolish and then watch your words repeated over and over for the next fortyeight hours on every cable news show and in every newspaper column next have congressmen call for you to retract your statements clucking tongues shaking headshow could he be so insensitive was he really suited for the job wasnt he really a liability at his post and then you were out that was how it was done these days now bellarmino was facing a dangerously loaded question about maori genetics should he say what he really believed and risk being accused of demeaning a downtrodden ethnic minority did he mute his comments but still risk criticism for promoting eugenics how actually could he say anything at all he decided he couldnt you know he said thats an extremely interesting area of research but we just dont know enough yet to answer next question chapter it had been raining all day in southern sumatra the jungle floor was wet the leaves were wet everything was wet the video crews from around the world had long since gone on to other assignments now hagar was back with only one client a man named gorevitch a famous wildlife photographer who had flown in from tanzania gorevitch had set up beneath a large ficus tree unzipped a duffel bag and removed a nylon mesh sling like a hammock he set this on the ground carefully then he brought out a metal case popped it open and assembled a rifle you know thats illegal hagar said this is a preserve no shit if the rangers come through you better get that stuff out of sight not a problem gorevitch charged the compressor opened the chamber how big is this guy hes a juvenile two or three years old maybe thirty kilos probably less okay ten ccs gorevitch pulled a dart out of the case checked the level and slipped it into the chamber then another and another he clicked the chamber closed he said to hagar when was the last time you saw him ten days ago where near here he comes back this is his home range seems to be gorevitch squinted down the telescopic sight he swung it in an arc then up to the sky then back satisfied he put the gun down you got a low enough dose dont worry gorevitch said also if hes high in the canopy you cant shoot because i said dont worry gorevitch looked at hagar i know what im doing dose is just enough to unsteady him hell come down by himself long before he collapses we may have to track him on the ground for a while youve done this before gorevitch nodded with orangs chimps chimps are different really sarcastic the two men fell into an uneasy silence gorevitch got out a video camera and tripod and set them up then a longrange microphone with a onefoot dish which he clipped to the top of the camera with a mounting pole it made an ungainly apparatus but effective hagar thought gorevitch squatted on his haunches and stared out at the jungle the men listened to the sound of the rain and waited in recent weeksthe talking orangutan had faded from the media the story had gone the way of other animal reports that didnt prove out that arkansas woodpecker nobody could find again and the sixfoot congo ape that nobody could locate despite persistent stories by natives and the giant bat with the twelvefoot wingspan that was supposedly seen in the jungles of new guinea as far as gorevitch was concerned the declining interest was ideal because when the ape was finally rediscovered media attention would be ten times greater than it would have been otherwise especially because gorevitch intended to do more than record the talking ape he intended to bring it back alive he zipped his jacket collar tight against the dripping rain and he waited it was late in the afternoon and starting to get dark gorevitch was dozing off when he heard a low gravelly voice say alors merde he opened his eyes he looked at hagar sitting nearby hagar shook his head alors commenta va gorevitch looked slowly around merde scumbag espce de conit was a low sound throaty like a drunk at a barfungele a usted gorevitch turned on the camera he couldnt tell where the voice was coming from but he could at least record it he swung the lens in a slow arc while he watched the microphone levels because the mike was directional he was able to determine that the sound was coming fromthe south nine oclock from where he was he squinted through the finder zoomed in he could see nothing the jungle was becoming darker every minute hagar stood motionless nearby just watching now there was a crashing of branches and gorevitch glimpsed a shadow as it streaked across the lens he looked up and saw the shape moving higher and higher swinging on branches as it went up into the overhead canopy in a few moments the orang was seventy feet in the air above them gods vloek het asshole wijkje vloek he took the camera off the tripod tried to film it was black nothing flicked on night vision he saw nothing but green streaks as the animal moved in and out of the thick foliage the orang was moving higher and laterally vloek het moeder fucker nice mouth on him but the voice was growing fainter gorevitch realized he had a decision to make and quickly he set the camera down and reached for the rifle he swung it up and sighted down the scope military night vision bright green very clear he saw the ape saw the eyes glowing white dots hagar said no the orang jumped to another tree suspended in space for an instant gorevitch fired he heard the hiss of gas and thethwack of the dart smacking the leaves missed him he raised the rifle again dont do this shut up gorevitch sighted fired in the trees above there was a momentary pause in the thrashing sound you hit him hagar said gorevitch waited the crashing of leaves and branches began again the orang was moving now almost directly overhead no i didnt gorevitch raised the gun once more yes you did if you shoot again gorevitch fired a whoosh of gas near his ear then silence gorevitch lowered the gun and moved to reload it keeping his eyes on the canopy overhead he crouched down flicked open his metal case and felt for more cartridges he kept looking upward the whole time silence you hit him hagar said maybe i know you hit him no you dont gorevitch popped three more cartridges into the gun you dont know that hes not moving you hit him gorevitch took his position raised the rifle just in time to see a dark shape come plummeting downward it was the orang falling straight down from the canopy more than feet above them the animal crashed to the ground at gorevitchs feet splattering mud the orang didnt move hagar swung a flashlight three darts protruded from the body one in the leg two in the chest the orang was not moving the animals eyes were open staring upward great hagar said great work gorevitch dropped to his knees in the mud put his mouth over the orangs big lips and blew air into his lungs to resuscitate him chapter six attorneyssat at the long table all shuffling through papers it sounded like a windstorm rick diehl waited impatiently biting his lip finally albert rodriguez his head attorney looked up the situation is this rodriguez said you have good reasonsufficient reason anywayto believe that frank burnet conspired to destroy the cell lines in your possession so that he could sell them again to some other company right rick said fucking right three courts have ruled that burnets cells are your property you therefore have a right to take them you mean take themagain correct except the guy has gone into hiding that is inconvenient but it does not change the material facts of the situation you are the owner of the burnet cell line rodriguez said wherever those cells may occur meaning his children his grandchildren they probably have the same cells you mean i can take cells from the kids the cells are your property rodriguez said what if the kids dont agree to let me take them they may very well not agree but since the cells are your property the children dont have any say in the matter were talking punch biopsies of liver and spleen here diehl said theyre not exactly minor procedures theyre not exactly major either rodriguez said i believe they are ordinary outpatient procedures of course you would have a duty to make sure that the cell extractions were performed by a competent physician i assume you would diehl frowned let me see if i understand youre telling me i can just grab his kids off the street and haul them to a doctor and remove their cells whether they like it or not i am yes and how rick diehl said can that be legal because they are walking around with cells that are legally yours hence with stolen property thats felony two under the law if you witness a felony being committed you are entitled to perform a citizens arrest and take the offender into custody so if you were to see burnets children walking on the street you could legally arrest them me personally no no rodriguez said in these circumstances one avails oneself of a trained professionala fugitiverecovery agent you mean a bounty hunter they dont like that term and neither do we all right do you know of a good fugitiverecovery agent we do rodriguez said then get him on the phone diehl said right now chapter vasco borden faced the mirror and reviewed his appearance with a professional eye while he brushed mascara into the graying edges of his goatee vasco was a big man sixfeetfour and twoforty all muscle nine percent body fat his shaved head and his trimmed black goatee made him look like the devil one big mother of a devil he meant to appear intimidating and he did he turned

daughter alex a lawyernever good as a target even if you handled them perfect you still got sued this gal was blond looked to be in decent physical shape attractive enough if you liked the type she was too skinny for vascos taste and she probably took some israeli defense class on weekends you never knew anyway she spelled potential trouble that left the kid jamie eight years old second grade local school vasco could get down there pick him up collect the samples and be done with this whole thing by the afternoon which was fine with him vasco had a fiftythousanddollar completion bonus if he recovered in the first week that declined to ten thousand after four weeks so he had plenty of reason to get it over with do the kid he thought simple and to the point dolly came in the paper in her hand today she was wearing a navy blue suit low shoes white shirt she had a brown leather briefcase as usual her bland looks enabled her to move about without attracting notice how does this look she said and handed him the paper he scanned it quickly it was a to whom it may concern signed by alex burnet allowing the bearer to pick up her son jamie from school and take him to the family doctor for his exam you called the doctors office vasco said yeah said jamie had a fever and sore throat and they said bring him in so if the school calls the doctor were covered and youre sent from the mothers office right got your card she pulled out a business card with the logo of the law firm and if they call the mother her cell number is listed on the paper as you see and thats cindy yes cindy

seconds is all he better not hurt that kid hey vasco said are you fine about this or what yeah im fine okay then lets do it he drove down the road chapter brad gordon had a bad feeling as he walked into the border caf on ventura boulevard and looked at the booths the place was a greasy spoon filled with actors a guy waved from a rear booth brad walked back to him the guy was wearing a light gray suit he was short and balding and looked unsure of himself his handshake was weak willy johnson he said im your new attorney for the upcoming trial i thought my uncle jack watson was providing the attorney he is johnson said im he pederasty is my specialty whats that mean sex with a boy but i have experience with any underage partner i didnt have sex with anybody brad said underage or not ive reviewed your file and the police reports johnson said pulling out a legal pad i think we have several avenues for your defense what about the girl she is not available she left the country her mother is ill in the philippines but i am told she will return for the trial i thought there wasnt going to be a trial brad said the waitress came over he waved her away why are we meeting here i have to be in court in van nuys at ten i thought this would be convenient brad looked around uneasily place is full of people actors they talk a lot we wont discuss the details of the case johnson said but i want to lay out the structure of your defense in your case i am proposing a genetic defense genetic defense whats that mean people with various genetic abnormalities find themselves helpless to suppress certain impulses johnson said that makes them in technical terms not guilty we will be proposing that as the explanation in your case what genetic disorder i dont have any genetic disorder hey its not a bad thing johnson said think of it as a type of diabetes youre not responsible for it you were born that way in your case you have an irresistible impulse to engage in sex with attractive young women he smiled its an impulse thats shared by about ninety percent of the adult male population what kind of a fucking defense is that brad gordon said a very effective one johnson shuffled through papers in a folder there have been several recent newspaper reports you mean to tell me brad said that theres a gene for sex with young girls johnson sighed i wish it were that simple unfortunately no then whats the defense ddr which is its called the novelty gene its the gene that drives us to take risks engage in thrillseeking behavior we will argue that the novelty gene inside your body drove you to risky behavior sounds like bullshit to me is it lets see ever jump out of an airplane yeah in the army hated it scuba diving couple of times had a hot girlfriend who liked it mountain climbing nope really didnt your high school class climb mount rainer yeah but that was you climbed a major american peak johnson said nodding driving sports cars fast not really no you have five tickets for speeding in your porsche in the last three years under california law you have been at risk for losing your license all that time just normal speeding i think not how about sex with the bosss girlfriend well and sex with the bosss wife just once a couple of jobs back but she was the one who came on to those are risky sex partners mr gordon any jury would agree how about unprotected sex venereal diseases just a minute here brad said i dont want to get into im sure you dont johnson said and thats not surprising considering three cases ofpediculosis pubis crabs two episodes of gonorrhea one of chlamydia two episodes of condylomaor genital wartsincludinghmm one near the anus and thats just the last five years according to the records of your doctor in southern california howd you get those johnson shrugged sky diving scuba diving mountain climbing reckless driving highrisk sex partners unprotected sex if that doesnt comprise a pattern of highrisk thrillseeking behavior i dont know what does brad gordonwas silent he had to admit the little guy knew how to make a case hed never thought of his life that way before like when he was screwing the bosss wife his uncle just gave him hell about it why his uncle had said did you make that kind of fuckedup decision keep it in your pants jerkoff brad had had no answer at the time under his uncles glare his actions did seem pretty stupid the broad wasnt even that goodlooking but now it seemed brad had an answer to his uncles question he couldnt help it it was his genetic inheritance that was controlling his behavior johnson explained further giving a lot of detail according to him brad was at the mercy of thisd drgene which controlled the chemical levels in the brain something called dopamine was driving brad to take risks and to enjoy the experience to crave it brain scans and other tests proved that people like brad could not control the desire to take risks its the novelty gene johnson said and it has been named by the most important geneticist in america dr robert bellarmino dr bellarmino is the biggest genetics researcher at the national institutes of health he has a huge lab he publishes fifty papers a year no jury can ignore his research okay so i have the gene you really think this will work yes but i want to see some frosting on the cake before we go to trial meaning what before your trial youre naturally worried stressed yeah so i want you to take a trip to take your mind off things i want you to travel around the country and i want you to take risks wherever you go johnson laid it out speeding tickets amusement parks getting into fights roller coasters climbing expeditions in national parksalways making sure to get into an argument a dispute about safety a claim that equipment was faulty anything that would get his name recorded in a document that could later be used in trial thats it johnson said get going ill see you in a few weeks he gave him a sheet of paper whats this a list of the biggest roller coasters in the us make sure you visit the top three christ ohioindianatexas i dont want to hear it johnson said youre facing twenty years in prison my friend with some big guy with tattoos whos going to be giving you lots worse than anal warts so do as i tell you and leave town today back in hisapartment in sherman oaks he packed a bag the thought of a big guy with tattoos preoccupied him for a moment he wondered if he should take his pistol going crosscountry to crazy places like ohiowho knew what he might come across he put a box of ammo in his bag and his pistol with the leg holster heading for his car brad found that he felt better about everything it was a sunny day his porsche was sparkling clean and he had a plan road trip chapter lynn kendall ran into the la jolla school arriving out of breath at the principals office i got here as soon as i could she said whats the problem its david the principal said she was a woman of forty the child you are homeschooling your son jamie brought him to school for the day yes to see how he did and i am afraid he did not do well on the playground he bit another child oh dear he very nearly drew blood thats terrible we see this in homeschooled children mrs kendall they severely lack socialization skills and inner controls there is no substitute for daily school environment with peers im sorry this has happened you need to speak to him the principal said he is in detention in the next room lynn went into a small room it was filled with green metal filing cabinets stacked high dave was on a wooden chair looking very small and brown curled up in the seat dave what happened he hurted jamie dave said who did i dont know his name he bees in six grade lynn thought sixth grade then it would have been a much bigger child and what happened dave he pushed jamie on the ground hurted him and what did you do i jumped on his back because you wanted to protect jamie dave nodded but you shouldnt bite dave he bited me first did he where did he bite you here dave held up a stubby muscular finger the skin was pale and thick there might be bite marks but she couldnt be sure did you tell the principal shes not with my mother that lynn knew was daves way of saying the principal didnt like him young chimps inhabited a matriarchal society where the allegiances of females were very important and constantly tracked did you show her the finger dave shook his head no ill speak to her lynn said thats his story is it the principal said well im not surprised he jumped on the childs back what did he expect would happen then the other child did bite first biting is not allowed mrs kendall did the other child bite him he says no is the child in sixth grade yes in miss fromkins class id like to speak to him lynn said we cant permit that the principal said hes not your child but hes accused dave and the situation is very serious if i am going to deal correctly with dave i need to know what happened between them ive told you what happened you saw it happen no but it was reported by mr arthur the playground supervisor he is very accurate in the matter of disputes i can assure you the point is we dont allow biting mrs kendall lynn was feeling an invisible hand pressing on her the conversation had a distinct uphill quality perhaps i should talk with my son jamie lynn said jamies story will agree with davids im sure the point is mr arthur says that it didnt happen that way the bigger boy didnt attack jamie first the principal stiffened mrs kendall she said in cases of disciplinary disputes we can refer to a security camera on the playground we can go to that if we need tonow or later but i would encourage you to stay with the issue of the biting which is david however uncomfortable that may be i see lynn said the situation was clear all right i will deal with dave when he comes home from school i think you should take him with you i would prefer he finish the day she said and walk home with jamie i dont think dave has a problem integrating in the classroom as you explained lynn said i dont think we help his integration if we pull him out of class now i will deal with him when he comes home the principal nodded reluctantly well i will speak to him now lynn said and tell him hell stay here for the rest of the day chapter alex burnet jumped out of the cab and ran toward the school when she saw the ambulance her heart began to pound a few minutes before she had been with a clientwho was sobbingwhen the receptionist buzzed to say that jamies teacher had called something about a doctors visit for her son the story was garbled but alex didnt wait she handed the client a box of kleenex and ran shed jumped in a cab downstairs and told the guy to run stoplights the ambulance was at the curb doors open a whitecoated doctor waiting in the backshe wanted to scream she had never felt like this before the world was greenishwhite she was sick with fear she ran past the ambulance and into the school courtyard the mother at the front desk said can i help but alex knew where jamies classroom was on the ground floor at the rear courtyard she headed straight toward it her cell phone rang it was jamies teacher miss holloway that woman is waiting outside the class she whispered she gave me a letter with your phone number on it but i didnt trust that i used the number we had on your school file and called that good work alex said im almost there shes outside alex came around the corner and saw a woman in a blue suit standing outside the classroom alex went right up to her and who the hell are you the woman smiled calmly held out her hand hi ms burnet casey rogers im sorry you had to come all this way she was so easy so relaxed alex was disarmed she put her hands on her hips breathing deeply catching her breath what seems to be the problem casey there isnt any problem ms burnet you work in my office gosh no i work in dr hughess office dr hughes wanted me to pick up jamie and bring him in for his tetanus shot its not an emergency but it does need to be done he cut his ankle a week ago isnt that right no no well i cant imaginedo you suppose i was sent for the wrong child let me call dr hughes she took out her cell phone yes do that inside the classroom the kids were looking at them through the glass she waved to jamie who smiled back perhaps we should move away casey rogers said not disrupt them then into the phone dr hughes please yes its casey together they walked back toward the school entrance through the entry arch alex saw the ambulance alex said did you bring an ambulance gosh no i have no idea why its here she pointed to the windshield looks like the driver is eating lunch through the windshield alex saw a burly man with a black goatee munching on a submarine sandwich had he stopped by the school just to eat lunch something about that didnt seem right she couldnt put her finger on it dr hughes its casey yes im with ms burnet right now and she says her son jamie did not cut his foot he did not alex repeated they walked through the arch and outside moving closer to the ambulance the driver put his sandwich on the dashboard and opened the door on the drivers side he was getting out yes dr hughes casey said were leaving the school right now she held the phone out to alex would you like to speak to dr hughes yes alex said as she put the phone to her ear she heard a piercing electronic shriekit disoriented hershe dropped the phone as casey rogers grabbed her elbows and yanked her arms back the driver was coming around the front of the ambulance toward her we dont need the kid the driver said shell do fine it took a moment before she put it together they were kidnapping her what happened next was instinct she slammed her head straight back hitting casey in the nose casey screamed and let go blood gushed down from her nose alex grabbed caseys arm and swung her forward throwing her at the big man he sidestepped gracefully as casey hit the concrete and rolled howling in pain alex fumbled in her pocket get back she warned him were not going to hurt you ms burnet the man said he was a good head and a half taller than she and big muscular just as he reached for her she got her finger on the button and sprayed pepper in his face shit goddamn it he threw his arm up to protect his eyes and half turned away from her she knew that was her one chanceshe kicked up fast and hard hitting him in the throat with her high heel he yelled in agony and she fell backward on the sidewalk unable to keep her balance she scrambled back to her feet immediately the woman was getting to her feet her blood pouring onto the sidewalk she ignored alex and went to comfort the big man who was leaning against the ambulance bent over clutching his throat moaning in pain alex heard distant sirenssomeone had called the policeand now the woman was helping the big man into the ambulance putting him in the passenger seat it was happening fast alex started to worry that these two would get away before the cops showed up but there wasnt much she could do as the woman climbed into the ambulance she screamed at alex well arrest you yet youll what alex said the unreality of this whole incident was starting to hit heryoull what well be back bitch the woman screamed starting the engine you wont get away the red flasher came on with the siren she put the ambulance in gear for what alex yelled again all she could think was that this entire business had been some dreadful mistake but vern hugheswas her doctor they had used her correct name they had come for jamie no it was not a mistake well arrest you yet what could that mean she turned and hurried back into the school her one thought now was jamie it was snack timethe kids were all sitting at their tables eating pieces of cut fruit some had yogurt they were quite noisy miss holloway gave her the paper the woman had brought it appeared to be a xerox of stationery from alexs law firm signed by her it wasnt a note from the doctors office that meant that the woman in the blue suit was a cool operator when caught she instantly changed her story smiling shaking hands with alex smoothly finding an excuse for the two of them to walk back outsideoffering her the phone so that when she took it we dont need the kid shell do fine they had come to kidnap jamie but they were ready to kidnap her instead why ransom she had no money to speak of was it some lawsuit she was involved in shed had dangerous lawsuits in the past but there wasnt anything pending at the moment shell do fine either her son or her miss holloway said is there anything i should know or the school should know no alex said but im going to take jamie home theyve almost finished their snack alex nodded to jamie waved for him to come over he came reluctantly what is it mom he said we need to go i want to stay here alex sighed contrary as ever jamie she began i missed a lot cause i was sick ask miss holloway and i didnt get to see my friends i want to stay and we have hot dogs for lunch im sorry she said go to your cubby and get your stuff we have to leave in front ofthe school two police cars and four police officers were examining the pavement one of them said are you ms burnet yes i am we have a report from a woman in the principals office who saw the whole thing the policeman said pointing to a nearby window but theres a lot of blood here ms burnet yes the woman hurt her nose when she fell are you divorced ms burnet yes i am for how long five years so it is not recent not at all your relations with your ex very cordial she talked to the police for a few minutes more while jamie waited impatiently the police seemed to alex to be oddly reluctant to become involved they were detached and seemed to feel they had come upon a private matter like a domestic dispute are you filing a complaint i would alex said but i have to take my son home now we can give you the paperwork to take home that will be fine she said one of the cops gave her a business card and said to call if there was anything further she needed she said she would then she and jamie started home out on the streetthe world around her suddenly seemed entirely different nothing could be more cheerfully bland than the sunlight of beverly hills but now alex saw only menace she didnt know where that menace was coming from or why she held jamies hand are wewalking home he said sighing yes were walking but even as he asked she started to wonder they lived only a few blocks from the school but was it safe to go home would those people with the ambulance be waiting or would they hide themselves better the next time its too far to walk jamie trudged along and too hot were walking and thats all there is to it as they walked she flipped open her cell and dialed the office her assistant amy answered listen i want you to check recent county filings find out if my name comes up as a defendant anywhere is there something i need to know amy asked laughing but it was a nervous laugh wrongdoing by an attorney might land their assistants in jail it had happened a couple of times recently no alex said but i think i have bounty hunters chasing me you jump bail anywhere no alex said thats the point i dont know what these people think they are doing the assistant said she would check jamie walking alongside alex said whats a bowie hunter why is she chasing you mom im trying to find out jamie i think its a mistake were they trying tohurt you no no nothing like that there was no reason to make him worry the assistant called back okay you do have a complaint all right in superior court ventura county that was a good hour from los angeles up past oxnard whats the complaint it was filed by biogen research incorporated of westview village i cant read the complaint online but youre showing up as a failure to appear appear when yesterday was i served indicates you were i wasnt alex said shows you were so is there a contempt citation a warrant for my arrest nothings showing but the online lags up to a day so there might be alex flipped the phone shut jamie said are you going to be arrested no honey im not then can i go back to school after lunch well see her apartment buildingon the north side of roxbury park looked quiet in the midday sun alex stood on the other side of the park and watched for a while why are we waiting jamie said just for a minute its been a minute already no it hasnt she was watching the man in coveralls going around the side of the house he looked like the meter reader for the utility company except that he was big with a bad wig and a trimmed black goatee that she had seen somewhere before and the meter readers never came to the front they always entered from the back alley she was thinking that if this guy was a bounty hunter he had the right to enter her property without warning and without a warrant he could break down the door if he wanted to he had the right to search her apartment to go through her things to take her computer and inspect the hard drive he could do whatever he wanted to do to apprehend a fugitive but she wasnt a can we go in mom jamie whined please her son was right about one thing they couldnt just stand there there was a sandbox in the middle of the park several kids maids and mothers sitting around lets go play in the sandbox i dont want to yes its for babies just for a while james he stamped his foot and sat down on the edge of the sandbox he kicked sand irritably while alex dialed her assistant amy i am wondering about biogen the company that bought my fathers cell line we dont have any motions pending do we no california supreme court is a year from now so whats going onshe wondered what kind of suit was biogen bringing now call the judges clerk up in ventura find out what this is about okay have we heard from my father not for a while okay it actually wasnt okay because she was now having the strong feeling that all this had to do with her father or at least with her fathers cells the bounty hunters had brought an ambulancewith a doctor in the backbecause they were going to take a sample or do some surgical procedure long needles shed seen sunlight glint on long needles wrapped in plastic as the doctor at the back of the ambulance shuffled things about then it hit herthey wanted to take their cells they wanted cells from her or from her son she couldnt imagine why but they clearly felt entitled to take them should she call the police not yet she decided if there were a warrant for her failure to appear theyd simply take her into custody and then what would she do about jamie she shook her head right now she needed time to figure out what was going on time to get everything straightened out what was she supposed to do she wanted to call her father but he hadnt been answering for days if these guys knew where she lived they would know what kind of car she had and amy she said howd you like to drive my car for a couple of days the bmw sure but and ill drive yours alex said

over in front of a white spanish apartment building with wroughtiron gates in front alex was unpreparedby temperament and training for the situation in which she now found herself all her life had been spent in the sunlight she obeyed the rules she was an officer of the court she played the game she didnt run yellow lights she didnt park in the red she didnt cheat on her taxes at the firm she was regarded as bythebook stodgy she told clients rules are made to be followed not twisted and she meant it five years earlier when she discovered her husband was screwing around on her she threw him out within an hour of learning the truth she packed his bag and put it outside the door and had the locks changed when he came back from his fishing trip she spoke through the door and told him to get lost matt was actually screwing one of her best friendsthat was matts wayand she never again spoke to that woman of course jamie had to see his father and she made sure that happened she delivered her son to matt at the appointed time on the dot not that he ever returned her son on time but it was alexs view that the world stabilized one person at a time if she did her part she felt eventually others might do theirs at work she was called idealistic impractical unrealistic she responded that in lawyerspeakrealistic was another word fordishonest she stuck to her guns but it was true that sometimes she felt she limited herself to the kinds of cases that did not challenge her illusions the head of the firm robert a koch had said as much youre like a conscientious objector alex you let other people do the fighting but sometimes we have to fight sometimes we cant avoid conflict koch was an exmarine like her father same kind of roughandtumble talk proud of it shed always shrugged it off now she wasnt shrugging anything off she didnt know what was going on but she felt pretty sure she couldnt just talk her way out of it she was also sure nobody was going to stick a needle into her or her son to prevent that she would do whatever had to be done whateverhad to be done she replayed in her mind the incident at the school she hadnt had a gun she didnt own a gun but she wished she had had one she thoughtif they were trying to do something to my son could i have killed them and she thoughtyes i could have killed them and she knew it was true a whitetoyota highlander with a battered front bumper pulled up she saw amy sitting in the car alex said jamie lets go finally he started toward their apartment but she steered him in another direction wherere we going were taking a little trip she said where he was suspicious i dont want to take a trip without hesitation she said ill buy you a psp she had steadfastly refused for a year to buy him one of those electronic game

thought you might want it what package it came to the office last week you never opened it you were at trial with the mick crowley rape case you remember that political reporter who likes little boys it was a small fedex box alex tore it open dumped the contents on her lap a cheap cellular phone the kind you bought and put a card in two prepaid telephone cards a tinfoilwrapped packet of cash five thousand in hundreddollar bills and a cryptic note in case of trouble dont use your credit cards turn off your cell phone dont tell anyone where you are going borrow somebodys car page me when you are

thats what my boyfriend wants to do she said he wants to go to pebble beach and watch the old car parade thats a great idea alex said take my car really i dont knowwhat if something happened to it i

ringingno doubt the new york client telephoning back clients were impatient they expected realtors to be available every minute of the day she went into the other room to take the call and opened her documents to review the numbers five minutes later her daughter yelled bye mom and georgia heard the front door slam it left her distinctly uneasy she just had afeeling she dialed her husbands lab in bethesda for once rob was not in meetings and she was put right through she told him the story what do you think we should do she asked search her room he said promptly we have an obligation okay she said ill call the office and tell them ill be late im flying later he said but let me know chapter barton williamssboeing rolled to a stop at the hopkins private terminal in cleveland ohio and the whine of the engines wound down the interior of the aircraft was luxuriously appointed there were two bedrooms two full baths with showers and a dining room seating eight but the master bedroom which took up the entire rear third of the plane with a kingsize bed and a fur throw and mood lighting was where barton spent most of the flight he needed only one flight attendant but he invariably flew with three he liked company he liked laughter and chatter he liked young smooth flesh on the fur with the mood lighting low warm reddish sensual and hell forty thousand feet up in the air was the only place he could be sure he was safe from the wife the thought of the wife dampened his mood he looked at the parrot standing on the perch in the living room of the plane the parrot said you kidnapped me whats your name again barton said riley doghouse riley speaking in a funny voice dont be smart with me my name is gerard thats right gerard i dont much like it sounds foreign how about jerry that suit you no the parrot said it doesnt why not its stupid its a stupid idea there was an uncomfortable silence is it really barton williams said with a hint of menace in his voice williams knew this was a mere animal but he was not accustomed to being called stupidespecially by a birdand no one had done so in many many years he felt his enthusiasm for this gift cooling jerry he said you better be getting along with me because i own you now people cant be owned and you aint people jerry youre a damn bird barton stepped close to the perch now let me tell you how its going to be im going to give you to my wife and i want you to behave i want you to be amusing i want you to compliment and flatter her and make her feel good is that clear everyone else does gerard said he was mimicking the voice of the pilot who heard it from the cockpit and snapped his head around to look back jesus i get sick of the old fart sometimes gerard continued barton williams frowned next he heard a precise imitation of the sound of jet engines in flight and superimposed on that a girls voice one of the flight attendants jenny are you going to blow him or am i your turn sigh ohkay dont forget to take him his drink click of a door opening and closing barton williams began to turn red the bird continued oh barton oh give it to me oh youre so big oh barton yes baby yes big boy ooh i love it so big so big aaaaaah barton williams stared at the bird i believe he said that you will not be a welcome addition to my household youre the reason our kids are ugly little darlin gerard said thats enough from you barton said turning away oh barton oh give it to me oh youre so big oh barton williams threw the cover over the birds cage jenny honeyyouve got family in dayton dont you yes mr williams you think anybody in your family would enjoy a talking bird uh well actuallyyes mr williams im sure they would love it good good i would appreciate it if you delivered him down there today of course mr williams and if by some chance he said your family is not appreciative of feathered companions just have them tie very heavy weights to his legs and drop him in the river because i never want to see this bird again yes mr williams i heard that said the bird good barton williams said after the old manslimousine had gone jenny stood on the tarmac holding the covered cage what am i going to do with this thing she said my daddy hates birds he shoots em take him to a pet store the pilot said or give him to somebody wholl ship him to utah or mexico or someplace like that refreshing pawswas an upscale store in shaker heights there were mostly puppies in the store the young guy behind the counter was cute maybe a little younger than jenny was he had a good body she walked in carrying gerard in his covered cage you got any parrots no we just have dogs he smiled at her whatve you got there im stan his name tag saidstan milgram hi stan im jenny and this is gerard hes an african grey lets have a look at

yougive away i have to drive out there stan milgram said in a couple of days i could take him with me i know shed like him but uh whatre you doing later tonight i could be free jenny said chapter the warehousewas located near the airport in medan it had a skylight so the lighting in the room was good and the young orang in the cage appeared healthy enough brighteyed and alert he seemed to have recovered completely from the darts but gorevitch paced back and forth intensely frustrated glancing at his watch on the table nearby his video camera lay on its side the case cracked muddy water draining out of it gorevitch would have taken it apart to dry it but he lacked the tools he lackedhe lacked off to one side zanger the network representative said what are you going to do now were waiting for another bloody camera gorevitch said he turned to the dhl rep a young malay man in a bright yellow uniform how much longer now they said within the hour sir gorevitch snorted they said that two hours ago yes sir but the plane has left bekasi and is on its way to us bekasi was on the north coast of java eight hundred miles away and the camera is on the plane i believe so yes gorevitch paced avoiding zangers accusatory stare it was all a comedy of errors in the jungle gorevitch had worked to resuscitate the ape for almost an hour before the animal showed signs of life then he had struggled to bind the animal and tranquilize it againnot too much this timeand then monitor the animal with care to prevent the creature from going into adrenaline shock while gorevitch brought him north to medan the nearest big town with an airport the orang survived the journey without incident ending up in the warehouse where he cursed like a dutch sailor gorevitch notified zanger who immediately flew in from new york but by the time zanger arrived the ape had developed laryngitis and no longer spoke except for a raspy whisper what the hell good is that zanger said you cant hear him it wont matter gorevitch said well tape him and then dub in his voice later you know lipsynch him youll dub in his voice nobody will know are you out of your mindeverybody will know every lab in the world will go over this video with sophisticated equipment theyll spot a dub in five minutes all right gorevitch said then well wait until he gets better zanger didnt like that either he sounds quite ill did he catch a cold somewhere possible gorevitch said in fact he was almost certain the ape had caught his own cold during the mouthtomouth resuscitation it was a mild cold for gorevitch but appeared to be serious for the orang who was now bent over in spasms of coughing he needs a vet cant gorevitch said hes a protected animal and we stole him remember youstole him zanger said and if youre not careful youll kill him as well hes young hell recover and indeed the following day the ape was talking again but coughing spasmodically and spitting up ugly yellowgreen gobs gorevitch decided hed better film the animal now so he went to get his equipment from the car stumbled and dropped the camera in a muddy ditch cracked the case open all this not ten feet from the warehouse door and of course in the entire city of medan they did not seem to be able to lay their hands on a decent video camera so they had had to fly one in from java they were waiting for the camera now while the ape swore and hacked and coughed and spat at them from inside his cage zanger stood just out of range shaking his head christ what a cockup and once again gorevitch turned to the malay kid and said how much longer the kid just shook his head and shrugged and inside the cage the orang coughed and swore chapter georgia bellarmino opened the door to her daughters bedroom and began a swift examination the room was a mess of course crumbs in the creases of the rumpled bedcovers scratched cds on the floor knockedover coke cans beneath the bed along with a dirty hairbrush a curling iron and an empty tube of selftanner georgia pulled open the drawers of the bedside table revealing a clutter of chewinggum wrappers balledup underwear breath mints mascara photos from last years prom matches a calculator dirty socks old issues ofteen vogue andpeople and a pack of cigarettes which didnt make her happy then to the dresser drawers riffling through them quickly feeling all the way to the back then the closet which took her quite a while a jumble of shoes and sneakers at the bottom the cabinet under the bathroom sink and even the dirty clothes hamper she found nothing to explain the bruises of course she thought there was hardly any purpose to putting a hamper in the room since jennifer just dropped her clothes all over the bathroom floor georgia bellarmino bent over and picked them up not really thinking about it that was when she noticed the streaks on the tile floor of the bathroom rubber streaks faint in parallel she knew what had caused those streaks a stepladder looking up at the ceiling she saw a panel that provided an entrance to the attic there were smudged fingerprints on that panel georgia went to get a stepladder she pushed the panel aside and needles and syringes tumbled out clattering onto the floor dear godshe thought she reached up into the attic space feeling around her hand touched a stack of cardboard tubes like toothpaste she brought them out they all bore medical labelslupron gonalf follestim fertility drugs what was her daughter doing she decided not to call her husband he would get too upset instead she took out her cell phone and dialed the school chapter in thechicago offices of dr martin bennett the intercom was buzzing but dr bennett paid no attention the biopsy report was worse than he had expected much worse he ran his fingers along the edge of the paper wondering how he would tell his patient martin bennett was fiftyfive he had been a practicing internist for nearly a third of a century and had delivered bad news to many patients in his day but it never got easier especially if they were young with young children he glanced at the pictures of his sons on his desk they were both in college now tad was a senior at stanford bill was at columbia and bill was premed a knock on the door and his nurse beverly stuck her head in im sorry dr bennett but you werent answering the intercom and i thought it was important i know i was justtrying to think how to put it he stood up behind the desk ill see andrea now beverly shook her head andrea hasnt arrived she said im talking about the other woman what other woman beverly slipped into the office and closed the door behind her she lowered her voice your daughter she said what are you talking about i dont have a daughter well theres a young woman in the waiting room who says shes your daughter thats impossible bennett said who is she beverly glanced at a note card her name is murphy she lives in seattle her mother works at the university shes about twentyeight and she has a toddler with her maybe a year and a half little girl murphy seattle bennett was thinking back twentyeight you say no no impossible he had had his share of affairs in college and even in medical school but hed married emily almost thirty years ago and since then the only times he had been unfaithful had been at medical conferences true that was at least twice a year in cancn in switzerland somewhere exotic but hed only started that about ten fifteen years ago he just didnt think it was possible hed have a child that old beverly said i guess you never know for surewill you see her no ill tell her beverly said she dropped her voice to a whisper but we dont want her making a scene in front of the patients she seems like she might be a little uh unstable and if shes not your daughter maybe you should set her straight in private bennett nodded slowly he dropped back into his chair okay he said show her in big surprise huhthe woman standing in the doorway bouncing a child in her arms was an unattractive blonde of medium height wearing jeans and a tshirt grunge clothes her babys face was dirty dripping snot sorry i didnt dress for the occasion but you know how it is bennett stood behind his desk please come in miss uh murphy elizabeth murphy she nodded to the baby this is bess im dr bennett he waved her to the seat on the other side of the desk he looked at her closely as she sat down he saw no resemblance at all not the slightest he himself was darkhaired fairskinned slightly overweight she was olivecomplexioned railthin brittle tense yeah i know she said youre thinking i dont look anything like you but with my natural hair color and more weight you can see the family thing im sorry bennett said sitting down but to be frank i dont see it thats okay she said shrugging i figure it must be a shock to you my showing up at your office like this its certainly a surprise i wanted to call ahead and warn you but then i decided i should just come in case you refused to see me i see miss murphy what makes you believe you are my daughter oh im yours all right theres no question about it she was speaking with an uncanny confidence bennett said your mother says she knows me no ever met me god no he gave a sigh of relief then im afraid i dont understand ill come right to the point you did your residency in dallas at southern memorial he frowned yes all the residents had their blood typed in case they were needed as emergency blood donors that was a long time ago he was thinking back about thirty years now yeah well they kept the blood dad again he heard that conviction in her voice meaning what she shifted in her seat you want to hold your granddaughter not at the moment thank you she gave a crooked smile youre not what i expected i thought a doctor would be moresympathetic theyve got more sympathetic people at the methadone clinic in bellevue miss murphy he said let me but when i got off the drugs and i had this beautiful daughter i wanted to make sense of my life i wanted my baby to know her grandparents and i wanted to finally meet you it was time bennett decided to cut this short he stood up miss murphy you realize that i can have genetic testing done and it will show yes she said i realize that she tossed a folded sheet of paper onto his desk he opened it slowly it was a report from a genetic laboratory in dallas he scanned the paragraphs he felt dizzy it says you are definitely my father she said one chance in four billion that you are not they tested my genetic material against your stored blood this is crazy he said dropping back in his chair i thought you would congratulate me she said it wasnt easy to figure it out my mom was living in st louis twentyeight years ago she was married at the time bennett had gone to medical school in st louis but she doesnt know me she had artificial insemination from an anonymous donor which was you bennett felt dizzy i figured the donor must have been a medical student she continued because she went to the clinic at the medical school and they had their own sperm bank medical students donated sperm for money back then right yes twentyfive dollars there you go good pocket money in those days and you could do it what once a week go in there and pop off something like that the clinic burned down fifteen years ago and all the records were lost but i got the student yearbooks and searched them each year the class was a hundred and twenty students half female that means sixty males eliminate asians and other minorities you have about thirtyfive a year back then sperm didnt keep for more than a year or so i ended up with about a hundred and forty names to check it went faster than i thought bennett slumped down in his chair but you want to know the truth when i saw your picture in the medical yearbook i knew immediately something about your hair your eyebrows she shrugged anyway here i am but this was never supposed to happen bennett said we were all anonymous donors untraceable no one would ever know whether we had children or not and back then our anonymity was a given yeah well those days are over but i never agreed to be your parent thats my point she shrugged what can i say i wasnt having a child i was helping infertile couples so they could have a child well im your child but you have parents im your child dr bennett and i can prove it in court there was a silence they stared at each other the baby drooled and squirmed finally he said why did you come here i wanted to meet my biological father well youve met him and i wanted him to fulfill his duties and obligations because of what he did to me so there it was finally out on the table miss murphy he said slowly youll get nothing from me he stood she stood too the reason im an addict she said is because of your genes dont be absurd your father was an alcoholic and you had drug troubles of your own you carry the genes for addiction what genes ags heroin dependence dat cocaine addiction you have those genes and so do i you gave me those genes you never should have donated defective sperm in the first place what are you talking about he said suddenly agitated this woman was clearly following a memorized script he felt danger i donated sperm thirty years ago there were no tests back thenand there is no responsibility now you knew she snapped you knew you had a problem with cocaine you knew it ran in your family but you sold your sperm anyway you put your damaged dangerous sperm on the market not caring who you infected infected you had no business doing what you did youre a disgrace to the medical profession burdening other people with your genetic diseases and not giving a damn through his agitation he somehow found selfcontrol he reached for the door miss murphy he said i have nothing more to say to you youre throwing me out youll regret this she said youll regret this very very much and she stormed out of the office feeling suddenly drained bennett collapsed into the chair behind his desk he was in a state of shock he stared at his desk at the files for his waiting patients none of it seemed to matter now he dialed his attorney and explained the situation quickly does she want money the attorney said i assume so did she tell you how much jeff bennett said youre not taking this seriously unfortunately we have to the attorney said this happened in missouri and missouri had no clear laws regarding paternity from artificial insemination back then cases like yours were never a problem until quite recently but as a rule in paternity disputes the court orders child support shes twentyeight yes and she has parents still she can make an argument in court based on this gene thing she can claim reckless endangerment she can claim child abuse and whatever else she can pull out of a hat maybe shell get something from a judge maybe she wont remember paternity rulings are stacked against males say you get a woman pregnant and she decides to have an abortion she can do that without consulting you but if she decides to give birth youll pay support even though you never agreed to have a child with her the court will say its your responsibility not to have gotten her pregnant in the first place or suppose you do genetic testing on your kids and discover theyre not yoursyour wife cheated on you the court will still require you to pay support for kids that arent yours but shes twentyeight years old shes not a child the question is does a prominent physician want to go to court on a case that involves not supporting his own daughter no bennett said thats right you dont she knows that and i assume she knows missouri law too so wait until she calls back arrange a meeting and call me if she has an attorney all the better make sure he comes meanwhile fax me that genetic report she gave you im going to have to pay her off count on it the attorney said and hung up chapter the desk officer at the rockville police station was an attractive smoothskinned black woman of twentyfive the desk plate read officer j lowry her uniform was crisp georgia bellarmino pushed her daughter close to the other side of the desk she set the paper bag of syringes in front of the policewoman and said officer lowry i want to know why my daughter has these things but she refuses to tell me her daughter glared at her i hate you mom officer lowry showed no surprise she glanced at the syringes she turned to georgias daughter were these prescribed to you by a physician yes do they involve matters of reproduction yes how old are you sixteen can i see some id shes sixteen all right georgia bellarmino said leaning forward and i want to know im sorry maam the policewoman said if she is sixteen and these drugs involve reproductive issues you have no right to be informed what do you mean i have no right to be informed shes mydaughter shessixteen thats the law maam but that law is for abortions she isnt having an abortion i dont know what the hell she is doing these are fertility drugs shesshooting up fertility drugs im sorry i cant help you on this you mean my daughter is allowed to inject drugs into her body and i am not allowed to know what is going on not if she wont tell you no and what about her doctor officer lowry shook her head he cant tell you either doctorpatient privilege georgia bellarmino collected the syringes and threw them back in the bag this is ridiculous i dont make the laws the policewoman said i just enforce them they were drivinghome honey georgia said are you trying to get pregnant no sitting there with her arms folded furious i mean youre sixteen that shouldnt be a problemso what are you doing you made me feel like an idiot honey im just concerned no youre not youre a nosy evil bitch i hate you and i hate this car it went on like this for a while until finally georgia drove her daughter back to school jennifer got out of the car slamming the door andyou made me late for french it was anexhausting morning and she had canceled two appointments now she had to try and reschedule the clients georgia went into the office set the bag of needles on the floor and started dialing the office manager florence walked by and saw the bag wow she said arent you a little old for this its not me georgia said irritably thennot your daughter georgia nodded yeah its that dr vandickien florence said who down in miami these teenage girls take hormones pump up their ovaries sell their eggs to him and pocket the money and do what georgia said buy breast implants georgia sighed great she said just great she wanted her husband to talk to jennifer but unfortunately rob was on a flight to ohio where they were making a tv segment about him that discussionwhich was sure to be fierywould have to wait chapter riding theunderground tram from the senate office building to the senate dining room senator robert wilson dvermont turned to senator dianne feinstein dcalifornia and said i think we ought to be more proactive on this genetic thing for example we should consider a law that would prevent young women from selling their eggs for profit young girls already doing that bob feinstein said they sell their eggs now why to pay for college maybe a few mostly they do it to buy a new car for their boyfriend or plastic surgery for themselves senator wilson looked puzzled how long hasthat been going on he said a couple of years now feinstein said maybe in california everywhere bob a teenager in new hampshire did it to make bail for her boyfriend and this doesnt trouble you i dont like it feinstein said i think its illadvised i think medically the procedure has dangers i think these girls may be risking their reproductive futures but what would be the basis for banning it their bodies their eggs feinstein shrugged anyway the boats sailed bob quite a while ago chapter not again ellis levine found his mother on the second floor of the polo ralph lauren store on madison and seventysecond she was standing in front of the mirror wearing a creamcolored linen suit with a green scarf she was turning this way and that hello dear she said when she saw him are you going to make another scene mom he said what are you doing buying a few things for summer dear we talked about that ellis said just a few things his mother said for summer do you like the cuffs on these pants mom weve been here before she frowned and fluffed her white hair absently do you like the scarf she said i think its a bit much we have to talk ellis said are we having lunch the spray didnt work he said oh i dont know she brushed her cheek i felt a little moisturization for about a week afterward but not a great deal no and you kept shopping i hardly shop at all anymore three thousand dollars last week oh dont worry i took a lot of those things back she tugged at the scarf i think that green does a funny thing to my complexion makes me look sick but a pink scarf might be nice i wonder if they have this in pink ellis was watching her intently with a growing sense of foreboding something was wrong with his mother he decided she was standing at the mirror in exactly the same place she had been weeks before when she showed a total indifference to him to his message to her family situation to her financial situation her attitude was completely inappropriate as an accountant ellis had a horror of people who were inappropriate about money money was real it was tangible it was hard facts and spreadsheet figures those facts and figures were not a matter of opinion it didnt depend on how you looked at it his mother was not recognizing the cold reality of her financial situation he watched her smile asking the salesgirl if the scarf came in pink no the salesgirl said he didnt make pink this year they only had green or white his mother asked to try the white the salesgirl walked away his mother smiled at him very inappropriate almost as if it might be early dementiahe thoughtit might be the first sign why are you looking at me that way what way mom im not crazy youre not putting me in a home why would you even say that i know you boys want the money thats why youre selling the condos in vail and the virgin islands for the money youre greedy the bunch of you you are like vultures waiting for your parents to die and if we wont die youll hurry it up put us in a home get us out of the way get us declared insane thats your plan isnt it the salesgirl came back with a white scarf his mother draped it around her neck flung it over her shoulder with a flamboyant gesture well mr smartypants youre not putting me in any home you get that through your head right now she turned to the salesgirl ill take it she said still smiling the brothers met that evening jeff who was handsome and had connections in every restaurant in town got them a table near the waterfall at sushi hana even early the place was packed with models and actresses and jeff was making plenty of eye contact annoyed ellis said howre things at home jeff shrugged fine sometimes i have to work late you know no i dont because im not a big investment banker and the girls dont wink at me like they wink at you aaron the youngest brother the lawyer was talking on his cell phone he finished flipped it shut knock it off you two its the same conversation youve been having since high school what about mom ellis said its what i told you on the phone its spooky shes smiling and happy she doesnt care three grand last week she doesnt care shes buying more than ever so much for that gene spray aaron said whered you get that anyway some guy works at some company in california biogen jeff had been looking over his shoulder now he turned back

mistake i cant remember they got an ipo coming up but itll tank for sure aaron turned to ellis you think that spray you got is affecting mom no i dont think so i think the damn stuff just didnt work but if they had contamination aaron said stop being a lawyer some cousin of moms her son sent it as a favor to us but gene therapy is dangerous aaron said there have been deaths from gene therapy lots of them ellis sighed aaron he said were not suing anybody i think were looking at the start of you know mental deterioration alzheimers or something shes only sixtytwo it can start that early aaron shook his head come on ellie she was in perfect health she was sharp now youre telling me shes losing it it could be the spray contamination jeff reminded them he was smiling at a girl jeff will you

ellis said she thinks were going to put her in a home and we may have to aaron said which will be very expensive but if we do its because of that genetics company you know the public has no sympathy for these biotech companies public opinion polls run ninetytwo percent against them theyre perceived as unscrupulous scumbags indifferent to human life gm crops trashing the environment patenting genes grabbing up our common heritage while no one is looking charging thousands of dollars for drugs that cost pennies pretending they do research when they really dont they just buy other peoples work pretending they have high research costs when they spend most of their money on advertising and then lying in the advertising sneaky scummy sloppy moneygrabbing schmucks itd be a slamdunk case

they cant be more than fifteen ellis said wrinkling his nose theyve got drinks on the table aaron said he has two kids in school howre things at home aaron said fuck you lets stay on the topic aaron said maybe moms losing it and maybe shes not but were going to need a lot of money if she goes into a home im not sure we can afford it so what are you saying i want to know more about biogen and that gene spray they sent us a lot more you sound like youre already planning the lawsuit just thinking ahead aaron said chapter this is on man riding his skateboard billy cleever angry sixthgrader came ripping off the playground with an oldschool aerial came down into a backside threesixty with a tail grab then heelflipped onto the sidewalk he did it flawlessly which was good because he was feeling hed lost some of his cool today the four kids following behind were quiet instead of yelling like usual and this was the big downhill run to market street in san diego but they were quiet like they had lost confidence in him billy cleever had been humiliated today his hand hurt like a mother he told the stupid nurse just to put a bandaid on it but she insisted on a big white thing he ripped it off the minute school was out but still looked like crap he looked like an invalid something sick humiliated at age eleven billy cleever was fivenine and pounds solid muscle for a kid his age and a good foot taller than anybody else in the school he was bigger than most of the teachers even nobody messed with him that little skinshit jamie that nimrod doof with buck teeth he should have stayed out of billys way markie lester the pester was throwing him a football and when he went back to receive it he tripped over bucky beaver and fell taking bucky with him billy was pissed and embarrassed sprawling like that in front of everybody with sarah hardy and the others giggling the kid was still lying on the ground so billy gave him a couple of kicks with his vansnothing really just a warningand when the kid got up he smacked him a little no biggie and the next thing he knows hes got monkeyboy jumping on his back yanking his hair and growling in his ear like a fucking ape and billy reached back and grabbed for him and monkeyboy took a bite likewhoa pissing pain seeing stars of course the monitor mr snotty nosedrip does nothing whining break it up boys break it up boys they put monkeyboy in detention and called his mother to come and pick him up but his mother obviously didnt take him home which was too bad for him because there they were now walking along at the bottom of the hill starting to cross the baseball field jamie and monkeyboy and this is on billy hits them side on moving fast and the two go flying like bowling pins right next to the dugout by the side of the field jamie skids on his chin on the dirt raising a cloud of brown dust and monkeyboy bangs into the chainlink backstop behind home plate off to one side billys buddies are yellingblood we want blood the little kid jamie is moaning in the dust so billy goes right for monkeyboy he charges him with his deck trucks out swinging the skateboard hard and catches the little black fucker back of the ear thinking thatll teach him a lesson monkeyboys legs go out he flops on the ground like a rag doll and billy kicks him a good one right under the chin lifts his ass off the dirt a little that one does but billy doesnt want to get that monkey blood on his vans so he comes back swinging the deck again figuring to whack the monkey square in the face maybe break his nose and jaw make him even uglier than he is but monkeyboy springs to one side the deck clangs the fencekawangkawangkwang and monkeyboy sinks his teeth into billys wrist and bitesfucking hard billy screams and drops his deck and monkeyboy hangs on billy is feeling his hand get numb theres blood pouring down from the arm down monkeyboys chin and hes snarling like a dog and his eyes are popping out staring at billy and its like his hair is raised or something and billy thinks in an instant of pure panicshit this black fucks gonna eat me by then his skateneck buddies run up all swinging their boards at the monkey four boards whacking him downside the head while billy is yelling and the monkey is growlingit takes forever until monkeyboy drops the hand springs at markie lester and hits him full in the chest and the pester goes down and the others all chase after them as they roll in the dust while billy nurses his bleeding arm a few seconds later when the pain is bearable and billy looks up he sees the monkey has scrambled up the chainlink backstop and is maybe fifteen feet in the air above them staring down at them while his buds all stand below and yell and shake their decks at him but nothing is happening billy staggers to his feet and says you look like a bunch of monkeys we want him to come down well he wont billy said hes not stupid he knows well kick the shit out of him if he comes down least i will so how we get him down billy is feeling mean now blind mean he wants to hurt something so he goes right over to jamie and starts kicking the kid trying to hit him in his little nuts but the kid is rolling and yelling for help fucking baby that he is some of the buds dont like it hey leave im alone hey hes a little kid but billy is thinkingfuck it i want that monkey down here and this will do

and see billy trudges home carrying his board and the others drag on after him and hes thinkingoh shit what did i just promise to do chapter stan milgramhad begun the long trip to see his aunt in california but he had only been driving for an hour before gerard started to complain it stinks gerard said perched in the backseat it stinks to high heaven he looked out the window what hellhole is this its columbus ohio stan said disgusting gerard said you know what they say stan said columbus is cleveland without the glitter the bird said nothing you know what glitter is yes shut up and drive gerard sounded cranky and he shouldnt be stan felt considering how well the parrot had been treated the last couple of days stan had gone online to find out what greys ate and had gotten gerard some delicious apples and special greens he had left the tv on in the pet shop at night for gerard to watch and after a day gerard had stopped nipping at his fingers he even allowed stan to put him on his shoulder without biting his ear are we almost there gerard said no weve only been gone an hour how much farther is it we have to drive three days gerard three days that is twentyfour times three that is seventytwo hours stan frowned he had never heard of a bird that did math whered you learn that i am a man of many talents youre not a man at all he laughed was that from a movie sometimes the bird repeated lines from movies he was sure of it dave gerard said in a monotone this conversation can serve no purpose anymore goodbye oh wait i know that one itsstar wars fasten your seat belts its going to be a bumpy night it was a womans voice stan frowned some airplane movie they seek him here they seek him there those frenchies seek him everywhere i know thats not a movie thats poetry sink me now he sounded british i give up stan said so do i gerard said with an elaborate sigh how much farther is it three days stan said the parrot stared out the window at the passing city well theyre saved from the blessings of civilization he said in a cowboy drawl and he began to make the sounds of a plunking banjo later in the day the parrot began to sing french songs or maybe they were arab songs stan couldnt be sure anyway some foreign language it seemed he had gone to a live concert or at least heard a recording of one because he mimicked the crowd sounds and the instruments tuning up and the cheering as the performers came on before he sang the song itself it sounded like he was singing didi or something like that it was interesting for a while kind of like hearing radio from a foreign country but gerard tended to repeat himself on a narrow side road they were stuck behind a woman driver stan tried to pass her once or twice but never could after a while gerard started to sayle soleil cest beau and then make a loud sound like a gunshot is that french stan asked more gunshotsle soleil cest beau bang le soleil cest beau bang le soleil cest beau bang gerard the bird saidles femmes au volant cest la lachet personifi he made a rumbling soundpourquoi elle ne dpasse pasoh ou merde des travaux the lady driver finally turned off to the right but she was slow making the turn and stan had to brake slightly as he went past her il ne faut jamais freinercomme disait le vieux pre bugatti les voitures sont faites pour rouler pas pour sarrter stan sighed i dont understand a word you are saying gerard merde les flics arrivent he began to wail like a police siren thats enough stan said he turned on the radio by now it was late afternoon theyd passed maryville and were heading toward st louis traffic was picking up are we almost there gerard said stan sighed never mind it was going to be a long trip chapter lynn saton the edge of the tub and used the washcloth gently to clean the gash behind his ear dave lynn said tell me what happened she could see the cut was deep but he wasnt complaining they came after us mom jamie was excited moving his arms he was covered in dust and had bruises on his stomach and shoulders but was otherwise not badly hurt we didnt do anything sixthgraders evil dudes jamie she said let dave tell me how did you get this cut

while jamie im tired see if you can lie back and rest i cant its boring its going to be a while she said again she flipped open the new cell phone found the number she had entered for her old childhood friend she didnt know whom else to call lynn was always there for her when alex and her husband were breaking up she and the baby had gone down to see lynn and henry the little kids both named jamie played together alex had stayed there a week but now she was having trouble getting lynn on the phone at first she worried she didnt have the right number then she thought there was something wrong with her cheap cell phone but then she got the answering machine and now hello hello who is this lynn its alex listen i oh alex im really sorry i cant talk now what not now im sorry later but what she heard the dial tone lynn had already hung up she stared forward at the red lights of the creeping freeway whos that her son asked aunt lynn she said but she couldnt talk they just sounded busy so are we still going there maybe tomorrow she pulled off the freeway at san clemente and started to look for a motel for some reason she was strangely disoriented by the fact that she could not see lynn she hadnt realized that shed been counting on it wherere we going mom jamie sounded anxious well stay at a motel what motel im looking he stared at her do you know where it is no jamie im looking they passed one a holiday inn but it was too big and it looked exposed she found a best western unobtrusive on camino real and pulled in she told jamie to stay in the car while she went into the lobby a pimply gangly kid stood behind the counter he was tapping his fingers on the polished granite surface humming a little to himself he seemed restless hi alex said do you have a room for tonight yes maam id like one just for yourself no for me and my son he glanced out the door at jamie he under twelve he was still clicking his fingernails yes why if he goes to the pool you gotta accompany him thats fine still tapping the counter she gave him a credit card and he swiped it all the while tapping out a beat with his other hand it was getting on her nerves can i ask you why

very unusual she said my dad used to sing it i see hes dead now i see killed himself im sorry to hear that shotgun im sorry want to see it she blinked maybe some other time i keep it right here he said nodding to the underside of the counter not loaded of course tapping singing trouble is the only place ive been ill just sign in alex said he gave her back her card and she filled out the form still clicking all the time she thought about going elsewhere but she was tired jamie was waiting she had to feed him buy some new clothes for him a toothbrush all that there you go the kid said giving her the room keys it wasnt until she was back in her car driving to a parking spot near the room that she remembered she was not supposed to have used her credit card too late now mom im hungry i know honey well get something i want a burger okay we can do that she drove through the parking lot and back onto the street better to get him fed before they went to the room chapter there were two moregunshots as lynn ran into the backyard her daughter tracy was screaming dave was up in the tree yelling and shaking the branches and jamie lay on the ground with blood pouring from his head she felt sick she started forward and tracy screamed mom stay down the gunshots seemed to be coming from the street whoever it was was shooting through their wooden slat fence there was the sound of distant sirens she could not take her eyes off jamie she started to move toward him more gunshots and snapping of leaves in the tree they were shooting at dave dave was whooping and growling shaking the branches angrily he yelled you dead you dead boy dave be quiet she shouted she started crawling toward jamie tracy was shouting into the cell phone giving the address to jamie was moaning on the grass he was all she saw she hoped that henry had gone out the front door and would see who it was and would not get hurt it was obviously someone trying to get dave the sirens were louder she heard shouts and running footsteps on the street some car had pulled up bright lights shining through the slats of the fence casting streaks of shadow overhead dave gave a war whoop and was gone tracy was yelling lynn got to jamie the blood was thick around his head jamie jamie she got to her knees turned him over gently he had a huge gusher on his forehead red blood pouring down one side of his face he smiled weakly hi mom jamie where are you hit not where jamie i fell from the tree she had the edge of her skirt in her hand was cautiously wiping the wound she saw no bullet hole just a huge abrasion bleeding profusely honey you werent shot no mom he shook his head it wasnt me anyway he was after dave who was billy lynn looked up at the tree overhead branches gently swaying in the light of the headlamps dave was gone daves first jump landed him on the sidewalk and he began running after the fleeing billy cleever who was heading down the street running home dave could move swiftly when he wanted to loping on all fours he ran parallel to the sidewalk staying on the grass because the concrete hurt his knuckles he was growling continuously as he closed in on billy at the end of the block billy turned and saw dave bearing down on him he held his gun in two shaking hands and fired a shot then another dave kept coming along the street people were looking out their windows all the windows glowed blue from the tv sets inside billy turned to run and dave caught him and slammed his head into a traffic signpost it rang with the impact billy tried to turn but he was terrified dave held him firmly and smashed his head into the concrete he would have killed him for sure but the sound of approaching sirens made him pause and look up in that moment billy kicked scrambled to his feet and ran up the driveway of the nearest house he climbed into a car parked in the driveway dave chased him billy slammed the door and locked it just as dave landed on the windshield he slid over the surface of the hood peering into the interior billy aimed his gun but he was too shaken too terrified to fire dave dropped down to the passenger side tried the door yanking again and again at the handle billy was gasping for breath watching him then dave dropped down again completely out of sight the sirens came closer billy realizedhis predicament slowly the police were coming he was locked in the car with a gun in his hand his blood and fingerprints smeared all over it powder marks and a red cut where the hammer had nipped him he didnt know how to shoot not really he had just wanted to scare them is all the police were going to find him here trapped in this car cautiously he peered out the passenger window trying to see dave black and screaming dave leapt up and slammed against the window billy screamed and jumped back the gun fired hitting the dashboard plastic splinters cutting into his arm the car filling with smoke he dropped the gun onto the floorboard leaned back in the seat he was gasping for breath sirens closer maybe they would find him here but it was selfdefense that would be obvious monkeyboy was a vicious animal the police would take one look at him and realize that everything billy had done was selfdefense he had to protect himself the monkey kid was vicious he looked like an ape and he acted like an ape he was a killer he belonged behind bars in a zoo flashing red lights sweeping the roof of the car the sirens stopped billy heard a bullhorn this is the police come out of the car now very slow with your hands where we can see them i cant he yelled hes out there come out of the car now the voice boomed with your hands up billy waited awhile then came out holding his hands high blinking in the bright spotlight of the police cars a cop came up and shoved him onto the ground he snapped handcuffs on him it wasnt my fault billy said his face pushed in the grass it was that kid dave hes under the car theres nobody under the car son the cop said lifting him to his feet just you nobody else now you going to tell us what this is about his father came billy knew he was going to get a beating but his father didnt give any indication of that he asked to see the gun he asked billy where the bullets were billy said he was shooting at a vicious kid who was attacking him billys father just nodded his face bland but he said he would follow the cops down to the station when they took billy there to book him henry saidi think we have to admit it just isnt working what do you mean lynn said running her fingers through daves hair this isnt daves fault you said so yourself i know but there seems to be trouble all the time biting fightingnow gunshots for gods sake hes endangering all of us but its not his fault henry im worried about what will happen next you could have thought of that earlier she said in a sudden burst of anger like four years ago when you decided to do your experiment because now its a little too late to be having regrets dont you think hes our responsibility and hes staying with us but were his family they were shooting at jamie jamies all right but shooting it was some crazy kid sixthgrader the police have him lynn youre not listening she glared at him what do you think that you can quietly get rid of him like a petri dish that didnt turn out right you cant just dump dave in the biotrash youre the one whos not listening dave is a living thinking sentient being and you made him you are the reason why he exists on this earth you dont have the right to abandon him just because hes inconvenient or has trouble at school she paused to catch her breath she was very angry anyway im not giving him up she said and i dont want to talk about it anymore but not now henry henry knew that tone he shrugged and left thank you dave said bending his head so she could run her fingers through the fur on his neck thank you mom chapter alex took her son to an innout drivein and they had burgers and fries and strawberry shakes it was now dark outside she thought of calling lynn again but lynn had sounded harried she decided not to she paid for the burgers in cash then they drove to a walstons drugstore one of those blocklong places that had everything she bought jamie some underwear and a change of clothes she did the same for herself she bought a couple of toothbrushes and toothpaste she was heading toward the checkout when she saw the guns for sale over by the cameras and watches she went to look over the years she had gone to shooting ranges with her father she could handle a gun she told jamie to go look at the toy aisle and she went to the gun rack help you it was a wimpy guy with a mustache id like to see that mossberg doubleaction she nodded to the wall thats our model twelvegauge perfect for home defense got a special price this week only she hefted it okay ill take it ill need an id and a deposit to hold it no she said i mean ill buy it now sorry maam tenday waiting period in california she handed the gun back ill think it over she said she returned to jamie bought the spiderman toy he was playing with and walked out to the parking lot a man was standing at the back of her car bending over the license plate writing the number down he was an older guy in some kind of uniform he looked like a security guard from the store she thoughtrun leave now but that didnt make sense she needed a car it was time to think fast she told jamie to get in the car and she walked to the back you know hes a damn liar she said whos that the guard said my exhusband he pretends like this car is his but it isnt hes just harassing me i got a court order to stop him and i got a big judgment against the security guard at walmart hows that he said dont act dumb she said i know you got a call from him he pretends to be an attorney he pretends to be a bail bondsman or a court agent and he wants you to check if my car is in the lot he says its some pending legal matter well yes hes lying and youre now liable did he tell you i was an attorney no he just well i am and youre an accessory to his breaking the court order that makes you liable to damages invasion of privacy and harassment she took a pad from her purse now your name is she squinted at the name tag began to write i dont want any trouble maam then give me that sheet of paper you wrote my license on and back off she said and when my husband calls again you damn well tell him you never set eyes on me or ill see you in court and i promise you youll be lucky if all you lose is your job he nodded gave her the paper his hands were shaking she got in the car and drove off as she pulled out of the parking lot she thought maybe it will work then again maybe not mostly she was stunned by how fast this bounty hunter had located her he no doubt had followed her own car north for a couple of hours and then realized that she had switched cars with her assistant he and his cohorts knew her assistants name and they got her car registration so now they knew the car alex was driving then alex had used her credit card and within minutes the bounty hunter had known about it and fixed her position at a motel in san juan capistrano realizing that shed need supplies the hunter had probably called every convenience store within a fivemile radius of the motel and gave a story to the security people be on the lookout for a white toyota license soandso and this guy found her right away unless she missed her bet the bounty hunter was on his way to capistrano right now if he was driving he would be there in three hours but if he had access to a helicopter he might be here already already mom can i watch tv when we go back to the motel sure honey but of course they werent going back to the motel she parked around the corner from the motel from her position she could see the lobby and the kid inside he was talking on the phone looking around as he did so she turned on her regular cell phone and dialed the motel the kid put the other line on hold and picked up best western yes this is mrs colson i checked in earlier yes mrs colson it seemed to excite him he looked around in all directions now frantic you put me in room yes i think theres someone in my room mrs colson i cant imagine i want you to come here and open the door for me if its anybody its probably the maid i think its a man oh no it couldnt be come here and open the door or do i have to call the police no im sureill be right there thank you he switched to the other line spoke quickly and then left the lobby running down toward the rooms at the back alex got out of her car and sprinted across the street to the lobby she moved in quickly stepped behind the counter picked up the shotgun and walked out again it was a sawedoff twelvegauge remington not her first choice but it would do for now shed get shells later she got back in the car whats the gun for jamie said just in case she said she drove off turning onto camino real through her rearview mirror she saw the kid coming back into the lobby looking puzzled i want to watch tv jamie said not tonight she said tonight we are going to have an adventure what kind of adventure youll see she drove east away from the lights and into the darkness of the mountains chapter stan milgram was lost in endless darkness the road ahead was a strip of light but on each side he could see no signs of life at all nothing except pitchblack desert landscape stretching away into the distance to the north he could just detect the ridge of the mountains a faint line of black against black but nothing elseno lights no towns no houses nothing it had been that way for an hour where the hell was he from the backseat the bird gave a piercing shriek stan jumped the sound made his eardrums ache if you ever plan to motor west he thought dont take a damn bird on the highway thats the best hed put cloth over the cage hours ago but the cloth didnt shut the bird up anymore from st louis down through missouri and on to gallup new mexico all the way the bird would not shut up stan checked into a gallup motel and at around midnight the bird began to scream earsplitting shrieks there was nothing to do but check outwith all the other motel guests yelling at himand start driving again the bird was silent once they were driving but he pulled off the road for a few hours during the day to sleep and later when he stopped at flagstaff arizona the bird began to scream again it started before he even checked into the motel he kept driving winona kingman barstow heading for san bernardinosan berdoo his aunt called itand all he could think was this trip would be over soon please god let it be over before he killed the bird but stan was exhausted and after driving more than two thousand miles he had become strangely disoriented either he had missed the san berdoo turnoff oror he wasnt sure he was lost and the bird still shrieked your heart sweats your body shakes another kiss is what it takes he pulled the car over he opened the door to the backseat he took the cloth off gerard he said why are you doing this you cant sleep you cant eat gerard stop it why im afraid why its too far from home the bird blinked looked at the darkness outside what fresh hell is this this is the desert its freezing the desert is cold at night why are we here im taking you to your new home stan stared at the bird if i leave your cloth off will you be quiet yes no talking at all yes you promise yes okay i need it quiet so i can find out where we are i dont know why i love you like i do after all the changes try and help me gerard please stan went around and got in the drivers seat he pulled out onto the road and started driving the bird was quiet the miles rolled by then he saw a sign for a town called earp three miles ahead mellow greetings ukie dukie gerard said stan sighed he drove forward into the night you remind me of a man gerard said you promised stan said no you are supposed to say what man gerard shut up you remind me of a man gerard said what man the man with the power what power the power of hoodoo hoodoo stan said you do do what remind me of a man what man stan said and then he caught himself gerard shut up or i will put you outside right now ooh arent you the twisted bunny stan glanced at his watch one more hour he thought one more hour and that bird was out chapter ellis sat down across from his brother aaron in aarons office at the law firm the office window looked south over the city down toward the empire state building it was a hazy day but the view was still spectacular powerful okay ellis said i talked to that guy in california josh winkler uhhuh he says he never gave anything to mom uhhuh says what he sent was water well thats what you would expect him to say aaron ellis said they gave her water winkler said that he was not going to transport anything across state lines his mother wanted it done

you know the history of gene therapy its a horror story ellie starting back in the late s the biotech guys went off halfcocked and killed people right and left at least six hundred people we know about have been killed and plenty more we dont know about you know why we dont know no why because they claimedget thisthat the deaths couldnt be reported because they were proprietary information killing their patients was a trade secret did they really say that could i make this shit up and then they bill medicare for the cost of the experiment that killed the patient they kill we pay and if the universities get caught they claim they dont have to give informed consent to subjects because they are nonprofit institutions duke penn university of minnesotabig places have been caught academics think theyre above the law six hundred deaths ellis said i dont see what this has to do you know how gene therapy kills people all sorts of ways they dont know whats going to happen they insert genes into people and it turns on cancer genes and the people die of cancer or they have huge allergic reactions and die these goofballs dont know what the hell they are doing theyre reckless and they dont follow the rules and we he said are going to smack their asses down ellis squirmed in his chair but what if winkler is telling the truth what if we are wrong we didnt break the rules aaron said they did now moms got alzheimers and theyre in deep deep shit chapter when brad gordon started the bar fight at the lucky lucy saloon on pearl street in jackson hole wyoming he hadnt intended to end up in the hospital the two guys in the tightfitting plaid shirts with the pointy pearlbutton pockets looked like pussies to him and he figured he could take them easily there was no way to know they were brothers not lovers and they didnt take kindly to his remarks about them and there was no way to know that the smaller one taught karate at wyoming state and had won some kind of championship at a bruce lee tournament for martial arts in hong kong kickboxing with metaltipped cowboy boots brad lasted all of thirty seconds and a lot of his teeth were loose he had been lying in this fucking infirmary for three hours while they tried to push the teeth back in place there was one periodontist they kept calling but he wasnt answering possibly because as the intern explained he was off hunting for the weekendhe liked elk tasty eating elk brads fucking mouth was killing him so they left him there with icepacks on his face and his jaw shot full of novocain and somehow he fell asleep and the next morning the swelling had gone down enough that he could talk on the phone so he called his attorney willy johnson in los angeles holding the business card between his bruised thumb and forefinger the receptionist was cheerful johnson baker and halloran willy johnson please hold on please the phone clicked but he wasnt put on hold and then he heard the woman say faber ellis and condon brad looked again at the card in his hand the address was an office building in encino he knew what that place was it was a building where solo attorneys could rent a tiny office and share a receptionist who was trained to answer the phone as if she was working at a big law firm so clients would not suspect their attorneys were on their own that building housed only the most unsuccessful sort of attorney the ones who handled smalltime drug dealers or who had done jail time themselves excuse me he said into the phone sorry sir i am trying to find mr johnson for you she cupped her hand over the phone anybody seen willy johnson and he heard a muffled voice yell back willy johnson is a dick sitting there at the entrance to the emergency room weak and in pain his jaw aching like hell brad did not feel good about what he was hearing did you find mr johnson one moment sir were looking he hung up he felt like crying he went out to get breakfast but it hurt too much to eat and people in the coffee shop looked at him oddly he saw his reflection in the glass and realized his whole jaw was blue and puffy still it was better than last night he wasnt worried about anything except this attorney johnson all his initial suspicions about the man were confirmed why had they met at a restaurant instead of his law firm because johnson didnt belong to a law firm there was nothing to do but call his uncle jack john b watson investment group mr watson please they put him through to the secretary who put him through to his uncle hey uncle jack where the fuck are you watson said he sounded distinctly unfriendly im in wyoming staying out of trouble i hope actually my attorney sent me here he said and thats why i am calling you im a little worried i mean this guy look watson said youre up on a molestation charge and youve got a molestation expert to handle your case you dont have to like him personally i hear hes a prick well but he wins cases do what he says why are you talking funny nothing im busy brad and you were told never to call click brad was feeling worse than ever back at his motel room the guy at the desk said someone from the police had come looking for him something about a hate crime brad decided it was time to leave beautiful jackson hole he went to his room to pack watching some truecrime show where the police caught a dangerous fugitive by pretending to put him on television they staged a fake tv interview setup and as soon as the guy relaxed they slapped cuffs on him and now the guy was on death row police were getting tricky brad hastily finished packing paid his bill and hurried out to his car chapter the selfproclaimed environmental artist mark sanger recently returned from a trip to costa rica looked up from his computer in astonishment as four men broke down the door and burst into his berkeley apartment the men were dressed head to foot in blue rubber hazmat suits with big rubber helmets and big faceplates rubber gloves and boots and they carried evillooking rifles and big pistols he had hardly reacted to the shock when they were on him grabbing him with their rubber hands and wrestling him away from the keyboard pigs fascists sanger yelled but suddenly it seemed like everybody was shouting and screaming in the room this is an outrage fascist pigs he shouted as they cuffed him but he could see their faces behind the masks and they were afraid jesus what do you think im doing here he said and one of them answered we know what youre doing mr sanger and spun him away hey hey they pulled himroughlydown the steps from his apartment to the street sanger could only hope media would be waiting cameras ready to film this outrage in broad daylight the press however was cordoned off across the street they could hear sanger as he shouted and they were filming him but their distance prevented the upclose inyourface confrontation he hoped for in fact sanger suddenly realized how this scene must look through their lensespolicemen dressed in frightening hazmat suits escorting a thirtyish bearded man in jeans and a che guevara tshirt who struggled in their arms cursing and shouting sanger knew he must look like a madman like one of the teds ted bundy ted kaczynski one of those guys the cops would say that he had microbiology equipment in his apartment that he had tools for genetic engineering and he was making a plague making a virus making a diseasesomething horrible a madman put me down he said forcing himself to be calm i can walk let me walk all right sir one of them said they let him stand on his feet and walk sanger walked with as much dignity as he could muster straightening his shoulders shaking his long hair as they led him to a waiting car of course it was an unmarked car he should have expected that fucking fbi or cia or whatever secret government organizations the shadow government black helicopters unaccountable the crypto nazis among us fuming he wasnt prepared to see mrs malouf the black lady who lived on the second floor of his building standing outside with her two young kids as he passed her she leaned forward and started yelling at him you bastard you risk my family you risk my childrens lives you frankenstein frankenstein sanger was intensely aware of how that moment would play on the evening news a black mother shouts at him calls him frankenstein and the kids at her side were crying frightened by everything that was happening around them then the cops shoved sanger into the unmarked car with one rubbergloved hand on his head easing him into the backseat and as the door slammed shut he thought i am fucking screwed sitting in his jail cell watching the television in the hallway trying to hear the commentary over the arguments of the other guys in the cell trying to ignore the faint smell of vomit and the deep sense of despair that settled over him as he watched first there was footage of sanger himself hair long dressed like a bum walking between two guys in hazmat suits he looked even worse than he had feared the corporate flunky reading the news was mouthing all the buzzwords sanger was unemployed he was an uneducated drifter he was a fanatic and a loner who had genetic engineering materials in his cramped filthy apartment and he was considered dangerous because he fit the classic bioterrorist profile next a bearded san francisco lawyer from some environmental defense group said sanger should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law sanger had caused irreparable harm to an endangered species and had jeopardized the very existence of the species by his depredations sanger frowned what the hell was he talking about next the tv showed a picture of a leatherback turtle and a map of costa rica now it seemed that authorities had been alerted to sangers activities because he had visited tortuguero on the atlantic coast of costa rica sometime before and because he had madeserious threats to the environment regarding leatherback turtles sanger couldnt follow this he had never made any threats he had wanted to help that was all and the fact was once he got back to his apartment he had been unable to carry out his plans he bought stacks of genetics textbooks but the whole thing was much too complicated he opened the shortest of the texts and scanned some of the captions to graphics a plasmid harboring a normal loxp has little chance of remaining integrated in a genome at a similar loxp site since the cre recombinase will eliminate the integrated dna fragment lentiviral vectors injected into onecell embryos or incubated with embryos from which zona pellucida was withdrawn were particularly a more efficient way to replace a gene relies on the use of mutant es cells devoid of the hprt gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase these cells cannot survive in the hat medium which contains hypoxanthine aminopterine and thymidine the hprt gene is introduced at the targeted site by a double homologous recombination sanger had stopped reading and now the tv screen showed turtles on the beach at night glowing a weird purple colorand they thought that he had done that the very idea was ridiculous but a fascist state demanded blood for any transgression real or imagined sanger could foresee himself thrown in jail for a crime he hadnt committeda crime that he didnt even know how to commit new transgenic pets on horizon giant cockroaches permanent pups artists industry hard at work yaletrained artist lisa hensley has joined forces with the genetic firm of borger and snodd ltd to create giant cockroaches to be sold as pets the gm cockroaches will be three feet long and stand approximately one foot off the ground they will be the size of large dachshunds says hensley although of course they wont bark hensley regards the pets as works of art intended to raise human awareness of the insect community the overwhelming majority of living matter on our planet consists of insects she said yet we maintain an irrational prejudice against them we should embrace our insect brethren kiss them love them she observed that the real danger of global warming is that we may render so many insects extinct hensley acknowledged that she was inspired by the work of artist catherine chalmers bs engineering stanford university whose project american cockroach first elevated cockroaches to a major theme of contemporary art meanwhile in suburban new jersey the firm of kumnick genomics is hard at work creating an animal they believe dog owners really want permanent puppies kumnicks permapuppies will never grow up according to spokesperson lyn kumnick when you buy a permapuppy it stays a puppy forever the firm is working to eliminate unwanted puppy behavior such as chewing shoes which gets on dog owners nerves once the teeth are in this behavior stops kumnick said unfortunately at this point our genetic interventions have prevented the growth of teeth altogether but well solve that she said that rumors they were going to market a toothless animal called a gummydog were untrue kumnick observes that since adulthood in human beings is being replaced by permanent adolescence people naturally wish to be accompanied through life by similarly youthful dogs like peter pan we never want to grow up she says genetics makes it possible chapter still lost now driving through very hilly terrain stan milgram squinted at the road sign emerging from the darkness ahead palomar mountain miles where the hell was that he had never realized california was so big he had passed through a couple of towns a ways back but at three in the morning everything was closed including gas stations and then he was once more in dark empty countryside he should have brought a map stan was exhausted irritable and he needed to pull over and sleep but the damn bird would start shrieking as soon as he stopped the car gerard had been silent for the last hour but now inexplicably he began to make telephone dial tones as if he were calling someone stop it gerard stan said and the bird stopped at least for a moment stan was able to drive in silence but of course it didnt last im hungry gerard said you and me both you bring any chips the chips are gone they had eaten the last of them back in the town of earp an hour ago two hours ago nobody knows the trouble ive seen gerard said humming dont do it stan warned nobody knows cept jesus gerard silence it was like traveling with a child stan thought the bird had all of the stubbornness and unexpectedness of a child it was exhausting they passed train tracks off to the right gerard made chugging sounds and a mournful whistle i aint seen the sunshine since i dont know whennnn stan decided not to say anything he gripped the wheel and drove through the night behind him he could see a faint lightening of the sky that meant he was driving west and that was where he wanted to go more or less and then in the tense silence gerard began again ladies and gentlemen mesdames et messieurs damen und herren from what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues may i now present a cultured sophisticated man about town hit it youre pushing stan said and im giving you a warning its my lifedont you forget the bird sang screaming at the top of its lungs it seemed as if the whole car vibrated stan thought the windows might shatter he winced gripped the wheel harder and then the screaming stopped were so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight gerard said sounding like an announcer stan shook his head dear god lets be happy happy happy say the word now happy happy happy try it somehow stop stan said gerard went right on happy happy happy happy oh baby yes happy happy thats it stan yelled pulling over to the side of the road he got out of the car slammed the drivers door hard you dont scare me buster gerard said stan swore and opened the back door gerard was singing again ive got some news for you and youll soon find out its true and youll have to eat your lunch all by yourself no problem stan said because you are out of here pal he grabbed the bird roughlygerard pecked at him viciously but he didnt careand put gerard down on the side of the road in the dust it looks as though youre letting go and if its real i dont want to its real stan snarled gerard flapped his wings you cant do this to me he said oh no watch me stan walked back to the front of the car opened the door i want my perch gerard said its the least you can fuck your damn perch dont go away mad it cant be so bad dont go away bye bye gerard stan slammed the door and shoved his foot down on the pedal driving off fast making sure he raised a big cloud of dust he looked back but couldnt see the bird he did however see all the bird shit in the backseat jeez it would take days to clean all that up but now it was quiet blessedly quiet finally the adventures of gerard were over now that there was silence in the car his accumulated fatigue hit him stan began to doze off he turned on the radio rolled down the window stuck his head out in the cold breeze nothing was helping he realized he was going to fall asleep and he had to pull off the road that bird had kept him awake he felt a little bad putting him out in the road that way it was as good as killing him a bird like that wouldnt last long in the desert some rattler or coyote would make quick work of him had probably already done it no reason to go back stan pulled over to the side of the road into a grove of pines he turned the engine off and inhaled the scent of the trees he fell instantly asleep gerard walked back and forth on the dusty ground for a while in the darkness he wanted to get off the ground and several times he tried jumping onto the scrubby sage bushes that surrounded him but the sage didnt support his weight and he came crashing down again each time finally he halfhopped halfflew into the air coming down again on a juniper bush about three feet off the ground standing on that makeshift perch he might have gone to sleep except the temperature was extremely cold for a tropical bird and he was kept awake by the yelping of a pack of animals in the desert the yelps were coming closer gerard ruffled his feathers a sign of unease he looked in the direction of the sound he saw several dark shapes moving through the desert brush he caught the glint of green eyes he ruffled his feathers again and watched the pack come toward him chapter the robinson rhelicopter descended in a cloud of dust and vasco borden came out crouched beneath the blades he got into the waiting black hummer talk to me he said to dolly who was driving shed come down earlier while vasco went on that wild goose chase to pebble beach dolly said she checked into the best western at seventhirty tonight went to walstons where a security guy idd the car she brushed him off with a story about an exhusband and he went for it when was that little before eight from there she went back to the motel gave the kid at the desk a story about someone being in her room while he was checking she took his shotgun from under the counter and made off with it did she borden said the little lady has some balls apparently she had tried to buy a gun in a drugstore but ran into the tenday wait and now we were tracking her cell phone but she turned it off before that happened we got her heading east toward ortega highway into the desert vasco said nodding shell sleep in her car and then continue on tomorrow morning we can download sat shots at eight am thats the fastest processing time shell be gone before eight in the morning vasco said he leaned back in the hummer shell go at dawn so lets see he paused thinking all afternoon shes been driving and its basically south the minute all this began our lady went south you thinking mexico dolly said vasco shook his head she doesnt want to leave a record and crossing the border will leave a record maybe shell head east try to cross at brown field or calexico dolly said maybe vasco rubbed his beard thoughtfully too late he felt the mascara coming off on his fingers damn he had to remember that shes scared i think shes heading for a place she thinks will give her help maybe meet her father down here or meet up with somebody she knows an old boyfriend school friend sorority sister former teacher former law partner something like that weve been checking all the net databases for the last two hours dolly said and so far weve got nothing how about her old phone records no calls to san diego area code how far back a year thats all thats available without a special order so whoever this is she hasnt called em in a year vasco sighed well just have to wait for her he turned to dolly lets go to that best western i want to find out what kind of gun the little lady got and we can get a couple of hours rest before dawn im sure well get her by tomorrow i got a feeling he tapped his chest and im never wrong hon you just got mascara on your nice shirt ah hell he sighed itll come out dolly said ill get it out for you chapter gerard watched the dark shapes approach they moved with a loping gait and made a snorting or snuffling sound and sometimes a mewling sound their bodies were low their backs were just visible above the sage they circled his perch approaching then sliding away but they had clearly smelled him because they were coming ever closer to him there were six animals altogether gerard ruffled his feathers partly in an attempt to warm his body the animals had long snouts their eyes glowed bright green they had a distinctive musky odor that was unpleasant they had long fluffy tails he could see that they were not black but rather brownishgray they moved in closer im sha sha shakin im shakin now and closer they were quite close now the largest one paused a few feet away and stared at gerard gerard did not move after several seconds the big animal edged closer you can stop right there mister the animal stopped instantly and even took a few paces backward the other animals in the group backed away too they all seemed confused by the voice but not for long the big animal started to move in again well hold on this time there was only a momentary pause then the animal kept coming you feel lucky punk do you huh the animal was coming very slowly now sniffing at gerard closer and closersniff sniffthe creature smelled awful the nose was just inches away gerard bent and bit hard on the animals soft nose the creature yelped and jumped backward almost knocking gerard from his perch he regained his balance every time you turn around expect to see me gerard said cause one time youll turn around and ill be there and ill kill you matt the animal was flat on the ground rubbing his injured nose with his forelegs he did that for a while then he got up growling life is hard but its harder if youre stupid the whole pack of animals was growling now they moved forward in a semicircle they seemed to be coordinated gerard ruffled his feathers and ruffled them again he even flapped his wings trying to make as large and active a shape of himself as possible these creatures didnt seem to care look you fools youre in danger cant you see theyre after you theyre after all of us but the spoken voices seemed to have no effect at all the animals just kept moving forward slowly one was loping around behind gerard he turned his head to look not good not good get back to where you once belonged gerard flapped his wings again nervously but apparently the anxiety gave him new strength because there was a bit of lift from the branch he stood on the growling animals closed in and gerard flapped his wings hardhardand felt himself lift into the air it was weeks since his last feather clip that was the reason he could fly he moved high above the ground and discovered that he could soar a little not much but a little the smelly animals were far below howling at him but gerard turned west following the road that stan had been driving on he was heading away from the sunrise toward darkness with his acute sense of smell he detected the odor of food and flew toward that chapter sleeping in the front seat of her car alex burnet opened her eyes and saw that she was surrounded by men three of them were peering into her car they wore cowboy hats and carried big pronged sticks with loops on them she sat up abruptly one of them waved for her to be still jes a moment miss alex looked over at her son jamie sleeping peacefully in the seat beside her he didnt awaken nothing woke jamie when she looked back outside she gasped one of the cowboys raised his stick a gigantic rattlesnake easily five feet long and as thick as a forearm was wriggling on the end of it making a sizzling sound with its rattle you can come out now if you want he swung the snake away she opened the door cautiously its the heat of your engine one of them said draws em under the car in the mornings she saw that there were six men altogether they each had sticks and carried large sacks with squirming contents whatre you doing were collecting rattlers why she said for the rattlesnake roundup next week in yuma uhhuh do it every year its a contest who brings the most snakes i see its by weight so you want the big uns didnt mean to frighten you thank you the group of men was moving off the man talking to her lagged behind maam you oughtnt to be out here alone he said though i see you got yourself a weapon he nodded to the backseat of the car yes she said but i

stuffed them into her pockets thanks what do i owe you he shook his head you just take care maam he turned to rejoin the others a black hummer came up this road about an hour ago big guy with a beard said he was looking for a woman and her little boy said he was their uncle and they were missing uhhuh whatd you tell him we hadnt seen you yet so we said no which way did he go she said toward elsinore but i figure anytime now hell be heading back thanks she said he waved dont stop for gas he said and good luck transcript cbs san francisco accused bioterrorist released today cbs suspected terrorist mark sanger was released from alameda county jail today on two years probation for possession of dangerous biological materials informed sources say the technical complexity of the governments charges against sanger led the prosecutors to reluctantly conclude that they might not be able to put the suspect behind bars in particular the charge against sanger that he had genetically modified turtles in central america has now been thrown into question we spoke with julio manarez in costa rica manarez it is true that the atlantic turtles have suffered from genetic modification that produces a purple color in their shells as yet there is no explanation for how this happened but the age of the turtles indicates that genetic manipulation occurred five to ten years ago cbs shortly after his arrest investigators determined that sanger had not been in costa rica early enough to have carried out the genetic change he was only there last year and so mark sanger suspected terrorist is now free on a fivehundreddollar fine chapter in congressional hearing room while waiting for proceedings to begin congressman marvin minkowski dwisconsin turned to congressman henry wexler dcalifornia and said shouldnt we have stronger regulations to limit the availability of recombinant dna technology you thinking of sanger well hes the most recent case where did he get his stuff do you know on the internet wexler said you can buy recombinant kits from outfits in new jersey and north carolina cost a couple of hundred bucks thats asking for trouble isnt it listen wexler said my wife gardens does your wife garden now that the kids are gone shes a fanatic about her roses local garden club all of that well sure plenty of gardeners who used to make hybrids by grafting cuttings onto rootstocks now use dna kits to carry things a step further wexler said people are making genetically modified roses all over the world supposedly a japanese company has made a blue rose using gm methods a blue rose has been a dream of growers for centuries point is the technologys everywhere marv its in big companies and its in backyards everywhere what do we do about that minkowski said nothing wexler said im not about to do anything to make your wife angry or mine he cupped his chin in his hand in a gesture that always looked intelligent on camera but maybe he said maybe its time for a speech expressing my concern about the dangers of this uncontrolled technology good idea minkowski said i think ill give one too liposuction news prime ministers fat sells for next celebrities to donate fat for charity bbc news a bar of soap made from fat liposuctioned from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has been sold for to a private collector the soap is a work of art entitled mani pulite clean hands made by the artist gianni motti who is based in switzerland motti bought the fat from a clinic in lugarno where berlusconi had the liposuction performed motti then molded it into a bar of soap which sold at the basel art fair to a private swiss collector who can now wash his hands with berlusconi commentators noted that berlusconi is unpopular in europe which may have reduced the price fetched by his fat the fat of film celebrities would be worth significantly more the skys the limit for brad pitt or pamela anderson byproducts said one would celebrities ever sell their fat why not said a beverly hills plastic surgeon it could be a charity thing after all theyre doing the liposuction anyway at the moment we just throw the fat away but they might as well use their fat to help worthy causes speedboat racer bums around the butt of many jokes wired news service wealthy new zealander peter bethune will attempt to set a world record on a speedboat powered by fat from his own backside his ecocorrect foot trimaran earthrace is powered entirely by biodiesel fuel made from vegetable oil and other fats in fact bethunes bum will make only a minor contribution to the roundtheworld journey his buttocks yielded a mere liter of fuel however bethune noted that he was badly bruised and said it was a personal sacrifice to produce the fuel artist cooks eats his own body fat protests wastefulness of western society reuters new york conceptual artist ricardo vega underwent liposuction cooked his fat and ate it he said his purpose was to draw attention to the wastefulness of western society he also set aside other portions of his fat for sale noting that this would enable people to taste human flesh and experience cannibalism vega did

already been done by the artist marcos evaristta who made meatballs of his body fat marcos evaristta is a chileanborn artist living in denmark reports that his bodyfat meatballs would be auctioned by christies in new york could not be confirmed as christies representatives did not return phone calls chapter the ambulance sped south on the freeway sitting in the drivers seat wearing her new bluetooth headset dolly talked to vasco vasco was angry but there was nothing dolly could do about it hed set off in the wrong direction a second time he had only himself to blame look dolly said we just got telephone records for the last five years just got em this minute alex calls people in this area code named kendall henry and lynn hes a biochemist we dont know what she does but lynn and alex are the same age we think maybe they grew up together and where are they located vasco said the kendalls la jolla its north of i know where it is goddamn it vasco said where are you now dolly said coming back from elsinore im at least an hour from la jolla roads so damn twisty goddamn it i know she was sleeping on this road somewhere how do you know i just know got my nose working okay well shes probably on her way to la jolla now she might even be there already and where are you twenty minutes from the kendall house you want us to pick them up vasco said hows the doc sober sure close enough for government work dolly said hes drinking coffee from a thermos you check the thermos yes of course sodo we pick up or wait for you if its the girl alex leave her alone but if you see the kid grab him will do dolly said chapter bob alex said holding her phone to her ear she heard a groan at the other end what time is it its seven in the morning bob aw christ a thump as his head hit the pillow this better be important alex were you out on a winetasting robert a koch distinguished head of the law firm devoted a great deal of attention to wine kept his collection in lockers all over town bought at auction from christies made trips to napa australia france but as far as alex was concerned the whole thing was just an excuse to get drunk on a regular basis im waiting alex he said it better be good okay last twentyfour hours i got a bounty hunter huge guy looks like a walking brick hes after me and my kid trying to stick biopsy needles in us and take our cells very funny im waiting im serious bob theres a bounty hunter chasing me and my kid this is out of nowhere no i think its related to biogen i hear biogen is having troubles bob said and theyre trying to take your cells they probably cant do that probably is not what i want to hear you know the law is unclear look she said i have my eightyearold son here theyre trying to grab him in the back of an ambulance and stick needles into his liver i dont want to hearunclear i want to hearwell stop it well certainly try he said this is your fathers case yeah did you call him hes not answering you call the police theres a warrant out for my arrest in oxnard theres a hearing in oxnard today i need somebody good to go up and appear for me ill send dennis i said somebody good dennis is good dennis is good if he has a month this is today bob well who do you want i want you she said aw christ oxnard its so fucking fari havent had my shots i have a sawedoff shotgun in the backseat bob i dont really care if you think the drive is too long okay okay take it easy he said i have to arrange some things will you go yes ill go you want to give me a hint what this is about youll find it in the burnet file i assume it has to do with takings by eminent domain or simple conversion taking your cells they claim they own them how can they own your cells they own your fathers cells oh i get it same cells but thats bullshit alex tell the judge they cant violate the integrity of your body or the body of your kid just save it for the judge she said ill call you later find out how it went she flipped the phone shut she looked down at jamie he was still sleeping peaceful as an angel if koch got to oxnard by late morning he might get an emergency hearing set for the afternoon she should probably call him around four pm that seemed a very long time away she drove toward la jolla chapter its the last thing we need henry kendall thought visitors he watched in dismay as lynn threw her arms around alex burnet and then bent over to hug alexs kid jamie alex and jamie had just shown up with no advance warning the women were chattering excitedly arms fluttering happy to see each other as they walked into the kitchen to get food for alexs jamie meanwhile his son jamie and dave were playing drive or die on the playstation the sound of crunching metal and squealing tires filled the room henry kendall was overwhelmed he walked into the bedroom to think things through he had just come back from the police station where he reviewed the playground security camera tape from the day before the image quality wasnt that goodthank godbecause the image of that kid billy kicking and beating his son was so upsetting he could hardly watch he had to look away several times and those other boys that gang of skaters they should all be in jail with any luck theyd be expelled from school but henry knew it wouldnt end there it never did everybody sued these days and no doubt the skater parents would sue to have their kids reinstated theyd sue henrys family and theyd sue jamie and dave and out of those lawsuits it was sure to emerge that there was no such thing as gandalfcrikey syndrome or whatever it was that lynn had made up it was sure to emerge that dave was in reality a transgenic chimp and then what a media circus beyond all imagining reporters camped on the front lawn for weeks chasing them wherever they went filming them with spy cameras day and night destroying their lives and around the time the reporters got bored the religious people and the environmentalists would start in henry and his family would be called godless theyd be called criminals theyd be called dangerous and unamerican and a threat to the biosphere in his mind he saw commentators on tv in a babel of languagesenglish spanish german japaneseall talking with pictures of him and dave in the background and that was just the beginning dave would be taken away henry could possibly go to jail though he doubted that scientists had been breaking the rules about genetic testing for two decades and none had ever gone to jail even when patients died but he would certainly be barred from research he could be kicked out of the lab for a year or more how would he support his family lynn couldnt do it alone and her web business would almost certainly dry up and what would happen to dave and his son to tracy and what about their community la jolla was pretty liberal parts of it anyway but people might not be understanding about the idea of a humanzee going to school with their kids it was radical no doubt about it people werent ready for it liberals were only so liberal they might have to move they might have to sell their house and go somewhere remote like montana though maybe people would be even less accepting of them there these and other thoughts raced through his mind to the accompaniment of cars squealing and crashing into each other and his wife and her friend laughing in the kitchen he felt overwhelmed and in the middle of it at the center of everything was his deep sense of guilt one thing wasclear he had to keep track of his kids he had to know where they were he couldnt risk further incidents like the one that had occurred the day before lynn had kept the children at home for an extra hour intending to let them go to school later so there wouldnt be any incidents with older kids that cleever kid was a menace and it wasnt likely he was jailed theyd probably just scare him and give him over to the custody of his father the father henry knew was a defense analyst for a local think tank and a hardass gun nut one of those intellectuals who liked to shoot things a manly intellectual there was no telling what could happen he turned to the package he had brought home from the lab it was marked tracktech industries chiba city japan inside were five inchlong polished silver tubes slightly thinner than soda straws he pulled them out and looked at them these marvels of miniaturization had gps technology built in as well as monitors for temperature pulse respiration and blood pressure they were activated by a magnet that you touched at one end the tip glowed blue once then nothing they were designed to keep track of lab primates monkeys and baboons the tubes were inserted with a special surgical instrument that looked like an oversized syringe they were placed under the skin of the neck just above the clavicle henry couldnt do that to the kids of course so the question was where to put them he went back to the living room where the kids were drop the sensors in their school bags no down the collars of their shirts he shook his head theyd feel them then where the surgical instrument worked perfectly the devices went smoothly into the rubber at the heel of the sneaker he did it for daves sneaker then for jamies then on an impulse went out and got a sneaker from alexs son jamie as well what for jamie said i need to measure it back in a sec he inserted another device into the third sneaker that left two more henry thought about it for a while several possibilities came to mind chapter the hummer pulled up behind the ambulance and vasco got out he walked up to the ambulance dolly slid over onto the passenger seat whats happening vasco said as he got in dolly nodded to the house at the end of the street thats the kendall place you see burnets car in front shes been in there an hour vasco frowned whats goin on she shook her head i could get the directional mike but we have to be straight on to the windows and i figured you didnt want me to pull up closer right i dont vasco leaned back in his seat he gave a long sigh he looked at his watch well we cant go in there bounty hunters were permitted to enter the premises of the fugitive even without a search warrant but they could not enter the premises of third parties even if they knew the fugitive was there sooner or later he said they gotta come out and when they do well be here chapter gerard was tired he had been flying for an hour since his last stop which had been something of a disaster shortly after dawn he had landed at a complex of buildings where he smelled food the buildings were made of wood with faded paint there were old cars with grass growing up around them large animals made snorting sounds behind a fence he stood on a fencepost and watched a young boy in blue coveralls walking out with a bucket in his hand gerard smelled food im hungry he said the young boy turned he looked around briefly then continued on his way i want food gerard said i am hungry the boy paused again he looked around again whats the matter dont you know how to talk gerard said yes the kid said where are you here the kid squinted he walked over to the fence my name is gerard no kidding you can talk how thrilling for you gerard said he could smell the bucket strongly now he smelled corn and other grains he could also smell something else that smelled bad but his hunger overwhelmed him i want food what food do you want the kid said he reached into the bucket and scooped up a handful of feed you want this gerard bent over tasted it he spit it out at once yuck its chicken feed nothing wrong with it they eat it do you have any fresh vegetables the kid laughed youre funny you sound like british whats your name gerard an orange do you have an orange he hopped back and forth on the fencepost impatient i like an orange how come you talk so good i could ask the same of you you know what im going to show you to my dad the kid said he held out his hand youre tame arent you sink me gerard stepped on his hand the kid put gerard on his shoulder he started walking back to the wooden building i bet we can sell you for a lot of money he said gerard gave a squawk and flew up to the roof of one building hey come back from inside the house a voice jared do your chores gerard watched as the kid reluctantly turned back to a dirt yard where he tossed handfuls of the grain from the bucket onto the ground a group of yellow birds clucked and jumped as the food was thrown to them they looked incredibly stupid it took a moment before gerard decided that he would eat that food after all he flew down and made a loud squawk to drive away the stupid birds then started eating their grain it tasted disgusting but he had to eat something meanwhile the kid dived for him hands outstretched gerard flew into the air pecked the kid hard on the nosethe kid screamedand then dropped down a short distance away to eat again these big yellow birds were all around him get back get back all of you the yellow birds paid little attention gerard made the sound of a siren the kid dived again barely missing gerard he was obviously a stupid kid buffeting buffeting twenty thousand feet buffeting i am going to push the stick forward then the sound of a huge airshattering explosion the chickens scattered at that and he had a moment of peace eating a little now the kid was back with a net and was swiping downward with it that was too much excitement for gerard who was feeling sick in the stomach from the horrid food so he flew quickly into the air evacuating and hitting the kid perfectly on the head before he climbed into blue sky and went on his way twenty minutes later in cooler air he came to the coast and followed it it was easier here because there were updrafts a blessing to his tired wings he could not soar but it helped nonetheless he experienced a modest sense of peace at least he did until some giant white birdenormously huge giganticrushed silently up at him whooshing past creating spinning turbulence that tumbled him out of control when gerard got his bearings again the bird had glided away from him on huge flat wings there was a single eye in the center of the head it glinted in the sun and the wings never moved they just remained straight and flat gerard was grateful there was not a flock of these birds but instead only one he watched as it circled slowly toward the ground below and that was when he noticed the beautiful green oasis in the midst of the dry coast an oasis it was built at the site of a large cluster of huge boulders surrounding the boulders were palm trees and luscious gardens and pretty buildings nestled among the green gerard felt certain that there would be food there it was so inviting he spiraled down it was a kind of dream beautiful people in white robes walking silently through a garden of flowers and shrubs in the cool shade of palm trees with all sorts of birds flittering about he did not smell food here but he was sure there must be some and then he smelledorange cut orange it took him only a moment to locate another bird brilliant blue and red standing on a perch with lots of oranges all around him on a tray below oranges and avocado and bits of lettuce cautiously gerard landed next to him i want you to want me he said hello blueandred bird said i need you to need me hello nice place you got here my name is gerard aaah whats up doc the bird said mind if i have an orange hello the bird said aaah whats up doc i said i would like an orange hello gerard lost patience he went for the orange the blueandred bird pecked at him viciously gerard dodged and flapped away with the orange in his mouth he sat on a tree branch and looked back that was when he saw that the other bird was chained to the perch gerard ate the orange at his leisure then he flew back for more he came at the perch from behind then later from the side he flew in unexpectedly each time dodging the bird who could only say hello after half an hour he was quite satisfied meanwhile he watched the people in white robes come and go talking of nyquil and jello he said jello the tasty dessert for the whole family now with more calciyum two of the people in robes looked up someone laughed then continued on their way this place was peaceful the water gurgled in little brooks beside the path he would stay here gerard felt certain for a long long time chapter okay we got action vasco said two young kids were coming out of the kendall house one was a dark kid in a baseball cap sort of bowlegged the other was fair also in a baseball cap wearing khakis and a sport shirt looks like jamie he said putting the car in gear they drove slowly forward i dont know dolly said doesnt look quite the same its the baseball hat just ask him vasco said dolly rolled down her window she leaned out jamie honey the boy turned yes he said dolly jumped out of the car henry kendall was working at the computer activating the tracktech when he heard the highpitched scream from outside he knew at once that it was dave he bolted up and ran for the door behind him was lynn running from the kitchen but he noticed that alex stayed in the kitchen with her arms around her son jamie she looked terrified dave was confused by what he saw jamie spoke to the woman in the big white car and then she jumped out and grabbed him dave was not inclined to attack females so he watched as the woman scooped up jamie took him to the back of the white car and opened the back doors dave saw a man inside in a white coat and he saw lots of shiny equipment that frightened him jamie must have been frightened too because suddenly he was screaming and then the woman slammed the back doors shut before the car started moving dave screamed and leaped onto the back grabbing the handles on the door the white car accelerated forward going fast dave held on struggling to keep his balance when he had a good grip he pulled up so he could look through the rear windows he saw the man in the coat and the woman pushing jamie onto a bed trying to tie him down jamie was screaming dave felt rage flood through his body he snarled and banged at the doors the woman looked up in alarm she seemed shocked to see dave she yelled something to the driver the driver started to swerve the white car dave was flung sideways barely able to hold on to the recessed door handles when the car swung him back once more he reached high grabbing the lights above the doors he pulled himself onto the top of the ambulance the wind blew hard the surface was smooth he lay flat inching forward the car straightened out drove more slowly he heard yelling inside he crept forward we lost himdolly yelled looking out the back window what was it looked like an ape hes not an ape hes my friend jamie yelled struggling he goes to school with me the kids baseball cap fell off and dolly saw that he had dark brown hair she said whats your name jamie jamie kendall oh no she said aw christ vasco said driving you got the wrong kid he said his name was jamie its the wrong kid jesus christ youre an idiot dolly this is kidnapping well its not my fault whose fault do you think it is you saw the kid too i didnt see you were looking right out there christ shut up stop arguing we gotta take him back what do you mean we gotta take him back where we found him its goddamn kidnapping and then vasco swore and screamed dave was on the roof of the cab wedged between the light bar and the slope of the ambulance he leaned over the drivers side there was a big side mirror there he could see an ugly blackbearded man driving and shouting he knew the man was going to hurt jamie he could see the man baring his teeth in a sign of rage dave leaned down resting his weight on the side mirror and swung his arm in through the open window his strong fingers grabbed the bearded man by the nose and the man yelled and jerked his head daves fingers slipped but he lunged back and bit down hard on the mans ear and held on the man was screaming at him in rage dave could feel that rage but he had plenty of his own he pulled hard and felt the ear come away with a gush of hot blood the man screamed and spun the wheel the ambulance tilted the left wheels came up off the ground and the vehicle slowly turned over and crashed down on its right side the sound of screeching metal was incredibly loud dave was riding the ambulance down as it fell but he lost his grip on impact his feet slammed into the face of the bearded man and one of his shoes went right into his mouth the vehicle slid to a stop on its side the man was biting and coughing the woman inside was screaming dave pulled his foot out of his shoe leaving it in the bearded mans mouth blood was gushing everywhere from the mans ear he yanked off the other shoe scampered around to the back of the ambulance and managed with some effort to get the doors open the whitecoat man was lying on his side bleeding from his mouth jamie was underneath the man yelling dave dragged the whitecoat man out of the car dropped him onto the street then he went and got jamie put him on his back and ran carrying him back to their house jamie said are you hurt the ear was still in daves mouth he spit it into his hand no whats that in your hand dave opened his fist its an ear ugh eeeew i bit his ear he was bad he hurted you uck up ahead they saw everybody standing out on the front lawn of their house henry and lynn and the new people too dave put jamie on the ground and he ran to his parents dave waited for his mother lynn to comfort him but she was entirely focused on jamie it made him feel bad he dropped the ear in his hand on the ground everybody was swirling around him but nobody touched him nobody put their fingers in his fur he felt more and more sad then he saw the boxy black car barreling down the street toward them it was huge high off the ground and it drove right up onto the lawn chapter the oxnard courtroom was small and so cold bob koch thought he would catch pneumonia he was feeling none too good anyway his hangover had left a very sour feeling in his stomach the judge was a youngish guy about forty and he looked hungover too but maybe not koch cleared his throat your honor i am here representing alexandra burnet who is unable to be here in person this court has ordered her to appear the judge said in person i am aware of that your honor but she and her child are presently being pursued by a bounty hunter who intends to remove tissue from their bodies and she is therefore in flight to prevent that what bounty hunter the judge said why is there a bounty hunter involved in this we would like to know exactly that your honor bob koch said the judge turned mr rodriguez your honor rodriguez said standing there is no bounty hunter per se well what is there there is a professional fugitiverecovery agent at work with what authorization he is not authorized per se in this case he is making a citizens arrest your honor arrest of whom of ms burnet and her son on what basis possession of stolen property your honor to make a citizens arrest the possession of stolen property has to be witnessed by the person making the arrest yes your honor what has been witnessed the possession of the property in question your honor you are talking about the burnet cell line the judge said yes your honor as previously documented before this court that cell line is owned by ucla and licensed to biogen in westview the ownership is attested to by several prior court rulings how then is it stolen your honor we have evidence that mr burnet conspired to eliminate the cell lines in possession of biogen but whether that is true or not biogen has the right to restore the cell lines that it owns it can restore them from mr burnet yes your honor presumably so since the court has ruled that mr burnets cells belong to biogen they can at any time take more whether the property is actually within mr burnets body or not is immaterial biogen owns the cells you are denying mr burnets right to the integrity of his body the judge said raising an eyebrow with respect your honor there is no such right suppose someone took your wifes diamond ring and swallowed it the ring is still your property yes the judge said but i might be required to wait patiently for it to reappear yes your honor but suppose for some reason the ring becomes stuck in the intestine dont you have the right to retrieve it clearly you do it cant be kept from you its your property wherever it is whoever swallows it assumes the risk of retrieval koch thought hed better move in your honor he said if i remember my high school biology correctly anything swallowed is not actually inside the body any more than something inside a doughnut hole is inside the doughnut the ring is outside the body rodriguez began to sputter your honor your honor koch said raising his voice i trust we can all agree that we are not talking about diamond rings that have been stolen we are talking about cells that reside inside the human body the notion that these cells can be owned by someone elseeven if the appellate court has upheld a jury findingleads to absurd conclusions as you see here if biogen no longer possesses mr burnets cells then they have lost them by their own foolish actions they are not entitled to go back and get more if you lose your diamond ring you cant go back to the diamond mine and get a replacement rodriguez said the analogy is inexact your honor all analogies are inexact in this instance rodriguez said i would ask the court to stick narrowly to the issue at hand and consider the previous findings of the court that are relevant to the issue the court has held that biogen owns these cells they came from mr burnet but they are the property of biogen we argue that we have the right to retrieve these cells at any time your honor this argument directly conflicts with the thirteenth amendment against chattel slavery biogen may own mr burnets cells but they dont own mr burnet theycant we never claimed to own mr burnet only his cells and that is all we are asking for now rodriguez said but the practical consequence of your claim is that you effectively own mr burnet since youdo claim access to his body at any time the judge was looking weary gentlemen i see the issue he said but what does any of this have to do with ms burnet and her son bob koch stepped back let rodriguez bury himself on this one he thought the conclusion he was asking the court to draw was inconceivable your honor rodriguez said if the court accepts that mr burnets cells are my clients property as i believe it must then said cells are my clients property wherever they are found for example if mr burnet gave blood at a blood bank the donated blood would contain cells that we own we could assert ownership of those cells and demand to extract them from the donated blood since mr burnet is not legally able to give those cells to anyone else they are our property similarly the same cells that we ownthe identical cellsare also found in mr burnets children and descendants therefore we have ownership of those cells as well and we have the right to take the cells and the bounty hunter the fugitiverecovery specialist rodriguez said is making a citizens arrest on the following basis if he sees mr burnets descendants then since they are by definition walking around with our property they are selfevidently in possession of stolen property and can be arrested the judge sighed your honor rodriguez said this conclusion may strike the court as illogical but the fact is that we are in a new era and what seems strange to us now will in a few years not seem so strange already a large percentage of the human genome is owned the genetic information for various disease organisms is owned the notion that such biological elements are in private hands is only odd because it is new to us but the court must rule in accordance with previous findings the burnet cells are our cells but in the case of descendants the cells are copies the judge said yes your honor but that is not at issue if i own a formula to make something and someone xeroxes that formula on a sheet of paper and gives it to another it remains my property i own the formula no matter how it is copied or by whom and i have the right to retrieve the copy the judge turned to bob koch mr koch your honormr rodriguez has asked you to rule narrowly so do i previous courts held that once mr burnets cells were out of his body they no longer belonged to him they did not say that mr burnet was a walking gold mine that could be plundered at will again and again by biogen and they certainly said nothing to imply that biogen had a right to physically take these cells no matter who carried them that claim goes far beyond any implication of the courts prior finding it is in fact a new claim made out of nothing but wishful thinking and we ask the court to require biogen to call off this bounty hunter the judge said i do not understand on what basis biogen has simply acted on its own mr rodriguez this appears hasty and unwarranted you could certainly wait for ms burnet to appear before this court unfortunately your honor that is not possible the business situation of my client is critical as i said to you we believe we are victims of a conspiracy to deprive us of what is ours without going into details it is urgent that the cells be replaced immediately if the court forces a delay we may lose an enormous business undertaking in the meanwhile such that our company goes out of business we merely attempt a timely response to an urgent problem bob could tell the judge was going for it all that timeliness crap was working on him he didnt want to be responsible for putting a california biotech company out of business the judge swiveled in his chair glanced at the wall clock swiveled back bob had to pull it out and he had to do it now your honor he said there is an additional issue that bears on your decision i would like to bring to your attention the following affidavit from duke university medical center dated today he handed a copy to rodriguez i will summarize the contents for your honor and how it affects the issue before you burnets cell line he explained was capable of making large quantities of a chemical called cytotoxictla d a potent anticarcinogen it was that chemical that made biogens cell line so valuable however last week the us patent office issued a patent for the genetla a this is a promoter gene that codes for an enzyme that snips out a hydroxy group from the center of a protein called cytotoxic tlymphocyte associated protein b this protein is the precursor of cytotoxictla d which forms when the hydroxy group is removed unless the hydroxy group is snipped out the protein has no biological activity so the gene that controls the manufacture of biogens product is owned by duke university and they assert ownership in the document now in your hands rodriguez was turning very red your honor he said this is an attempt to confuse what should be a very simple case i would urge that you it is simple bob agreed unless biogen makes a licensing agreement with duke they cannot use the enzyme made by the duke gene the enzyme and its product are owned by someone else but this is biogen owns a cell your honor bob said but not all the genes inside that cell the judge looked again at the clock i will take this under advisement he said and give you my ruling tomorrow but your honor thank you gentlemen arguments are concluded but your honor we have a woman and her son being hounded i believe i understand the issue i need to understand the law i will see you tomorrow counselors chapter the kendall were screaming as the hummer raced forward but vasco borden snarling through his aching teeth one hand holding the bandage against his bleeding ear knew what he was doing he drove the car up onto the lawn and pulled to a stop blocking the front door then he and dolly jumped out grabbed alexs jamie off the lawn pushed the kids stunned mother to the ground leapt back into the hummer and roared off while the others just stood there and stared just like that baby vasco said shouting if youre not inside the house youre mine he roared off down the street we lost our ambulance so we go to plan b he looked back over his shoulder dolly honey get the next operating room going tell em well be there in twenty minutes one hour from now this is all a done deal henry kendall was in shock there had been a kidnapping right on his front lawn he hadnt rushed forward to stop it his own son was sobbing and clutching his mother and dave had dropped some guys ear on the lawn the other kids mother was getting to her feet screaming for the cops but the hummer was gone down the street and around the corner and gone he felt weak and emasculated as if hed somehow done something wrong and he was embarrassed to be around lynns friend so he went inside and sat down again at the computer it was just where he had been sitting five minutes before when dave screamed and all this started he still had the tracktech web site up where hed entered the names and the serial numbers he had done it for dave and for jamie but he hadnt done it for the other jamie feeling bad he did it now the web site switched to a blank featureless map with an entry spot where you typed in the unit you were looking for the first unit he entered was jamie burnets if the sensor was operating he would have seen it moving down the street but the blue spot wasnt moving it was static the address showed marbury madison drive which was his own house he looked around the living room and saw jamies white sneakers over in the corner with his little travel bag hed never even put the sneakers back on next he typed in the sensor for his own son same result the blue spot was fixed at his own home address then it moved a little and his son jamie walked through the door dad what are you doing the police are outside they want to talk to everybody okay in a minute his mom is really upset dad in a minute shes crying mom said to get a tissue ill be right with you quickly henry typed in the third serial numberdaves number the screen went blank he waited a moment he saw the map as it was redrawn it now showed roads leading north of town in the area of torrey pines the blue dot was moving north torrey pines road ene mph as he watched the dot turned off onto gaylord road heading inland somehow daves sensor was in the hummer it either came out of his shoe or they had taken his shoe but the sensor was there and working he said jamie go get alex tell her i need to see her for a minute but dad do it and dont say anything to the police alex stared at the screen im going to get that son of a bitch and im going to blow his head off you touch my kid youre dead her voice was flat cold henry felt a chill she meant it wheres he going she said hes left the coast and heading inland but he may just be avoiding the del mar traffic he may go back to the coast again well know in a few minutes how far away is he ten minutes lets go you bring that she said nodding to the laptop ill get my gun henry looked out the front window there were three cop cars flashing their lights at the curb and six cops on the front lawn not that easy yes it is im parked around the corner they said they want to see me make an excuse ill be in my car he told them dave needed medical attention and he had to take him to the hospital he said that his wife lynn had witnessed everything and could tell them what had taken place he said he would give a full statement when he returned but he needed to take dave to the hospital since daves hands were bloody they accepted it lynn gave henry a funny look he said ill be back as soon as i can he walked around the back of the house and cut through the property behind dave followed him where are we going dave said to find that guy the guy with the black beard he hurted jamie yeah i know i hurted him too yeah i know his ears came off uhhuh next time his nose dave he said we need to show restraint whats restraint dave said it was too complicated to explain alexs white toyota was up ahead they got in the car he got in front dave got in back what is this dave said pointing to the seat beside him dont touch it dave alex said thats a gun she put the car in gear and drove off she called bob koch on the off chance that he had news i do he said but i wish it were better he let it go he held over until tomorrow did you try yeah i tried hes confused its not the usual legal area for oxnard judges thats probably why they filed there so tomorrow yeah thanks she said and hung up there was no point in telling him what she was about to do she wasnt even sure she would do it but she thought that she probably would henry was riding shotgun looking at the computer now that he was out here in a car the connection sometimes dropped out for a minute or two he began to worry about losing it altogether he glanced back at dave who was shoeless where are your shoes they camed off where in the white car he meant the ambulance how one was in his mouth the man then the car falled and your shoes came off yes they camed off apparently alex was thinking the same thing because she said then his shoes are still in the ambulance not the hummer were following the wrong car no the ambulance crashed it cant be the ambulance then the signal it must have fallen out of his shoe and slipped into the guys clothes somehow then it could slip out again yeah it could or they could find it yeah she didnt say anything after that he continued watching the screen the blue dot went north then east then north and finally east again passing rancho santa fe going back to the desert then it curved onto highland drive okay he said i know where theyre going solana canyon whats that its a spa very big very highend with doctors im sure they may even do surgery maybe facelifts liposuction something like that then they have surgical facilities she said grimly she stepped on the accelerator the one hundred acres known as solana canyon represented a triumph of marketing only a few decades earlier the region was known by its original name hellhole palms it was a flat boulderstrewn region without a canyon in sight thus solana canyon had no canyon and precious little to do with the coastal town of solana beach the name simply tracked better than the other choices which had been angel springs zen mountain view cedar springs and silver hill ashram compared to the other choices the name solana canyon conveyed a muted understated quality in keeping with a resort that charged thousands of dollars a day to rejuvenate the bodies minds and spirits of its clients this was accomplished through a combination of yoga massage meditation spiritual counseling and diet help all delivered by staff who greeted guests with prayerful hands and a heartfelt namaste solana canyon was also a favorite spot for celebrities to dry out alex drove right past the adobestyle main gate artfully concealed behind giant palms they were following the tracking signal which was going around the back of the resort hes taking the service entrance henry said youve been here before once a lecture on genetics and i wasnt invited back they didnt like the message you know the old saying professors attribute the intelligence of their students to environment and the intelligence of their children to genes same with rich people if youre rich or goodlooking you want to hear that your genes make you that way that enables you to feel inherently superior to other peoplethat you deserve your success and then you can give other people as much crap as youhold on theyre stopping slow down what now she said they were on a side road and there was a service entrance up ahead i think theyre in the parking lot so lets get them right there no he shook his head theres always a couple of security guys at the parking lot you show a gun and therell be trouble he watched the screen stationarynow moving again now stationary he frowned she said if theres security guards theyll see jamie struggling when he gets out maybe theyve drugged him ori dont know he said quickly seeing the pain on her face wait moving again theyre going around the back road she put the car in gear and drove to the service gate the gate was open nobody was on duty she drove through into the parking lot the back road was at the far corner of the lot what do we do she said follow them down the road i dont think so if we do theyll see us coming better park he opened the door lets take a walk through beautiful solana canyon resort he looked at her you going to leave that shotgun here no she said she popped open the trunk found a towel wrapped the shotgun in it and said im ready okay henry said here we go goddamn itvasco said stepping on the brakes he was driving around the back road to park behind the surgicenter the plan was for dr manuel cajal to come out of the surgicenter slip into the hummer do the biopsies and go out again nobody sees it nobodys the wiser but now the back road was blocked two backhoes digging some big trench no way across and no other road a hundred yards from the surgicenter damn damn damn he said take it easy vasco dolly said its no big deal if the road is blocked we just walk to the center go in the rear door and do it there everyone will see us walking through the resort so what were just visitors besides everybody at this place is completely selfabsorbed they have no time to think about us and if they did and if they decided to call someonewhich they never wouldthe procedured be finished before the call was finished manuel can do it faster in there than out here i dont like it vasco looked around stared at the road then at the spa grounds but she was right it was a quick walk through the garden he turned to the kid listen he said this is how it is were going to take a walk you just be quiet and everything will be fine whatre you going to do he said to me nothing just take a little blood are there needles just a little one like at the doctors he turned to dolly okay call manuel tell him were coming and lets get going jamie had been diligently taught to yell and scream and kick if anyone ever tried to kidnap him and he had done those things when they first grabbed him but now he was very frightened and he was afraid they would hurt him if he made any trouble so he walked quietly along the path of the garden with the woman keeping her hand on his shoulder and the big mean guy walking on the other side wearing a cowboy hat so his ear wouldnt show they passed people in bathrobes women mostly chatting and laughing but nobody really looked at them they walked on through another garden area and then he heard a voice say i say do you need help with your homework he was so startled he stopped he looked up it was a bird a sort of graycolored bird are you a friend of evan the bird said no he said youre the same size as he is whats eleven take away nine jamie was so surprised he just stared lets go dear dolly said its just a bird justa bird the bird said who are you calling abird you really talk a lot jamie said and you dont the bird said who are these people why are they holding you were not holding him dolly said you gentlemen arent really trying to kill my son are you the bird said ah christ vasco said ah christ the bird said exactly duplicating his voice whats your name lets get going vasco said my name is jamie jamie said hello jamie im gerard the bird said hello gerard all right vasco said lets get a move on here that depends on whos in the saddle gerard said dolly vasco said we have to keep to our schedule well a boys best friend is his mother the bird said in an odd voice do you know my mother jamie said no son dolly said he doesnt hes just saying things hes already heard before your story didnt sound quite right gerard said and in a different voice oh thats too bad you got a better one but now the grownups were pushing jamie forward he didnt think he could stay longer and he didnt want to make a scene bye gerard he said bye jamie they walked on for a while jamie said he was funny yes he was dear dolly said keeping her hand firmly on his shoulder coming into the gardens alex first passed the swimming pool area it was the quietest swimming pool she had ever seenno splashing no noise people lay in the sun like corpses there was a cabinet stacked with towels and bathrobes alex took a bathrobe and draped it over her shoulder covering the towelwrapped shotgun how do you know these things henry said watching her he was nervous walking with her while she carried that gun and knowing she intended to use it he didnt know if the bearded guy was armed but chances were that he was law school she said laughing dave walked a couple of steps behind them henry turned and said keep up dave okay they rounded a corner passed beneath an adobe archway came into another secluded garden the air here was cool and the path shaded a little brook ran alongside the path they heard a voice say mellow greetings ukie dukie henry looked up what was that me henry said its a bird excuse me the bird said my name is gerard alex said oh a talking parrot the parrot said my name is jamie hello jamie im gerard hello gerard alex froze stared thats jamie do you know my mother the bird said sounding exactly like jamies voice jamie alex started to shout in the garden jamiejamie and in the distance she heard mom dave took off running forward henry looked at alex who stood very still she dropped the towel and the robe to the ground and methodically loaded the shotgun she pulled the action bar back and forward making achung chung sound then she turned to henry lets go she was very cool the gun was cradled in her arm you may want to walk behind me uh okay she started walking jamie mom she walked faster they couldnt have been more than twenty feet from the back door to the surgicentermaybe three four good paces no more than thatwhen the whole thing started and vasco borden was pissed his trusted assistant just melting right before his eyes the kid cries mom and she lets go of him she just stands there like she was stunned hold on to him damn it he said what are you doing she didnt answer mom mom exactly what i was worried about he thought he had an eightyearold kid screaming for his mother and all these women in bathrobes walking around if they werent looking at him and the kid before they sure as hell were nowpointing and talking vasco appeared completely out of place sixfour and bearded dressed entirely in black with a black cowboy hat he had to pull down low because his damn ear had been bitten off he knew he looked like a bad guy in a bad cowboy movie his woman wasnt helping she wasnt soothing the kid or leading him forward and any minute he knew that kid would turn and bolt vasco needed to get control here he started to reach for his gun but now more women were coming out of rooms on all sideshell a whole damn yoga class was emptying into the garden to look to see why some kid was hollering for his mother and there he was the man in black he was screwed dolly he snapped goddamn it pull yourself together we have to take this young man into the surgicenter here vasco never finished the sentence because a dark shape came streaking toward him leapt into the air swung from a tree branch about eight feet high andright about the time he realized it was that black kid again that hairy kid the one that bit off his earthe black kid slammed into him hard as a big rock smashing him full on the chest and vasco stumbled backward over some rose bushes and went down on his ass legs up in the air and that was it the kid bolted shrieking for his mom and dolly suddenly starts acting like she doesnt know him and hes cut and scratched dragging himself out of the rose bushes with no help from her cant work up any dignity getting up to your feet with your ass full of thorns and theres at least a hundred people watching him and any minute security guards and the black monkeylooking kid is gone cant see him anywhere vasco realizes that hes got to get out of there its finished its a fucking disaster dolly is still frozen like the fucking statue of liberty so he starts pushing her yelling at her to get moving that they have to leave all the other women in the garden start booing and hissing some old broad in a leotard screams testosterone poisoning and the others are yelling leave her alone creep abuser he wants to yell back she works for me but of course she doesnt anymore shes dazed and bewildered and by now the leotard broads are screaming for the police so its only going to get worse dolly is so slow she might be sleepwalking vasco has to get out he pushes past her moving through the garden at a halftrot his only thought now to get away get out of this place in the next garden he sees the kid standing with some guy and in front of the two of them he sees the broad alex and shes holding a fucking sawedoff twelvegauge like she knows how to use ithand on the stock hand on the actionand she says if i ever see your face again ill blow it off asshole vasco doesnt answer just keeps moving past her and the next thing he knows theres a fucking explosion and ahead of him the bushes along the path just blast away in a green cloud of fluttering petals and leaves and dirt so of course he stops right there and he turns slowly keeping his hands away from his body she says did you fucking hear what i said to you yes maam he says always polite to a lady with a gun especially if shes upset now the crowd is huge theyre three or four deep chattering like birds craning to get a look at what is happening but this broads not going to let it go she yells at him whatd i say to you you said if you saw me again youd kill me thats right she says and i will you touch me or my son again and i will fucking kill you yes maam he says he feels the red rushing into his face anger humiliation rage you can go now she says moving the barrel ever so slightly she knows what she is doing a lawyer who goes to the shooting range the worst kind vasco nods and moves off quickly as he can he wants to get away from her and out of sight of all those women its like some nightmare all these women in robes watching him eat shit in a moment hes practically running back to the hummer away from this place thats when he saw the black kid the one who looked like an ape in fact he was an ape vasco was sure of it watching the kid move an ape dressed like a kid but he was still an ape the ape was circling around the garden just seeing that ape made vascos head throb where his ear once was without a conscious thought he pulled out his pistol and started firing he didnt expect to hit the little fucker at this distance but he needed to do something and sure enough the ape ran scrambled went behind a wall and disappeared vasco followed him it was the damn ladies room but nobody was around the lights in the bathroom were off he could see the pool off to his right but nobody was there now so nobody was in the bathroom except for the ape he held his gun and moved forward chung chung he froze he knew the sound of a doubleaction pump you never went in a room after you heard that sound he waited do you feel lucky punk do you it was a raspy voice sounded familiar he stood there in the doorway to the womens bathroom angry and afraid until he began to feel very foolish and very exposed ah screw it he said and he turned and went back to his car he didnt care about the fucking ape kid anyway from behind him a voice said my my such a lot of guns around town and so few brains he spun looked back but all he saw was that bird flapping its wings as it stood on the door leading to the bathroom he couldnt tell where the voice had come from vasco hurried to his hummer already he was thinking what he would tell the law firm and the biogen people fact was it just didnt work out the woman was armed she was tipped off someone had told her in advance nothing vasco could do about that he was good at his job but he couldnt work miracles the problem lay with whoever tipped her off before you blame me take a look at yourself they had a problem inside their organization anyhow something like that chapter adam winklerlay in the hospital bed frail and weak he was bald and pale his bony hand gripped joshs listen he said it wasnt your fault i was trying to kill myself anyway it would have happened no matter what the time you gave meyou did me a big favor look at me i dont want you blaming yourself josh couldnt speak his eyes were filled with tears promise me you wont blame yourself josh nodded liar adam gave a weak smile hows your lawsuit okay josh said some people in new york say we gave their mother alzheimers actually we gave her water you going to win oh sure adam sighed liar his hand relaxed you take care bro and he closed his eyes josh panicked wiped his tears away but adam was still breathing he was sleeping very peacefully chapter the oxnard judge coughed in the chilly air as he handed the ruling to the assembled attorneys alex burnet was there along with bob koch and albert rodriguez as you can see he said i have ruled that biogens ownership of mr burnets cells does not entitle them to take these cells from any individual living or dead including mr burnet himself certainly the cells cannot be taken from members of his immediate or extended family any contrary ruling would conflict with the thirteenth amendment forbidding slavery within the context of my ruling i observe that this situation has arisen out of confusion from prior court rulings as to what constitutes ownership in a biological context first is the notion that material removed from the body is waste or lost material which is therefore unimportant to the person from whom it was removed this view is false if one considers a stillborn fetus for example even though it has left the mothers body we can well intuit that either the mother or other relatives might feel a strong attachment to the fetus and wish to control its disposition whether in burial cremation or to provide tissues for research or to help others the notion that the hospital or the doctor may dispose of the fetus as they wish merely because it is outside the body and therefore is waste material is clearly unreasonable and inhuman a similar logic applies to mr burnets cells even though they are removed from his body he will rightly feel that they are still his this is a natural and common human feeling the feeling will not go away simply because the courts rule according to some other legal concept shoehorned in by analogy you cannot banish human feelings by legal fiat yet this is precisely what the courts have tried to do some courts have decided tissue cases by considering the tissues to be trash some courts have considered the tissues to be research material akin to books in a library some courts consider the tissues to be abandoned property that can be disposed of automatically under certain circumstances as rental lockers can be opened after a certain time and the contents of those lockers sold some courts have attempted to balance competing claims and have concluded that the claims of society to research trump the claims of the individual to ownership each of these analogies runs up against the stubborn fact of human nature our bodies are our individual property in a sense bodily ownership is the most fundamental kind of ownership we know it is the core experience of our being if the courts fail to acknowledge this fundamental notion their rulings will be invalid however correct they may seem within the logic of law that is why when an individual donates tissue to a doctor for a research study it is not the same as donating a book to a library it never will be if the doctor or his research institution wishes later to use that tissue for some other purpose they should be required to obtain permission for this new use and so on indefinitely if magazines can notify you when your subscription runs out universities can notify you when they wish to use your tissues for a new purpose we are told this is onerous to medical research the reverse is true if universities do not recognize that people retain a reasonable and emotional interest in their tissue in perpetuity then people will not donate their tissues for research they will sell them to corporations instead and their lawyers will refine documents that forbid the universities to use so much as a blood test for any purpose at all without negotiated payment patients are not naive and neither are their attorneys the cost of medical research will increase astronomically if physicians and universities continue to act in a highhanded manner the true social good therefore is to enact legislation that enables people to maintain disposition rights to their tissue forever we are told that a patients interest in his tissues and his right to privacy ends at death that too is outmoded thinking that must change because the descendants of a dead person share his or her genes their privacy is invaded if research is done or if the genetic makeup of the dead person is published the children of the dead person may lose their health insurance simply because contemporary laws do not reflect contemporary realities but in the end the burnet case has gone awry as it has because of a profound and fundamental error by the courts issues of ownership will always be clouded when individuals are able to manufacture within their bodies what the court has ruled someone else owns this is true of cell lines it is true of genes and of certain proteins these things cannot reasonably be owned it is a standing rule of law that our common heritage cannot be owned by any person it is a standing rule that facts of nature cannot be owned yet for more than two decades legal rulings have failed to affirm this concept patent court rulings have failed to affirm this concept the resultant confusions will only increase with time and with the advances of science private ownership of the genome or of facts of nature will become increasingly difficult expensive obstructive what has been done by the courts is a mistake and it must be undone the sooner the better alex turned to bob koch i think this judge had help she said yeah could be bob said chapter rick diehl was trying to keep it together but everything seemed to be falling apart the maturity gene was a disaster and worse biogen was getting sued by a lawyer in new york who was smart and unscrupulous ricks attorneys told him to settle but if he did it would bankrupt the company although that would probably happen anyway biogen had lost the burnet line they had failed to replace it with cells from burnets kid and now it looked like a new patent interfered with their product rendering it worthless at diehls request his wife had come out of hiding and returned to town the kids were at her parents house in marthas vineyard for the summer she was going to get custody his attorney barry sindler was himself facing a divorce and didnt seem to have time for rick these days there was a big uproar over all the gene testing being done for custody cases sindler had been widely denounced for pioneering the practice deemed unethical there was talk in congress of passing laws to limit genetic testing but observers doubted congress would ever act because the insurance companies wanted testing which was only logical given that insurance companies were in the business of not paying claims brad gordon had left town while awaiting trial it was rumored he was traveling around the west getting himself into trouble rodriguezs law firm had presented biogen with the first part of their bill for more than a million dollars they wanted another two million on retainer in light of all the pending litigation the company faced ricks assistant buzzed him on the intercom mr diehl the woman from bdg the security company is here to see you he sat up in his chair he remembered how electrifying jacqueline maurer was she radiated sexuality and sophistication he felt alive just being with her and he hadnt seen her in weeks send her in he stood up hastily stuffed his shirt into his pants and turned to the door a young woman of thirty wearing a nondescript blue suit and carrying a briefcase came into the room she had a pleasant smile a chubby face and shoulderlength brown hair mr diehl im andrea woodman of bdg im sorry i havent been able to meet with you earlier but gosh weve been so busy with other clients the last few weeks this was the first i could come im so glad to make your acquaintance she held out her hand he just stared cavemen preferred blondes anthropologist notes rapid evolution of light gene are blondes really sexier a new study by canadian anthropologist peter frost indicates that european women evolved blue eyes and blond hair at the end of the last ice age as a way to attract mates the hair color gene mc r evolved seven variants around years ago he notes this occurred extremely rapidly in genetic terms ordinarily such a change would take close to a million years but sexual preference can produce rapid genetic change competition by women for males who were in short supply due to early death in harsh times led to the new hair and eye color frosts conclusions are supported by the work of three japanese universities which fixed the date of the genetic mutation for blondes frost suspects that blondes have sexual appeal because light hair and eyes are a marker for high estrogen levels in women and hence greater fertility but not everyone agrees with this view jodie kidd the blond model said i dont think being a blonde makes you more ripe for sexual activitybeauty is much deeper than the color of your hair professor frosts theory appeared in the journal evolution and human behavior his research was corroborated by a who study that predicted the demise of blondes by subsequent reports contested the results of the who study after a un panel denied its accuracy chapter frank burnet walked into the starkly modern offices of venture capitalist jack watson shortly after noon it was as he had seen it on previous visits the mies furniture the modern arta warhol painting of alexander the great a koons balloon sculpture a tansey painting of mountain climbers that hung behind watsons desk the muted phones the beige carpetsand all the stunning women moving quietly efficiently one woman stood beside watson with her hand on his shoulder ah frank watson said he did not stand have you met jacqueline maurer i dont believe so she shook his hand very cool very direct mr burnet and you know our resident tech genius jimmy maxwell watson nodded to a kid in his twenties sitting at the back of the room the kid had thick hornrim glasses and wore a dodgers jacket he looked up from his laptop and waved to burnet how ya doing hi there burnet said i asked you to come in watson said shifting in his chair because we are very nearly finished with the entire business ms maurer has just negotiated the license agreement with duke university on extremely favorable terms the woman smiled a sphinxlike smile i get on with scientists she said and rick diehl watson continued has resigned as the head of biogen winkler and the rest of the senior staff have gone with him most of them face legal troubles and i am sad the company will not be able to assist them if you break the law the companys insurance policy does not cover you so theyre on their own unfortunate jacqueline maurer said so it goes watson said but given the present crisis the biogen board of directors has asked me to take over and put the company back on its feet i have agreed to do so for an appropriate equity adjustment burnet nodded then it all went according to plan watson gave him an odd look uh yes in any case frank nothing more prevents you from returning home to your family i am sure your daughter and grandson will be happy to see you i hope so burnet said shes probably angry but itll work out it always does thats right watson said still seated he extended his hand wincing a little everything all right frank said its nothing too much golf yesterday i pulled something but its good to take time off from work so true watson said flashing his famous smile so very true chapter brad gordon followed the crowds that swarmed toward mighty kong the huge roller coaster at cedar point in sandusky ohio hed been visiting amusement parks for weeks now this one was the biggest and best in america he was feeling better his jaw was almost completely painfree now the only thing that bothered him was he had had one conversation with his lawyer johnson johnson seemed smart but brad was uneasy why hadnt his uncle paid for a firstrate attorney he always had before brad had the vague feeling that his life was on some sort of knifeedge but he pushed all those thoughts aside as he looked at the track far above him and the people shrieking as their cars went by this roller coaster mighty kong with more than four hundred feet of drop it gave plenty of cause for people to scream the line of eager ticketholders buzzed with anticipation brad waited as was his custom until two very cute young girls got on line they were local kids raised in a milk bottle healthy and pinkskinned with little budding breasts and sweet faces one girl had braces which was just adorable he stayed behind them happily listening to their highpitched inane chatter then he screamed with the rest of them as he took the fantastic drop the ride left him shivering with adrenaline and pentup excitement he felt a bit weak as he climbed out of the car and watched the girls round little buns as they walked away from the coaster toward the exit wait they were going again perfect he followed them getting on line a second time he was feeling dreamy catching his breath letting his eyes drift over the soft curls of their hair the freckles on their shoulders revealed by their halter tops he was starting to fantasize about what it would be like with one of themhell with both of themwhen a man stepped forward and said come with me please brad blinked guilty from his reverie im sorry would you come with me sir it was a handsome confident face one encouraging him smiling brad was instantly suspicious often cops acted friendly and polite he hadnt done anything with these girls he was sure of it he hadnt touched them hadnt said anything sir please its important if you would step over herejust over here brad looked and saw to one side some people wearing what appeared to be uniforms maybe security uniforms and a couple of men in white coats like people from a sanitarium and there was a television crew or a camera crew of some kind filming and he suddenly felt paranoid sir the handsome man said please we very much need you why do you need me sir please the man was plucking at brads elbow then grabbed it more forcefully sir we get so few adult repeaters adult repeaters brad shivered they knew and now this guy this handsome charming smoothtalker was leading him toward the people in the white coats they were obviously onto him and he tugged free but the handsome man held on brads heart was pounding and he felt panic flood through him he bent over and pulled his gun from its holster no let go of me the handsome man looked shocked some people screamed the man held up his hands now take it easy he said its going to be the gun in brads hand fired he didnt realize it had happened until he saw the man stumble and start to fall he clutched at brad hanging on him and brad shot again the man fell back everybody was screaming all over the place somebody shouted he shot dr bellarmino he shot bellarmino but by then he was very confused the crowd was running away those cute little buns were running everything was ruined and when more men in uniform yelled to him to drop his gun he fired at them too and the world went black chapter at the fall meeting of the organization of university technology transfer officers outt a group dedicated to licensing the work of university scientists philanthropist jack b watson gave the stirring keynote address he struck his familiar themes the spectacular growth of biotechnology the importance of gene patents keeping bayhdole in place and the necessity of preserving the status quo for business prosperity and university wealth the health and wealth of our universities depends on strong biotech partners this is the key to knowledge and the key to the future he told them what they wanted to hear and left the stage to the usual thunderous applause only a few noticed that he walked with a slight limp and that his right arm did not swing as freely as the left backstage he took the arm of a beautiful woman where the hell is dr robbins hes waiting for you in his clinic she said watson swore then leaned on the woman as he walked outside to the waiting limousine the night was cold with a faint mist fucking doctors he said im not doing any more damn tests dr robbins didnt mention anything about tests the driver opened the door watson climbed in awkwardly his leg dragging the woman helped him in he slumped in the back wincing the woman got in on the other side is the pain bad its worse at night do you want a pill i already took one he inhaled deeply does robbins know what the hell this is i think so did he tell you no youre lying he didnt tell me jack christ the limousine sped through the night watson stared out the window breathing hard the hospital clinic was deserted at this hour fred robbins thirtyfive and handsome as a movie star was waiting for watson with two younger physicians in a large examining room robbins had set up light boxes with xray electrophoresis and mri results watson dropped heavily into a chair he waved to the younger men you can go but jack tell me alone watson said to robbins nineteen fucking doctors have examined me in the last two months ive done so many mris and cat scans i glow in the dark you tell me he waved to the woman you wait outside too they all left watson was alone with robbins they say youre the smartest diagnostician in america fred so tell me well robbins said its as much a biochemical process as anything thats why i wanted three months ago watson said i had a pain in my leg a week later the leg was dragging my shoe was worn on the edge pretty soon i had trouble walking up stairs now i have weakness in my right arm cant squeeze toothpaste with my hand its getting hard to breathe in three months so tell me its called vogelmans paresis robbins said its not common but not rare a few thousand cases every year maybe fifty thousand worldwide first described in the s by a french can you treat it at this point robbins said there are no satisfactory treatments are there any treatments palliative and supportive measures massage and b vitamins but no treatments not really jack no what causes it that we know five years ago enderss team at scripps isolated a genebrda that codes for a protein that repairs myelin around nerve cells theyve demonstrated that a point mutation in the gene produces vogelmans paresis in animals well hell watson said youre telling me ive got a genetic deficiency disease like any other yes but how long ago did they find the gene five years then its a natural for gene replacement start the coded protein being made inside the body replacement therapy is risky of course do i give a damn look at me fred how much time do i have the time course is variable but spit it out maybe four months jesus watson sucked in his breath he ran his hand over his forehead took another breath okay so thats my situation lets do the therapy five years later they must have a protocol they dont robbins said somebody must they dont scripps patented the gene and licensed it to beinart baghoff the swiss pharma giant it was part of a package deal with scripps about twenty different collaborationsbrda wasnt regarded as particularly important whatre you saying beinart put a high license fee on the gene why its an orphan disease it makes no sense to robbins shrugged theyre a big company who knows why they do things their licensing division sets fees for eight hundred genes that they control theres forty people in that division its a bur eaucracy anyway they set the license high christ and no laboratory anywhere in the world has worked on the disease in the last five years christ too expensive jack then ill buy the damn gene cant i already checked its not for sale everythings for sale any sale by beinart has to be approved by scripps and the scripps office of tech transfer wont consider never mind ill license it myself you can do that yes and ill set up the gene transfer myself well get a team in this hospital to do it i really wish we could jack but gene transfers extremely risky and no lab will take the chance these days nobodys gone to jail yet over a failed gene transfer but there have been a lot of patient deaths and fred look at me you can get it done in shanghai no no here fred robbins bit his lip jack you have to face reality theres less than a one percent success rate i mean if we had done five years of work we would have the results of animal tests vector tests immunosuppressive protocols all kinds of steps to increase your chance of success but just shooting from the hip thats all i have time for shooting from the hip fred robbins was shaking his head a hundred million dollars watson said for whatever lab does it take over a private clinic out in arcadia just me nobody knows do the procedure there it works or it doesnt fred robbins shook his head sadly im sorry jack i really am chapter the overheadlights came on in the autopsy room bank after bank it made a dramatic opening shot gorevitch thought the figure in the lab coat was distinguishedlooking in a severe way silver hair wirerim glasses he was the internationally renowned primate anatomist jorg erickson using a handheld camera gorevitch said dr erickson what are we doing today we are examining a worldfamous specimen the putative talking orangutan of indonesia this animal is said to have spoken in at least two languages well we shall see dr erickson turned to the steel table where the carcass was draped in a white cloth he pulled the cloth away with a flourish this is a subadult or juvenilepongo abelii a sumatran orangutan distinguished by its smaller size from the borneo orangutan this specimen is male approximately three years of age in apparent good health with no external scars or injuriesall right now we begin he picked up a scalpel with a midsagittal incision i expose the anterior musculature of the throat and pharynx note the superior and inferior belly of the omohyoid and here the sternohyoidhmmm erickson was bent over the animals neck gorevitch found it difficult to maneuver for a shot what do you see professor i am looking now at the stylohyoid and the cricothyroid muscles here and hereand this is quite interesting ordinarily in pongo we find the anterior musculature poorly developed and lacking the fine motor control of the human speech apparatus but this creature appears to be a transitional case bearing some features of the classic pongid pharynx and some features more characteristic of the human neck notice the sternocleidomastoid gorevitch thought sternocleidomastoid jesus they would have to dub in a voiceover professor perhaps you could say it in english no the terms are latin i dont know the translation i mean can you explain in laymans terms for our viewers ah of course all these superficial muscles most of which attach to the hyoidthat is to say the adams applethese muscles are more human than apelike what could account for that some mutation obviously and the rest of the animal is it more human as well i have not seen the rest of the animal erickson said severely but we will get there in due time i shall be especially interested to inspect any rotation of the axis of the foramen magnum and of course the depth and arrangement of sulci of the motor cortex to the extent that gray matter has been preserved do you expect to find humanlike changes in the brain frankly no i do not erickson said he turned his attention to the top of the skull running his gloved hands over the sparse hair of the orangs scalp feeling the bones beneath you see in this animal parietal bones slope inward toward the top of the cranium that is a classic pongid or chimp finding whereas humans have bulging parietal bones the top of their heads are wider than the bottom erickson stepped back from the table gorevitch said so you are saying this animal is a mixture of human and ape no erickson said this is an ape it is an aberrant ape to be sure but it is merely an ape john b watson investment group for immediate release john b jack watsonworldfamous philanthropist and founder of the watson investment group died today in shanghai china mr watson was internationally lauded for his charitable work and his efforts on behalf of the poor and downtrodden of the world mr watson had been ill for only a short time but he suffered from an extremely aggressive form of cancer he checked into a private shanghai clinic and died three days later he is mourned by friends and colleagues around the world story details tk chapter henry kendall was surprised that gerard could help dave with his math homework but that wouldnt last long eventually dave would probably need special schooling dave had inherited the chimps short attention span he found it increasingly difficult to keep up with the other kids in class particularly in reading which was agony for him and his physical prowess put him in another league on the playground the other children wouldnt let him play so he had become an excellent surfer and by now the truth was out there had been a particularly distressing article inpeople magazine the modern family which said the most uptodate family is no longer a samesex family or a blended family or an interracial family thats all so last century says tracy kendall and she should know because the kendall family of la jolla california is transgenic and interspeciescreating more excitement in the household than a barrel of monkeys henry had been called to testify before congress which he found a peculiar experience the congressmen spoke to the cameras for two hours then they got up and left pleading urgent business elsewhere then the witnesses spoke for six minutes each but there were no congressmen there to hear their remarks later the congressmen all announced they would soon deliver major speeches on the subject of transgenic creation henry was named scientist of the year by the society for libertarian biology jeremy rifkin called him a war criminal he had been excoriated by the national council of churches the pope excommunicated him only later to discover that he wasnt catholic they had the wrong henry kendall the nih criticized his work but the replacement for robert bellarmino as head of genetics was william gladstone and he was much more openminded and less selfaggrandizing than bellarmino had been henry now traveled continuously lecturing about transgenic techniques at university seminars around the country he was the subject of intense controversy the reverend billy john harker of tennessee called him satan incarnate bill mayer noted leftwing reactionary published a long and muchdiscussed article in the new york review of books entitled banished from eden why we must prevent transgenic travesties the article failed to mention that transgenic animals had been in existence for two decades already dogs cats bacteria mice sheep and cattle had all been created when a senior nih scientist was asked about the article he coughed and said whats the new york review lynn kendall ran the transgenic times web site which detailed the daily life of dave gerard and her fully human children jamie and tracy after a year in la jolla gerard began to make dialtone sounds he had done it before but the tones were mysterious to the kendalls evidently they were the tones of a foreign telephone exchange but they failed to identify which country where did you come from gerard they would ask i cant sleep a wink anymore ever since you first walked out the door he had become enamored of american country music all you ever do is bring me down what country gerard to that they never received an answer he spoke some french and he often talked with a british accent they assumed he was european then one day one of henrys graduate students from france was having dinner at their house and he heard gerards tones my god he said i know what he is doing he listened for a moment there is no city code he said but otherwiselets try he pulled out his own cell phone and began to key in numbers do it again gerard gerard repeated the tones and again life is a book youve got to read it gerard sang life is a story and youve got to tell it i know this song the graduate student said what is it henry said its eurovision gerard the tones eventually gerard did the dial tones the graduate student placed the call his first guess was to try paris a woman answered the phone he said in french excuse me but do you know of a grey parrot who is named gerard the woman began to cry let me speak to him she said is he all right he is fine they held the phone by gerards perch and he listened to the womans voice his head bobbed excitedly then he said is this where you live oh mothers going to love it here gail bond arrived to visit a few days later she stayed a week and then returned alone gerard it seemed wanted to stay for days afterward he sang my baby used to stay out all night long she made me cry she done me wrong she hurt my eyes open thats no lie tables turn and now her turn to cry because i used to love her but its all over now all in all things were working out much better than anyone expected the family was busy but everyone got along there were only two worrisome trends henry noticed that dave had developed a few gray hairs around his muzzle so it was possible that dave like most other transgenics might die earlier than usual and one autumn day while dave was walking with henry at the county fair holding henrys hand a farmer in overalls came up and said id like to get me one of them to work on my farm that gave henry a chill ebook extras a conversation with michael crichton author of next q next challenges the readers sense of what is happening what is true and what is invented how much of whats in the book has already taken place its odd but nearly everything in the book has already happened or is about to happen the book does look to the future a bit particularly with regard to some transgenic animals that become important characters but for the most part next is not really speculative fiction at all q what scares you the most about next and conversely which possibilities do you find the most encouraging im not really scared about anything in the genetic realm my research actually reassured me because i concluded that many of the things people discuss with great fear or great longingsuch as designer babies or extended longevityare probably not going to happen i think that well have some remarkable new therapies from this area and we will also find that the genome is vastly more complicated than we anticipated in that sense the genome is a bit like the human brainmuch harder to understand than we once imagined q what first sparked your interest in genetics its a longstanding interest for me i studied genetics and evolution in college and of course as a medical student genetics has been one of the most exciting areas of scientific research in my lifetime its hard to remember that when i was born in the s people werent really sure what a gene consisted of and they thought human beings had chromosomes instead of and they had no idea at all how an embryo grew and differentiated into a live birth q in the past youve said that you usually do research to answer a question of your own that interests you what was the origin of next possibly for powells this novel began when i attended a genetics conference at the salk institute in la jolla i learned just how fast the field was progressing and how inappropriate certain legal positions were the field obviously needed some broader attention from the public in terms of the novel the question i asked was whats the current view of how the genome operateshow you get from genotype to phenotype because such ideas have changed hugely in the last decades of course this question is ultimately the old naturenurture issue and so it is politically charged how much of our behavior is ruled by genes and how much by upbringing and experience i ultimately concluded i couldnt really address this question in the book because it is so complex but i arrived at answers for myself that surprised and satisfied me my answer is that genes are an integral part of our adaptive apparatus as organisms in an environment so we find both heightened importance for nature and also for nurture but the whole interaction is far more complicated than people thought fifty years ago and it continues to change q next poses many complex questions and presents the audience with many moral gray areas where do you stand on the ethics of genetic engineering stem cell research genetic therapy and gene patents i oppose patenting genes and argue such patents should never have been granted in the first place the genome is our common heritage going back millions of years and it is absurd that anyone should own any part of it i hope this book helps undo gene patents the practice is obstructive and even dangerous genetic therapy is highly experimental it has great promise and great hazards stem cell research is more a political football than a therapeutic issue at this point politically its a continuation of the abortion controversy that has wracked this country for nearly half a century with no end in sight what stem cell research will ultimately offer us is wholly unknown it may be hugely powerful it may be a dead end but in any case i oppose bans on research they dont work and they displace the arguments which become about the ban and not about the subject of the research itself as for the ethics of genetic engineering most people argue excitedly about what is not possible if it were possible to pop genes in and out of embryos to make designer babies then we would indeed have serious ethical questions to face at the moment that is not possible at all i therefore dont think that talking about it does a lot of good on major human life decisions i dont think there is great value in deciding what you will do until you are actually faced with the issue for example i think it is fruitless to speculate what you would do if you had a fatal disease eventually we all get one and our behavior at that point will probably not be what we imagined similarly i think we dont know in advance how we will respond to opportunities in new technology we just dont know q what is the latest court ruling as to what constitutes cell ownership are there any upcoming cases that youre keeping an eye on rules regarding tissues are fragmented a recent sixth circuit decision regarding the tissue collection of dr william catalona has set back the efforts of patients to have some control over what happens to their tissues once donated to medical research there are good reasons why patients deserve such control if you give your tissue for prostate research you might not want the tissues used for other purposes you disagree with you might have religious or other objections you might have legal concerns because if your genetic information was published your insurance might be cancelled these are genuine concerns federal guidelines regarding tissues are much more humane and they dont interfere with research we need congress to make these guidelines the law of the land q one of your characters warns that science is as corruptible an enterprise as any other academics and entrepreneurs are way too cozy and data can be massaged to achieve any desired result is this something the american public should be more aware of i hope that such unsavory narratives as the vioxx scandal will convince the public that we need better and more independent sources of information but it is also true that the british slaughter of livestock at the height of the bse scare now seems to have been unnecessary the result of a flawed computer prediction we are going to see more such errors in many areas of science i believe we live in the greatest era of snake oil salesmen in the history of mankind unless government acts to assure us of independently verified information we will continue to suffer bad science policies and even deaths q how do you stay informed about current and cuttingedge science how much do you read are you actively involved in the scientific community there is no secret i just read a lot i dont talk to a lot of scientists its faster to read than talk q many of your previous books have ignited public discussion and debate do you think next will provoke a similar response i am never sure how the public reaction to my books will be im usually surprised i wont make any predictions about this book q in you appeared before the united states senates committee on environment and public works to discuss the politicization of scientific research what was your message why is this such a big problem and what is the solution essentially i argued that what we need is a government policy that assures independently verified information in any area that is important to policy this is the essence of the scientific method there are wellestablished statistical procedures to make sure that the information you get is unbiased its simple enough to do although expensive but bad information is expensive and bad policies are very expensive i argue that we live in a technological society where science matters and it is up to the government to make sure that what were told is accurate for this rather ordinary argument i was thoroughly attacked there are many people out there who dont want their data to be checked q whats so striking about all your books and now next in particular is your ability to make complicated science comprehensible to a mass audience while also showcasing your tremendous expertise how do you pull that off time after time again theres no secret making the story clear is accomplished by rewriting and rewriting until the technical passages are understandable in any book there are usually a few pages that i end up rewriting about twenty times q after the final thrilling page what would you most like readers to take away from next the future is bright and exciting and it will challenge us to think in fresh ways about our lives but among our challenges today we have some legal problems in genetics that need to be fixed we need some laws passed and some laws changed but i am optimistic about the future very optimistic michael crichton next audio interview transcript jb hi im jonathan burnham publisher of harpercollins and im here interviewing bestsellingauthor michael crichton about his new novel next michael as with many of your other novels next is a vivid dramatization of what can happen when cuttingedge science goes a little too far is next a cautionary tale mc well i think it is in the sense that many of the books are but for me whats different about this book is that so much of it is realor that so much of it is very thinlydisguised versions of actual events that have occurred genetics which is the subject of the book has advanced extraordinarily rapidly in the last years or so and sometimes in directions that many people are troubled about or disapprove of and so it is a very interesting and hot contentious area jb and have you been tracking the science of genetics for the last years watching it seeing whats going on and building a portfolio mc actually you know its odd i was very interested in it at the time of jurassic park which now to my astonishment was years ago and i lost track of it a bit so to return is to have this odd sense of coming into a world where so many things that were fictional years ago are now taking place jb youve chosen a very interesting and i think new form for this novel which is to break down the conventional narrative into many different stores some of which overlap some of which are selfcontained and others which move forward and become the principle themes of the book how did you conceive of this book in formal terms mc well i think there were two considerations that i had one was that i was unable to overlook the structure of the genome as we are now starting to understand it and how individual genes interact with other genes or may seem to be silent or we dont really know what they do or sometimes there are repetitions that are not clear to us and it struck me as an interesting idea to try to organize the novel in that way even though its not what one ordinarily does the second thing that was driving me was the notion that there are a great many stories of interest in this area and theyre all quite different in terms of the legal and ethical problems that are raised in the field so i wanted to do a number of different stories jb next poses a large number of ethical issues to the reader do you personally have a strong position on these issues mc well i do on some and not on others the feeling in general that i have is that we have too little information and the impulse in some quarters to ban things or prevent research or curtail it seems to me illadvised and also not very practical whatever research isnt done in the united states will be done in shanghai so what exactly is being accomplished i do think that there are some things that have been done in a business sense that are tremendously bad and dangerous and inappropriate and among those are the patenting of genes we have within our bodies for the most part identical genes and many of these genes are millions or even billions of years oldtheyre found in other animals theyre found in microorganisms and yet theyre being patented nowdiseases are being patented hepatitis c is owned by somebody haemophilus influenza is owned by somebody the gene for insulin is owned this seems to me to be very wrong on a number of levels and i hope that this will be changed and the book will be influential in starting a discussion jb youve written about many frightening areas of science in your novelshow does genetics rate in the large field that youve covered in terms of the elements of fear connected to reality that are built into it mc as a person i think i am myself not very fearful and it may be that i get out all of these fears in my work the first sort of genetics book that i did that addressed any of these things was jurassic park and that was of course entirely fiction whats happened at this point is that many of these possibilities are real and so you see because of the structure and the way that things are being done when you hear for example that scientists were reluctant to study sarsthe severe acute respiratory syndrome that was spreading across the worlda disease that had a fatality and was suddenly in countriesand scientists hesitated to study it because there was a conflict over who would own the genomewho would get the patent thats very scarythat business interest might put us all at risk for a pandemicits kind of insane jb how do you keep abreast of new developments in science mc for the most part its simply reading i do visit occasionally laboratories but not very often and there are sort of two reasons for it one is that when one goes to an individual laboratory one spends time with someone who has a particularly strong interested in a very narrow area which is usually not my area of interest and the other thing is that to read is the equivalent of talking to people on the telephoneits just simply much faster its a much quicker way and the journals stack up in my office and i go through them as best i can jb your first goal as a writer im sure is to entertain and youve done that brilliantly in this book but in terms of asking readers to think about the issues that youre exploring what do you want the reader to take away from next after theyve finished it mc what my experience was in working on this was a kind of combination of anxiety and excitementthe possibility of really wonderful things that might happenthe possibility that for example certain genetic diseases might actually be cured and people who might previously either were certain to die or could only be treated in fairly unsatisfactory waysthere now is the likelihood that you will be able to inject the gene and that person is curedthats quite extraordinary and there are many other examples of new cancer treatments and other things that are just amazing and then on the other side there is this connection of law and business and academia which is very distressing in the directions that its going and it involves a tremendous amount of secrecy and involves a tremendous direction which i think is against the public interest and which i think really ought to distress and frighten people jb if you were in a position to create legislation how would you being to reign in the bad sciencethe combination of science business and academics moving in the wrong direction as you see it mc i think there are actually three or four things that would really transform the field the first thing that i would do is i would make the testing of genes for medical diagnoses completely legal irrespective of patents i think that would do a great public service and also oblige scientists to start to look at the patenting business in a different way the second thing i would do is i would require universities to follow federal guidelines for use of tissues in research federal guidelines are excellentthey give people a tremendous amount of control over the tissues that they donatemany universities institutions of higher learning are trying to break these rules trying to go in another directionthey ought not to be allowed to and i would change that the third thing i would do is i would make sure people got the information that they needed to make informed decisions there are some situations now where patients have died from gene therapy and the institutions involved have said that they dont want the deaths reported because theyre a trade secret this is so insane laughs that the mind bogglesthis whatever legislation is needed to stop that we ought to do and the final thing is that in there was a law passed that was called bidolebipartisan law that enabled universities to sell their products to industry and it was wellintentioned but it has had the effect of creating this gigantic commercial consulation within universities that is very damaging and so i would reverse that law jb in spite of the serious message of the book and the profound issues youre tackling there is a lot of fun in this book there are many jokes there are many very amusing passages and stories and there are a number of ideasconceptsthat perhaps are true or perhaps are fictional is there anything in the book that you would like to be real that perhaps isnt realthat would improve your life mc interesting questioni dont know how to answer thati guess what i feel is that whatever i might imagine is probably right around the corner anyway laughs jb absolutely thank you so much for this interview and we are sure that this book is going to be a huge success this essay breaks the law by michael crichton the earth revolves around the sun the speed of light is a constant apples fall to earth because of gravity elevated blood sugar is linked to diabetes elevated uric acid is linked to gout elevated homocysteine is linked to heart disease elevated homocysteine is linked to b deficiency so doctors should test homocysteine levels to see whether the patient needs vitamins actually i cant make that last statement a corporation has patented that fact and demands a royalty for its use anyone who makes the fact public and encourages doctors to test for the condition and treat it can be sued for royalty fees any doctor who reads a patients test results and even thinks of vitamin deficiency infringes the patent a federal circuit court held that mere thinking violates the patent all this may sound absurd but it is the heart of a case that will be argued before the supreme court on tuesday in researchers filed a patent application for a method of testing the levels of homocysteine an amino acid in the blood they went one step further and asked for a patent on the basic biological relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency a patent was granted that covered both the test and the scientific fact eventually a company called metabolite took over the license for the patent although metabolite does not have a monopoly on test methodsother companies make homocysteine tests toothey assert licensing rights on the correlation of elevated homocysteine with vitamin deficiency a company called labcorp used a different test but published an article mentioning the patented fact metabolite sued on a number of grounds and has won in court so far but what the supreme court will focus on is the nature of the claimed correlation on the one hand courts have repeatedly held that basic bodily processes and products of nature are not patentable thats why no one owns gravity or the speed of light but at the same time courts have granted socalled correlation patents for many years powerful forces are arrayed on both sides of the issue in addition there is the rather bizarre question of whether simply thinking about a patented fact infringes the patent the idea smacks of thought control to say nothing of unenforceability it seems like something out of a novel by philip k dickor kafka but it highlights the uncomfortable truth that the patent office and the courts have in recent decades ruled themselves into a corner from which they must somehow extricate themselves for example the human genome exists in every one of us and is therefore our shared heritage and an undoubted fact of nature nevertheless percent of the genome is now privately owned the gene for diabetes is owned and its owner has something to say about any research you do and what it will cost you the entire genome of the hepatitis c virus is owned by a biotech company royalty costs now influence the direction of research in basic diseases and often even the testing for diseases such barriers to medical testing and research are not in the public interest do you want to be told by your doctor oh nobody studies your disease any more because the owner of the geneenzymecorrelation has made it too expensive to do research the question of whether basic truths of nature can be owned ought not to be confused with concerns about how we pay for biotech development whether we will have drugs in the future and so on if you invent a new test you may patent it and sell it for as much as you can if thats your goal companies can certainly own a test they have invented but they should not own the disease itself or the gene that causes the disease or essential underlying facts about the disease the distinction is not difficult even though patent lawyers attempt to blur it and even if correlation patents have been granted the overwhelming majority of medical correlations including those listed above are not owned and shouldnt be unfortunately for the public the metabolite case is only one example of a much broader patent problem in this country we grant patents at a level of abstraction that is unwise and its gotten us into trouble in the past some years back doctors were allowed to patent surgical procedures and sue other doctors who used their methods without paying a fee a blizzard of lawsuits followed this unhealthy circumstance was halted in by the american medical association and congress which decided that doctors couldnt sue other doctors for using patented surgical procedures but the beat goes on companies have patented their method of hiring and real estate agents have patented the way they sell houses lawyers now advise athletes to patent their sports moves and screenwriters to patent their movie plots my screenplay for jurassic park was cited as a good candidate where does all this lead it means that if a real estate agent lists a house for sale he can be sued because an existing patent for selling houses includes item no list the house it means that kobe bryant may serve as an inspiration but not a model because nobody can imitate him without fines it means nobody can write a dinosaur story because my patent includes items covering all aspects of behavior like item no dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs such a situation is idiotic of course yet elements of it already exist and unless we begin to turn this around there will be worse to come i wanted to end this essay by telling a story about how current rulings hurt us but the patent for ending an essay with an anecdote is owned so i thought to end with a quotation from a famous person but that strategy is patented too i then decided to end abruptly but abrupt ending for dramatic effect is also patented finally i decided to pay the end with summary patent fee since it was the least expensive the supreme court should rule against metabolite and the patent office should begin to reverse its strategy of patenting strategies basic truths of nature cant be owned oh and by the way i own the patent for essay or letter criticizing a previous publication so anyone who criticizes what i have said here had better pay a royalty first or ill see you in court the new york times oped section sunday march authors note at the end of my research for this book i arrived at the following conclusions stop patenting genes gene patents might have looked reasonable twenty years ago but the field has changed in ways nobody could have predicted today we have plenty of evidence that gene patents are unnecessary unwise and harmful there is great confusion about gene patents many observers conflate a call to end gene patents with anticapitalist and antiprivate property sentiments it is nothing of the sort it is perfectly reasonable for industry to seek a mechanism that will ensure a profit on productive investment such a mechanism implies a restriction on competition involving a created product however such protection does not imply that genes themselves should be patented on the contrary gene patents contradict longestablished traditions of intellectual property protection first genes are facts of nature like gravity sunlight and leaves on trees genes exist in the natural world facts of nature cant be owned you can own a test for a gene or a drug that affects a gene but not the gene itself you can own a treatment for a disease but not the disease itself gene patents break that fundamental rule of course one can argue about whats a fact of nature and there are people paid to do that but heres a simple test if something exists for millions of years before the arrival of homo sapiens on earth its a fact of nature to argue that a gene is in any way a human invention is absurd to grant a gene patent is like granting a patent on iron or carbon because its a patent on a fact of nature a gene patent becomes an undeserved monopoly ordinarily patent protection enables me to protect my invention but encourages others to make their own versions my ipod doesnt prevent you from making a digital audio player my patented mousetrap is wood but your titanium mousetrap is allowed this is not what happens with gene patents the patent consists of pure information already existing in nature because there has been no invention no one can innovate any other use of the patent without violating the patent itself so further innovation is closed its like allowing somebody to patent noses you couldnt make eyeglasses kleenex nasal sprays masks makeup or perfume because they all rely on some aspect of noses you could put suntan lotion on your body but not on your nose because any modification of your nose would violate the patent on noses chefs could be sued for making fragrant dishes unless they paid the nose royalty and so on of course we would all agree that a patent on noses is absurd if everyone has one how can anyone own it gene patents are absurd for the same reason it takes little imagination to see that monopolistic patenting inhibits creation and productivity if the creator of auguste dupin could own all fictional detectives we would never have had sherlock holmes sam spade philip marlowe miss marple inspector maigret peter wimsey hercule poirot mike hammer or j j gittes to name just a few this rich heritage of invention would be denied us by a patenting error yet that is exactly the error in patenting genes gene patents are bad public policy we have ample evidence that they hurt patient care and suppress research when myriad patented two breast cancer genes they charged nearly three thousand dollars for the test even though the cost to create a gene test is nothing like the cost to develop a drug not surprisingly the european patent office revoked that patent on a technicality the canadian government announced that it would conduct gene tests without paying for the patent some years ago the owner of the gene for canavan disease refused to make the test widely available even though families who had suffered with the disease had contributed time money and tissues to get the gene identified now those same families could not afford the test that is an outrage but it is far from the most dangerous consequence of gene patents in its heyday research on sars severe acute respiratory syndrome was inhibited because scientists were unsure who owned the genomethree simultaneous patent claims had been filed as a result research on sars wasnt as vigorous as it might have been that should scare every sensible person here was a contagious disease with a percent death rate that had spread to two dozen countries around the world yet scientific research to combat the disease was inhibitedbecause of patent fears at the moment hepatitis c hiv hemophilus influenza and various diabetes genes are all owned by some entity they shouldnt be nobody should own a disease if gene patents are ended we can expect screams of outrage and threats that business will abandon research that companies will go bankrupt that health care will suffer and the public will die but it is more likely that an end to gene patents will be phenomenally liberating to everyone and will result in a burst of new products for the public establish clear guidelines for the use of human tissues human tissue collections are increasingly important to medical research and increasingly valuable appropriate federal regulations to manage tissue banks already exist but courts have ignored federal rules historically the courts have decided questions about human tissues based on existing property law in general they have ruled that once your tissue leaves your body you no longer maintain any rights to it they analogize tissues to say the donation of a book to a library but people have a strong feeling of ownership about their bodies and that feeling will never be abrogated by a mere legal technicality therefore we need new clear emphatic legislation why do we need legislation consider a recent court ruling on the case of dr william catalona this eminent prostate cancer physician assembled a collection of tissue samples from his patients so he could work on the disease when dr catalona moved to another university he tried to take the tissues with him washington university refused saying that it owned the tissues the judge upheld the university citing such trivial facts as some of the releases being printed on washington university stationery patients are now understandably outraged they believed they were giving their tissues to a beloved doctor not a shadowy university lurking in the background they thought they were giving tissues specifically for prostate cancer research not for any use which the university now claims the right to do the notion that once you part with your tissue you no longer have any rights is absurd consider this under present law if somebody takes my picture i have rights forever in the use of that photo twenty years later if somebody publishes it or puts it in an advertisement i still have rights but if somebody takes my tissuepart of my physical bodyi have no rights this means i have more rights over my image than i have over the actual tissues of my body the required legislation should ensure that patients have control over their tissues i donate my tissues for a purpose and that purpose only if later someone wants to use them for another purpose they need my permission again if they cant get permission they cant use my tissues such a rule fulfills an important emotional need but it also acknowledges that there may be significant legal and religious reasons why i do not want my tissue used for another purpose we should not fear that such regulations will inhibit research after all the national institutes of health seems to be able to conduct research while following these guidelines nor should we accept the argument that these rules impose an onerous burden if a magazine can notify you that your subscription has run out a university can notify you if they want to use your tissues for a new purpose pass laws to ensure that data about gene testing is made public new legislation is needed if the fda is to publish adverse results from gene therapy trials at the moment it cannot do so in the past some researchers have tried to prevent the reporting of patient deaths claiming that such deaths were a trade secret the public is increasingly aware of defects in the systems we use to report medical data research data has not been made available for other scientists to inspect full disclosure has not been required genuinely independent verification of findings is rare the result is a public exposed to untold unknown hazards bias in published studies has become a bad joke psychiatrist john davis looked at the trials funded by pharmaceutical companies in competition for the most effective of five different antipsychotic drugs he found that percent of the time the drug manufactured by the company sponsoring paying for the study was judged superior to the others whoever paid for the study had the best drug this should not be news review studies conducted by those who have a financial or other interest in the outcome are not reliable because they are inherently biased that fact should be addressed by an information system that does not permit biased testing and takes steps to ensure that it does not occur yet gross bias remains far too common in medicine and in certain other areas of highstakes science as well government should take action in the long run there is no constituency for bad information in the short run all sorts of groups want to bend the facts their way and they do not hesitate to call their senators democratic or republican this will continue until the public demands a change avoid bans on research various groups of different political persuasions want to ban some aspect of genetic research i agree that certain research ought not to be pursued at least not now but as a practical matter i oppose bans on research and technology bans cant be enforced i dont know why we have not learned this lesson from prohibition to the war on drugs we repeatedly indulge the fantasy that behavior can be banned invariably we fail and in a global economy bans take on other meanings even if you stop research in one country it still goes on in shanghai so what have you accomplished of course hope springs eternal and fantasies never die various groups imagine they can negotiate a global ban on certain research but to the best of my knowledge there has never been a successful global ban on anything genetic research is unlikely to be the first rescind the bayhdole act in congress decided that the discoveries made within universities were not being made widely available to benefit the public to move things along it passed a law permitting university researchers to sell their discoveries for their own profit even when that research had been funded by taxpayer money as a result of this legislation most science professors now have corporate tieseither to companies they have started or to other biotech companies thirty years ago there was a distinct difference in approach between university research and that of private industry today the distinction is blurred or absent thirty years ago disinterested scientists were available to discuss any subject affecting the public now scientists have personal interests that influence their judgment academic institutions have changed in unexpected ways the original bayhdole legislation recognized that universities were not commercial entities and encouraged them to make their research available to organizations that were but today universities attempt to maximize profits by conducting more and more commercial work themselves thus making their products more valuable to them when they are finally licensed for example if universities think they have a new drug they will do the fda testing themselves and so on thus bayhdole has paradoxically increased the commercial focus of the university many observers judge the effect of this legislation to be corrupting and destructive to universities as institutions of learning bayhdole was always of uncertain benefit to the american taxpayers who became through their government uniquely generous investors taxpayers finance research but when it bears fruit the researchers sell it for their own institutional and personal gain after which the drug is sold back to the taxpayers consumers thus pay top dollar for a drug they helped finance ordinarily when a venture capitalist invests in research he or she expects a significant return on investment the american taxpayer gets no return at all the bayhdole legislation anticipated that the public would receive a flood of marvelous lifesaving therapies such that the investment strategy would be justified but that hasnt happened instead the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits secrecy now pervades research and hampers medical progress universities that once provided a scholarly haven from the world are now commercializedthe haven is gone scientists who once felt a humanitarian calling have become businessmen concerned with profit and loss the life of the mind is a notion as quaint as the whalebone corset all these trends were perfectly clear to observers fifteen years ago no one paid much attention back then now the problems are becoming clear to everyone a good first step toward restoring the balance between academia and corporations will be to repeal bayhdole legislation
