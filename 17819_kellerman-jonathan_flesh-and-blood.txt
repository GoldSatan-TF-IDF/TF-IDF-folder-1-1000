those years listening so many faces there was a time i recalled every one of them forgetting comes with experience it doesnt bother me as much as it used to her mother phoned my service on a saturday morning soon after new years a mrs jane abbot said the operator she says her daughters an old patient lauren teague jane abbots name meant nothing to me but lauren teague sparked an uneasy nostalgia it was an number somewhere in the valley when id known the family theyd lived in west la i searched my old case files before returning the call teague lauren lee intake date ten years ago the tail end of my wilshire boulevard practice shortly after i cashed in some real estate profits tried to drop out met a beautiful woman became friends with a sad brilliant detective learned more than i wanted to know about bad things since then id avoided the commitment of longterm therapy cases stuck to court consults and forensic work the kinds of puzzles that removed me from the confines of my office lauren had been fifteen at referral thin file one historytaking meeting with the parents followed by two sessions with the girl then a missed appointment no explanation the next day the father left a message canceling any future treatment unpaid balance for the final session id made a halfhearted effort to collect then written it off when old patients get in touch its usually because theyre doing great and want to brag or exactly the opposite either way they tend to be people with whom ive connected lauren teague didnt qualify far from it if anything i was the last person shed want to see why was her mother contacting me now presenting problems poor school achiev noncompliance at home clin impressions fath angry moth possib deprssd tension bet moth and father marital strss parents agree re

till last year then change of attitude new friends bums fath some truancy cs and ds basic mood is sullen no communic parents try to talk get no resp suspect drug use as i leafed through the file jane and lyle teagues faces came into semifocus she thin blond edgy a former flight attendant now a fulltime mom a heavy smoker fortyfive minutes without tobacco had been torture laurens father had been sliteyed blankfaced reluctant to engage his wife had talked fast nervous hands moist eyes when shed looked to him for support hed turned away they were both thirtynine but he looked older hed done something in the building trades here it was elect contractr a powerfullooking man fighting the advent of middle age with long hair sprayed in place that fringed his shoulders black pelt of beard muscles made obvious by a tootight polo shirt and pressed jeans crude but wellbalanced features gold chain circling a ruddy neck gold id bracelet how did i remember that put him in buckskins and he couldve been a grizzly hunter lyle teague had sat with his legs spread wide consulted his watch every few minutes fondled his beeper as if hoping for intrusion unable to maintain eye contact lapsing into dreamy stares that had made me wonder about attention deficit something he mightve passed on to lauren but when i raised the topic of academic testing he didnt stir defensively and his wife said lauren had been examined two years before by a school psychologist and found to be normal and extremely bright bright he said putting no praise into the word nothing wrong with her brain that a little discipline wont cure accusing glance at his wife her mouth twisted but she said thats what were here to learn lyle teague smirked i said mr teague do you think anything else is going on besides laurens being spoiled nah basic teenage garbage another look at his wife this time seeking confirmation she said laurens a good girl lyle teague laughed threateningly then why the hell are we here honey yeah yeah fine he tried to tune out but i stuck with him finally got him talking about lauren how different she was from the cute little kid hed once taken to job sites in his truck as he reminisced his face darkened and his speech got choppy and by the end of the speech he pronounced his daughter a real hassle hope to hell you can do something with her two days later lauren showed up in my waiting room alone five minutes late a tall slender conspicuously busted brownhaired girl treated kindly by puberty fifteen but she couldve passed for twenty she wore a white jersey tank top skimpy snug bluedenim shorts and ludicrously highheeled white sandals smooth tan arms and long tan legs were showcased by the minimal clothing pinkpolished toes glinted at the tips of her sandals the strap of a small black patent leather purse striped a bare shoulder if shed been studying the hookers on sunset for fashion tips shed learned well when young girls flaunt the result is often a comic loss of equilibrium lauren teague seemed perfectly at ease advertising her body like father like daughter she favored her father in coloring her mother in structure but bore no striking resemblance to either the brown hair was burnt umber sparked with rust thick and straight hanging halfway down her back parted dead center and flipped into extravagant wings at the temples high cheekbones wide mouth glossed pink dominant but perfectly proportioned cleft chin heavily lined azureshadowed blue eyes mocking eyes a strong straight uptilted nose was dashed by freckles shed tried to obliterate with makeup lots of makeup it stuccoed her from brow to jaw creating a toobeige mask as i introduced myself she breezed past me into the office taking long easy strides on the impossible heels none of the usual teenage slump she held her back straight thrust out her chest a strikingly goodlooking girl made less attractive by cosmetics and blatancy selecting the chair closest to mine she sat down as if shed been there a hundred times before cool furniture thank you like one of those libraries in an old movie she batted her lashes crossed and recrossed her legs threw out her chest again yawned stretched folded her arms across her torso dropped them to her sides suddenly a cartoon of vulnerability i asked why she thought she was there my parents think im a loser a loser yup what do you think of that derisive laugh toss of hair her tongue tip skated across her lower lip maybe shrug yawn so time to talk about my head problems huh jane and lyle teague had denied previous therapy but laurens glibness made me wonder i asked her about it nope never the school counselor tried to talk to me a couple of times about my grades did it help she laughed yeah right okay ready for my neurosis

the other placed a hand on a calf and tickled be straight i said as in drugs theyre paranoid about that along with everything else even though they smoke they smoke dope dope tobacco little afterdinner taste sometimes its booze cocktails were mature enough to control it lauren she laughed jane used to be a stewardess working all these fancy private charters theyve still got this collection of tiny little bottles i like the green melon stuff midori but im not allowed to touch pot till im eighteen she laughed like id ever pots not for you i said pots boring too slow like hey man lets pretend were in the sixties get all wasted and sit around staring at the sky and talking about god another gust of laughter painfully lacking in joy pot sure makes them boring its the only

singsonged do my chores get ready in the morning without calling my mom a bitch stop saying fuck and shit and cunt go to class and pay attention build up my grades stop breaking curfew hang out with

ignores me walks away and gets involved in something else he has hobbies him only thing he does is work eat smoke dope stuff his face watch tv he has no faith in me in you either conspiratorial smile he says shrinks are just a bunch of overpaid clowns who cant screw in a lightbulb by themselves and im gonna just end up conning you like i con everybody hes only paying for this because janes really getting on his nerves with all her nagging mom has more faith in shrinks moms totally worried she said mom likes to suffer theyre heres a juicy one for you they only got married cause they had to one day i was looking for a bra in janes drawer and i found their wedding license two months before my birthday i was conceived in sin what do you think of that is it a big deal to you i just think its funny how so here they are being all moral and whatever lifting the tiny black purse she undid the clasp peered inside snapped it shut mom likes to suffer i said yeah she hates her life she used to work private charters fly all around the world with superrich people she regrets ever coming down to earth she shifted to the edge of the chair how much longer do i have to be here rather than pick apart the fine points of free choice i said half an hour opening the purse again she pulled out a compact checked her reflection plucked an eyelash and flicked it away half an hour she said no way do i have half an hour of problems want to hear all of them sure she launched into a long droning speech about stupid girlfriends getting on her case stupid exboyfriends foolish enough to think they were still in her good graces stupid teachers who didnt know anything more than the students stupid parties a stupid world talking nonstop in the flat tones of a rehearsed witness looking everywhere but at me when she was through i said so everyones getting on your nerves youve got that right how much longer now twentyfive minutes shit that much you should have a clock up there so people can keep track usually people dont want to why not they dont want to be distracted she favored me with a bitter smile scooted forward on the chair well i want to leave early okay just today please ive got some people waiting for me and i need to get home by fivethirty or jane and lylere gonna freak out people waiting for what fun friends are picking you up she nodded where i told them to meet me a block from here so can i go lauren im not forcing you but if i split early youll fink right look i said its a matter of twenty minutes as long as youre here why not make good use of the time i expected protest but she sat there pouting thats not fair i told you everything theres nothing wrong with me im not saying there is lauren so whats the point id like to learn more about you im not worth learning about okay my lifes boring i already told you that she ran her hands over her torso this is it all of me nothing exciting i let several seconds pass lauren is everything really going as well as it could for you she studied me from under grainy black lashes reached into the purse again and extricated a pack of virginia slims when she produced a lighter i shook my head oh cmon sorry how can you do that people coming here all stressed out dont they complain wasnt jane climbing the walls shes a chimney mostly i see kids and teens i said people manage kids and teens she gave a short cold laugh every teen i know smokes are you allergic or something some of my patients are so why does everyone have to suffer because of a few thats not democracy its consideration i said fine she jammed the pack back into the purse how much time left now chapter the second time she was twenty minutes late hurried into the office muttering what might have been an apology same getup different color scheme black tank top sunburn pink shorts lips coarsened by bright red paste same precarious sandals and cheap little purse she reeked of tobacco and a roseheavy perfume her cheeks were flushed and her hair was mussed she took a long time settling in the chair finally said got hung up you and your friends yeah hair flip sorry hung up where around the pier santa monica i said we like the beach she massaged one bare bronze shoulder nice sunny day i said smiling classes must have let out early sudden bright laughter tumbled from between the crimson lips right schools a drag huh school would have to be on uppers to be a drag she produced the cigarette pack bounced it on a shiny knee when i was little they tested my iq im supposed to be supersmart they say i should be studying more i say im smart enough to know its a waste of time no interest in any subject i said nutrition love that garlic bread is today when we talk about sex that caught me off guard i dont recall our scheduling that they scheduled it ive been instructed to talk to you about it by your parents yeah why its mostly lyles idea hes positive im doing the dirty gonna get pregnant stick him with a little nigger grandkid like if i was talking to you about it would help like just because i dont talk to them im going to throw up my insides to some outsider sometimes talking to an outsider can be safer maybe for some people she said but explain me this when youre young everyones always knocking into your head never talk to strangers beware of strangers watch out for strangers so now theyre paying for me to tell my secrets to a stranger she ran a fingernail under the seal of the pack slit it open played with the foil flap what bullshit maybe theyre hoping eventually you wont consider me a stranger they can hope all they want low tight laugh hey im not trying to be rude its just coming out that way sorry you seem like a nice guy its just that i shouldnt have to be here okay face it theyre just using you to punish me like grounding me or threatening not to let me get my license next year none of that worked and this wont either you have to care to be controlled and i dont do caring what are they punishing you for lauren they say its my attitude she said but you know what i think i think theyre jealous of what my happiness youre happy and theyre not theyre making themselves out to be all in control especially him she lowered her voice to a hostile baritone parody lauren youre screwing up your life this therapy crap is goddamn expensive i want you to go in there and spill your guts last week shed talked about spitting out secrets the emetic approach to insight so i said your parents arent happy theyre taking it out on you and im the weapon theyre stuck where they are and im cool free enjoying my life and that bugs them soon as i get my own money im out of there byebye lyle and jane do you have a plan to get money she shrugged ill figure something out im not talking right now im

in freedom which is exactly what i need right now next week ill be good i mean it next week conning me or did she really intend to return ive gotta get out of here sure i said take care big smile hair flip youre a doll swinging the purse like a slingshot she hurried out i caught up with her in the waiting room just as she whipped out her lighter jamming the cigarette in her mouth she shoved at the door i watched her trot down the hall a girl in a hurry haloed by a cloud of smoke i thought about her a few times the image of selfdestructive escape then that faded too six years later i was invited to a bachelor party the weekend before halloween a fortyfiveyearold radiation oncologist at western pediatrics was getting married to an or nurse and a consortium of hospital physicians and administrators had rented the presidential suite of the beverly monarch hotel for the sendoff steaks ribs buffalo wings assorted fried and grilled stuff on the buffet iced tubs of beer serveyourself bar cuban cigars gooey desserts my contact with the honoree a mumbling loner lacking in social skills had been a few stiff unproductive discussions about patient care and i wondered why id been included in the festivities perhaps every face helped there was no shortage of faces when i arrived late the suite was vast a string of moodlit blackcarpeted rooms packed with sweaty men penthouse level no doubt a great view but the drapes were drawn and the air felt heavy suit jackets and neckties were heaped on a sofa near the door under a handlettered sign that said get casual i made my way through testosterone guffaws random backslapping blue cigar fog the strained glee of boozy toasts a crowd swarmed the food i finally got close enough to redeem a skewer of teriyaki beef and a grolsch belched cheers and scattered applause from the next room drew me to a larger throng i drifted over found scores of eyes trained forward on the hundredinch projection tv the hotel provided for presidents skin flicks flashing larger than life bodies squishing and squirming and slapping in time to an asthmatic sax score the men around me gaped and pretended to be casual i wandered away got more food stood to the side chewing and wondering what the hell i was doing there why i just didnt wipe my mouth and leave a pathologist i knew sauntered by with a whiskey in his hand hey he said eyeing the screen arent you the guy whos supposed to explain why we do this youve obviously mistaken me for an anthropologist he chuckled more like paleontologist ill bet cavemen painted dirty pictures how about we videotape this and show it at grand rounds better yet i said at the next gala fundraiser right teninch cocks and wet pussies better have oxygen ready for mrs prince and all the other biddies a roar from the widescreen crowd made both our heads swivel then a sharp peal flatware on glass shouts for quiet and the vocal buzz faded out isolating the thumpthump of the porn soundtrack moans continued to thunder in stereo a womans voice urged fuck it fuck me and nervous laughter rose from the audience then a tight abrasive silence a thickset ruddy man holding a nearly full beer mug a financial officer named beckwith stepped into the space between the two front rooms his eyeglasses had slid down his meaty nose and when he righted them beer splashed and foamed on the carpet go jim someone shouted get a neuro workup jim thats why pencil pushers cant be surgeons beckwith staggered a bit and grinned here here gentlemen and i do use the term loosely look at what weve wrought is this a goddamn blast or what cheers hoots nudges bottoms up youre sure blasted jim beckwith rubbed his eyes and his nose gave a onearmed salute splashed more beer since all of us are such serious nononsense citizens since wed never dream of abandoning god and spouses and country and moral obligation except for the direst emergency raucous laughter thank god weve got ourselves one hell of an emergency brethren namely the impending sentencing uh matrimony of our esteemed steamedup buddy the eternal infernal nocturnal dr phil harnsberger wielder of the radioactive cancerkiller beam better known to all of us as el terminador aka he who lurks behind the lead door come on out phil where are you boy no sign of the groom beckwith cupped his hands into a megaphone paging dr deathray dr deathray to center stage stat come on phil show yourself boy chants of phil phil phil phil then here he is thunderous ovation as the crowd rippled and phil harnsberger clutching a martini glass was expelled from its midst and shoved next to beckwith balding and normally pallid with a pinkred mustache demeaning his upper lip the radiotherapist was flushed incandescent his smile was a paranoid smear and he seemed on the verge of tipping over he had on a black tshirt so grossly oversized that it skirted past the knees of his slacks a yellow cartoon silkscreened across the front portrayed a hefty leering bride gripping a leash that tethered a pintsized groom prostrate before a hanging judge and looming scaffold a bold legend protested i dint kill no one yer honor so why the life sentence beckwith slapped harnsberger on the back harnsberger flinched and tried to down some martini most of the liquid ended up on his chin and he wiped himself with his sleeve sterile procedure someone shouted call the fucking jcah fucking germ culture stat beckwith slapped harnsberger again harnsberger labored at smiling hey phil hey old guy and i do mean old speaking of which its about time you lost your cherry stooping beckwith pretended to search for something on the floor examined harnsbergers cuffs finally straightened and picked the olive out of harnsbergers martini ah here it is turned green from disuse whoops from the crowd harnsberger smiled but hung his head phil said beckwith you may be pathetic but know we love you big guy silence terminador said beckwith do you know it harnsberger muttered sure jim you know what said beckwith you love me beckwith backed away not so fast lone ranger to the crowd dont ask dont tell is okay for those fruits in the navy but maybe someone should inform the bride harnsberger flushed wild laughter beckwith closed back in on his target going nose to nose seriously phil youre sure youre having a good time oh yes absolutely beckwith reached around and delivered yet another backslap hard enough to cause harnsberger to drop the martini glass beckwith crushed the glass underfoot ground the shards into the carpet like the jews say mazel tav happy batchday phil sure hope youre enjoying your last meal er last rites grub to your satisfaction harnsberger nodded get enough to drink yes cause none of us want you pissed off and beaming that death ray of yours down at us philly shouts of agreement harnsberger simpered beckwith said thats also why none of us want to be around when you get the bill momentary panic in harnsbergers eyes beckwith slapped him again scared you there huh boy nah dont get your cojonejones in an uproar its all taken care of lifted it out of patient funds beckwith rubbed an index finger against a thumb and winked sorry no kidney transplants for medical patients this month peals of merriment beckwith took hold of harnsbergers arm and now for the pièce de résistance phil pieces so to speak sure youve eaten enough im sure jim well beckwith grinned maybe not he flourished an arm nothing happened for a moment then the lights dimmed and music surged from behind the giant tv warpspeed disco beat louder than the porn score the crowd parted and two women in long black trench coats pranced into the clearing as beckwith slipped from view they positioned themselves on either side of harnsberger young women tall shapely coltish stepping high on spiked heels widesmiling tossing the smiles as if dispensing candy they rotated their hips thrust their pelvises made the exaggerated moves of trained dancers long mass of coal black hair on one girl her partners coif was whiteblond boyshort gelspiked synchronized butt shakes as they flanked harnsberger rubbed his neck kissed his cheek bumped his hips a pair of tongues flicked the radiotherapists ears now crimson his face was polluted with arousal and fear the girls stomped and shouted stroked their crotches pretended to go for harnsbergers fly threw back their heads and pantomimed openmouthed laughter began shoving him gently between them back and forth the way baby jackals play with a rabbit the music took on even more speed off came the trench coats the girls wore identical black leather bustiers black thongs garter belts and fishnet stockings several beats of bump and grind i stared along with everyone else caught a side view of busty profiles heard the girls whoop and laugh as they continued to tease harnsberger the blackhaired girl tickled his chin veneered herself against him ran her hands over his head messed his hair the blonde took hold of his face kissed him long and hard on the mouth as he tried to wriggle away hands flying wildly suddenly he succumbed to the kiss getting into it he was reaching for the blondes rear when she shoved him away did an athletic squat danced back up to him shook her head from side to side peeled back a bustier cup and flashed a nipple let the leather flip back up the blackhaired girl joined her for more crotch rubbing and prancing both bras teased down on cue now shed and tossed to the crowd full young breasts bobbled and rotated the girls pinched their nipples hard bent low dropped to perfect splits bounced up danced wildly played with their gstrings pointing at harnsberger and moving in on him but this time they guided him offstage and returned just the two of them holding hands the gstrings popped snapped back on firm flat pubises a bit more genital hideandseek then the blackhaired girl got down on all fours rotated her buttocks pulled at the blondes ankle the blonde stood there shaking her head no pouting feigning resistance hoarse screams of encouragement from the choir everyone paying attention in a flash both girls were naked but for garter belts and fishnets the music slowed to languid sludge in a toosweet key and they began caressing each other vamping stroking kissing tongues lizarding the blackhaired girl sank to the carpet lay on her back arched her pelvis the blonde shimmied between her partners legs lowered to her knees bowed her head prayerfully grazed the dark girls abdomen with platinum spikes tonguing the dark girls navel the dark girl writhed the blond girl looked up placed a finger on her lip as if contemplating what to do next a bigeyed travesty of innocence holding out her hands as if seeking counsel from the crowd the crowd cheered her on she tilted her head back to the dark girls crotch began to dip again raised her face kneeling in place but not moving as the darkhaired girl still bucking took hold of her arm and urged her down the blond girl studied the audience took in the entire room turning my way giving me a full view of her face long oval face beneath the silvery spikes pale eyes under plucked brows dominant but perfectly proportioned cleft chin recognition was a splinter in my chest hers too the slyness dropped off her face replaced by a queasy smile she stared at me and her head froze above the blackhaired girls writhing hips i thought i saw her give the faintest headshake denying something the music oozed on the blackhaired girl kept gyrating started to realize something was off made a grab for laurens head lauren didnt budge then she did as she allowed herself to be dragged down i escaped chapter i drove home nearly blind with shame cutting through dark cold streets as if nothing mattered the closest ive come to having children are the people whove depended on me encountering lauren had given me a glimpse of what the parents of whores and felons go through the look in her eyes when shed recognized me strippers flaunt degrading to imbalance the uncertainty shed never shown as a teenager now she was twentyone legal that made me laugh out loud why the hell had i gone to harnsbergers party in the first place why hadnt i left when the tone of the evening became clear because as in most men something in me craved fresh erotic imagery robin was waiting up for me but that night i was very poor company i slept terribly woke the next morning wondering what if anything i should do about the encounter at eight oclock i called my service and the operator informed me lauren had phoned at midnight and asked for an appointment she sounded urgent said the operator i knew about that cancellation at two so i gave it to her hope that was okay dr delaware sure i said sick with dread thanks were here to serve doctor at two pm precisely the bell on the side door rang and my heart jumped patients whove never been to my house usually remain down at the gate the bell ring meant lauren had unlatched the gate mastered the route across the front drive and through the garden no warning dog bark robin had gone up to carpinteria on a woodbuying trip left at daybreak taking spike with her i put down the coffee i hadnt touched hurried through the house opened the door new face on the other side fresh scrubbed expressionless clipped snowy hair stripped of product brushed forward falling in a soft caesar cut no makeup at all the same blue eyes tougher tempered an untested face except for the eyes at twentyone lauren looked younger than she had at fifteen a bleacheddenim shirt and easyfit jeans covered her from neck to ankle the shirt was buttoned to the top and cinched with a turquoise clasp the jeans managed to hug her frame advertise the tight waist soft hips on her feet were white canvas flats with straw soles a big calfskin bag hung over one shoulder rich burnished roan goldclasped conspicuously expensive hello lauren gazing past me she offered her hand her palm was cold and dry i didnt feel like smiling but when her eyes finally met mine i managed she didnt you work at home now cute place thanks come on in i stayed just ahead of her during the walk to my office she moved fast as eager to enter as shed once been to leave very nice she said when we got there still seeing kids and teens i dont do much therapy anymore she froze in the doorway your answering service didnt say that im still in practice but most of my work is consultation i said court cases some police work im always available to former patients police work she said yes i saw your name in the paper that schoolyard shooting so now youre a public hero still looking past me through me come on in i said thats the same she said eyeing my old leather couch kind of an antique i said youre not you really havent changed that much i moved behind the desk ive changed she said youve grown up i said have i she sat stiffly made a move for the calfskin bag stopped herself started to smile quashed that too still no smoking sorry no filthy habit she said inherited it from mom she had a scare a few years back spot on her x ray but it turned out to be a shadow stupid doctor so she finally stopped youd think it would teach me people are weak you know that you make a living off that people are fallible i said one of her legs began to bounce back when i came to you i gave you a real hard time didnt i i smiled nothing i hadnt seen before it probably didnt seem like it but i was actually getting into the idea of therapy id psyched myself up for it then they killed it your parents the surprise in my voice made her flush they didnt tell you her smile was cold they claimed they did but i always wondered all i got was a cancellation call i said no explanation i phoned your house several times but no one answered bastard she said with sudden savagery asshole your father lying asshole he promised hed explain everything to you it was his decision he never stopped complaining about the money the day i was supposed to see you he picked me up from school i thought he was making sure i showed up on time i thought youd lied to me and finked to him about my coming late i was furious at you but instead of heading to your office he drove the other way into the valley over to this miniature golf course this family fun center arcades batting cages all that junk he parks turns off the engine says to me you need quality time with your dad not hundredbuckanhour babysitting with some quack she bit her lip doesnt that sound a little like he was jealous of you as i mulled my answer she said seductive dont you think i continued to deliberate took the leap lauren was there ever any no she said never nothing like that he never laid a finger on me not for anything creepy or for normal affection the fact is i cant remember him ever touching me hes a cold fish and guess what he and mom finally got divorced he got himself a bimbo some slut he met on the job so they never told you they canceled that it wasnt my idea figures they brought me up with lies what kind of lies the blue eyes met mine got hard doesnt matter that day at the golf course i said what happened what happened nothing happened we played a few holes finally i said i was bored started nagging and whining to be taken home he tried to convince me i sat down on the green and wouldnt budge he got mad got all redfaced like he does finally drove me home steaming mom was in her room it was obvious shed been crying i thought it had to do with me i thought everything had to do with me thought it all the time and it just sat there in my head like a tumor now i know better they were totally messed up all along she crossed her legs a few weeks later he walked out filed for divorce without telling her she tried to get child support out of him he claimed business was lousy never gave us a penny i told her to sue his ass but she didnt not a fighter she never has been so you lived with her for a little while if you call it living we lost the house moved into an apartment in panorama city real dive gunshots at night the whole bit things sucked we were broke she was always crying but i was having a great time cause she wasnt even trying to discipline me and finally i could do what i wanted she wouldnt fight with me either she took a tissue from the box i position strategically crumpled it into a ball picked it open men suck she said staring at me now lets talk about last night last night was unfortunate her eyes sparked unfortunate thats the best you can do you know the problem with this goddamn world no one ever says theyre sorry lauren forget it she waved the tissue dismissively i dont know why i even bothered she began rummaging through the leather bag end of session how much do you charge now probably more now that your name gets in the papers please lauren no she said shooting to her feet the times mine so dont tell me how to spend it no one tells me what to do anymore thats what i like about my job being in control her hands slapped onto her hips and she glared down at me i know youre giving me shrink talk but in this case you happen to be right last night you were probably too turned on to notice but i was in charge michelle and me all you guys with your mouths hanging open and your dicks stiff and we were calling the shots so dont judge me as if im some brainless slut no judgments her hands fisted and she stepped closer whyd you have to leave like that why were you ashamed of me as i considered my answer she gave a knowing smile i turned you on and that freaked you out i said if you were a stranger i probably wouldve stuck around i left because i was ashamed of myself she smirked probably wouldve stuck around i didnt answer but we are strangers she said how can you say were not the fact that youre here so what lauren once you came to me for help i had a duty to be there for you like a surrogate parent i felt my presence caused you shame too but it was my own embarrassment that got me out of there how noble she said man youre confused like all guys are okay i got what i came for now im going to pay you theres nothing to pay for she wagged a finger oh no you dont youve got the title and respectability and in your eyes im just some stripperslut but once i pay you the balance of power equalizes i am not judging you lauren you say she whipped a wad of cash out of her jeans pocket whats the tab doc lets talk about how much she demanded whats your hourly fee i told her she whistled not too shabby she peeled off bills handed them to me okay here you go and you dont even have to declare it to the irs ill find my own way out i followed her anyway when we reached the door she said my roll that stash i paid you from did you see the size of it thats my tip money honey i do great with tips chapter now four years later i had to talk to her mother mrs jane abbot so shed remarried was life treating her more kindly had the spot on her lung recurred i was curious but couldve lived without finding out life would be so much easier if i was one of those flakes who felt no obligation to return calls my pompous little speech to lauren about surrogate parenthood rang in my ears i put off the call anyway revved up the coffee machine tidied up an already clean kitchen checked the stores in the pantry when i returned to the kitchen i discovered id forgotten to put coffee in the filter and started from scratch listening to the machine bubble offered another few minutes of respite and when i finally sat down to drink i dropped a little brandy in the mug took my time sipping scanned a newspaper id already covered from front to back finally the inevitable staring at the big pine that nearly blocks the kitchen window i punched numbers two rings hello mrs abbot yes whos this dr delaware two beats of silence i didnt know if youd phone do you remember me laurens mom laurens mom she said my claim to fame her voice broke its lauren im calling about dr delaware shes missing for a week i know you work with the police ive seen your name in the papers lauren saw it too that impressed her she always liked you you know it was my husband my exhusband who stopped her from seeing you he was a very mean man is a mean man lauren hasnt had contact with him in years but thats neither here nor there the problem ive got now is i cant find her shes been living on her own for a while but this it just feels wrong by the third day i called the police but they say shes an adult and unless theres evidence of a crime theres nothing they can do other than have me come in and file a report i could tell they werent taking me seriously but i know lauren just wouldnt take off like that not without telling me does she ever travel occasionally but not for this long so youre in regular communication with her i said wondering if lauren was still stripping and did her mother know pause yes of course i call her she calls me we manage to stay in touch dr delaware adding i live in the valley now as if that explained the lack of facetoface contact where does lauren live i said in the city near the miracle mile she wouldnt just walk out without telling me doctor she didnt tell her roommate anything either and it doesnt look as if she packed a suitcase dont you think thats frightening there could be an explanation please dr delaware i know how things work its who you know youve worked with the police with your contacts theyll listen to you you must know someone who can help whats laurens address she recited some numbers on hauser near sixth street not far from the museum complex the la brea tar pits i used to take her to the tar pits when she was little please dr delaware call your contacts and ask them to take me seriously my contact was milo his turf was west la division and hauser near sixth was wilshire petra connor my only other lapd acquaintance worked hollywood homicide a pair of homicide detectives jane abbot didnt want to hear that i said ill make a call thank you so much doctor hows lauren been doing youd be superproud of her i am she we had a few rough years after her father walked out on us she dropped out of high school without graduating it was kind of but then she pulled herself together got her ged attended jc got her associates degree with honors and transferred to the u this past fall she just finished her first quarter got all as shes majoring in psychology wants to be a therapist i know thats your influence she admires you doctor she always said what a caring person you were thank you i said feeling surreal its midquarter break at the u for another few weeks sometimes students travel no she said lauren wouldnt have gone anywhere without telling me and not without luggage ill do what i can youre a good man i always sensed that you were a great influence on her doctor you only saw her that couple of times but it had an impact she once told me she wished you were her father instead of lyle i tried milo at home first got no answer just the tape with rick silvermans voice on it i tried the west la detectives room sturgis morning this is your wakeup call got sunrise for that boyo putting in weekend overtime whats a weekend thought the murder rate was down i said exactly he said so now were all ballandchained to subarctic cold cases whats up i need a favor i told him about lauren letting him know shed been a patient knowing hed understand what i could and couldnt say shes how old he said twentyfive missing persons told her mother the only option was filing a report did she file i didnt ask her i said so she wants some strings pulled problem is missing persons is right an adult case without some evidence of disability or blood and guts or a stalking boyfriend it comes down to routine for the first few weeks what if it were the mayors daughter long sigh what if i went down in a light plane off the coast of cape cod id be lucky to get two drunks in a rowboat as a search party let alone a navy destroyer and a fleet of choppers okay ill put in a call to mp anything else i should know about this girl shes enrolled at the u but its possible she got involved in something less than wholesome oh four years ago she was working as a stripper i said private parties she may still be stripping the mother told you this no i learned it myself dont ask how silence okay spell her full name i did and he said so were talking bad girl here i dont know about that i snapped just that she danced he didnt react to my anger four years ago what else shes done one quarter at the u straight as according to her mother mama knows best some mamas do what about this one dont know like i said its been a long time milo your own cold case something like that he promised to get back as soon as possible i thanked him and hung up took a longer than usual run returned home sweatdrenched and faded showered off got dressed went down to the pond and fed the koi without bothering to enjoy their colors returning to my office i started to clear some custody reports i ended up thinking about lauren from stripping to straight as at the u i decided to call jane abbot let her know id followed through maybe that would be the end of it this time a machine answered a mans voice robotic one of those canned recordings women use as a security device i delivered my message worked for a few more hours on the reports shortly after noon i drove into south westwood bought a takeout italian sandwich and a beer at wallys returned to holmby park where i ate on a bench trying not to look ominous among the nannies and the rich kids and the old people enjoying green grass as cars whizzed by when i got back the message light on my answering machine was a blinking red reproach one call milo sounding even more tired hey alex getting back to you on lauren teague call whenever youve got a chance i jabbed the phone another detective answered and it took a few moments for milo to come on the line the mother did file a report yesterday mp ran a background on lauren he coughed shes got a record alex they havent informed the mother yet maybe they shouldnt what kind of record i said prostitution i kept silent he said thats all so far does that alter the chance that someone will actually look for her the thing is alex theres nothing to go on they asked the mother for any known associates and she came up with zilch mp detectives feeling is that mama is not in the loop when it comes to laurens private life and maybe lauren traveling isnt exactly an aberration her arrests werent only here nevada too vegas reno lots of girls work that route hopping on cattlecar flights doing one twoday turnarounds for fast cash so maybe her picking up without explanation is just part of her lifestyle student or not shes been gone for a week i said not exactly a turnaround so she stayed to play the tables or got herself a lucrative gig she wants to milk for a while the point is were not talking suzy creamcheese wandering away from the church bus when was her most recent arrest i said four years ago here or nevada good old beverly hills she was one of gretchen stengels girls got nabbed at the beverly monarch hotel site of phil harnsbergers bachelor bash the hotels vanilla rococo façade flashed in my head tip money i do great with tips what month four years ago i said whats the difference last time i saw her was four years ago november hold on let me check december nineteenth gretchen stengel i said the westside madam herself at least she wasnt working the street for crack vials i gripped the phone so hard my fingers ached is there any record of a drug history no just the solicitation bust but gretchens girls did tend to party hard look alex you know passing judgment on peoples sex lives isnt my thing and i dont even think much about dope unless it leads to someone being made dead but the fact that laurens a working girl does have to be taken into account here most likely she split for a gig and the roommates covering for her with mom i cant see any reason to panic youre probably right i said mom may be out of the loop though shes not totally unaware told me lauren went through some rough times and her voice tightened up when she said it and with the last arrest four years ago maybe lauren did turn herself around she did enroll at the u that could be i know i know cockeyed optimism hey it gives you that boyish charm so you treated her four years ago ten i saw her once four years ago followup ah he said ten years is a long time its a damned eon long pause you still sound protective of her just doing my job surprised at the anger in my voice i avoided further discussion by thanking him for his time he said the mp guy did agree to make some calls to hospitals morgues too i said that too alex i know you didnt want to hear about the girls sheet but in this case maybe it puts things in a more positive light shes got a rationale for cutting out without explanation best thing to tell the mom is just wait nine times out of ten the person shows up and when they dont its too late to do anything about it anyway he didnt answer sorry i said youve done more than you had to he laughed softly no i had to up for lunch sometime i said sure after i chip away at some of this ice subarctic huh i wake up middle of the night with penguins pecking my ass what kinds of cases potpourri tenyearold child murder parents probably did it but no physical evidence twelveyearold convenience store robberygonebad no witnesses not even decent ballistics cause the bad guys used a shotgun drunk snuffed out in an alley eight years ago and my personal favorite old lady smothered in her bed back when nixon was president shouldve gotten my degree in ancient history english lits not a bad fit either how so everyones got a story i said yeah but once im listening to them you can forget happy endings chapter the roommates covering for her a roommate who lived the same life as lauren if so no reason for her to talk to jane or the police or anyone else jane abbot claimed lauren admired me i found that hard to believe but perhaps lauren had mentioned me to the roommate and i could learn something i called the number jane had given me for lauren got another male robot on the machine hung up without leaving a message i thought some more about the path laurens life had taken given the little i knew about her family life i supposed there was no reason to be surprised but i found myself succumbing to letdown anyway ten years ago two sessions when her father had terminated had i let it go too easily i really didnt think so lyle teague had never accepted the idea of therapy even if id managed to reach him by phone there was no reason to believe hed have changed his mind no reason at all for me to feel id failed and i told myself i felt comfortable with that but as the afternoon grayed laurens disappearance continued to chew at me just after two pm i left the house gunned the seville down the glen to sunset and headed east through beverly hills and the strip to the rollercoaster ramp that was the crest of la cienega catching third just past the beverly center i picked up sixth at crescent heights and cruised past the tar pits plaster mastodons reared and groups of schoolkids gawked they pull bones out of the pits daily one of las premier tourist spots is an infinite graveyard laurens apartment on hauser sat midway between sixth and wilshire a puttycolored sixunit box old enough for fire escapes i made my way up a chunky cement path to a glass door fronted by wroughtiron fettuccine through the glass dim hallway and dark carpeting a column of name slots and call buttons listed teaguesalander in apartment i pressed the button was surprised to be buzzed in immediately the hallway smelled of beef stew and laundry detergent the carpeting was an ancient wool flamingocolored leaf forms over mud brown once pricey now heeled and toed to the burlap mahogany doors had been restained streaky and lacquered too thickly no music or conversation leaked from behind any of them a flight of chipped terracotta steps at the rear of the building took me upstairs unit faced the street i knocked and the door opened before my fist lowered a young man holding a white washcloth stared out at me fivesix onethirty fairhaired and fraillooking wearing a sleeveless white undershirt very blue jeans cinched by a black leather belt black laceup boots a heavy silver chain looped a front jeans pocket oh i thought you were breathyvoiced pitched high someone else i said sorry if im interrupting my names alex delaware no recognition in the wide hazel eyes just residual surprise the fair hair was dun tipped with yellow clipped nearly to the skull zero body fat but what was left was string not bulk tiny gold ring in his right earlobe a tattoo dont panic in elaborate blueblack script capped his left shoulder a band of thorns in the same hue circled his right biceps he looked to be around laurens age had the round unlined face pink cheeks and arched brows of an indulged child as he looked me up and down surprise began to give way to suspicion he clenched the washcloth and his head drew back im an old acquaintance of laurens i said one of her doctors actually her mother called me concerned because she hasnt heard from lauren for a week one of her doctors oh the psychologist yes she told me about you i remember your name was one of the states are you native american kind of a mongrel he smiled pulled at the silver chain produced a saucersized pocket watch my god its twoforty another eye rub i was catching a nap heard the bell thought it was threeforty and jolted up sorry for waking you he let the washcloth unfurl waved it in a tight little arc oh dont apologize you did me a favor i have an old friend dropping by need the time to pull myself together a hip cocked now why are we having this conversation out in the hall a bony arm shot forward his grip was iron andrew salander im laurens roomie he swung the door wide open stepped aside and let me into a large parlor with a high crossbeamed ceiling heavy rubyandgold brocade drapes sealed the windows and plunged the space into gloom new smells blew toward me cologne incense the suggestion of fried eggs let there be light said andrew salander as he rushed over and yanked the curtains open a cigar of downtown smog hovered above the rooftops of the buildings across the street exposed the living room walls were lemon yellow topped by gilded moldings the crossbeams were gilded as well someone had taken the time to handleaf french cigarette prints insipid old seascapes in decaying frames and frayed samplers coexisted in improbable alliance on the walls deco and victorian and tubularlegged moderne furniture formed a cluttered liaison a close look suggested thriftshop treasures a keen eye had made it all work salander said so mrs a called you me too three times in as many days at first i thought she was being menopausal but it has been sixplus days and now im starting to get concerned about lo myself he pulled a tattered silk throw off a sagging olive velvet divan and said please sit excuse the squalor can i get you something to drink no thanks its far from squalid oh please a hand waved work in progress and very little progress at work lo and i have been going at this since i moved in sundays at the rose bowl swap meet western avenue once in a while you can still find something reasonable on la brea the problem is neither of us has time to really give it our all but at least its habitable when lo lived here by herself it was utterly bare i thought she was one of those people with no eye no artistic sense turns out she has fabulous taste it just needed to be brought out how long have you been rooming together six months he said i was in the building already downstairs in number two he frowned sat on a mockleopardskin ottoman crossed his legs month to month i was supposed to move out to then things changed as they so often do and the landlord leased my space to someone else and suddenly i found myself without hearth or home lo and i had always had a good rapport we used to chat at the laundromat shes easy to talk to when she found out i was stuck she invited me to move in at first i refused charitys one of many things i dont do but she finally convinced me two bedrooms were too much for her and i could share the rent a fingertip grazed a plucked eyebrow to be honest i wanted to be convinced being alones so dark i hadnt and los a wonderful person and now shes flown off somewhere dr delaware do we need to worry i really dont want to worry but i must admit i am bothered lauren didnt give a clue where she was going no and she didnt take her car its parked in her space out back so maybe she did fly off literally its not as if shes a greyhound girl nothing slow suits her she works like a demon studying doing research research at the u uhhuh on what she never told me just said that between her classes and research job she had a full plate you think thats what mightve taken her somewhere the job maybe i said no idea who she worked for salander shook his head were chums and all that but lo goes her way and i go mine different biorhythms shes a morning lark im a night owl perfect arrangement shes bright and chirpy for classes and im coherent when the time rolls around for my work by the time i wake up shes usually gone thats why it took a couple of days to realize her bed hadnt been slept in he shifted uncomfortably our bedrooms are our private space but mrs a sounded so anxious that i did agree to peek in the right thing to do i said i hope what kind of work do you do mr salander andrew advanced mixology he smiled i tend bar at the cloisters its a saloon in west hollywood milo and rick sometimes drank at the cloisters i know the place his brows climbed higher do you so why havent i seen you before ive driven by ah he said well my bombay martinis are works of art so feel free to breeze in his face grew grim listen to me laurens gone and im sitting here prattling no doctor she never gave me a clue as to where she was headed but till mrs a called i cant say i was ready to panic lauren did go away from time to time for a week he frowned no one or two nights weekends how often maybe every two months every six weeks i cant really recall whered she go one time she told me she spent some time at the beach malibu by herself he nodded she said she rented a motel room needed some time to decompress and the sound of the ocean was peaceful as for the other times i dont know those weekends did she usually take her car yes always so this is different isnt it he rubbed his armband tattoo wincing as if the art were new the pain fresh do you really think somethings wrong i dont know enough to think anything but mrs abbot seems to be worrying maybe mrs as getting us all overwrought the way mothers do have you met her only once a while back two three months ago she came to take lo out to lunch and we chatted briefly while lo got ready i thought she was nice enough but rather pasadena if you know what i mean coordinated ensemble several cracks past brittle i saw her as a perfect fifties person someone whod drive a chrysler imperial with all the trimmings and pile the backseat full of bullocks wilshire shopping bags conservative i said staid he said theatrically sad one of those women fighting the future with mascara and matching shoes and tiny sandwiches with the crust trimmed doesnt sound like lauren hardly lauren is très natural unaffected the washcloth was wadded once more im sure shes fine she has to be fine he sighed massaged the tattoo some more i said so the time you met mrs abbot she and lauren went out to lunch long lunch mustve been three hours lo came back alone and she didnt look as if shed had fun upset upset and distracted as if shed been hit on the head i suspected something emotional had gone on so i fixed her a gimlet the way she likes it and asked if she wanted to talk about it she kissed me here he touched a rosy cheek said it wasnt important but then she drank every drop of that gimlet and i just sat there emitting that imreadytolisten vibe its what i do after all and she he stopped should i be telling you this im beyond discreet i said because of what i do i suppose and lauren did say she liked you all right its nothing sordid anyway she simply told me shed spent her childhood fighting not to be controlled had made her own way in the world and now her mother was trying to do the same old thing again control her he nodded did she say how no im sorry doctor im just not comfortable flapping my trap theres nothing more to say anyway thats the entire kit and caboodle i smiled at him didnt budge he said really ive told you everything and only because i know lo liked you she came across your name in the paper some kind of police case said hey andrew i knew this guy he tried to straighten me out i made some remark how it obviously hadnt taken she thought that was funny said maybe it was patients like her whod driven you to quit doing therapy and work with the cops i his cheeks flamed i made some crack about shrinks being more screwed up than their patients asked if you were like that she said no you seemed pretty i think conventional was the word she used i said how boring and she said no sometimes conventional was exactly what you needed that shed screwed up not making good use of her therapy but looking back it had all been a setup anyway what do you mean i said she realized that her parents had set her up to rebel tried to use you as a weapon against her but you hadnt gotten sucked into their game you had integrity youre sure i cant get you a drink my throat had gone dry a coke would be fine he laughed the soft stuff recovering juice fiend no its just a bit early for me trust me its never too early but all right one colabean juice coming up pronto lemon or lime lime he hurried into the kitchen returned with a tall drink on ice and a glass of white wine for himself settling back down he rested one elbow on a knee placed his chin in a cupped palm stared into my eyes i said so lauren felt her mother was trying to control her but she didnt say how and the next day she was going about her business with nary a mention of mama truth is i dont think mrs a looms large in her life shes been on her own for years and thats absolutely all i can tell you about her family dynamics so drink up he drew out the pocket watch your friend i said he flinched yes does lauren have any friends i could talk to no no one at all not a one she doesnt date nor does she chum around with the girls were both social isolates doctor yet another tie that binds the night owl and the morning lark i said makes for a cozy little aviary this is absolutely the best living arrangement ive ever had laurens a living doll and i simply insist that she be okay now if youd like i can pour that drink into styrofoam and you can take it to go as charming a dismissal as id encountered placing the drink on a side table i stood just a few more questions mrs a said lauren didnt pack a suitcase i told her that he said i know every item in laurens wardrobe she has luscious things after i moved in i organized her closet she owns two pieces of luggage a pair of vintage samsonites we picked up for a prayer at the santa monica flea market and theyre both here so is her backpack from school and her books so she must be planning to return he began to sip wine stopped himself that isnt good is it running off without luggage not unless laurens the impulsive type impulsive as in meet someone hot and fly off to cuernavaca that would be nice he sounded doubtful but unlikely well said salander i just dont think thats lo if shed fallen in love id have known she was a creature of routine got up jogged went to class studied went to sleep got up and did the same thing all over again to tell the truth she was a bit of a grind strict routine except for occasional weekends away except for shes in between quarters at school i said whats she been doing with her vacation going to work the research job a grind he said shed spend every spare moment studying if i didnt drag her out to do some antiquing must have paid off i said mrs a said she got straight as lo was so proud of that showed me her transcript i thought it was adorable what was a grown woman all excited like a little kid shes studying psychology wants to be a therapist herself you must have been a good influence staring at me again you havent touched your drink is it okay i picked up the coke and drank terrific thats mexican lime not bearss lime more bite more cola flowed down my gullet does the research job pay the bills maybe some of it but lo also has investments investments some kind of nest egg she put away from when she worked fulltime she told me she can coast for a few more years before she has to hit the boards again i give her a lot of credit giving up something so lucrative for the sake of her studies the boards the runway modeling he said nothing voguecoverish or anything like that she worked the fashion mart scene since she was eighteen made good money but said she detested being a brainless face and body now doctor im sorry to be illmannered but my appointment its someone who hurt me ive been building my courage and finally im ready to face him and move on please he indicated the door and led me out i said thanks very much for your time if you dont mind im going to have a look at laurens car out back what kind is it gray mazda miata dont steal it nervous laugh i crossed my heart no joyrides today louder laughter we shook hands again im not going to worry he said theres no reason to worry im sure there isnt watch he said ill be sitting here worrying myself sick and lo will come waltzing through this door and ill scold her for putting all of us through this he walked me out into the hall looked toward the staircase chewed his lip youre a good listener any time you want a career switch i can get you a job at the cloisters i grinned ill keep that in mind he laughed no you wont for a whole list of reasons out in back was a carport that fronted the alley the miata was the only car parked there several years old lots of nicks and dents coated with days of dust locked its oatmealcolored canvas top set snugly campus parking sticker on the rear bumper thomas guide map book in the drivers door pocket pair of sunglasses on the center console just below the gearshift nothing else i returned to the seville trying to organize what id learned from salander no friends no dates a grind rooming with a gay man said lauren prized companionship wasnt looking for sex because she was still getting paid for it working the fashion mart runway since eighteen maybe she really had done some modeling or perhaps it was just a cover for selling her body in another way weekends by herself one in malibu other times unspecified keeping it vague to cover her trail as she met up with clients the night owl and the morning lark if she wanted privacy salander was a perfect roommate still the guy was perceptive if lauren had been working at her old profession wouldnt he have caught on maybe he had and chose not to tell me my gut told me hed been forthcoming but you never knew i thought of what hed told me about laurens income investments from her working days enough to coast for a few years i do great with tips good clothes but otherwise living frugally before salander had moved in shed had virtually no furniture that and the old car said she knew how to make do budgeting but spending on luscious things in her closet dressing for the job i wondered about the lunch with her mother lauren returning dazed and upset complaining about jane trying to control her but that had been two or three months ago no reason it would lead her to vanish now vanish despite my reassurances to salander i was thinking worstcase scenario seven days no luggage no car no explanation maybe lauren would waltz in any minute straighta student returned from a research trip some professor asking her to attend an outoftown meeting or convention deliver a paper shed flown somewhere that could explain no car but it didnt solve the problem of wardrobe and why hadnt she let anyone know unless salander wasnt as familiar with her wardrobe as he claimed and she had packed something tossed casual clothes into a bag research a project at my alma mater a psych major so probably a psych job at the very department from which id obtained my union card i headed west on wilshire caught snail traffic at crescent heights an orangevested caltrans crew stupidest agency in the state taking pettyfascist satisfaction in blocking off two lanes i sat idling along with the seville rolled a foot or two sat some more finally got past la cienega unmindful of the noise and the dirt new focus yearning to feel useful chapter i reached the citysized campus of the u just after fourthirty more people were leaving than arriving and the first two parking lots i tried were being retrofitted for something university officials gripe about budget constraints but the jackhammers are always working overtime its a boom time for la might endure till the next time the earth shrugs it was nearly five pm when i hurried up the stairs to the psych building hoping someone would be around the cementandstucco waffle had been repainted from offwhite to a golden beige with chartreuse overtones uncommonly bright for a place devoted to the joys of artificial intelligence and compelling brainlesioned rats to race through ever more machiavellian mazes maybe boom times hadnt loosened up grant money and the new hue was an attempt to connote warmth and availability if so eight stories of skinnerbox architecture said forget it by the time i entered the main office half the lights were out and only one secretary remained locking up but the right secretary a plump gingerhaired young woman named mary lou whiteacre whose fiveyearold son id treated last year brandon whiteacre was a nice little boy soft and artistic with his mothers coloring and scaredbunny eyes a freeway pileup had shattered his grandmothers hip and sent him to the hospital for observation brandon had escaped with nothing broken other than his confidence and soon he began wetting his bed and waking up screaming mary lou got my name from the alumni referral list but the department wasnt picking up the tab she was reeling from the crash and still chafing under the financial hardships imposed by a threeyearold divorce her hmo offered the usual cruelty i treated brandon for free my footsteps made her look up and though she smiled she seemed momentarily frightened as if id come to revoke her sons recovery dr delaware hi mary lou hows everything the red hair was a flyaway frizz that she patted down brandons doing great i probably should have called you to tell you she approached the counter thanks so much for your help dr delaware my pleasure hows your mom she frowned her hips taking a long time to heal and the other drivers being a butt denying responsibility we finally got ourselves a lawyer but everything just drags out so what brings you here im trying to locate a student who was involved in research a grad student undergrad i assume you have a record of ongoing projects well she said thats generally not public information but im sure youve got a good reason this girls gone missing for a week mary lou the police cant do much and her mothers frantic oh no but its midquarter break students take off she didnt tell her mother or her roommate though she did say shed continue to come here even during the break to do research so maybe the job took her out of town a conference or some kind of fieldwork she didnt tell her mom anything not a word she crossed the room to a wall of file cabinets same golden beige the outcome of someones experiment on color perception out came a twoinchthick computer printout that she laid on a desk and flipped through whats her name lauren teague she searched shook her head no one by that name registered with personnel on any federal or state grants lets see about private foundations another flip she looked up with the same worried expression id seen on her first visit to my office psychologys code of ethics forbids bartering with a patient id traded something with her wondered if id stepped over the line nothing maybe theres a misunderstanding i said thanks she crossed her mouth with an index finger wait a second when its parttime work sometimes the professors hire out through one of those employee management firms it avoids having to pay benefits another cabinet another printout nope no lauren teague doesnt look as if shes working here dr delaware youre sure the study was in psychology some of the other departments have behavioral science grants sociology biology i assumed psychology but you could be right i said let me call over to the administration building see what the central employee files turn up glance at the wall clock maybe i can catch someone i really appreciate this mary lou dont even think about it she said as she dialed im a mom no job listing anywhere on campus mary lou looked embarrassed an honest person confronting a lie but she said they do have her enrolled junior psych major transferred from santa monica college tell you what ill pull our copy of her transcript i cant give you her grades but i will tell you which professors she took classes from maybe they know something i appreciate it hey she said were not even close to even in the thankyou department okay here we go this past quarter she took a full load four psych courses introductory learning theory with professor hall perception with professor de maartens developmental with ronninger intro social psych with dalby gene dalby uhhuh we were classmates i said didnt know he switched from clinical practice to teaching social he came on fulltime a couple of years ago good guy one of the less pompous ones even though he drives a jag her eyes rounded and she pretended to slap her wrist forget i said that she began to return the transcript to the drawer lauren told her mother she got straight as like i said dr delaware grades are confidential her eyes dropped to the paper tiny smile but if i was her mother id be proud smart girl like that im sure theres an explanation here let me write those professors names down for you ronningers on sabbatical but the others are teaching all year by this time i doubt theyre in but good luck thanks youd make a good detective me she said never i dont like surprises she locked up and i walked her through the lobby both our footsteps echoing on black terrazzo when she was gone i strode back to the elevators and read the directory simon de maartenss office was on the fifth floor stephen z halls and gene r dalbys on the sixth i pushed the button and waited and thought about laurens lie to andrew salander no research job probably covering for her real employment stripping hooking both resuming her old ways or shed never stopped runway modeling another lie or maybe gigs at the fashion mart were just another way to cash in on her looks smart kid but enrollment in college and good grades werent contradictory to plying the flesh trade back when lauren had worked for gretchen stengel the westside madam had employed several college girls beautiful young women making easy money big money someone able to compartmentalize and rationalize would find the logic unassailable why give up fivehundreddollar tricks for a sixbuckanhour parttime bottlewashing gig without benefits salander had said lauren was living off investments and i wondered if her body was the principal if so her disappearance could be nothing more than a quarterbreak freelance to accrue spare cash no car because she was flying jetting off somewhere with a sheik or a tycoon or a software emperor any man sufficiently rich and deluded to fall for the ego sop of purchased pleasure lauren serving as amusement for a few days returning home nicely invested but if that was the case why had she raised her mothers anxiety by not providing a cover story and why hadnt she packed clothing because this particular job required a new wardrobe or no clothing at all beyond the threads on her back she had taken her purse meaning she had her credit cards what did a party girl require other than willingness and magic plastic maybe she was punishing jane by slipping away without explanation letting jane know she wouldnt be controlled or perhaps the answer was painfully simple rest and recreation after grinding away for grades cooling out in one of the places shed used before nice quiet malibu motel if that was true maybe lauren had done the latoreno shuttle found her old stomping grounds lucrative decided to stay for a while the elevator doors wheezed open and i rode up to five professor simon de maartenss door was decorated with far side cartoons and a newspaper clipping about moose deaths from acid rain closed i knocked no answer the handle didnt turn i had no more success at stephen halls unadorned slab of chartreuse wood but gene dalbys door was open and gene was sitting at his desk wearing a rumpled white shirt and khakis bare feet propped gray laptop resting on a skinny stalk of thigh he typed hummed tonelessly wiggled his toes a pair of huarache sandals sat near the legs of his chair coffee bubbled in an old white machine a single window to his left framed rooftops and the northern edge of the campus botanical gardens from a boom box on the ledge came supernatural guitar licks and a bruised voice stevie ray vaughans crossfire i said uh hi professor dalby could we talk about my grades genes head turned same bony pencil face and jug ears and rebellious ginger hair his temples had silvered blackframed halflens reading glasses rode the center of a swooping askew hook of a nose he grinned placed the specs on the desk did the same with the laptop no way you flunk jumping up to his full ostrichnecked sixfour all loose limbs and oversized hands and bobbing head he clasped my shoulders and shook his head in wonderment as if my arrival heralded the second coming of something gene is one of the most outgoing people i know a paragon of unadorned friendliness hyperactive maestro of the thunderous greeting his good cheer is nearly constant and he avoids complexity unusual traits in a psychologist so many of us were introspective overly imaginative kids who got into the field trying to figure out why our mothers were depressed no matter what we did in grad school a lot of people found him too good to be true and distrusted him he and i always got along though it rarely went beyond offcolor jokes and casual lunches so he said alex how long has it been a while lightyears man here sit coffee i took a side chair accepted a mug of something strong and bitter and vaguely coffeelike he kicked the sandals under the desk the office was tiny and his size didnt help he hunched like a pet confined by a cruel owner working during the break i said best time less distraction besides back when i was in practice i used to see fifty sixty patients a week that was real work this academic racket is legalized theft nine months a year make your own hours he laughed these guys love to complain but its a paid vacation when did you make the switch i said three years ago sold the practice to my associates and presented the department with an offer they couldnt refuse they take me on parttime no job security no benefits and i carry a heavy teaching load in exchange for a clinical full professorship and no assignment to committees no publishing treadmill exactly but the funny thing is even though i didnt plan to im doing research anyway first time in years asking questions that really interest me rather than churning out garbage in tribute to the tenure gods and i love the teaching man the kids are great despite what the idiot pundits say students are getting smarter what kind of research are you doing i said political attitudes in little kids we go out to grade schools try to gauge their perceptions of candidates youd be surprised how much little kids know about the scumbags who run for office i feel like im home social psych was always my first love i went into clinical because i also liked clinical and i thought it would be nice to help people and all that but mainly because i needed to make a buck married with kids unlike you i never went through the swinging bachelor stage youve got the wrong guy there gene i dont think so man i distinctly recall you being a departmental love object even the girls who didnt shave their legs looked at you that way i must have missed it i said he grinned listen to him that coyness all part of the charm anyway you look great alex you too i look like i always did ichabod crane on methamphetamine but yeah im doing what i can to stay in shape got into longdistance hiking jan and i did the john muir trail last summer alaska before that he turned the volume down on stevie ray i named the song he said srv he was the man sad huh struggles his whole life with dope and booze plays bars for chump change finally gets sober makes it big and the damn plane goes down talk about an object lesson live life to the fullest i said live life and dont worry be happy like that other song been telling that to patients for years now im following my own advice not that it took courage or some bigtime followyourbliss thing to motivate me i got lucky bought in at ground level with a startup software company turned a penny stock into dollars ten years of bad stock tips from my brotherinlaw finally one pays off were not talking private jet here but now if i dont like the taste of something i dont have to eat it the kids are in college and jans law practice is doing fine life is shockingly good thanks to dotcom madness the companys going to shit but ive already sold congratulations yeah he said even traded the honda for a jag dont hate me cause im beautiful he shifted in his chair cracked his knuckles so what brings you here doing some teaching yourself no im trying to locate a student named lauren teague locate as in i told him about the sevenday absence implied without spelling it out that lauren had once been a patient emphasized jane abbots anxiety poor lady he said so you were here and just dropped in no i thought you might be able to help me lauren told her roommate she had a research job here but that doesnt seem to be true she was in four classes last quarter one of them your intro social section im checking with all the profs see if anyone remembers her lauren teague he said i sure dont had five hundred plus kids in that class what others did she take i named the courses lets see he said herb ronninger is out in the indian ocean somewhere studying violent preschoolers his class pulls over six hundred so even if he were here i doubt he could help you de maartens and hall are youngbuck newhires and learning and perception tend to be a bit smaller let me call them for you i already tried their offices do you have home numbers sure he found and copied the listings handed them to me thanks lauren teague he said putting his glasses back on he opened a bottom desk drawer rifled papers for a while pulled out a list of names and grades yeah she was enrolled all right did well too very well eighteenth out of good solid as on all her exams b plus on her paper more scrounging produced another list iconography in the fashion industry oh her you remember her the model he said i thought of her that way because she looked like one all the basics tall blond gorgeous and when i read the paper i figured shed been writing from experience she also stood out because she was quite a bit older than the average junior pushing thirty right shes twentyfive oh he said well she seemed older maybe because she dressed maturely pantsuits dresses expensivelooking stuff i remember thinking this girl has money kind of aloof too she used to sit in the back by herself take notes constantly never saw her with any other students so whyd i give her a b plus on the paper if the students want them i hand them back dont know if she picked hers up but i do keep a comment card bending low he began tossing papers out of drawers created a high pile on the desk okay here goes he flourished a stack of rubberbanded blue index cards my notes say high on anger low on data if i remember it was a bit of a screed alex anger at the fashion industry i said from what i recall probably the usual feminist stuff woman as meat subservient roles coerced by unrealistic conceptions of femininity i get at least two dozen every quarter all valid points but sometimes they substitute passion for facts i really cant remember this particular paper but if i had to guess that would be it so she left without telling mom is that an aberration according to mom he scratched his chin yeah as a parent that would worry me placing his feet on the floor and his hands on his knees he looked at me over the rims of the halfglasses its funny actually its anything but funny your coming around about a missing student when you first told me it gave me a start because something like this happened last year another girl some kind of campus beauty queen shane something or shana shanna i dont recall her exact name left her dorm room one night and never came back big stir on campus for a few days then nothing it affected me more than it mightve because jan and i had just sent our lisa off to oberlin she was fine in the separationanxiety department but we werent doing so well id just started to settle down had stopped phoning the poor kid twelve times a day and this shanna thing happens she was never found he shook his head talk about the ultimate parents nightmare theres no word i despise more than closure poppsych crapolsky but not knowings got to be worse im sure it has nothing to do with the teague girl it just reminded me gene in terms of the research job is there something i mightve missed i checked federal state and private grants including parttime positions he thought awhile what about something offcampus paid subject positions you see ads in the daily cub feeling low or moody you may be clinically depressed and qualify for our cool little clinical trials pharmaceutical outcome studies obviously the fda or whoevers in charge doesnt see a problem using paid participants the cubs out of circulation till next quarter but maybe you can find something still what would that tell you about where she is probably nothing i said unless lauren signed up for a study because she had a specific problem as in depression depressed people drop out her mother wouldnt know if she was that low hard to say thanks for the tip gene ill look into it i got up placed the coffee on a table and headed for the door youre really extending yourself on this alex dont ask he stared at me but said nothing no longer a clinician but he knew enough not to press it chapter the story was easy to find shawna yeager beautiful face heartshaped unlined crowned by a tower of pale ringlets almond eyes shockingly dark pixie chin perfect teeth beauty undiminished by grainy blackandwhite miniaturization the cold metal frame of the microfiche machine the stale air of the research library microfilm vault i stared at lovely glowing shoulders exposed by a strapless gown sparkly things dotting the bodice the gown shawna yeager had worn at her coronation as miss olive festival silly little rhinestone crown pinned to the luxuriant curls happiestgirlintheworld grin the contest had taken place two years ago in her hometown an aggie community east of fallbrook named santo leon shawna yeager held a scepter in one hand a giant plastic olive in the other the daily cub article said shed graduated fifth in her class at santo leon high a single paragraph summed up her precollege history smalltown beauty queenhonor student travels to the city to attend the u shawna had surprised her friends by not pledging a sorority choosing instead to live in one of the highrise dorms turning into a study grind shed majored in psychobiology talked about premed used her beauty contest winnings and income from a summer teachers aide job to pay her bills shed been enrolled for only a month and a half when she left the dorm on a late october night informing her roommate that she was heading to the library to study at midnight the roommate a girl named mindy jacobus fell asleep at eight am mindy woke found shawnas bed empty worried a bit went to class when shawna still hadnt returned by two pm mindy contacted the campus police the unicops engaged in a comprehensive search of the us vast terrain notified lapds west la and pacific divisions beverly hills and santa monica police and west hollywood sheriffs of the girls disappearance no leads the campus paper carried the story for a week no sightings of shawna not even a false report her mother agnes yeager a widowed waitress was driven to la from santo leon by a representative of the chancellors office and provided living quarters in a graduate student dorm for the duration of the search a cub followup still no news said the search had lasted three weeks after that nothing i returned to the microfilm librarian filled out cards obtained spools from the times and the daily news for the corresponding dates shawnas disappearance merited two days of page media attention then a senators drunken son crashed his porsche on the i killing himself and two passengers and that story took over i returned to the cub spool wrote down the reporters name adam green and studied shawna yeagers beauty contest photo some more searched for a resemblance to lauren she and lauren did share a sculpted blond loveliness but nothing striking both a students psychology major psychobiology major both were selfsupporting too one banking on pageant money the other investments had each been on the lookout for extra income consulted the campus classifieds and gotten involved in one of the research studies gene dalby had described i searched for more parallels found none all in all nothing dramatic and plenty of differences at nineteen shawna had been considerably younger than lauren when she disappeared smalltown olive queen bigcity call girl widowed mother divorced mother and shawna had vanished during the second month of the quarter lauren during the break i scrolled to the cubs want ads worked backward until i came upon a boldface entry in the middle of the jobs section posted two weeks before shawna vanished tired listless inexplicably sad these may be normal mood changes or they may be signs of depression we are conducting clinical trials on depression and are looking for paid volunteers you will be offered free evaluation and if you qualify may receive experimental treatment as well as a handsome stipend no address just a phone number with a area code i copied the information kept scrolling found two similar ads for the entire month one researching phobias and featuring a different listing the other a study of human intimacy that provided a callback human intimacy had a sexual flavor to it racy research in orange county sex was commerce to lauren might something like that have caught her eye i obtained microfiche for the last quarter checked classified after classified no repeat of the intimacy ad nothing even vaguely similar and the only paidresearch solicitation was for a study on nutrition and digestion with a campus phone extension that meant the med school i wrote it down anyway left the library headed for the seville two girls gone missing a year apart very little in common shawna had never been found i could only hope that laurens disappearance would amount to nothing at all i drove home trying to convince myself shed show up tomorrow a little richer and a lot tanner laughing off everyones worries gene dalby had pegged her at thirty and maybe he was right about her maturity shed been living on her own for years had street smarts so no shock if the last week came down to a quick jaunt to vegas puerto vallarta even europe money shrinks the world i drove up the bridle path that leads to my house imagining lauren partying with a potentate then seeing the dark side of the fantasy those kinds of adventures can go very bad quickly lauren getting herself into something she hadnt counted on silly to let my mind run i barely knew the girl the girl she was well past childhood no sense obsessing id bother milo one more time tell him about shawna yeager receive the expected response the logical detectives response interesting alex but i pulled up in front of the carport pleased to see robins ford pickup there ready to stop wondering about a near stranger and be with someone i cared about but as i parked and climbed the stairs to the front door i wondered what would i tell jane abbot i knew id say little if anything to robin about my day confidentiality protects patients what it does to therapists personal relationships can be interesting private by nature robins never had a problem with my not discussing work in detail like most artists she lives in her head can do without people for long stretches of time hates gossip weve had perfectly romantic dinners where neither of us uttered a word part of thats her but i tend to drift off and ruminate sometimes i feel shes not with me and i know there are instances when she views me as inhabiting another planet mostly we connect i called out a looocey im home babaloo and she shouted back ricky she was in jeans and a black tank top everything filling nicely as she squatted to fill spikes feed bowl and sang along with the radio country station alison krauss and keith whitley doing when you say nothing at all whitleys rich baritone exhumed from the grave technology could resurrect sound waves but it couldnt dampen a mothers grief robin finished pouring kibble stood and stretched to her full barefoot fivethree no bra beneath the tank top and when i pressed her to me her breasts spread across my shirtfront when i kissed her her tongue tasted of coffee her auburn curls were loose and longer than usual six inches past the middle of her back when she gets her hair done its a halfday threefigure affair at a place in beverly hills that reeks of nail polish and people trying too hard i couldnt remember the last time shed spent the time and money busy with a seemingly endless flow of guitar construction and repairs better than the alternative was her comment when i remarked on her long days a few weeks ago shed recorded a new phone message hi this is robin castagna im out in the studio carving and gluing would love to talk to you however its going to be a while before i can be polite if you have an urgent message please leave it in detail but we kissed some more and spike yelped in protest hes a french bulldog twentyfive pounds of black brindle barrel bat ears perked and deceptively soft brown eyes im the one who rescued him on a hot arid summer day but forget gratitude the moment robin smiled at him i came to be viewed as an annoyance keeping one hand on robins bottom i set my briefcase on the table spike nudged her shin she said hold on handsome sure i said keep feeding his ego she laughed you aint chopped liver either spikes flat face pivoted and he glared at me i can swear he understands english his attenuated larynx let out a strangled growl and he pawed the floor tom flews deigns to speak i said grumble grumble dont feud boys said robin bending to pet him long day sweetie me or him you id thought the cheer in my voice sounded authentic wondered why shed asked long enough but over spike sputtered a twentyoneinch neck quivered drool sprayed im staying for the evening pal deal with it his eyes pinched at the corners as he let out a belly grunt i kissed the back of robins neck as much out of spite as anything spike began bouncing higher than stumpy legs had any right to take him and robin added something from the fridge to his dinner and toted it to the service porch his nose was buried before the dish hit the floor is that last nights stroganoff i said i figured were finished with it we are now she laughed bent picked up a stray bit of meat handfed it to him breathing hard he plunged his head back into the bowl bon appétit monsieur hed prefer foie gras and a fine burgundy i said but hell condescend she laced her arms around my neck so whats up what shall our dinner be havent thought about it she said any ideas how about his leftovers now youre being cranky she started to leave but i held her back stroked her neck her shoulder blades slipped my hands under the tank top and kneaded the knobs of her spine cupped a breast food first she said then maybe maybe what fun if you behave yourself define your terms ill define them as we go along so what went wrong today who says anything went wrong your face youre all stressed around the edges wrinkles i said the aging process dont think so her small fineboned hand topped my knuckles look i said stretching my lips with my thumbs and letting go mr happy she said nothing i sat there and enjoyed her face another heartshaped face olivetinted set upon a long smooth stalk framed by the mass of curls straight assertive nose full lips swelled by a hint of overbite the faintest beginnings of crowsfeet and laugh lines around almond eyes the color of bittersweet chocolate im fine i said okay she played with her hair how was your day no one bugged me so i got more done than id planned her hand fingerwalked over to mine and she began playing with my thumb just tell me this alex is it one of your own cases or something milos gotten you into the former i said got it she said zipping a finger across her lips so nothing dangerous not that im harping not remotely dangerous i said remembering the talk wed had last year after id roleplayed with a group of eugenic psychopaths and ended up too close to dead the pledge id given her good she said cause when i see you burdened i start to wonder if maybe youre feeling constrained its just a case from the past that i mightve handled better i need to make a few phone calls and then we can figure out dinner okay sure she said and thats where we left it i went into my office poured the contents of my briefcase onto the desk found the numbers gene dalby had given me for professors hall and de maartens and dialed two answering machines i left messages next adam green the student journalist information had four adam greens listed in the area code no sense at this stage of the game trying to figure out which if any was the kid whod covered the shawna yeager story hed spent three weeks of his life on the story a year ago what could he possibly have to offer arranging the photocopies id made of the daily cub microfiches i retrieved the three phone numbers accompanying the want ads the depression and phobia study listings were out of service and the orange county intimacy project id saved the best for last connected to a newport beach pizza parlor in la its not just the tectonic plates that shift finally i looked up hotels and motels in malibu and made a dozen calls if lauren had checked into any of the establishments she hadnt used her real name one last call jane abbot that would wait till tomorrow no it wouldnt i dialed the valley number planning to be vague but supportive careful not to leech her hope the phone rang four times and i rehearsed the little speech id deliver to her robot guardian ah here he was no one can take your call but if you care to beep mrs abbot this is dr delaware ive talked to a police detective about lauren nothing really to report but hes been made aware of the details ill stay on it get back to you the moment i learn a real mans voice broke in very soft halting yes i identified myself long silence i said hello this is mr abbot more of an announcement than an exchange mr abbot your wife spoke to me recently mrs abbot he said yes sir she and i this is mr abbot mrs abbot isnt here when will she be back sir several seconds of dead air the house is empty your wife called me about lauren and i was getting back to her more silence her daughter lauren i said lauren teague still nothing mr abbot my wifes not here said the frail voice plaintively she goes out comes back goes out comes back are you all right sir im upstairs trying to read robert benchley ever read benchley funny as hell but the words get small ill call back later mr abbot no reply sir click chapter i hung up tried to figure out what had just happened robin knocked on the doorjamb and said ready shed put on a tiny little charcoal sweater over a long gray tweed skirt and glossed her lips her smile made putting the call aside a little easier we ended up at a japanese place on sawtelle south of olympic the only business open at night in an obscure little strip mall we were the only nonasians in the room but no heads turned a gaunt chef chopped something eelish behind the sushi bar a tiny woman showed us to a corner booth where we drank sake laced fingers and talked very little then not at all the service was formal but perfect as another diminutive woman brought us boxes of warm sake and pinches of exquisite food the quiet and the dimness took hold and when we stepped out into the night ninety minutes later my lungs and brain were clear when we got back spike was baying miserably and we took him for a short walk up the glen then robin ran a bath and i stood around doing nothing finally i gave in and checked my messages thinking again about jane abbots husband callbacks from professors hall and de maartens in halls case by proxy a young man identifying himself as craig the halls house sitter informed me cheerfully that stephen and beverly are in the loire valley with their children and wont be back for another week ill pass the message along de maartens spoke for himself in a mellow accented puzzled voice this is simon de maartens i have checked my records and lauren teague was indeed enrolled in my class unfortunately i have no personal recollection of her sorry not to have been more helpful robin called out join me from the bathroom and i was out of my clothes when the phone jangled i let it ring and had a good soak took my time washing her hair then just lying back in the wombwarmth of the tub scrubbing and sponging led to caressing and nibbling then giggling aquatic contortions that flooded the floor we tripped to bed made love till we were breathless left the covers soaked and foaming with soap bubbles i was still gasping when robin got up wrapped herself in one of my ratty robes danced into the kitchen and returned with two glasses of orange juice she poured juice down my gullet spilled a good deal of the liquid thought that was hilarious my revenge was sloppy and we changed the sheets when she went to dry her hair i put on a tshirt and shorts stepped onto the rear terrace propped my elbows on the redwood railing stared out at looming black shapes the pines and cedars and blue gums that coat the hills behind our property feeling like a california guy i was somewhere on the way to torpor when robins voice stirred me honey milos on the phone he says he called half an hour ago the ring id ignored she said you can take it in here im going down to the pond theres a spotlight out i went inside picked up the bedroom extension whats up your girl said milo the teague girl shes my business now nine pm sepulveda boulevard the commercial strip south of wilshire and north of olympic discount outlets animal emergency rooms ironworks furniture wholesalers except for the veterinarians everything shut down for the night a cat screeched west side of the street milo had said the alley not far from the restaurant where id stuffed my face three hours before now the thought of eating churned my stomach a patrol car blocked the alley rubysapphire lights flashing the crown jewels of trouble the uniform with his foot propped on the front bumper was young and pumped up and distrustful and his palm shot out reflexively as i edged the seville near i stuck my head out called out my name he wasnt hearing it scowled at the sevilles grille ordered me to move it i shouted louder and he sauntered over unibrowed angrily hand on his holster my face was hot but i forced myself to talk slowly and politely finally he made the call that cleared me and when i got out he said over there as if imparting something profound pointing south down the alley but there was no need for direction the knot of vehicles was a huge chrome tumor under the sizzle of power lines as i ran toward the crime scene the stench of rotted upholstery and gasoline and putrefying vegetables nearly gagged me i spotted milo next to the coroners van hunched and scrawling furiously one of his legs was bent and the roll of his belly protruded far beyond his lapels he licked his pencil then jockeyed for comfort the way big heavy men often do the highintensity spots the techs had set up turned his face white and powdery as if dusted with flour showcasing pouches and pits the saggy smudges under his eyes i continued toward him feeling numb and sick and out of place when i was ten feet away he looked up now his face was strangely diffuse as if my eyes had suddenly lost acuity except for his eyes they gleamed sharp too bright jumpy as a coyotes emerald green bleached by the spots to sea foam he had on a fleshcolored polywool sport coat baggy brown cords white washandwear shirt with a skimpy curling collar and a skinny green tie that glistened like a strip of tooth gel his hair needed cutting the top ink black left longish as usual shot off in all directions and the spiky forelock that shaded his brow arched over his highbridged nose his temples clipped to bristle were snowwhite from ear top to the bottom of elvisoid sideburns the contrast was unnatural recently hed taken to calling himself el skunko was making more and more cracks about senility and mortality he was less than a year older than i seemed to have aged a lot during the last year or so robin told me i looked young when she thought i needed to hear that i wondered what rick told milo he closed his notepad rubbed his face shook his head where is she i said already in the van he said tilting his head toward the coroners transport the doors were closed a driver sat behind the wheel i started toward the van he held my arm you dont want to see her i can handle it dont put yourself through it whats the point i continued to the van and he opened the door slid out the gurney unzipped the first two feet of the body bag i caught a nosefull of rottenmeat stench and a glimpse of misshapen greengray face purplish swollen eyes protuberant tongue long blond strands before he resealed the bag and led me away as the van drove off he sighed rubbed his face again as if washing without water shes been dead for a while alex four five days maybe more at the bottom of one of the dumpsters under a load of trash he pointed that one behind the patio furniture outlet someone wrapped her in heavyduty plastic industrial sheeting nights have been cool but still who found her i said the outlet uses a private trash service they pick up once a week at night showed up a couple of hours ago when they latched the dumpster onto their truck and upended it she fell out do you really want to hear this go on part of her rolled out a leg the driver heard her hit the ground went over to check and uncovered the rest of her she was bound hands and feet hogtied shot in the back of the head two shots close range both in the brain stem coroner says one bullet wouldve done the trick someone was being careful or angry or both or just liked to play with his firestick large caliber large enough to blacken her eyes and do that to her face alex why are you sounds like an execution i said it came out calm and flat my eyes filled with water and i swiped at them he didnt answer four or five days or more i went on so it happened soon after she disappeared looks like it howd you identify her moment i saw her i knew exactly who she was when i spoke to missing persons for you they sent me her sheet and id seen her booking photo well i said now youve got a relief from your cold cases im sorry about this alex i just left a message for her mother told her i was still working on finding lauren nothing like success huh my eyes brimmed and a handwipe didnt do the trick as i reached for my handkerchief milo turned away i stood there and let the tears gush what the hell was this all about i was no stranger to tragedy had trained myself to maintain distance lauren was dead at twentyfive but my memories were dominated by a fifteenyearold face too much makeup useless little black purse ridiculous shoes ive changed youve grown up have i my gorge rose and this time i didnt think i could hold back milos voice was far away fuzzed and funneled by distance you all right i tried to mouth the word fine turned and sprinted up the alley found a spot away from the crime scene and vomited convulsively the burn of rice wine the fishy aftertaste of a fine japanese dinner i waited in milos unmarked as he did what he needed to do my throat was raw and my body was sheathed in clammy sweat yet i felt strangely serene milod left his cell phone on the front seat and i called robin she picked up right away waiting sorry to ruin another evening i said what happened someone got killed the case i mentioned today what i couldnt talk about a girl i once treated youll probably read about it in the paper tomorrow they just found her body oh god a child a young woman she was a child when i met her shed gone missing her mother asked me to help i may end up going with milo to notify her im not sure when ill be back alex im so sorry a laugh slipped out from between my lips inappropriate inexplicable love you i said i know you do milo got behind the wheel and i told him about shawna yeager he said i remember that one the beauty queen guy named leo riley ended up with it thank god tough one impossible from the getgo not a shred of physical evidence and no witnesses leo used to gripe about it his last case before retiring and he had to end it open his hunch was some warpo got hold of the girl did his thing put her where shell never be found he eyed the dumpster whoever did this didnt care about that true i said whyd you tell me about the yeager girl i repeated my conversation with gene dalby he said two students blond goodlooking a year apart if im right about the yeager girl being a sex thing thats a long time between victims nothing youve said screams pattern just thought id mention it ill keep it in mind if nothing else turns up on lauren meanwhile ive got uniforms headed over to her apartment to secure the premises and keep an eye on the roommate got a name on her him andrew salander midtwenties tends bar at the cloisters the cloisters he said running a hand through his hair short skinny pale kid with tattoos thats him andy his smile was uneasy claims to fix a mean martini he doesnt hell if i know i hate martinis he frowned so she roomed with andy any idea how long he told me about six months said hed been living downstairs in the same building couldnt make the rent and lauren invited him to share interesting turning the green eyes on me what do you think of that her living with him maybe she considered him safe maybe he was you know something about him that makes you doubt it no he said a little too chatty for my taste but he always seemed like a nice kid then again his roomie got killed well just have to see he shifted in the seat meanwhile the fun part of the job notifying mom ill go with you i know you will he said i wasnt even thinking of talking you out of it sherman oaks he said from the passenger seat wed swapped the unmarked for the seville and i was driving north on sepulveda i jumped onto the north onramp veered to the fast lane pushed the car up to eightyfive years ago the freeway wouldve been a clear sail at this hour tonight i had plenty of company mostly big trucks lumbering and small cars rushing the nerve to get in my way i had big plans jane abbots life to ruin i wondered if she was home yet or would we find the addled husband alone from mean old lyle to that marital luck didnt seem to be her specialty if she was home what would i say how would i tell her devana terrace said milo reciting the address hed gotten from motor vehicles south of ventura boulevard i knew the neighborhood nice whatever his mental state jane abbots second husband had provided well remembering his feeble voice i wondered what shed settled for the valley i said laurens father took her to a miniature golf course in the valley the day he terminated therapy i told him about lyle teagues deception nice man he said you trying to tell me something about him no lauren denied abuse but you were concerned enough to ask her there was a seductive quality to his behavior lauren alluded to it herself the time she came back to see me she said it sounded as if hed been jealous of her time with me but she was very clear about there being no molestation protesting too much he said who knows i didnt have time to find out he grunted stretched his long legs so after daddy killed therapy you saw her only that once im still not sure why she originally made the appointment but she ended up unloading on me maybe thats all she wanted he was quiet for a while i put on more speed and he laughed nervously and i slowed to eighty he said from actingout teenybopper to stripping and doing tricks lots of girls in the skin trade have abuse in their backgrounds another laugh who the hell am i lecturing to if her father did abuse her hes sure not going to admit it now lets see how he reacts to all this and sooner rather than later he may be a schmuck but as her parent he also merits notification if you can find him why wouldnt i he walked out on lauren and her mother years ago remarried sometimes men who run run far he whipped out the cell phone lyle teague hed be about fifty he began punching numbers the fast lane was clear for a mile or so and i sped up once more milo said have mercy on my colon dr daytona and again i eased up on the gas pedal a moment later he had lyle teagues address reseda looks like everyones in the valley lauren lived in the city yeah he said maybe no coincidence distancing herself from mom and dad or she wanted to be closer to the u then why didnt she live on the westside more bang for her rental buck i said speaking of which he said any idea how she made the rent she told salander investments never got specific a student with investments he said tell me everything you know about her alex right from the beginning the long version death ends confidentiality freed from that hurdle i spilled not much confidentiality to honor anyway therapy with lauren had amounted to so little and the retelling drove home how little id accomplished when i got to phil harnsbergers party my voice grew louder faster milo kept his eyes on his pad looked up only when the ventura freeway appeared and i forgot to veer to the right realizing my error i asserted myself across three lanes as he sat up and gripped the armrest managing to bounce onto the eastbound offramp i tortured my shock absorbers drove for another couple of miles exited at van nuys found the south end of the valley comfortingly quiet he said well that got my heart rate up no need for the treadmill whens the last time you saw the inside of a gym sometime in the pleistocene era me and all the other neanderthals pumping chunks of granite i stayed on van nuys reached valley vista turned left found devana terrace and cruised slowly looking for jane abbots address dark street pretty street i finished the account of laurens strip the recognition that had passed between us like a virus milo wanted nothing to do with the confessor role waved his pen said remember the other girls name michelle michelle what lauren never said same age as lauren approximately around the same height too darkhaired maybe latin blonde and brunette he said and i knew what he was thinking someone ordering a matched pair for the evening after id left how far had lauren and michelle taken things he said anyone mention the name of the company they worked for no and even if you find the guys who organized the party i doubt theyll admit to anything were talking medical school professors and financial types and this was four years ago four years ago would be right around the time lauren was working for gretchen stengel so maybe gretchen had a partyrental sideline where is gretchen dont know she served a couple of years for money laundering and tax evasion but your guess is as good as mine he closed his pad investments so maybe lauren stayed in the game be interesting if she and michelle maintained a relationship andrew salander said lauren didnt have any friends maybe there were things lauren didnt tell andrew or he didnt tell you that could very well be i said thinking lauren lied about the research job so shed probably erected other barriers constructing her own confidentiality now all her secrets were trash chapter the house was too easy to find twostory white colonial at the end of the block almost grand behind black stripes of iron fencing so brightened by highvoltage spots that it seemed to inhabit its own private daylight mullioned windows green shutters semicircular driveway two gates one marked entry milo tightened the knot of his tie as i parked we got out and walked toward the entrance gate the night seemed drained of life force or maybe it was the task at hand lights yellowed a couple of upstairs windows and the fanlight above the front door flashed chandelier sparkle a white cadillac fleetwood blocked the view of the front door shiny enough to be brandnew but of a size no longer hazarded by detroit handicap license plate a metallic blue mustang coupe also spotless was parked behind the caddy trailing the big car like an obedient child milo glanced at the call box then at me either way i pushed the button a digital code sounded then a ringing phone jane abbot said yes in a sleepy voice mrs abbot its dr delaware her breath caught oh what is it its about lauren may i please come in yes yes of course just one second let me hold on her voice climbed in pitch with each truncated phrase and the last word was a tight screech moments later the door opened and jane abbot ran out wearing a quilted silk robe hair pinned up in her hand was a remote control that she aimed at the gate iron panels slid open she was two feet away when we stepped through ten years since id seen her she was still trim and fineboned the blond hair now a salon ash barely darker than the platinum lauren had sported the decade had hollowed her face and loosened her skin and acidetched fissures in all the typical places as she ran toward us she breathed through her mouth fluffy slippers flapped on brick milo had his badge out but it wasnt necessary he had that terrible sadness on his face and jane abbots curse was comprehension she raised her hands to her head jerked away from him and stared at me i had nothing better to offer and she screamed and beat her breast tripped and stumbled as her legs gave way a slipper flew off pink slippers the things you notice milo and i caught her simultaneously she struck at us all bones and tendons oddly slippery through the chenille of her robe her grief was raw and headsplitting but no one else came to the door of the house no reactions from the neighbors either and i had a sudden taste of the solitude shed face i picked up the slipper and we guided her across the driveway and back inside except for the chandeliered entry and a front room lit by a ceramic table lamp shaped like a beehive the house was dark milo flipped a switch and revealed an interior surprisingly modest in scale low ceilings white walltowall carpeting furniture that had been pricey during the fifties grasscloth walls painted pinkbeige and crowded with what looked to be real picassos and braques and tiny impressionist street scenes a sliver of eastern wall held builtin white bookshelves filled with hardcover books and blackspined folders interspersed with framed plaques and gilded trophies a rear wall of glass looked out onto nothing we sat jane abbot down on a stiff ocean blue sofa and i settled next to her smelling her perfume and metallic sweat milo took a facing armchair much too small for him his pad wasnt out yet it would be soon janes hands shook caught in the fabric of her robe became sharpknuckled paralyzed talons her cries degraded to gasps then snuffles then tortured squeaks that caused her to twist and jerk milo watched her without seeming to relaxed but not blasé how many times had he done this suddenly she became still and silence captured the house a cold rotten inertia where was the husband im sorry maam said milo my god my god when did it happen lauren was found a few hours ago she nodded as if that made sense and milo began giving her the basics speaking slowly clearly in low even tones she kept nodding began rocking in sync with his phrasing shifted her body away from me and toward him the logical realignment i welcomed it he finished waited for her to respond and when she didnt said i know this is a hard time to be answering questions but ask anything she clutched her head again and her face crumpled my baby my precious baby more tears a beeper went off milo reached for his and jane abbot pulled one out of her robe my other baby she said wearily she rose unsteadily one foot still bare i was holding the slipper handed it to her she took it smiled terribly shuffled to the next room and turned on the light the dining room mock chippendale furniture more pretty paintings she touched something near a side door and the walls hummed and the door slid open home elevator ill be right back she stepped in disappeared milo exhaled got up and walked around stopped at the bookshelves pointed to one of the trophies hmm what couple of emmys from the fifties early sixties writers guild awards and this ones from the producers guild melville abbot all for comedy heres a picture of eddie cantor sid caesar dear mel ever hear of the guy no i said me neither tv writer you never hear of them he pulled out one of the blackspined volumes muttered script just as the elevator door slid open and jane abbot came out pushing a man in a wheelchair her pink robe had been replaced by a long blackandsilver silk kimono she still wore the fuzzy slippers the man wore perfectly ironed pale blue pajamas with whitepiped lapels he looked to be eighty or more a brown cashmere blanket draped a lap so shrunken it barely tented the fabric his small gray egg of a head was hairless but for puffs of white at the temples his nose was a droopy salmoncolored balloon his mouth pursed and lipless above an eroded chin small brown eyes merry eyes took us in and he chuckled jane abbot heard it and flinched she stood behind him hands squeezing the bar of the chair her grimness a reproach he gave a thumbup wave called out in a jarringly hearty voice evening les gendarmes bon soir mel abbot decibels above the tentative phone voice of a few hours ago jane moaned softly abbot grinned pleased to meet you sir said milo approaching the wheelchair les gendarmes abbot singsonged les gendarmes du marseilles the constabulary de stiff awm o de law he craned tried to look back at his wife alarm go off again dearest no said jane its not that its different mel something mel something terrible has happened now now said mel abbot winking at us how terrible can it be were all alive please mel now now now abbot insisted now now now now cutie pie raising a palsying hand he reached back groped without success finally jane took hold of his fingers closed her eyes he winked at us again like when they asked chevalier how does it feel to turn eighty and chevalier says how does it feel studied pause ill tell you how it feels considering the alternative it feels terrific mel now now dearest whats another false alarm citation así es la vida you plays you pays we can afford it denks gott melville abbot freed his hand and waved floppy fingers his head lolled but he managed another wink the main thing is everyones alive like chevalier said when they asked him how does it feel to turn eighty wink and chevalier says mel jane lurched forward and grabbed his hand dearest no jokes mel please not now no more jokes abbots eyes bugged his crushedcrepe face bore the humiliation of a child caught masturbating my wife he said to us id say take her but i wouldnt mean it cant live with em cant live without state trooper stops a fellow on the highway fellow says i wasnt speeding officer trooper says didja notice a mile back your wife fell outta the car fellow says oh good i thought i was going deaf jane must have squeezed his fingers because he winced and said ouch she moved around to the front of the wheelchair and kneeled before him mel listen to me something bad has happened something terrible to me abbots eyes hazed he looked to us for rescue our silence made his mouth drop open oversized dentures too white too perfectly aligned emphasized the ruin that was the rest of him he pouted jane placed her hands on his narrow shoulders whats wrong with a little levity dearest whats life without a little spice its lauren mel shes jane began weeping the old man stared down at her licked his lips touched her hair she rested her head on his lap and he stroked her cheek lauren he said as if familiarizing himself with the name his eyes closed movement behind the lids flipping through a mental rolodex when they opened he was smiling again the pretty one jane shot to her feet and the chair rolled back several inches gritting her teeth she inhaled spoke very slowly lauren my daughter mel my child my baby like your bobby abbot considered that turned away pouted again bobby never comes to see me jane shouted thats because bobby she stopped herself murmured lord lord kissed the top of the old mans head hard more of a blow than a gesture of affection and covered her face with her hand abbot said bobbys a doctor bigshot plastic surgeon michelangelo with a knife big industry practice knows where all the wrinkles are buried he brightened turned to his wife what do you say we go out for breakfast all of us well pile into the caddy go over to sollys and have some a second of confusion whatever with onions omelette maybe with lox to us that means you gents breakfast is on me long as you dont give us a ticket for the false alarm jane abbot lied to him as she wheeled him back to the elevator making breakfast plans telling him theyd have lox and onions maybe pancakes she needed some time to straighten up he should think about what he wanted to wear shed come back in a few minutes the lift arrived and she pushed him in ill wear a cardigan he said as the door closed behind them one of the good ones from sy devore milo said my my when we were alone again he made another trip to the bookshelves look at this groucho milton berle the guy knew everyone heres a photo from a friars club roast they did for him twenty years ago the fires sure dim dont they gives me hope for the future i inspected the signatures on the artwork picasso childe hassam louis rittman max ernst a tiny renoir drawing the elevator vibrated the walls the door groaned open and jane abbot ran out as if escaping suffocation her eyes were sunken and inflamed and she looked old and i tried to think of her as a young flight attendant smiling easily im sorry hes just its been getting worse oh god she collapsed on the sofa cried softly stopped and talked to her lap bobby his son died ten years ago skiing accident he was mels only child mels wife doris had been ill for a while bad arthritis she bound up to the point where she couldnt move bobbys death made her worse and eventually she needed roundtheclock care after my divorce i went to nursing school got my lvn hired out for private duty i took care of doris until she died terrific lady never lost her spirit for five years i cared for her sometimes i did two shifts a day basically i moved in here mel was older than her but back then he was in great shape we all got along great he had the best sense of humor they both did she clawed a cheek the man used to be pure sunshine and brilliant he had a repertoire of thousands of jokes could rattle them off by category you name it hed know twenty gags after doriss funeral i moved out and got a job at a rest home two months later mel called me when he asked me out i thought it was for old times sake to thank me when he showed up at my apartment all spiffed up with a corsage i was taken aback shocked really i had no idea but i didnt want to hurt his feelings so i went along with it he took me to the palm we ate steak drank great wine and i ended up having the best time of my life he was we dated for a long time i finally agreed to marry him two years ago i quit smoking for his health i know the age difference is but its not what it seems no need to explain maam sure there is she said sure there is theres always a need to explain i know youre thinking this is another maydecember golddigger routine but it isnt mels wellheeled his art alone but we have a prenuptial and i dont know the details of his finances dont want to know i get an allowance ive never asked him to amend his will hes the nicest man in the world until recently we maam just had the greatest time traveling taking cruises living life lauren only met him a few times but she liked him he made a point of telling her how gorgeous she was a regular marilyn she never got that from her father laurens never gotten anything from her father and maybe that was my fault she sobbed i sat down next to her so lauren didnt come by often said milo she was always busy with school and all that the times she was here she loved mels jokes her eyes hardened lyle never told her jokes lyle wouldnt know a joke if it there wasnt much to laugh about in our family im sure you remember that dr delaware i nodded what a grim life we had mel taught me what real living was all about then a year ago he had the first stroke then another and another his legs went first then his mind sometimes hes clear as a bell but mostly hes like what you just saw my other baby thank god the elevator was already in place for doris or i dont know what wed do so its not that bad he weighs next to nothing getting him in the chairs no problem my training bathing hims a bit of a but no big deal for the most part things go smoothly her face constricted and tears gushed from her eyes for the most part they go very very smoothly i took her hand her skin was dry and cold thrummed by an unseen tremor hell be beeping me soon she said he misses me when im not there do what you need to do maam said milo well work with you thank you youre sweet oh this is oh she threw up her hands laughed horribly a few questions maam if you feel you can handle it i can handle anything she said without conviction some of these questions are going to seem stupid but they need to be asked go ahead can you think of anyone whod want to harm lauren no she said quickly everyone loved her she was sugar no exboyfriends anyone with a personal grudge she never had a boyfriend never said milo silence jane abbot said she was going places with her work her education didnt have the time for relationships did she tell you that she told mel that when shed come over hed say youre so gorgeous doll why no stud on your arm or something like that shed laugh and say she didnt have time to waste on a man and mel would make cracks about if only he were two hundred years younger when if he figures out what happened itll crush him her nose began to run and i handed her a tissue her work said milo modeling she freelanced saved up quite a bit of money it allowed her to go back to school no time for boyfriends he said not a single one no one that i ever met her eyes shifted to the floor and i knew she was holding back aware of laurens real profession busy with her studies said milo yes she loved her classes loved psychology planned to go all the way get a phd to me you inspired her she thought you were great milo said in addition to classes did she do any psychological work you mean like volunteering i dont think so volunteering research no said jane nothing that she mentioned what about travel she took off from time to time but only for a day or two not a week thats how i knew something was wrong andy her roommate knew it too i could tell when i spoke to him he was worried he knew this was wrong andy said milo lauren and he get along pretty well famously like two peas he finally got lauren to spruce that place up he has a great eye most of them do them gays theyre clever that way it was a smart arrangement i told lauren that no hankypanky and he had a great eye for decorating what did she say to that she agreed so he said youre not aware of any conflict between her and andy she stared at milo andy you cant be no no ridiculous hed have no reason hes more of a girl than a boy they were like two sorority sisters no reason for conflict because no sexual tension she blanched well yes arent so many things like this physical men hurting women because theyre twisted you think this mightve been a sexual crime well no she said i dont think anything what do i know was there did someone abuse her nothing points that way maam but well have to wait for the coroner the coroner jane began crying again i was ready with another tissue and milo wrote in his pad i hadnt seen him take it out when lauren went off for a few days whered she go mrs abbot she looked up i dont really know another eye shift and something new had come into her voice wariness milo had to have heard it but he kept his eyes on the pad so she never told you details just that she was taking off he said lauren was twentyfive detective long bout of crying sorry i was just thinking shell never be twentysix lauren was a private person detective i knew i had to respect that if i wanted to keep getting along we had a history dr delaware can fill in the details lauren was a really rebellious teenager even as a small child if i pushed shed pull if i said black shed insist it was white then my ex walked out on us and we got poor overnight and lauren didnt want to know about that she ran away when she was sixteen never lived with me again for years i barely heard from her i tried she looked at me for support i mustered a nod we reconnected she went on all those years of barely hearing from her and she wanted to reconnect i was afraid if i bugged her id lose her so i didnt and now maybe if id no reason to blame yourself i said no do you mean that or is that something you just say to all the whatever i am her head dropped into her hands the nape of her neck was moist with sweat i thought about the lunch that had sent lauren home upset complaining jane was trying to control her at odds with janes speech about restraint she sat up suddenly flushed coldeyed what im trying to say is i was trying to get to know her again to know my daughter and i thought i was doing pretty good and now i should be able to tell you more but i cant cause i dont know its come to this and i dont know youre doing fine maam she laughed sure i am my babys dead and the one upstairs will be beeping me soon im doing fantastic just fantastic ill do everything i ca find whoever did this detective take this seriously and find him not the way the cops took it like a joke when lauren went missing of cour find him so i can look him right in the eye then ill slice his balls off chapter milo questioned her a bit longer honing in on laurens finances any jobs she mightve worked between seventeen and twentyfive any business acquaintances modeling said jane thats the only work i know about fashion modeling nod howd she get into that maam i guess she just applied and got work shes was a beautiful girl did she ever mention an agent someone who got her work jane shook her head she looked miserable ive seen the same thing happen to other surviving parents the pain of ignorance realizing theyd raised strangers she paid her own way detective and thats more than you can say for a lot of kids she unlaced her hands glanced toward the elevator i dont like it when he gets too quiet as is i barely sleep always worried about something happening to him sickly smile this is a bad dream right ill wake up and find out you were never here she sprang up ran to the elevator we saw ourselves out trudged back to the seville from somewhere in the hills an owl hooted plenty of owls in la they eat rats milo looked back at the house so she knows nothing think its true hard to say when you asked her about laurens travel her eyes got jumpy also when she began talking about laurens modeling so maybe she knows or suspects about how lauren really paid the rent something else he said she was quick to tell us about her prenup with mel but even if she did marry him for the loot i cant see what that has to do with lauren still i think ill follow the money trail laurens finances this one smells like money sex and money i said is there a difference i got behind the wheel and turned the key the dash clock said am too late for lyle in reseda he stretched the seat belt over his paunch nah never too late for fun i drove back to van nuys boulevard turned right and picked up the west at riverside the freeway had nearly emptied and the exits before the reseda boulevard offramp zipped by like snapshots as i got off milo said daddy and mommy live pretty close wonder if they had any contact mommy says no so near and yet so far nice metaphor for alienation huh not that im in any mood for that kind of crap lyle teagues street was a scruffy treeless stretch south of roscoe smelling of infertile dirt and auto paint apartments that looked as if theyd been put up over the weekend mingled uneasily with charmless singlefamily boxes old pickups and cars that had rolled off the assembly line without much selfesteem crowded curbs and front lawns crushed beer cans and discarded fastfood containers clumped atop storm gutters my slow cruise brought forth a chorus of canine outrage dogs that sounded eager to bite the teague residence squatted on a thirdacre table of what looked to be swept dirt eightfoot chain link gave the property a prisonyard feeling something in common with his exwife they both liked being boxed off but this house was dark no outdoor lighting milo used his penlight to sweep the property the narrow beam made it a lengthy exercise alighting on windows and doors lingering long enough to arouse suspicion but neither that nor the continuing hound concerto brought anyone out to check the flashlight continued to roam found a guard dog on duty sign but no animal materialized to back up the warning a chain heavy enough to moor a yacht tied the gate to the fence a fistsized padlock completed the welcome the house was a basic box with a face as flat as spikes but none of my poochs personality pale stucco on top dark wood siding below a few feet away sat a prefab carport a longbed truck with grossly oversized tires and chromium pipes rested in front of the opening too tall to fit inside no squawk box no bell said milo scrutinizing the gate different tax bracket than janes could make a fellow irritable he rattled the chain called out hello got no response pulled out his cell phone dialed waited five rings then a voice on the other end barked loud i couldnt make out the words but the tone was clear mr teague sir please dont hang up this is detective sturgis of the los angeles police force yes sir its for real its about your daughter lauren yes sir im afraid i am sir please dont hang up this isnt a prank please come outside were right in front of your house yes sir at the gate please sir thank you sir he pocketed the phone woke him up and hes not pleased we waited two minutes three five milo muttered tobacco road checked his watch still no lights on in the little house finally the door opened and i saw the outline of a figure standing in the opening milo called out mr teague were over here no answer twenty seconds passed then yeah i see you gravel voice thicker than i remembered but i didnt remember much about lyle teague whynt you show some id milo flashed the badge and waved it the skimpy moon provided little help and i wondered what teague could see from this far do it again milos black brows rose yes sir another wave how do i know its not a tijuana special departments not that hard up sir said milo forcing himself to keep his voice light teague took a few steps closer silent steps bare feet i could see them now saw the barrel of his bare chest wearing nothing but shorts one hand tented his eyes the other remained pinioned to his side ive got a shotgun here so if youre not who you claim to be this is fair warning if you are dont lose your cool im just protecting myself before the speech was complete milo had stepped in front of me his hand was under his jacket and his neck was taut put the shotgun down sir go back inside your house phone the west la division at a number im going to give you and check me out milo sturgis detective three homicide he recited his badge number then the stations exchange teagues shotgun arm flexed but the weapon remained sheathed in darkness milo said mr teague put the shotgun down now we dont want any accidents homicide teague sounded uncertain thats right sir youre saying this is about lauren youre saying she im afraid so mr teague shit what the hell happened we need to sit down and talk sir please put down the shotgun teagues gun arm remained pressed to his side he stumbled closer catching just enough moonlight to limn his flesh but the light didnt reach above his shoulders and he turned into a headless man white torso arms legs making their way toward us unsteadily fuck whispered milo stepping back put the gun down sir now lauren teague stopped spit kneeled placed the shotgun on the ground straightened shot both arms up at the sky laughed and spit again close enough so i could hear the plink of saliva hitting dirt lauren lord lord this is fucked he made his way over to the gate head down arms stiff and swinging reaching into a shorts pocket he took a long time to produce a key tried to spring the padlock fumbled around the hole cursed began punching the chain link milo said let me help you with that sir teague ignored him and gave the lock another stab with no more success breathing hard i could smell his sweat vinegary overlaid with the rotted malt of too many beers he pounded the fence again cursed raggedly getting a closer look at him sprang a memory latch in my head same face but his features had coarsened and his eyes had regressed to piggish slits a clot of scar tissue weighed down on the right eye still bearded with a full head of long wavy hair but the strands were gray and drawn back in a ponytail that dangled over one beefy shoulder and the oncebarbered facial pelt was an unruly bramble as he attacked the fence his biceps bunched and his chest swelled big slablike muscles but slackened drained of bulk like goatskins emptied of wine give that to me said milo teague ceased punching stared at the lock panted tried once more to fit the key into the hole his knuckles were bloody and wild hairs pale and brittle as tungsten filament had come loose from the ponytail the shotgun lying in the dirt like a felled branch mightve made him feel younger sharper finally he succeeded in springing the lock ripped the chain free and flung it behind him it clattered in the dirt and he yanked the gate open holding his hands out defensively letting us know he didnt want to be comforted inside he said hooking a thumb at his house fuck if im going to let any of these bastards see it squinting at me he stared and i prepared myself for recognition but he turned his back on both of us and began marching toward his front door we walked along with him milo said by the bastards you mean the neighbors teague grunted neighbor troubles asked milo why do you think i came out carrying if the assholes were human theyd be neighbors theyre fucking animals couple of months ago they poisoned my rottweiler tossed in meat laced with antifreeze the damn dog got kidney failure and started shitting green since the summer weve had three drivebys all those shitty apartments crammed with low life fucking wetbacks cholos gangbangers im not prejudiced hired plenty of them in my day for the most part they worked their asses off but that scum over there his lower jaw shot out and beard hairs bristled im living in a war zone this used to be a decent neighborhood the shotgun was in reach milo got to it first emptied the weapon pocketed the shells teague laughed dont worry im not blowing anyones head off yet he stared at me again looked puzzled turned away yet said milo thats not too comforting sir its not my goddamn job to comfort you teague stopped placed his hands on his hips spit into the dirt resumed walking the shorts rode lower and strands of white pubic hair curled above his waistline i remembered the way hed dressed to showcase his body your job is to find the lowlife motherfucker who killed my daughter and bust his fuckin ass agreed said milo any suggestions in that regard teague halted again whatre you getting at any specific lowlife motherfucker in mind nah said teague im just talking logic howd they what did they do to her she was shot sir bastards nah i cant tell you a damn thing lauren never told me a damn thing wolfish grin see we didnt relate she thought i was a piece of shit and told me so whenever she had the opportunity we reached the house the door was still open reaching in teague switched on a light a bare bulb hung from the raw fir ceiling of a twelvebytwelve living room paneled in rough knotty pine red linoleum floors faded hooked rug brownandblackplaid sofa coffee table hosting a budweiser sixpack and five empties a green tweed lazboy faced a bigscreen tv illegal cable converter on top very little space to walk two openings along the rear wall one leading to a cramped kitchen the other exposing a chunky corridor with two doors to the right the smell of must and lager and salted nuts but no clutter the carpet was old but clean the linoleum rubbed dull different tax bracket teague said you can sit if you want im staying on my feet standing next to the recliner he folded his arms across his chest the scar tissue over his eye was the color of cheap margarine a hairline scar ran from the corner of the socket down to his jaw the right eye was filmy not inert but lazier than its mate milo and i remained standing teague looked us over tilting his head so his left eye caught a full view of my face do i know you alex delaware lauren was my patient the shrink his jaw shoveled oh fuck what are you doing here milo said dr delawares a police consultant in the case of your one of the hallway doors opened and a womans voice called out lyle everything okay go back inside teague barked the door shut quietly consultant what the hell does that mean youre saying you know something about lauren shes been seeing you again no i said lauren went missing and your exwife called me because shed heard i had police contacts police contacts teague grabbed the bottom of his beard twisted let go to milo what is this bullshit just what the doctor said now id like to ask you missing said teague for how long several days from where her apartment wheres that she never told me where she was bunking down hauser street in la she used to live all over said teague the streets after she ran away she got wild which any idiot could see coming where on the streets sir hell if i know jane used to call me up to go looking for her i could never find her hauser that where it happened she was found on the westside said milo back of a furniture store on sepulveda someone shot her and left her body in an alley spitting out the details matteroffact watching teagues reaction teague said west la we used to live there over near rancho park he began to draw himself up gave up and slumped this is shit my life cant be this fucked up the door opened again and the hallway light went on a woman stepped out wearing a long blue dodgers tshirt and nothing else seeing us she threw a protective hand over her belly ducked back inside reappeared seconds later wearing acidwashed jeans under the same shirt lyle something the matter i said go inside the woman stared at us whats going on bleary eyes faint southern inflection a good deal younger than teague maybe thirty with long limp brown hair grainy skin wide hips dimpled knees full face distorted by confusion wellproportioned but forgettable features as a child shed probably been adorable lyle teague swiveled fast and faced her theyre the goddamn police lauren got herself murdered tonight the womans hand slapped over her mouth oh my god omigod go back to bed omigod milo extended his hand detective sturgis maam the woman blubbered shivered hugged herself took the hand tish tish teague patricia corrected her husband keep it down dont wake up the kids the kids said tish teague dully you dont need

she was this nineteenyearold piece of ass drove one of the roach coaches now we got two kids how old are your children said milo six and four girls boys two girls when you called and said something

jane wasnt gonna be honest with you she was just conning you pal one big happy family thats why i ended it we were wasting your time and my money load of bullshit hands on hips again his good eye bore into mine my silence made his neck tendons fan whys he have to be here he demanded of milo i want to solve your daughters murder dr delawares been helpful to us on a lot of cases if its a big deal i

thrown in jail with no money on her called me to make her bail no hide or hair of her for years and she calls me then nothing for a couple of years till that christmas and all of a sudden shes a big shot and im shit making no mention of the arrest as one of gretchen stengels girls the westside madams name had hit the news bigtime but none of her call girls had been exposed nor had the clients milo scrawled in his pad so there was another contact before the christmas visit i wasnt counting phone calls said teague any other calls nope did you send her bail money no way i said forget it you made your own bed now sleep in it she cussed me out and hung up teague snorted she tried to bullshit me told me the whole thing had been a mistake shed been working at one of the casinos escorting rich guys nothing illegal the cops had overreacted she said she just got caught with no cash on her all she needed to do was get home to her credit cards shed fix it if id float her the dough credit cards letting me know she was living the high life and here i was stuck recuperating you were sick said milo teague touched the scar clump i used to have my own electrical business was doing a job out in calabasas someone fucked up i ended up duking it out with a mass of rebar i was in a coma for a week had double vision for months i still get headaches glancing at the beer cans i sued tied myself up for years the lawyers took most of it then she tells me shes pregnant cocking his head toward the bedroom i was on painkillers halfway groggy most of the time and lauren calling out of nowhere whining about the police overreacting defiance spiked his voice even in death lauren pushed his buttons howd she make her bail said milo how should i know teague shook his head picked something out of his beard i couldve thrown her out the first christmas but i wanted to be decent she might notve considered herself my daughter but i was too mature to let that get to me she said she didnt consider herself your daughter teague laughed thats just one of the things she unloaded on me big truckload of shit and i just sat there being cool thats the way i always was with her when she was a kid shed open up a big mouth and id just shine her on long silence teague said lauren and i we never she was always a handful from day one she always tried to make me feel like an idiot everything i said and did was insensitive and stupid he placed his palm over his heart lauren was sometimes therere people you just cant get along with no matter what the hell you do i was hoping maybe one day shed grow up understand maybe shed start being polite he shook his head moisture in his eyes for the first time least i got two others they love me those two no shit outta their mouths you really have no idea who did it not yet said milo why no why i was just thinking it couldnt be any big mystery look for a low life pal cause lauren chose a lowlife lifestyle fancy clothes and all last time she was here bragging about enrolling in college i had my doubts about what about her being a student i figured it was another one of her cons to me she lied since she got out of diapers whether you saw it or not thats the truth when she was four five years old shed point to red tell you it was blue just about convince you to me she didnt look like a student never seen a student dress like that flash all that jewelry expensive stuff said milo to my eye but what the hell do i know i dont shop on rodeo her mother liked all that crap too used to lean hard on my checkbook i had a good business back then but who wants to blow it on that crap he pitched forward smiled she married an old guy my ex senile old bag of shit shes soaking him for his dough waiting for him to croak did you tell her about lauren yet just came from her place sir teagues smile died suspicion slitted his eyes she probably told you i was an asshole we didnt discuss you said milo only lauren and by the way lauren was enrolled at the u yeah well look where that got her teague sat back in the recliner the footrest shot out and he stretched his legs the soles of his feet were black and callused he breathed in let the air out beneath his rib cage his belly swelled i know you think im an asshole cause im not faking out that everything was cool between me and lauren but at least im honest okay so lauren was in school but that doesnt mean she wasnt still hanging around with low lifes you wont hear that from my ex shes living in a dreamworld lauren was some angel howd she take it hard said milo any contact between you and your ex same as lauren every so often she used to call throw it in my face when was the last time teague thought years ago his smile was reborn its not like shes gonna come visit the kids that pisses her off my having kids she and i tried real hard to have a bunch and all we could squeeze out was lauren clear to see it was her problem anyway check out laurens lifestyle thats my suggestion she was living the life riding high on the wave but it wasnt for free few things are said milo wrong said teague nothing is chapter a prince among men said milo i was driving east on ventura boulevard blackened storefronts bare sidewalks a breeze had kicked up and scraps of litter danced above the cement warm breeze unseasonal winter he hated her didnt he alex you consider him a suspect i said cant eliminate him am i the only one who picked up nuances of paranoia unhappy man i said lots of anger but he didnt try to softpedal doesnt that imply nothing to hide or hes trying to be clever pull some kind of stupid double bluff what a family the more i learn the sorrier i feel for lauren i knew what was taking place laurens corpse had begun as business as usual inanimate as the mountain of forms he was forced to fill out on every case enlarging her humanity brought out his empathy its happened to him on most of the cases weve worked together i said you didnt ask him where he was the night lauren was killed i dont know when she was killed waiting till the coroner gives me an estimate also there was no sense threatening him right off if nothing else slamdunks hell get a recontact maybe i can pay him a morning visit see what hes like when hes not beered up and the shotguns not within arms reach yeah that was fun wasnt it loose cannon like that having access to a doublebarrel just what the founding fathers had in mind wifey number two seemed quite the sheep think he slaps her around he dominates her i wonder if lyle and jane had violent stuff going on when they were hitched jane kept saying he was mean maybe something else lauren was exposed to that never came out when you treated her she complained about them but never mentioned violence but the treatment wasnt much two sessions he rubbed his face twentyfive years old and what did she have to show for it besides a nifty wardrobe people and their garbage some jobs you and ive got hey i said sure beats being rich and relaxed he laughed you wont catch me admitting this again but your gig just might be tougher than mine whys that i know what people are you try to change em as i turned onto laurel canyon he phoned the officer at laurens apartment found out andrew salander hadnt returned i said he works the night shift you up for the cloisters sure i said one of my favorite spots he laughed again yeah ill bet ever been to a gay bar you took me to one i said i dont remember that when years ago i said tiny little place over in studio city disco music serious drinking lots of guys who didnt look at all like you past universal city back of an auto body shop oh yeah he said the fender closed down a long time ago i actually took you there right after our first case together the handler murder the way i figured it some friendship rapport was developing and you were still nervous about what being gay youd already made the grand confession i didnt get overtly repulsed but you probably figured i needed more testing oh come on he said testing you for what tolerance could i really handle it why am i not remembering any of this advanced middle age i said i can describe the room precisely aluminum ceiling black walls donna summer on tape loop guys going off in pairs whoa he said then nothing a few miles later he said you werent overtly repulsed meaning meaning sure it threw me i grew up with sissies getting beat up on the school yard and fag as acceptable speech i never pounded on anyone but i never stepped in to stop it either when i started working my practice emphasized traumatized kids and homosexuality never came up much you were the first gay person id ever known socially you and rick are still the only gay people i know in depth and sometimes im not sure about you he smiled aluminum ceilings guys who didnt look like me huh so whod they look like more like andrew salander there you go he said i am the great individualist the cloisters was on hacienda just north of santa monica notched unobtrusively into the gray side wall of a twostory building it was nearly three am but unlike the postnuclear silence of the valley the streets here were alive lit by a steady stream of headlights sidewalk cafés still serving a garrulous clientele the pavement crowded with pedestrians mostly but not exclusively male west hollywood was one of the first la neighborhoods to earn itself a nightlife now people emerge for afterdark strolls in beverly hills melrose westwood one day los angeles may grow up and become a real city i found a parking space half a block up and we walked to the front door no bouncer on duty and we stepped right in id allowed myself the luxury of prediction and expected the place to be stone walls refectory windows gothic gloom it turned out to be offwhite plaster recessed lighting dimmed to softandeasy a mahoganyandblackgranite bar with a brass rail and beige suede stools a few booths along the opposite wall light classical music eased from unseen speakers and the conversation from the fifteen or so men inside was low and relaxed casually but welldressed men in their thirties and forties shrimp and meatball bar snacks toothpicks sporting colored cellophane frizz but for the fact that there were only men it couldve been an upscale lounge in any slick suburb andrew salander was easy to spot working alone behind the bar wiping down the granite refilling glasses attending gregariously to half a dozen patrons his dress duds were a pale blue buttondown shirt under a whiteandbluestriped apron we were right in his face when he noticed us first me then milo back to me back to milo one of the drinkers saw the scaredanimal heat in his eyes and turned toward us with hostile curiosity milo leaned on the bar and nodded at him and the man returned to his scotch mr sturgis said salander hi andy anyone to cover for you uh toms on break hold on ill get him salander ran through a rear door with a tall young man dressed in a similar shirt and apron holding a cigarette tom stubbed out his light and put on a smile and salander came around through dutch doors at the other end of the bar please tell me this isnt business he said to milo please milo eased him toward the door waited to say sorry until we were outside salander wept it cant be i cant believe it why would anyone hurt her i was hoping you might be able to help me with that andy i cant dr delaware already knows that i already told him everything i knew didnt i doctor i said is there anything else you might remember what you think i was holding back back when we thought lauren was coming back i can see your not wanting to violate her privacy but now thats true i was being discreet but theres still nothing else i can tell you lauren gave you no hint of where she was going said milo no it wasnt that weird her taking off i already told the doctor shed done it other times for a day or two yes this was a week i know but said salander i wish i could help those short trips said milo did you ever have any reason to think they were for anything other than rest and relaxation what do you mean did lauren ever mention another reason for traveling no why okay andy lets backtrack to the last time you saw her last sunday a week ago said salander i didnt sleep well got up around noon and lo was in the kitchen how was she dressed slacks silk blouse casual elegant as always she rarely wore jeans did you guys talk not much just small talk we had a light lunch before she left eggs and toast i can eat breakfast any time of day she left shortly after id say one onethirty but she didnt say where i assumed the u her research job thats what i figured on a sunday shed worked other sundays detective sturgis but this time she didnt take her car how would i know that unless i followed her downstairs and you didnt no of course not when did you notice shed left the car when i went to get my own car which was said milo later that evening when i left for work around seventhirty and what did you think when you saw laurens car i didnt didnt think much one way or the other was that typical andy lauren not taking her car not really i just it wasnt on my mind i cant say i even consciously noticed it when i got home she wasnt there but that wasnt unusual either she was often gone by morning we were on different biorhythms sometimes days would pass before we bumped into each other i started to get a little concerned by wednesday or so but you know she was an adult i figured she had a reason for doing the things she did was i wrong about her having reasons about not doing something sooner i mean what could i have done milo didnt reply salander said i just wish i feel sick this is unbelievable back to sunday andy what did you do after lauren left um tried to go back to sleep couldnt got up and went shopping over at the beverly center i thought id buy some shirts but i didnt find anything so i saw a movie happy texas hilarious have you seen it milo shook his head salander said you should see it really funny whatd you do after shopping came back had some dinner got dressed for work came here the next day i slept late till three why are you asking me all this you cant seriously think routine questions said milo thats so tv said salander so jack webb trying to smile but his face had lost tone as if someone had yanked out the bones okay andy said milo there are police officers at your apartment its going to be disruptive for a while legally i dont need your permission to search but id like to know that i have your cooperation sure of course you mean my room too if the search does carry over to your room would you have a problem with that salander kicked one shoe with the other i mean i wouldnt want my stuff trashed or anything ill do it myself andy make sure everything gets put back in place sure but can i ask why mr sturgis what does my room have to do with anything i need to be thorough salanders narrow shoulders rose and fell i guess why not i have nothing to hide nothings ever going to be the same is it can i go back to work now when do you get off shift four then i clean up the officers may still be there when you arrive you are planning to come home where else would i go at least for now for now i dont know if i can afford the place by myself oh god this is just so nauseating did she suffer i dont have the forensic details yet who would do this said salander what kind of twisted mind oh mr sturgis i feel as if everythings unraveling milo said yeah its rough he looked out at the traffic on santa monica eyes unreadable then a glance at me i said andrew that lunch lauren had with her mother when she said she didnt want to be controlled do you have any idea what she meant no and even when she was upset at mrs a she said she knew her mother loved her what about her father did he ever come up no she never talked about him refused to just clammed up the first time i brought him up so i never did that again it was pretty obvious she had no use for him but she never said why headshake there are so many reasons though arent there he said so many men who screw up fatherhood so i said you have no idea what the control issue was i just thought it was one of those family tension things you know i mean its not as if she told me about any big festering jerry springer thing salander rubbed the back of his head against the wall this is horrible i hate this hate what andy talking about lauren in the past tense thinking about her suffering can i get back to work the show must go on said milo salander froze that was unkind mr sturgis i cared about her i really did we cared for each other loved to hang out together but we didnt she didnt confide in me can i help it if she didnt confide what i told the doctor about that lunch is all that i remember she came back and looked miffed didnt want to talk about it and i tried to get her to open up but she really didnt what did she say as closely as you can remember i said something to the effect that shed come this far on her own and wouldnt be controlled thats it come to think about it she might not have even said controlled by mrs a specifically i just assumed thats who she was talking about because it was mrs a shed just had lunch with he sidestepped closer to the cloisters front door lets get back to that research job said milo what else do you know about it something to do with psychology or maybe im assuming that too im so shook up i dont even know what i know when did the job start salander thought soon after the quarter started so maybe two three months ago or maybe even before the quarter i cant swear to anything was it a fivedayaweek job said milo no it was irregular sometimes shed work every day of the week then shed have days off but i really wasnt paying attention to her schedule half the time she was up and around i was sleeping what else did she tell you about the job just that she enjoyed it nothing else nope did she mention who she worked for what the project was no just that she enjoyed it im sure you can find out at the u thats the problem andy said milo we cant seem to find any trace of her working at the u salanders mouth dropped open how can that be im sure its some mistake she definitely told me it was on campus that i do remember well said milo why would she make up something like that good question andy my you think the job had something to do with im not saying anything andy but when people dont tell the truth oh lauren said salander he put his back to the wall of the building cupped his hand over his eyes oh my what is it said milo im all alone now during the drive to hauser and sixth milo ran salanders name through the files one traffic ticket last year no wants or warrants no criminal record milo closed his eyes and i realized how numb i felt deadened and tired and marginal we cruised the rest of the way in silence gliding through city streets stripped of light and humanity two squad cars and a crimescene van were parked outside laurens building a uniform guarded the entrance another was stationed upstairs someone had opened the door to apartment inside the living room a young black woman kneeled and dusted and scraped loretta said milo morning milo yeah guess it is anything lots of prints as usual so far no blood and the only semens on the roommates sheets nothing looks disturbed the roommate said milo did both bedrooms said the tech was that okay perfect nothings perfect said loretta not even me we entered salanders room first midnight blue velvet walls and shabbylooking tapestry drapes turned the stingy space gloomy a black iron queensized bed canopied by billows of what looked like cheesecloth took up most of the floor a fake persian rug left only a footwide border of scuffed board lining the ceiling were more of the gilded moldings id seen in the living room a small tv and vcr perched atop a pale blue bureau decoupaged with pink cabbage roses replicas of russian icons and filigreed crucifixes hung on the wall along with a whiteframed photo of salander and a stolidlooking couple in their fifties at the bottom of the frame someone had written in black marker mom and dad bloomington ind the olde country in the top drawer of the bureau milo found neatly folded clothing tissues and eyedrops a box of disposable contact lenses six packets of condoms and a passbook from washington mutual bank four hundred bucks he said flipping pages little andys highest balance for the year is fifteen hundred he ran through the book several times every two weeks he deposits nine hundred gotta be his takehome on the fifteenth he withdraws six hundred the rent spends around eight or so leaving a hundred or so in savings but it looks like he eventually spends that too tight budget i said he will have trouble making the rent by himself he frowned and replaced the bankbook giving him a legit reason to cut out youre worried about him i noticed you did ask him about time and place no specific reason to worry he said but no reason not to either hes the last person to see her alive and thats always interesting opening the closet door he ran his hands over pressed jeans and khakis two pairs of black slacks several blue buttondown shirts like the one salander wore at the bar a black leather jacket black oxfords brown loafers nikes and one pair of tan demiboots on the floor nothing on the top shelf plenty of empty space okay said milo on to the main event laurens room was larger than salanders by half bare oak floors walls painted the palest of yellows and a low narrow single bed with no headboard increased the feeling of space her dresser was a white threedrawer affair flanking it on each side were low teak bookcases with the slightly askew stance of selfassembly hardback books filled every shelf next to the bed was a matching teak desk with a builtin file drawer milo began there and it didnt take long to find what he was looking for smith barney brokerage account out of town seattle wanting things private i said thinking lauren had thrived on secrets kept everything segmented he turned pages ran his finger down columns she kept some loose cash in a money market the rest is in highyield mutual funds well well well look at this quite a different league from little andy shes put away three hundred forty thousand dollars and some change in a little over four years first deposit is a hundred grand four years ago december then fifty a year for the next three last one was three weeks ago nice and steady wonder where it came from i do great with tips he opened another drawer lets see if she keeps her tax returns here be interesting to know how she categorized her employment he found a paperclipped stack of visa gold receipts that he examined as i looked over his shoulder six months worth of records lauren had charged only a handful of purchases each month supermarkets and gas stations the campus bookstore at the u and bills from neimanmarcus and several designer boutiques that amounted to percent of her expenditures dressing for the job no motel or hotel charges that made sense if shed paid cash to avoid leaving a trail or if someone else had paid for her time and lodgings the bottom dresser drawer yielded another stapled sheaf here we go he said tucked in with the cashmere sweaters four years of short forms looks like she prepared them herself nothing before that everything started when she was twentyone he scanned the irs paper she called herself a selfemployed photographic model and student took deductions for car expenses books and clothing thats about it no student loans no medical writeoffs no mention of any research gig either every year for the past four she reported fifty thousand gross deducted it down to thirtyfour net fifty thousand a year coming in i said and she manages to invest every penny yeah cute isnt it he moved to the closet opened a door on a tightly stacked assortment of silk dresses and blouses pantsuits in a wide array of colors leather and suede jackets two fur coats one short and silver the other fulllength and black thirty or so pairs of shoes versace he said squinting at a label vestimenta dries van noten moschino arctic silver fox from neiman and this black thing is he peeled back the long coats lapel real mink from mouton on beverly drive hand me back those visa receipts the average is a grand or so a month on threads thats less than one of these suits so she had to be spending more had cash she didnt declare he closed the closet door okay add tax evasion to her hobby list over three hundred grand saved up by age twentyfive like momma said she took care of herself that first hundred plus the three fiftythousand deposits is two fifty i said whered the rest come from stock appreciation he returned to the brokerage papers trailed his finger to a bottom line yup ninety thou five hundred and two worth of longterm capital appreciation looks like our girl played the skin game and rode the bull market that would explain the lie about having a job at the u i said feeling a sad insistent gnawing in my gut when she was arrested in reno at nineteen she called her father for bail money claimed she was broke two years later she deposited a hundred thousand working hard he said the american way she didnt call mom because mom was poor that and she mightve cared enough about jane to keep secrets i took the brokerage packet from him stared at zeros the first hundred was probably money she saved up when she turned twentyone she decided to invest i wonder if it came from multiple clients or just a few high rollers what makes you wonder a longterm client could be the reason she didnt take her own car on sunday someone sent one for her interesting milo said when the sun comes up ill check with taxi companies and livery services gonna also have to canvass the neighborhood see if anyone saw her getting into a car if she was hooking up with some poohbah who wanted it hushhush he wouldnt have had her wait right in front of her apartment but maybe she didnt walk too far he whipped out his pad scrawled furiously something else i said being in a cash business wanting cash handy for expenditures she couldve been carrying a lot of money in her purse he looked up a highstakes mugging its possible isnt it i suppose in any event the money stink has now grown putrid he placed the tax returns atop the desk nothing but papers on the desk that made me wonder about something else wheres her computer i said who said she had one she was a student every college kid has a computer and lauren was an a student he gave the dresser drawers another shuffle found a pocket calculator grunted disgustedly returning to the closet he searched the corners and the shelves nada so maybe she was storing data someone wanted as in trick book as in a poohbah with a good reason to value his privacy trick database i said she was a modern girl he frowned ill ask salander if he ever saw a computer and i just thought of something else that should be here but isnt birth control no pills or diaphragm in her drawers no medical charges on her visa either so she either paid her doctor in cash or used the student health service call girls get checked up regularly he said highpriced entertainment would have to be especially careful she had to be using some kind of protection alex let me check the bathroom again why dont you take a look at her books meanwhile see if anything pops out starting at the top of the lefthand case i traced two and a half years of required reading basic math algebra geometry basic science biology chemistry economics political science history the type of fiction favored by english professors sections underlined in pink marker used stickers from the bookstore at santa monica college the neighboring case was all sociology and psychology dogeared textbooks and collections of journals stored in transparent plastic boxes the volumes on the top shelf matched laurens classes last quarter more pink underlining used stickers from the u bookstore the charges id just seen on her visa fifty grand a year but she watched her pennies turning to the journals i opened the first plastic box and found a collection of thirtyyearold issues of developmental psychology each bearing the faded stamp of a salvation army thrift shop on western avenue and a tencent price tag no receipt no date of sale the rest of the magazines were of similar vintage and origin american cancer society thrift hadassah city of hope in a copy of maslows toward a psychology of being i found a goodwill receipt dated six years ago a few scraps from the same time span turned up in other volumes six years ago lauren had begun her selfeducation at nineteen nearly four years before shed enrolled in junior college intellectually curious ambitious straight as none of that had stopped her from selling her body for a living then again why should it knowledge can be power in all kinds of ways i took a closer look at the material lauren had acquired before shed gone back to school most of it centered on human relations and personality theory no underlined sections back then shed approached her books with the awe of a novice i shook each volume found no loose papers back to the required texts on the top shelf nothing illuminating or profound in the pink passages just another student hypothesizing about what might appear on the final exam i was just about to quit when something in the margin of her learning theory book caught my eye a neatly printed legend that matched the lettering id seen on her school papers intim proj dr d that flipped a switch the human intimacy study that had run in the cub three weeks before shawna yeagers disappearance disconnected orange county number the newport beach pizza parlor same area code but this number was different there was no evidence shawna had even seen the ad let alone checked it out but she had been a psychobiology major living off savings intim proj right up laurens alley what she considered a research job but lauren hadnt needed the money maybe shed been greedy or something else had attracted her to the ad something personal as gene dalby had suggested intimacy a beautiful young woman who faked intimacy for cash dr d as in dalby no gene claimed to barely remember her and i had no reason to doubt him and his research was on politics not intimacy another of her teachers names began with a d de maartens the psychology of perception lots of ds who was i kidding i knew whose initial shed jotted you were a great influence on her doctor the last time id seen her shed paid for the privilege of unloading her anger not unlike the pattern shed adopted with her father years later shed thought of me made the notation intimacy wanting something from me never building up the courage to ask i thought of that last angry meeting lauren flashing the wad of bills unleashing the acid of recrimination id always felt shed been after more than that but what had been her goal when shed picked up the phone and dialed my service what had i not given her chapter milo came back shaking his head nothing maybe she kept her pills in her purse i said heres something showed him the inscription told him about the ad that had run before shawna yeagers disappearance ads probably run all the time not really i said from what i saw they tend to come and go did you find any ads before lauren went missing no but she couldve seen it elsewhere it sounded feeble and both of us knew it he was enough of a friend not to dismiss me but his silence was eloquent i know i said two girls a year apart no striking links but maybe there were other girls in between blondes disappearing on the westside id know if there were at this point im not eliminating anything but ive got a full plate right now get hold of laurens phone records find out if she had a computer look for possible witnesses to a pickup maybe find some known associates too theres got to be someone other than salander and her mom who knew her if all that deadends ill take a closer look at shawna he returned the textbook to me dr d youre sure thats you theoretically it could be one of her professors gene dalby or another one named de maartens neither of them remembers her big lecture classes well he said i cant exactly interrogate them because of this hell if it means anything at all the main things still the money her job and the way she was killed cold professional the body left out there maybe as a warning smacks to me of her getting in someones way thats why im not jumping on the yeager girls case leo riley felt that one was sexual if lauren deposited fifty a year who knows how much she was taking in and that makes me wonder if some of her income came from supplemental sources like blackmail who better than a call girl to hoard nasty secrets and try to profit from them that would also be reason to make off with her computer precisimoso big bucks at stake college profs dont exactly fit the bill some college profs are independently wealthy actually gene dalby is you keep mentioning him something about him bug you not at all i said old classmate tried to be helpful okay then onward so we just let the intimacy project lie this might be a current number he took the book back produced his cell phone muttered probably gonna get ear cancer and punched in the number nothing in his eyes told me hed connected but as he listened he groped in his pocket for his pad wrote something down hung up motivational associates of newport beach he said friendly female voice our hours are ten am to blah blah blah sounds like one of those marketing outfits intimacy and marketing i said why not intimacy sells product lauren sure wouldve known that so this was a moonlight for her she liked money took another parttime gig make sense perfect sense look he said feel free to follow up on it call the other professor too de whateverhisnameis something bugs you let me know right now what bugs me is no computer i need a ride back to the station to pick up my car see if any messages came in then im packing it in you up for chauffeur duty or should i lean on one of the boys in blue ill drive you i said what a guy he said airily as he strode out of the room as we left the apartment he said im really sorry the way this turned out nine oclock the next morning i phoned dr simon de maartens at home and he picked up sounding distracted when i introduced myself his voice chilled i already returned your call thanks for that but there are still a few questions questions he said i told you i dont remember the girl so you have no memory of her talking to you about doing some research research of course not she was an undergrad only grad students are permitted into my lab now the perception course lauren took from you i said did the class subdivide into smaller discussion groups yes yes thats typical would it be possible to get a list of the students in laurens section no he said it would not be possible you claim to be faculty and you are asking for something like that that is appalling what is your involvement in all this i knew lauren her mothers going through hell and she asked me to be involved well im sorry about that but its a confidentiality issue being enrolled in a study section is confidential i said not the last time i checked the apa ethics code everything about academic freedom is confidential dr delaware fine i said thanks for your time the police will probably be getting in touch with you then i will tell them exactly the same thing click something bugs you let me know i called milo no answers at home in the car or at his desk i told his voice mail de maartens was not helpful he bears attention a live woman answered at motivational associates of newport beach informing me in a boredtodeath singsong that the office was closed is this the answering service yes sir when does the office open theyre in and out is there another office yes sir where la do you have the number one moment i have to take another call she put me on hold long enough for me to wonder if the line had gone dead finally she came back on with a phone number i called it and got her partner in ennui the office is closed when will it be open i dont know sir this is the service whats the offices address please one moment i have to take another call i hung up and looked it up in the phone book the twelve thousand block of wilshire boulevard put motivational associates la branch in brentwood just east of santa monica a couple of miles from the u and even closer to the sepulveda alley where laurens body had been found but no sense dropping by and confronting a bolted door i booted up the computer and plugged in motivational associates three hits the first a fouryearold article from the chicago tribune about a south side shelter for battered women and the services it offered residential care medical consultation individual counseling group therapy provided by motivational associates a private consulting group that offers pro bono services particularly in the area of human relations the gist of the article was humaninterest coverage of several abused women whod gained emotional strength and the firms participation earned no further mention the second reference was a shortened version of the trib piece picked up by the wire services and distributed nationally number three was an eastern psychological association abstract of a paper presented two years ago at a regional convention in cambridge buffington sandra lindquist monique and dugger b j the multidimensional assessment of intimacy factor analysis of the personal space grid index psgi and selfreport measures of locus of control trait anxiety personal attractiveness selfconcept and extroversion so much for racy research the authors affiliations were university of chicago for buffington and lindquist and motivational associates inc for b j dugger dr d i pulled out my american psychological association directory and looked up dugger betting on a woman barbara jean barbara jo benjamin john not the day for me to play the ponies duggers birth date made him thirtyseven hed earned a ba in psychology from clark university in worcester massachusetts at the age of twentyone and a phd in social psychology from the u of chicago ten years later postdoctoral fellowship at uc san diego then a twoyear lapse until his first and only job director motivational associates of newport beach california areas of specialty quantitative measurement of social distance and applied motivational research the address hed listed was on balboa boulevard in newport and the number was the id just called not a clinician so no need for a state license that made checking with the board of psychology for disciplinary actions a waste of time i called anyway zero i tried a pocketful of area codes for residential listings for dr benjamin j dugger nothing scanning his name on the internet pulled up only the same abstract of the cambridge paper which i reread jargon and numbers and highpowered statistics the arcane nutrients of tenure nothing remotely sexy still it had been duggers number listed in laurens book and as much as i disliked de maartens that made dugger the prime candidate for dr d and hed been running his ad during the time shawna yeager disappeared milo was probably right about there being no link between the cases but still i thought about it some more duggers bio was about as provocative as the owners manual for a plow weaker than weak i reread the bio and something shot out at me two time lapses ten years between his bachelors degree and his doctorate another two between finishing school and taking his first job nice first job most new phds enter the job market burdened by debt and are forced to accept temporary lectureships and entrylevel slots benjamin j dugger had disappeared for two years only to return in an executive position offices in newport beach and brentwood a company sufficiently capitalized to offer free services and what did personalspace research have to do with battered women it added up to money some college profs are independently wealthy simon de maartenss hostility made me wonder about his financial situation time to learn more about both dr ds the ovid files at the us research library spit out fortyfive publications for de maartens all on the psychophysics of vision in primates he was thirtythree and there were no lapses in his professional life ba at twenty from leiden university in the netherlands oxford doctorate in experimental psychology at twentyfive twoyear postdoc at harvard where he served a threeyear lectureship then assistant professorship at the u and fasttrack promotion two years later to associate the usual society memberships and more than a handful of academic honors including a grant and a service award from the braille institute perhaps his chimp research offered human possibilities benjamin j dugger had been less prolific five articles none more recent than two years ago all in the same dry vein the last three had been coauthored with barbara buffington and monique lindquist the first two had been solos summaries of duggers firstyear graduate research study and dissertation measuring personal space in hooded rats subjected to varying degrees of social deprivation the dates allowed me to fix his graduate studies as beginning four years prior to receiving his phd that still left a sixyear question mark between clark university and chicago having nowhere else to go i phoned both institutions and verified his degrees with the alumni associations so far nothing suspicious why should there be i was groping thinking about laurens body tumbling out of the dumpster i called chicago again and asked for professor buffington or lindquist the former was on sabbatical in hawaii but a woman answered lindquists extension with a high bright this is monique professor this is mr lew holmes from western news service weve come across an article about some work you and your colleagues did on personal space and were wondering if one of you could talk to us about a piece were putting together on dating in the nineties i dont think so she said laughing that research was pretty esoteric lots of math nothing about dating whered you come across it it came up on our database i said so you dont think you can help i think if you wrote about our research your readers would fall asleep oh too bad sorry for bothering you and i guess i wont follow up on professor dugger professor oh ben no i doubt he could help you either double toobad i said were a californiabased news service and our clients are always looking for local sources to quote with professor dugger being out here it wouldve worked out great i dont want to speak for ben but i doubt he could illuminate you either well let me ask you this professor are you doing any other research that might be of interest to our clients no sorry but im sure youll have no trouble finding someone wanting the attention especially out in california bye what about professor dugger would he be doing anything else that might be interesting as in sex is that what youre getting at well i said you know how it is i sure do in terms of ben duggers recent work i have no idea what hes been up to its been a while since we worked together matteroffact no rancor maybe ill give him a shot i said ive got him in newport beach and brentwood i read off the addresses this firm hes got motivational associates what are they into advertising market research she laughed again something funny professor youre out for the sex angle like every other reporter if thats what you want from ben dugger dont count on it whys that professor thats all i have to say bye now some kind of hangup said milo sounds more like hes a prude theres something there i said she didnt imply anything nasty no i admitted she was lighthearted like it was some kind of injoke so maybe the guys a catholic priest or something that wasnt in his bio he grunted over the phone it was nearly noon hed taken two hours to return my call andrew salander had verified that lauren had owned a toshiba laptop after that milod been tied up at the morgue watching laurens autopsy the coroner had found no evidence of sexual assault of any recent intercourse no illness surgery scarring or drug use the preliminary finding was that the first bullet fired into laurens brain stem a mm had shut off her life functions nearly instantly until that second a healthy girl so she probably didnt suffer he said i called her mom and told her she definitely didnt woman sounds as if shes been hollowed out and left to dry so de maartens is an uppity putz and dugger doesnt like to talk about sex dugger may also have money i gave him the logic on that if i had to choose id say press the dutch guy cause he got hostile if youre up to that fine if i show up at his door hell slam it i told him the police would probably be stopping by promises promises ill try to get to it eventually so far no record of any cab or limo making a pickup in the vicinity of laurens apartment her broker in seattle knows her only as a voice over the phone she coldcalled him a few years ago said she had money to invest which is a switch usually its the salesmen who call so needless to say he didnt argue he said lauren did her homework about the market knew what she wanted but was willing to listen to advice overall impression smart he was surprised to learn she was only twentyfive figured her for a good ten years older what did he say she wanted bluechip funds and she was patient enough to hold he figured her for a highincome lawyer or some other executive type i put two uniforms on the doortodoor a couple of people think they remember her vaguely from the neighborhood jogging driving around in her convertible but no one saw her getting picked up not the day she disappeared or any other time i got hold of six months worth of phone records she actually used the horn very little talked to her mom every couple of weeks the last call was two days before she disappeared nothing to lyle no surprise the only things that did look interesting were five calls over the last two months to the same number in malibu turns out to be a pay phone in point dume lauren told salander she went to malibu for rest and recreation is the phone near a motel no shopping center at kanandume road have you found any cell phone account for her or an answering service not so far dont you find that surprising if she was making dates pause a bit unless i said she didnt need a service because she wasnt casting her net had one client who paid all the bills maybe someone who lives in malibu doesnt want wifeypoo to hear laurens call so he uses the pay phone fifty grand plus from one john one helluva habit lots of passion i said when those kinds of things go bad they go very bad ill drive there today see what kinds of shops are nearby maybe someone noticed something maybe ill drop in on de maartens on the way back wheres he live dont know but his numbers a ill get it thanks for all the work alex however useless hey he said you can never tell whatll pan out lying through his teeth what else are friends for just after one pm i got in the seville and drove to motivational associates brentwood office the building was one of a group of towers that had sprouted on wilshire during one of the booms four stories for parking eight for offices zebrastriped walls of white aluminum and black glass the packing carton a serious building came in i walked past an empty guard desk to the directory no pattern to the tenant mix computer consultants insurance agents lawyers an occupational therapy brokerage a few psychotherapists motivational associates was suite a third of the way down a graywalled plumcarpeted hallway black doors with tiny chrome signage duggers was set between ewisdom and the law offices of norman and rebbirque no mail at or under the door and when i peeked through the slot i saw an unlit waiting room still no pile of letters either someone had collected or the post went to another location i didnt knock the last thing i wanted was to have to explain myself id returned to the elevator was waiting for it to ascend from the lobby when the door to swung open and a man came out carrying a scuffed brown leather briefcase locking the dead bolt he made his way in my direction swinging his keys thirtyfive to forty fiveten one sixty dark hair trimmed close to the sides thinning on top freckled bald spot at the crown he wore a shapeless oatmeal herringbone sport coat with brownleather elbow patches an opennecked white buttondown shirt with blue stripes faded beige cords that wouldve suited milo had they been five waist sizes larger and brown loafers with toes worn to gray gristle a wadded selection from the mornings times was stuffed into a pocket of the jacket weighing the garment down on one side and making him appear lopsided three black plastic pens were clipped to his handkerchief pocket tortoiseshell eyeglasses dangled from a chain around his neck he arrived at the lift just as the door opened waited for me to step in then followed and stood near the door placing the briefcase on the floor he punched in p and said how about you in a pleasant voice straight nose straight mouth smallish ears firm chin nothing out of proportion but something a blurring of contours kept it just shy of handsome the lapel of his sport coat was fuzzed where it met his shirt two white threads had come loose from his shirt collar i said same thanks he turned offering a view of his bald spot i noticed a worn gold monogram above the clasp of the case bjd as we descended he began whistling and his hands grew active fingers drumming tapping stretching curling a shaving nick bottomed his right earlobe another cut flecked his jawline he gave off the smell of soap and water he stopped whistling said sorry no problem they used to play muzak someone mustve complained people tend to do that they do indeed no further exchange until we reached p and i hung back as he stepped out into the parking area as he headed briskly toward a nearby aisle i was watching from behind a concrete pillar his car was a white volvo sedan plainwrap model several years old no alarm click and hed left the door unlocked tossing the briefcase across the seat he slid in started up backed out blowing chalky smoke i ran up the three flights to the lobby was heading for the seville when i saw him pull onto wilshire going west toward the beach malibu he was ten blocks ahead of me and it took several traffic violations for me to catch up i stayed two car lengths behind in the neighboring lane and tried to watch him he kept both hands on the wheel his lips were moving and his head was bobbing either a handsoff cell phone or singing to himself my guess was the latter he looked utterly at peace he drove to longs drugstore in santa monica stayed inside for ten minutes emerged with a big bag of something got back on wilshire and drove to broadway and seventh where he pulled up in front of a narrow whiteclapboard victorian once a threestory house now the pacific faith apostolic church one of the few old ones that had survived the northridge quake the white boards were freshly painted and a crisp picket fence boxed off the churchs yard sandboxes and swings and slides and monkey bars three dozen munchkins mostly brownskinned and darkhaired scooted and jumped and shouted and squatted in the sand three young women wearing braided hair and long pale dresses watched from the sidelines a rainbowlettered banner across the fence announced faith preschool spring registration still open dr benjamin dugger parked at the curb walked through the picket gate and entered the church if he was burdened with sin the bounce in his stride didnt say so he remained inside for fifteen minutes emerged minus the bag from the drugstore back to wilshire his next stop was a fishandchips place near fourteenth street where he came out with another bag smaller and greasespotted lunch was enjoyed on a bench at christine reed park behind the tennis courts where i watched from the seville as he shoved french fries and something breaded into his mouth drank from a can of coke and shared leftovers with the pigeons a quarter of an hour later he was back on wilshire heading east this time staying in one lane sticking to the speed limit he entered westwood village parked in a pay lot on gayley and entered a multiplex theater two comedies a spy thriller a historical romance showtimes said hed chosen either one of the comedies or the romance what a sinister fellow i drove home at three deciding i should stick to what i knew i phoned the abbot house the robot voice answered and feeling grateful when neither janes nor mels broke in i hung up at milo called the pay phones in a gas station nearby are a gym an insurance agency and a café no one remembers lauren the owner of the station doesnt recall any frequent callers its a busy place lots of traffic for him to notice someone they wouldve had to set up office in the booth i also dropped in on a bunch of motels and showed laurens picture around zero im back at my desk figured id check out snippy professor de maartens who as it turns out lives in venice want to tag along i debated whether to tell him id followed benjamin dugger by now the tail seemed ludicrous no reason to share sure i said the charm of my company just the opposite you pissed him off once maybe that can be harnessed chapter simon de maartens lived on third street north of rose the beach was a short walk west crossing rose brought you into gang territory the block was filled with tiny houses some divided intermittent bright spots fresh paint brandnew skylights flower beds staked saplings said gentrification had arrived de maartenss abode was a brownstucco sidebyside duplex with a gray lawn curling tarpaper roof and flaking woodwork the blue vw van in its driveway was patched and primered its rear bumper sagged and so did the independent wealth hypothesis doesnt look as if hes been seduced by externals said milo life of the mind and all that could be i realized the same could be said of benjamin dugger newport and brentwood offices but a frayed lapel not exactly the high rollers id conjured when imagining lauren spirited away to some casbah he switched off the engine how about i do the talking and work you in as needed sounds good to me we were halfway to de maartenss front door when loud barking came from the brown house and a big yellow face parted the curtains of the front window some kind of retriever steady barking but no enmity announcing our presence without passing judgment the door began opening before we got there and a young redhaired woman smiled out at us she was tall and solidly built wore a black tshirt and green drawstring pants held a paintbrush in one hand wet blue bristles her hair was the color of fresh rust cut in a pageboy that hung to midneck the bangs perfectly straight above inquisitive hazel eyes the pants were baggy but the shirt was tight accentuating a soft friendly bosom and generous shoulders nice coating of flesh everywhere except for her hands which were slim and white with tendril fingers the smell of turpentine blew through the doorway along with classical music something with woodwinds no sign of the yellow dog the woman had stopped smiling police maam said milo flashing the badge are you mrs de maartens anika pronouncing her name as if it were required for border crossing i thought you were ups thought came out taut her accent was thicker than her husbands harder around the edges or maybe that was anxiety who likes the police on a sunny afternoon expecting a delivery i im supposed to get art supplies from back home was there a crime somewhere on the block no everythings fine wheres back home holland why are you here nothing to worry about maam we just wanted to talk to professor de maartens is he in you want to talk to simon about what a student of his a student its better if we talk to the professor directly mrs de maartens is he in yes yes i go get him hold on she left the door open and headed toward the music a big buttercolored form materialized heavy jowls small bright eyes short coat droopy ears retriever mix a splash of mastiff somewhere in the bloodline the dog regarded us for a second then followed anika de maartens returned moments later with a man in tow man and beast walking in synchrony the masters hand resting lightly on the animals neck im simon what is it de maartens was six feet tall and heavyset with a whiskeycolored crew cut and a ruddy bulbnosed thicklipped face as close to spherical as id seen on a human despite his clothing gray sweatshirt blue cutoffs rubber beach sandals he looked like a rembrandt burgher and i halfexpected him to whip out a clay pipe detective sturgis said milo extending a hand de maartens looked past it kept coming toward us yes the sound of his voice made the dogs ears perk milo began repeating his name i heard you said de maartens im not deaf smiling as he and the dog stopped at the threshold his head turned from side to side and he stared blankly settling on the space between milo and me thats when i saw his eyes black crescents set in bluish sockets so deep they appeared to have been scooped out of his flesh immobile crescents the merest sliver of black showing through dull black no gleam of pupil a blind man the psychophysics of vision in primates the braille institute award he said this is about the girl lauren yes sir some of my students i do know said de maartens the ones who ask questions visit during office hours voices that recur he touched his ear the dog looked up at him adoringly lauren teague was not one of them she got an a in the class a very high a so perhaps she did not need to ask questions i can produce her exams when i return to my office next week but right now i am on vacation and i do not see why i need to be bothered what can you hope to learn from two exams so theres nothing you can tell us about ms teague de maartenss thick shoulders rose and fell he canted his face toward me smiled is that you dr delaware nice aftershave after your second call when i grew cross i called the department to see what records they have on her just her grade transcripts all as i should not have grown cross but i was in the middle of something and i did not see the point i still do not he scratched behind the dogs ears aimed his eye sockets back at milo three times during the quarter the class was divided into discussion groups of approximately twenty students each supervised by teaching assistants the groups were optional nothing discussed was graded it was an attempt by the department to be more personal another smile i checked with my department chairman and he said it would be permissible to give you the names of the students in lauren teagues group her ta was malvina zorn you may call the psychology department and obtain malvinas number she has been instructed to give you the names of the students in the group the chairman and i have signed authorizations that should be all you need thank you professor you are welcome de maartens rocked back and forth then stopped what exactly happened to ms teague someone shot her said milo you can read it in the paper he flushed scarlet de maartens laughed uproariously and ruffled the dog perhaps vincent here can read it to me no i am sure my wife will give me every detail she devours everything she can about crime and misfortune because this city frightens her when we were back in the car i said so much for that milo said i dont see laurens academic life as the thing here anyway its the people she didnt talk about that im interested in ill phone the psych department though get those students names he made the call copied down a list of nine students that i inspected as we drove away three males six females everyone out for the quarter he mumbled as we drove away fun im your partner in futility i told him about following benjamin dugger he was kind enough not to laugh old volvo and delivering goodies to kids at the church huh yeah yeah i said throw in the pro bono thing at the shelter in chicago and hes mother teresa in tweed youre right guys like him arent what got lauren into trouble she lived in a whole other world speaking of which he said i thought id drop in on gretchen stengel shes out of prison paroled half a year ago found herself a new line of work whats that similar to her old gig but legal dressing the insecure the boutique was on robertson just south of beverly five doors north of a restaurantofthemoment where valets shuffled ferraris and alfresco diners laughed too loudly as they sucked bottled water and smog déjà view couture with a past eightfootwide storefront the window draped in black jersey and occupied by a single bald faceless chromium mannequin in a billowing scarlet gown a bell push was required for entry but milos bulk didnt stop whoever was in charge from buzzing us in inside the shops mirrored walls and black granite floor vibrated to david bowies young americans the bass tuned to migraine level nailed into the mirror were raw iron bolts from which garments dangled on chrome hangers velvet crepe leather silk wide color range nothing above a size a pair of orange deco revival chairs designed by a sadist filled a tight oblong of center space copies of vogue talk and buzz fanned across a trapezoid of glass posing as a table no counter no register seams in the rear wall were probably the dressing rooms to the right was a door marked private the fermentedcorn sweetness of good marijuana tinctured the air a dangerously thin girl in her twenties wearing a baby blue bodysuit and a rosewoodtinted peter pan do stood behind one of the orange chairs hips thrust forward eyes guarded white stilettoheeled sandals put her at eye level with milo pink eyes and dilated pupils no ashtray or roach so maybe shed swallowed the bodysuit was sheer and the undertones of her flesh beneath the fabric turned the blue pearly she seemed to have too many ribs and i found myself counting yes husky voice almost mannish i need something in a size four said milo for my thumb he stepped closer the girl recoiled and crossed her arms over her chest the music kept pounding and i looked for the speakers finally spotted them small white discs tucked into the corners out came milos badge rather than rattle the girl it seemed to calm her and the punch line is she said is gretchen stengel here the girl gave a languid wave dont see her milo reached out toward the iron rack and fondled a black pantsuit couture with a past huh the girl didnt move or speak he examined the label lagerfeld what kind of past does this one have it went to the oscars two years ago really did it win and make a speech thanking the little people the girl snorted so wheres gretchen if you leave your name ill tell her you were here gee thanks and you are stanwyck stanwyck what just stanwyck ah said milo he dropped the sleeve faced her did one of those moves that makes him taller than you think possible dont they require two names for booking the girls lips tightened into a little pink bud is there anything else i can help you with wheres gretchen at lunch late lunch guess so where stanwyck hesitated cmon stan said milo or ill tell ollie her eyes filmed with confusion i dont run her appointment schedule but you do know where she is i get paid to be here thats all stan stan milo sniffed the air conspicuously why make this complicated gretchen doesnt like attention well i can sure understand that but fame is like a dog with an unstable temperament you feed it think youve got it under control but sometimes it bites you anyway now where the hell is she up the block she named the trendoid eatery he turned to leave stanwyck said dont tell her i told you promise said milo yeah right said the girl and youve got a porsche and a house on the beach and wont come in my mouth we made our way past the valets up brick stairs and through a low picket gate to the front patio turning the heads of the seeandbeseen crowd lots of freefloating anxiety and ponytails on heads that didnt deserve them big white plates decorated with small green food some high fashion though quite a few people were dressed worse than milo but at much higher cost and everyone knew the difference the maître ds were two whitejacketed blacktshirted sticks both too busy to stop us but one of them did notice us enter the inner dining room at the rear the room was low and dark and cheapchic noisy as a power plant as we made our way among the tables i heard a man in a fivehundreddollar hawaiian shirt urging a waiter speak to me of the crab cakes gretchen stengel sat at a corner table opposite a sleek young woman with blueblack skin a blue liter of esoteric water stood between them the black woman picked at a salad and gretchen twirled a crayfish on a toothpick no problem recognizing the westside madam three years ago shed been evening news fodder for months and but for a few age lines she hadnt changed much sunken cheeks lemonsucking mouth stringy brown hair skinny upper body but broadbeamed below the waist an ungainly waddle as her lawyers hustled her to and from court brown eyes that claimed injury when they werent shielded by dark lenses today the glasses were in place oversized black ovals that blocked expression it would have been easy to ascribe her pallor to the twentyfive months shed spent behind bars for income tax evasion but shed been pale before then floppy hats kabukiwhite makeup and the omnipresent black glasses fed rumors that she hated the sun interesting choice if it was one for a girl growing up at the beach then again most daughters of pacific palisades corporate lawyers dont grow up to be pimps gretchen stengel had been raised on two acres overlooking the ocean attended the peabody school and summer camps designed to pamper vacationed at private villas in venice and châteaus in southern france flown the concorde a dozen times before entering puberty rocky puberty her arrest led to journalistic archaeology of the stengel family and discovery of childhood learning problems drug and dui busts and half a dozen abortions beginning when gretchen was fourteen at twenty she dropped out of arizona state having never declared a major unsubstantiated stories had her starring in a series of bottomfeeder porn loops featuring a variety of partners not all of them twolegged prior to her arrest none of her teenage problems had leaked out of sealed records nor had she been disciplined by the system mildrew and andrea stengel were senior partners at munchley zabella and cater a downtown firm with a wide reach after leaving college gretchen moved back home to a guesthouse at their estate attending openings of bad art and premieres of films that lost money hanging out with the sweating throng of eurotrash that filled sunset plaza cafés telling anyone who cared to listen that she was working on a screenplay had a deal pending at one of the big independent production companies at some point she discovered longhidden organizational skills and began mustering a small army of hookers girls with great bodies and fresh faces and the ability to operate a creditcard machine none was older than twentyfive some had been peabody school acquaintances others she spotted on sunset or the colony many had never sold sex before all were terrific at faking innocence the nerve center of the operation was gretchens free digs behind the parental swimming pool she called her employees agents and put them to work in the lounges and bars of hotels with beverly in their names clients paid for the room and the flesh the girls divvied up for clothing and cosmetics and birth control and gretchen financed quarterly medical checkups other than doctor bills phone and credit company charges her overhead was nil by the time she was twentyfive gretchen was pulling in seven figures a year and lopping off a zero when she filed with the irs what tripped her up was never made clear the rumor mill spat out the names of famous clients movie stars assorted film industry lampreys politicians developers supposedly gretchen had run afoul of the lapd but no john list ever materialized and gretchen sat mute during her indictment her trial was slated to be the next big media event then gretchens lawyer pled her to a single evasion charge and a moneylaundering misdemeanor and bargained her sentence to thirtytwo months in federal lockup plus restitution and penalties gretchen served solid but truncated time no interviews no wheedling seven months lopped off for good behavior now she was selling used clothes in a highrent closet that reeked of weed and hiring exemployees to stroke the customers it suggested an inability to learn from experience but maybe gretchen had learned something other than crime doesnt pay blaming her parents was easy but like most pat solutions that was just an excuse not to puzzle gretchens older brother had achieved honors as a flight surgeon for the navy and a younger sister ran a music school in harlem following gretchens arrest someone had suggested middlechild syndrome they might as well have indicted the lunar cycle mildrew and andrea stengel were highpowered lawyers but by all accounts attentive parents the week after gretchens conviction they resigned their partnerships and moved to galisteo new mexico purportedly to live the simple life milo and i walked up to the table gretchen had to have seen us but she ignored us and tweaked the tail of the crayfish edging the creature toward her mouth she changed her mind drew back her arm flicked the crustaceans tail as if daring it to resuscitate then back to her lips licking but not biting some weightloss behaviormod trick play with your calories but never ingest them nearby diners had begun to stare gretchen didnt react her companion lacked gretchens composure and started fidgeting with her salad scallops on something sawtoothed and weedlike she was young like gretchen with cropped hair felonious cheekbones and slanted eyes wore a sleeveless yellow sundress pink coral necklace and earrings long curving nails painted a lighter shade of coral all that color achingly dramatic against flawless black skin gretchens cuticles were a wreck she had on a shapeless black sweatshirt and black leggings her hair looked as if it hadnt been washed in a week the black lenses did their trick putting her somewhere else milo moved so he could smile down at the black woman nice dress does it have a past painful smile in response have a bug said gretchen waving the crayfish thats what they are bugs her voice was nasal and scratchy the black woman grimaced milo said thanks for the biology lesson ms stengel gretchen said actually theyre more like spiders to the black woman think spiders taste any good her lips barely moved when she spoke the black woman put her fork down and picked up her napkin what about flies and caterpillars said gretchen or slugs milo said lauren teague the black woman wiped her mouth gretchen stengel didnt budge milo said lauren its a name said gretchen the black woman said if youll excuse me please and started to rise please stay said milo i have to go to the little girls room she reached down for her purse milo had placed his foot over the strap please she said conversation at neighboring tables had died a waiter came over a glance from milo made him retreat but seconds later one of the whitejacketed maître ds arrived officer he said sidling up to milo and managing to spit out the word while smiling wider than his lips had been built for you are a police officer and here i thought i was being subtle please sir this isnt the place and time gretchen twirled the crayfish the black woman hung her head for what said milo sir said white jacket people are trying to enjoy their food this is a distraction milo spied a free chair at a neighboring table pulled it over sat down hows this for blending in really officer fuck it damien said gretchen leave him alone i know him damien stared at her youre sure gretch yeah yeah she waved the crayfish tell joel to make it spicier next time oh damiens acrobatic lips fluttered its too bland if youve got taste buds oh no ill bring you some extra sauce gretch no said gretchen that wont help too late it has to be cooked into the meat really gretch no damien damien simpered i am so sorry ill have a fresh batch prepared right now dont bother not hungry i feel terrible said damien dont said gretchen flicking the crayfishs tail just do better next time sure of course certainly to the black woman is yours okay perfect glum tone im going to the little girls room she stood six feet tall in flats sleek as a panther looking down at her purse she left it there edged past me disappeared damien said really gretch i can get you another plate in no time im fine said gretchen blowing a kiss at him go away when he departed she looked at me sit take ingrids chair shell be gone awhile bladder infection i tell her to drink cranberry juice but she hates it old friend said milo new friend lets talk about lauren teague someone shot her and dumped her in an alley gretchens flat expression maintained she put the crayfish down how terrible i thought she was too smart for that too smart for what going into business without me you think thats what killed her off came the sunglasses the brown eyes were piercing and focused childhood learning difficulties seemed remote and i wondered how many of the rumors about her were true so do you she said thats why youre here were you and she in touch gretchen shook her head after i retired i cut all ties to the staff how long has it been since you saw lauren gretchen tried to pry something from between her teeth stubby nails werent up to the task she removed the toothpick from a crayfish and began probing she resigned before i retired how long before maybe a year why said milo she never said you didnt ask why should i said gretchen it wasnt as if there was a personnel shortage any idea why she quit it couldve been anything you never discussed it nope she emailed me i emailed back she was into computers said milo gretchen laughed milo said whats funny thats like asking if she was into refrigerators she reskewered the crayfish any theories said milo about why she quit nope what else do you remember about lauren great body knew how to do makeup no need for surgery some clients dont like bionics think she mightve picked up a steady said milo anythings possible did you know shed gone back to school really said gretchen how selfimproving she folded her hands in her lap when she was working for you did she complain of problematic clients nope no problems at all she was good with people i was sorry to see her go did she have any particular specialties other than being gorgeous and smart and polite no kinks gretchen smiled kinks anything out of the ordinary gretchen laughed how could i even begin to answer that how about yes or no and if its yes some details gretchen sat back and crossed her legs her back was against the wall and she seemed to enjoy the support the truth is people are depressingly ordinary guys were willing to pay bigtime for ordinary guys were willing to pay to have it on their terms so lauren had no specialties shrug what about special clients guys who requested her specifically gretchen shook her head picked up a crayfish and stared at the crustacean look at those eyes its as if he knows knows what that hes dead milo said who requested lauren nothing comes to mind milo edged his chair closer to her from the way he talked into her ear and her sudden warm smile they mightve been lovers help me out here he said were talking murder i can help if you want to buy a dress she drew her head back and looked him up and down i dont think youd like our styles milo stayed close to her someone tied lauren up and shot her in the back of the head and left her like garbage in a dumpster give me a name anyone who had a thing for lauren gretchen touched his tie lifted it and kissed the tip nice syntho chez sears tarzhay what about girls she worked with friends on the staff far as i recall she went it alone what about michelle michelle said gretchen as in a brunette lauren stripped with they both did the party scene back when you were in business was that one of your subsidiaries uhuh i specialized in what networking the tools of commerce nuts into bolts said milo so lauren and michelle were freelancing on the side gretchen smiled again youre cute did you have a michelle on staff its a common name how about a last name gretchen placed her lips next to milos ears flicked his lobe with her tongue gave a soft dry laugh i have nothing to offer because im nothing a speck of lint in the navel of the least important creature in the universe and that makes me free youre anything but nothing said milo id say youre a presence you are so sweet said gretchen ill bet you treat the girls gently milos turn to smile so how about tossing me a bone off the record michelle what michelle ma belle sont les whatever gretchen began toying with the crayfish those eyes hes like let me sit on this plate dead and get all shriveled up but leave me intact i just dont want to be chewed up lauren didnt end up intact gretchen sighed they really should remove the eyes milo said so thats it nothing have a nice day said gretchen on the way out we met ingrid returning milo blocked her way lauren teague was murdered lavender lips parted oh then whos lauren an old friend of gretchens im a new friend i dont think so dear said milo i think you and ol gretch go way back

lauren ingrid shook her head milos hand closed around her arm we can discuss this in my office or you can continue your meal ingrids eyes burned fiercely she craned to get a look at gretchens table dont worry said milo i wont let her know you told me told you what michelles last name i dont know any michelle ive heard mention of michelle salazar did gretchen eat anything not much damn she needs to eat please dont bother her lunch again chapter milo punched the mdts keypad ran a search on salazar michelle the screen lit up three hits michelle angela with a record for larceny michelle sandra imprisoned in arizona for manslaughter and michelle leticia arrested two years ago for prostitution a year after that for possession of narcotics there you go i said the age is perfect echo park lets go would you recognize her no it was dark i said maybe michelle salazar lived in a twostory peachcolored sixplex on a twisting street one block east of micheltorena and two blocks north of sunset a brown sky hung low over the potholes boxy hieroglyphics sang gang sagas small children played in the dust two doors up a cluster of shavedhead young men in white tank tops and baggy pants crowded an old white van sharing cigarettes and beer and lean looks as we got out of the unmarked some of the beer drinkers watched us milos gun hand was relaxed but in the right place as he threw them a salute big group effort not to respond we were in ramparts division where a police scandal had broken a couple of years ago crash officers forming their own criminal gang lapd claimed the bad cops had been weeded out lapd had denied the existence of bad cops for too long to have any credibility the lock on the buildings front door was missing inside a dark central hall was ripe with the gamy perfume of tooold menudo mailboxes set into the righthand wall were padlocked and unmarked milo knocked on the first door got no answer tried the next unit and received a shouted sí in response policía reciting the word quietly but there was no way to make it inviting long pause then a woman said eh policía policía por qué señora donde está michelle salazar por favor nothing señora número seis a radio was turned up loud enough to block out further discourse we made our way to the stairs different smells up on the second floor sour laundry urine orange soda milo rapped on number another female voice said yeah and the door opened six inches before he could respond held in place by a loose chain bisecting a womans face one watery brown eye half a parched lip sallow skin michelle salazar detective sturgis the door began to close and he blocked it with his foot reached around undid the chain i didnt recognize her but somehow i knew it was her last time id seen her shed had two arms she wore a green nylon robe with moth holes on the lapels thirty pounds heavier than when id watched her dance with lauren a oncepretty face had puffed in all the wrong places and sprays of pimples crusted her forehead and chin the same luxuriant mop of jetblack hair one hand held a cigarette with a gravitydefying ash her left sleeve was tied back at elbow length empty space from the shoulder down oh shit she said i didnt do anything please leave me alone im not here to hassle you michelle yeah right the room behind her was squalid with dirty clothes and old food and clumps of what looked like dog waste on gray linoleum as if confirming that a small hairless thing with a whitefringed head pranced across my field of vision seconds later a highpitched yelp sounded its okay baby said michelle the dog mewed a few more times before withdrawing to tremulous silence what is that a mexican hairless said milo like you give a shit peruvian inca orchid her voice slurred and her breath was sharp with alcohol a blue bruise smeared the left side of her neck milo pointed to the mark someone get rough with you nah she said just playing around im tired man go hassle someone else every time you guys got free time its always here police harassment huh nazi tactics how foolish to waste time here said milo place like this a veritable church michelle rubbed her single arm against the front of her robe just leave me alone ramparts guys visit a lot huh like you dont know i dont im west la then you got lost this isnt about you michelle its about lauren teague two rapid blinks what west la homicide he showed her his card lauren teague got killed yet another recitation of the details i hadnt gotten used to it and my gut clenched michelle began to shake oh god oh jesus youre not lying wish i was michelle can we come in its a shitpile i dont care about interior decorating i want to talk about lauren yeah but couldnt care less about your medicine cabinet michelle this is about someone making lauren dead the tremors continued she reached around with her right hand took hold of the empty left sleeve and squeezed its not that its theres someone in there someone you dont want listening in no its she glanced back he didnt know lauren long as he doesnt come out shooting hes no problem for me hold on she said let me just go explain you wouldnt be trying to rabbit michelle sure im gonna jump out of a twostory window one of you wants to wait down below to catch me fine how about this said milo have lover boy show himself then go back to sleep or whatever hes doing whatever she said backing away then stopping laurens really dead as dead as they come michelle shit damn the brown eyes misted hold on we waited in the doorway and a few moments later a man wearing nothing but red running shorts appeared from the left rubbing his gums thirtyfive or so with unruly dishwater hair a goatish chin beard and sleepy closeset eyes shoulders brocaded by tattoos chest acne and fibroid scars up and down his arms he held his hands up accustomed to surrender prepared to be rousted michelle materialized behind him saying theyre cool lance go back to sleep lance looked to milo for confirmation pleasant dreams lance the man returned to the bedroom and milo entered the apartment maneuvering around the dog dirt taking in everything i followed his footsteps struggled to keep my shoes clean the hairless dog perched on a folding chair eyes bugging the kitchen was an arbitrary clearing with a hot plate and a minifridge and a single plywood cabinet hanging crookedly cracked tile counters were piled high with empty soda cans and takeout cartons an ant stream originated under the plate and continued up the wall two small windows were browned by dirty shades and latin music maybe the din from the unit downstairs percussed the floor besides the dogs chair the only furnishings were a frayed brown sofa strewn with more empties crushed cigarette packs matchbooks yet more dog droppings and a redwood coffee table intended for outdoor use similarly decorated michelle stood watching us playing with the sash of her robe you can sit been sitting all day thanks tell me about lauren michelle sat down and placed the dog in her lap it stayed in place silent but edgy as she plucked at its ear michelle stretched out her index finger and the dog licked it you just made me depressed beyond belief sorry said milo sure you are she reached around the dog and flicked her empty sleeve im like a pirate see captain hook only ive got no hook she stroked the dog for a long time infection not aids for the record recently i said reflexively for a second id felt i was facing a patient if my breaking in bothered milo he didnt show it michelle said couple of years ago one of those flesheating bacteria things they said i couldve died tiny smile maybe i shouldve the guy i was living with then didnt want to take me to the hospital kept saying it was just a mosquito bite or something even when it started spreading up my arm then half my body swelled up like a balloon then everything just started rotting and he split left me alone by the time they got to me man i felt i was disappearing and it hurt im sorry said milo really yeah sure now you telling me this about lauren i cant believe it whens the last time you saw her michelle her eyes rose to the ceiling a year ago no after that later six months couldve been five yeah i think it was five months she came by and gave me money was that a regular thing not regular but she used to do it once in a while bring me food bring me stuff especially after i got out of the hospital when i was in the hospital she was the only one who visited and now shes dead why the fuck did god bother creating this fuckedup world what is he some kind of fucking sadist her head drooped and she ran her hand through her hair pulling at black strands muttering split ends cheap shitty shampoo five months ago said milo how was lauren doing she looked up her she was doing great how much money did she give you seven hundred bucks generous her and me go way back went way back her eyes flashed and she stroked the dog faster in the beginning i used to help her taught her how to dance in the beginning she used to dance like a white girl i taught her all kinds of stuff like what how to deal with reality developing your attitude technique smiling she ran her finger around the contours of her lips she was smart she learned fast smart about money too always saved whatever she could me i have money it just slips away im extremely fucked up and you wont hear me blaming the bacteria even though that really did fuck me up because even before the bacteria i was pretty fucked up personally she lifted the sleeve let it fall becoming a freak didnt help my selfimage but i get by you can always find some guy who digs like im talking to someone who cares reaching into a pocket of the robe she pulled out a cigarette no pack just a loose cigarette easier access with one arm milo was quick to light it for her a gentleman she sucked smoke so who offed lauren thats the big question michelle the brown eyes narrowed you really dont know thats why were here aw she said and here i was thinking it was my technique brought you over well i sure cant tell you lauren and i we went different ways i thought she was getting it together back when we were dancing and working together i always thought she had a better chance of getting it together whys that first like i said she was smart second she never got into dope in any big way had no jones for men either she never got attached to anyone let them get their hooks into her tell the truth she was really kind of a nun know what i mean not a party girl said milo not a party girl michelle repeated even when she was partying her real head was somewhere else you know its like no matter what we did and we did some shit believe me she was like doing something but really not doing it you know detached i said yeah at first it used to bug me i used to worry some customer would pick up on it and that would screw the whole deal kill the fantasy you know cause all they want customers is to be god for five minutes and i knew lauren no matter what she was doing thought the customers were pieces of shit at first i thought she was this snotty bitch with a imtoogoodforit vibe you know then i realized it was just her way of getting through the night and i came to respect her for that and i tried it myself she tossed her hair being detached i could never pull it off not without chemical help that made me admire lauren like she had some special talent like she was going places now look she studied me youre not a cop i glanced at milo he nodded im a psychologist i knew lauren years ago oh she said youre the one whats your name delsomething delaware yeah she talked about you said you tried to help her when she was a kid she was too messed up to work with you did she come see you again she said she was thinking of it when was this i said last time i saw her five months ago no she didnt her mother called me when she went missing missing she was gone for a week before we found her said milo left her car in the garage took no luggage didnt tell anyone looks like she had an appointment with someone who got mean any idea who i thought she got out of the job she told you that yeah said she was back in school wanted to be a shrink i said girl you look like nothing but a yuppie bitch right now so why bother and she laughed then i told her to keep studying and when she figured out why men are so fucked up let me know you and she mustve met some real sweethearts said milo back when you were working you forget em said michelle faces and dicks one big picture that you rip up and throw out i saw enough fat asses and melon bellies to last me halfway through hell what was working for gretchen like gretchen her face hardened gretchens got no heart she fired me im not going to have anything good to say about her what about dangerous types michelle customers you wouldnt see a second time anyones dangerous given the right situation did you and lauren ever have any close calls us nah it was boring bring your knee pads and fake out that you love to swallow same old same old guys thinking theyre in charge meanwhile we knew they were pathetic whyd gretchen fire you said milo she claimed i wasnt reliable so i was late a few times so what were not talking brain surgery what does it matter if you show up five minutes late what about lauren howd she and gretchen get along she inhaled and smiled around a cloud of smoke lauren handled gretchen kissed up to her and did her job and was reliable then she quit on gretchen that was a switch whend she quit mustve been three four years ago howd gretchen react to that i never heard one way or the other that the kind of thing make gretchen mad nah gretchen never got mad never showed any feeling like i said no heart cut her up and youll find one of those computer thingies slickon chip whatever lauren ever have any steady clients someone who really liked her and was willing to pay for it someone she was seeing recently nope lauren hated every one of them basically i think she hated men did she like women michelle laughed as in eatme girlfriend nah we did doubles playacted all the time but basically lauren wasnt into it switched off what you said detached whyd she quit gretchen said milo she told me she saved up enough money and i believed her when she came by to tell me she looked great was carrying this little computer laptop yeah she said it was for school and she had real great clothes on better than usual i mean lauren was always into clothes gretchen made us buy our own shit and lauren always knew where to get the good stuff cheap she used to do some modeling down at the fashion mart knew all the bargains but this time she was wearing the real thing thierry mugler pantsuit black like poured over her and a pair of jimmy choo pumps back then i was living in a real dump over in highland park told her girl you are taking your life in your hands coming around like that dressed like that she said she could handle herself showed me she trailed off smoked some more showed you what said milo protection she was carrying said milo yeah this little shooter silver thing kind of pretty that fit in her purse along with the spray i said whoa whats that school supplies she said a girl cant be too careful did she seem afraid of anything nah she was real casual about it not that that means much lauren was never much of a talker you just didnt push it with her so she came by to tell you shed quit that and she gave me some money that was the first time she brought me money seven hundred something like that maybe five it was usually between five and seven how often did she help you out every few months sometimes shed just slip it under the door and id find it when i woke up she never made me feel like scum for taking it she had a way of she had class shouldve been born rich did lauren ever say anything else that could help us find her killer said milo anyone who mightve had it in for her nah it was all school with her school this school that she was jazzed because she was meeting a different class of people professors whatever two eye blinks she was real high on that intellectuals professors really got off on hanging around with smart people she ever mention any names of professors no she ever talk about doing any work with professors she gazed at the floor rolled the dog over and scratched its abdomen im thinking nah i dont think so why she told people she had a research job oh another eye blink well she never told me nothing like that at all uhuh dropping the cigarette on the floor she ground it out created a smoldering black wound on the linoleum held out her hand i been putting out for you how about returning the favor stud milo pulled out his wallet and gave her two twenties she rubbed the bills between her fingers i used to do a whole lot less to get a whole lot more but this doesnt suck youre a sport nothing about her job huh nothing im getting tired milo handed her another twenty she brushed the edge of the bill against the dogs groin he said the money lauren saved up was that all from working with gretchen probably like i said she saved the rest of us the minute we had a dollar it was gone but lauren was this little scroogie thing counting every buck milo turned to me i said did lauren talk about her family she used to in the beginning but then she stopped she hated her father wouldnt say a word about him called her mom weak but okay said shed married some old guy was living in a nice house lauren was happy for her said shed screwed up plenty but was finally getting it together screwed up how i said life i guess screwing up like everyone does did she ever talk about her mother trying to control her she produced another cigarette waited for milo to light it not that i remember from what she said her mom sounded like a wimp not a bitch she put the cigarette to her lips inhaled held her breath when she opened her mouth again no smoke emerged so she hated her father i said he walked out on them married some stupid cow had a couple more kids little kids she said they were cute but she didnt know if shed ever connect with them because her dad was an asshole and the cow was stupid and she didnt know if she wanted to invest any time in it she was always talking like that everything was an investment your face your body your brain you had to think of it like money in the bank not give anything away for free another deep inhalation she coughed smoked rapidly burning the cigarette nearly down to the filter she was smart lauren was she shouldnt be dead everyone else should be but not her everyone else i said the world whoever killed her should fry in hell and then get eaten by rats crooked smile maybe ill be down there by then and i can train the rats a gun and a computer i said as we left the building the angry young men two doors up hadnt gotten any more lighthearted and this time milo stared at them until their heads turned like michelle said not exactly school supplies lauren told michelle she was out of the game but shed stayed in it he said no one talks about her being jumpy or afraid not andy or michelle or her mother so maybe the gun was to protect what was in the computer data i said secrets and something else despite the gun and laurens street smarts someone managed to hogtie her and shoot her in the head maybe she got caught off guard because the killer was someone she never imagined would hurt her someone she knew and trusted as in bigbucks steady customer whod been generous for years not blackmail fee for service but then the customer decided to end the relationship realized the potential for blackmail existed and took preventative measures we got in the car he sat behind the wheel staring at the dash for all we know i said lauren was killed with her own gun michelle said a little silver shooter plenty of small ninemillimeters around someone she trusted and allowed to get close to her purse still no answer maybe im making too much out of it i said but you know how we always talk about the eyes giving it away how people shift their gaze when theyre lying or holding back michelle started blinking and fidgeting when the subject of professors came up yeah i noticed that when she talked about lauren enjoying hanging out with intellectuals so maybe lauren did tell her about some bigtime john with a phd so why wouldnt michelle say so maybe she thinks theres a chance to profit from it blackmail a killer he said not too bright michelles no paragon of judgment and laurens death means no more money under the door he looked up at the peach building or maybe shes just used to holding back whores live by that creed ill try her again in a couple of days see if i can pry out the name of some rich intellectual ben duggers résumé the easy way he slid into owning his own company offices in newport beach and brentwood says money and those lapses in his education are interesting volvo and a frayed shirt says big spender maybe hes selective about what he spends on lauren did write down his number and monique lindquists comment about his not talking about sex still has me wondering during the ride down the elevator in his building he was in fine spirits humming literally walking with a bounce and enjoying lunch in the park so either he doesnt know laurens dead or he does and he doesnt care maybe its not high priority but somewhere along the line id take a closer look at him high priority he said right now ive got nothing else going he tapped the mdt lets see what our computers say about this intellectual chapter the crime files had nothing to say about benjamin dugger dmv spit out his address the beach an icy white highrise on ocean avenue in santa monica one of those nononsense things knocked into place in the fifties and filled with moderateincome retirees until someone figured out that heartstopping views of the pacific and sweet air werent bad things after all now units started at a half million the nineties upgrade included new paint and windows palm trees transplanted from the desert and lockeddoor security we stood out in front milo had punched the buzzer three times so far he peered through doormans right there yapping with some woman pretending he doesnt see or hear he cursed give me hookers over petty bureaucrats any day echo park to santa monica had been a rushhour crawl across the city and it was nearly five pm ocean avenue teemed with tourists and restaurants ranging from quick grease to waitatthebar haute were jammed across the street saltcured planks and a cheery white arch marked the entry to the santa monica pier newly rehabbed the ferris wheel was still dormant evening lights started to switch on old asian men carrying rods and reels exited the wharf and kids holding hands entered the ocean at dusk was polished silver just a short ride up the coast was malibu where lauren had supposedly escaped for rest and recreation where shed called a pay phone at kanandume come on said milo he buzzed again tapped his foot clenched his hands bastard actually turned his back he toed the door frame pounded on the glass finally the door opened the doorman wore a bright green uniform and matching hat around sixty and a head shorter than me with a squat waxy face scored with frown lines and the squint of someone weaned on no he inspected the glass in the door wagged a finger now look here you coulda broke milo advanced on him so quickly that for a moment i thought hed bowl the little man down green suit stumbled backward his uniform was pressed to a shine festooned with gold braids and tarnished brass buttons a gold plastic badge said gerald police business the badge flashed an inch from geralds eyes now what kind of business are we talking about here our business milo moved around him swung the door out of his grasp and stepped in gerald hurried in after milo i caught the door and brought up the rear the lobby was a chilly vault filled with a clean salty smell and the giddy glissando of hawaiian guitar music dim despite mirrored walls plush carpeting blunted our footsteps a grouping of aqua leather chairs blocked our way to the doormans station we stepped around headed for the elevators gerald the doorman huffed to keep up wait a minute we waited enough i was on the phone sir we continued to the directory b dugger top floor the penthouse the money trail gerald said were a highsecurity is dr dugger in i must call up first is he in until i call i couldnt say dont call just tell me now a big finger wagged in geralds face but dont argue hes in as we boarded the lift the doors closed on the doormans frogeyed outrage yeah i know said milo just doing his job well tough shit hes the one chosen by god as todays scapegoat three apartments on the penthouse level all with high gray double doors duggers was one of the pair that faced the beach dugger answered milos knock within seconds a rolled magazine in his hand reading glasses hanging from a chain around his neck his clothes were a variant of yesterdays rumpled casual white shirt sleeves rolled to the elbow beige dockers crepesoled brown loafers the magazine was us news dr dugger said milo flashing the badge yes whats going on i was standing behind milo and dugger hadnt looked at me closely id like to ask a few questions the police of me yes sir may we come in dugger stood there perplexed through the doors i caught an eyeful of floortoceiling glass black granite flooring endless ocean what i could see of the furniture looked mediumpriced and insipid im sorry i dont understand he said its about lauren teague lauren what about her milo told him dugger went ghostly white and swayed for a moment i thought hed faint and i got ready to catch him but he stayed on his feet and tugged at his collar and pressed a palm to one cheek as if stanching a wound oh no im afraid so doctor did you know her well she worked for me this is hideous my god come in the penthouse was lots of wideopen space a stepdown conversation pit increased the size of the glass wall magnified the view no terrace on the other side of the glass just air and infinity one of the few walls was covered with metal shelving filled with journals and books no food smells from the open kitchen no womans touch or sign of domesticity the first time id seen dugger i hadnt taken a look at his hands now i did no ring he sat down hung his head dropped it into his hands when he looked up his eyes aimed for milo he still hadnt focused on me for gods sake what happened someone shot her and dumped her in an alley doctor do you have any idea who would do something like that no of course not unbelievable duggers chest rose and fell breathing fast he shook his head unbelievable what kind of work did she do for you sir she was a research aide on a project im conducting im an experimental psychologist what kind of project doctor duggers hand flapped distractedly i run a small market research firm we do mostly contract work with ad agencies focus groups limitedtopic opinion surveys that kind of thing poor lauren when did it happen several days ago whens the last time you saw her a couple of weeks were on hiatus this is so what was lauren researching said milo she wasnt actually the study i hired her for is on interpersonal space said dugger why does that matter milos answer was a blank look one of many tricks in his bag it unsettles some people it caused dugger to shift his attention and now he saw me and his mouth turned down you were just in the elevator at my office have you people actually been following me why in the world would you do that milo and i had prepared for this he said first things first sir please tell us about lauren teagues role in your research dugger kept his eyes on me for several moments lauren worked as an experimental confederate but he shook his head still white but what sir i was going to say her job couldnt be relevant but im sure my saying so means nothing to you milo smiled and took out his notepad whats a confederate sir dugger touched the chain of his eyeglasses what psychologists call a plant im not a psychologist sir she roleplayed acting in a sense said dugger lauren pretended to be an experimental subject but she was really in on the game not a game a study limited deception its standard operating procedure in social psychology limited when the studies are over we always debrief the subjects you tell them theyve been fooled we yes how do people react to being fooled doctor its no problem said dugger we pay them well and theyre goodnatured no one gets irate said milo no one who might want to take it out on lauren no of course not said dugger you cant be serious yes i suppose you are no detective weve never had that kind of problem we pretest our subjects take only psychologically balanced people no weirdos even though its a psychology experiment i dont deal with abnormal psychology milo said the client doesnt want nutcases dugger scooted forward were not talking about anything strange here detective this is quantitative marketing research nothing sexy said milo dugger colored nothing controversial thats the point in marketing research one tries to establish norms to define the typical deviance is our enemy nothing lauren did for us could possibly have led to her death besides her identity was always kept confidential but the subjects found out shed fooled them yes but laurens name and personal information were always kept confidential his chin quaked i cant believe shes gone tell me more about the study sir nothing about it could possibly be important to you sir this is a homicide investigation and i need to know about the victims activities the word victim made dugger wince his forehead was sweating and he wiped it with his sleeve lauren he said its so this is horrible this is just horrible he shifted in his chair played with his glasses stared at me and his eyes slitted the study laurens been working on involves the geometry of personal space how people configure themselves in various interpersonal situations for example if the client was a cosmetics company they might want to know about the geometry of comfort zones how close people get to each other said milo how close people get to each other when theyre in varying social situations how people approach each other men and women men and women women and women men and men the influences of age culture distraction physical attractiveness thats where lauren fit in she was very beautiful and she served as our attractiveness confederate you wanted to know if guys got closer to goodlooking as opposed to ugly women its not that simple dugger smiled weakly yes i suppose thats basically it howd you come to hire lauren sir she answered an ad in the campus paper at the university the ad was actually soliciting subjects we were going to use a modeling agency to get confederates but when we saw lauren we realized she might fit we my staff and i dugger looked pained the sky behind him dimmed turning the ocean black graying his face because of her looks said milo not just her looks said dugger it was also her bearing and her intelligence she was so bright the experiment involves following complex sets of instructions that change from situation to situation instructions about what where to position oneself in a room duration of pose what to say what not to say nonverbal cues theres some scripting involved if the subject says one thing you say another when not to talk we use a special room with grid sensors in the floor that are tied in with our computers so we can track placement and movement directly dugger stopped you dont want to hear this actually we do said milo thats it really lauren was attractive extremely bright able to follow directions motivated punctual duggers glance wandered to the ceiling then lowered his right hand slid over its mate and both his knees began bouncing motivated how she expressed an interest in psychology was considering a career in psychology she talked to you about that it came up during the screening interview said dugger another quick glance upward a man with duggers training might have known intellectually about the telltale signs of evasion but it didnt stop him his knees bounced faster and sweat beaded his upper lip milo wrote something down kept his eyes on his pad so basically you placed lauren in this computerized room and measured how guys reacted to her yes for how long were she and the subjects in the room thats one of the things we vary duration temperature music dress dress she wore costumes not costumes said dugger different outfits varying colors styles in laurens case she brought her own clothes from which we selected what she wore laurens case it was actually laurens idea she said she had an extensive wardrobe suggested we might make good use of it creative said milo as i said she was motivated punctual absolutely reliable terrific with details plus she had the perspective of a researcher intensely curious so many people say they want to become psychologists because they have some ambiguous notion about helping people which is good nothing wrong with that but lauren went beyond that she was extremely keenminded and analytical had a very good sense of herself socially poised much more mature than other students wed worked with sounds like you came to know her quite well she worked with us for four months since the summer yes late july we ran the ad during the summer sessions but lauren hadnt been registered for the summer session i kept silent mature said milo then again she was older than most students yes she was but even so four months fulltime every day her work schedule was flexible we run studies when we get enough subjects generally id say it worked out to halftime sometimes more sometimes less dugger wiped his lip with the back of his hand his knees were still dealing with details had calmed him howd you reach her when you wanted her to come in we issued her a beeper whens the last time you beeped her that i couldnt tell you however if you call the newport office tomorrow ill make sure her time cards are available why newport and not brentwood the brentwood office is new not operational yet so you beeped lauren and she drove down to newport yes how many other confederates are you using in this particular experiment two other women and one man none of them has met each other none knew lauren we do that for contamination control and how many subjects did lauren sit in a room with that i couldnt begin to tell you said dugger but the information is available you cant really expect me to hand over my subject list im sorry i really cant do that detective i wont tell you how to do your job but im sure there are more productive ways to solve your case such as i dont know im just saying it had nothing to do with the experiment my god the thought of someone destroying a life that vital is sickening milo got up walked past him stood near the wall of glass a wisp of brass striped the southwest sky gorgeous view did you and lauren have any personal contacts duggers hands laced another ceiling glance not unless you call going out for coffee personal coffee a couple of times said dugger a few times hed gone pale again after work just you and lauren sometimes other members of the staff were there when work ran late and everyone was hungry milo said and other times it was just you and lauren hardly alone said dugger in a tight voice we were in a restaurant in full public view which restaurant more like coffee shops the hacienda on newport boulevard ships an ihop duggers hands separated he drew himself up twisted in his chair met milos gaze i want to make this perfectly clear there was absolutely nothing sexual going on between lauren and me if you had to characterize the meetings id liken them to studentteacher chats about psychology yes what aspect of psychology said milo dugger continued to stare up at him academic issues career opportunities sometimes students confide in teachers said milo walking around so he faced dugger did lauren ever get into her personal life her family no dugger wiped his lip again and his knees began bouncing again im a researcher not a therapist lauren had questions about research design excellent questions why we were structuring an experiment in a certain way how we developed our hypotheses she even had the courage to make suggestions dugger rubbed his thinning hair his eyes were feverish she had terrific potential detective this is a just a godawful waste did she ever tell you about any other jobs shed held that would be on her personnel form it never came up in conversation no id like to see her personnel form sir as well as any other data on lauren you have at hand dugger sighed ill try to have them ready for you tomorrow come by the newport office after eleven milo walked back to where i sat remained on his feet thank you sir apart from filling out the form did lauren say anything about her professional background professional said dugger im not sure i understand dr dugger can you think of anything that might help us anyone at all who resented lauren or wouldve had reason to harm her no said dugger all of us liked her to me how did you connect me with lauren anyway your name was among her effects said milo her effects duggers eyes closed for a second so pathetic milo thanked him again and we walked to the door before dugger could get to the knob milo took hold of it held it in place are you married dr dugger divorced recently five years ago children luckily no luckily divorce scars children said dugger would you like to know my blood type as well milo grinned not at this point sir oh one more thing the experiment how long has it been running this particular phase has lasted around a year said dugger how many phases have there been several said dugger its a longterm interest of ours interpersonal space thats right we found some notes in laurens effects said milo your name and number and something about intimacy is that the same study dugger smiled so thats it no its nothing sexy detective and yes its the same study intimacy in a psychosocial sense is a component of interpersonal space sir in fact the ad lauren answered used the term intimacy in order to as an eyecatcher yes said dugger for marketing purposes said milo you could put it that way okay then milo turned the knob so you have absolutely no knowledge of ms teagues prior work history you keep coming back to that milo turned to me guess she wouldnt have brought it up with someone like dr dugger what are you getting at said dugger your being her teacher and all that sir someone she looked up to youd be the last person shed tell he opened the door tell what said dugger milos big face took on the burden of so many sad irish centuries well sir youre likely to read about it in the paper so theres no sense avoiding it before lauren showed up at your door before she became a student she had a history of exotic dancing and prostitution a shudder ran down duggers body you cant be serious he said im afraid i am sir oh my said dugger reaching for the doorpost youre right she never mentioned that thats very tragic her death or working as a prostitute dugger turned away faced the glass all of it he said everything chapter on the way out milo bellowed a cheery byebye to gerald the doorman we drove up ocean night had settled in streetlights were hazed the ocean was reduced to a slash of reflection he blushed the first time you used the word sexy and he was sweating i said did plenty of his own eye calisthenics mostly when you suggested something personal between him and lauren yeah but he looked genuinely shocked when he found out lauren was dead yes he did i admitted i thought he was going to fall down still thats a strong reaction for an employer wouldnt you say he guided the wheel with one finger so maybe he was screwing her or wanted to doesnt mean he killed her true then again he could be characterized as an intellectual with bucks nice penthouse be interesting to get a look at his bankbook see if there are any withdrawals that match laurens deposits no way to do that he said not at this point the guys not even close to warrant material at this point hes done nothing to even justify a reinterview but after i have a look at laurens time cards tomorrow ill check out some of those coffee shops he mentioned if anyone saw hankypanky between him and lauren ill start talking to the da want me there he chewed his cheek no i think id better do this alone got to be careful procedurally he doesnt like me well he said smiling i dont know how anyone couldnt like you but right now im shining in comparison let me ask you about that experiment of his sound kosher hard to say i wonder who his client is what if lauren did get to know one of the subjects put two people in a room and who knows what can happen or suppose a subject got turned on to her decided to pursue it and it turned ugly or what you suggested a subject found out hed been conned didnt like that one bit he claims confidentiality but how hard would it be for a guy to sit and wait for lauren to come out id love to have his subject list but unless he decides to cooperate voluntarily forget it maybe ill appeal to his sense of morality he strikes me as someone who likes to think of himself as upstanding buying stuff for poor kids hes already been tenderized maybe hell bleed some he turned right on wilshire cruised past the third street promenade glanced at shoppers strolling panhandlers trolling what about his exwife i said if anyones gonna debeatify him who better he smiled you want to knock him off his pedestal maybe i do i said i guess something about him bugs me too good to be true tsk tsk such cynicism comes from spending too much time with you about time you learned he said laurens murder rated three backpage metro paragraphs in the next mornings times the story listed her as a student id woken up thinking benjamin dugger and shawna yeager the fact that duggers intimacy ad had run during the weeks before both womens disappearances milo was right about there being no logical connection but rationality was his province i was free to be foolish i turned it over for a while decided to look for adam green the student journalist whod covered shawnas story back to the phone book the four green adams in lord knew how many others existed in the panoply of area codes that blanketed la i began calling got two wrong numbers a disconnected line then a phone message that sounded promising this is adam green i may be out seeking inspiration or slaving away at my word processor or just pursuing pleasure either way if you dont think life sucks leave a message nasal baritone boy to man i said mr green this is alex delaware im a psychologist working with the la police department and would like to talk to you about shawna yeag this is adam shawna youve got to be kidding no im not theyre reopening shawna unreal did something happen did they finally find her no i said nothing that dramatic her name came up during another investigation investigation of what are you still a journalist mr green laughter a journalist as in working for the cub no i graduated im a freelance write scratch that thats pretentious i write ad copy golden dewdrops an organic breath of morning freshness half of that was mine which half you dont want to know so whats up with shawna whats this other investigation all about sorry i cant get into that i said but but im supposed to talk to you he laughed again psychologist huh what is this some kind of fbi profiling thing doing a special for a e no i really am working with lapd i was reviewing shawnas case and came across your coverage in the cub you were more thorough than anyone else and now youre buttkissing yeah i was good wasnt i not that there was much competition no one else seemed to give a damn too bad shawnas dad wasnt a senator bigtime apathy i wont say that but it wasnt exactly a task force offensive either the unicops did their thing but theyre no geniuses and the guy lapd assigned was an old fart riley leo riley yeah ready to retire i always felt he was phoning it in whered you get the material for your coverage hung around the unicop station mostly watched them work the phones and tack up flyers when i bugged them they treated me like a painintheass kid which i was but so what i was still covering it i got the distinct feeling i was the only one making a deal out of it except for mrs yeager of course shawnas mother not that it did her much good they shined her on too finally she started complaining and some dean and the head unicop met with her and told her they were really on it she didnt think much of riley either he paused i think shawnas dead i think she was dead soon after she disappeared why do you say that its just a feeling i have if she was alive why wouldnt she have turned up by now could we talk about this facetoface i said breakfast lunch or whatever lapds buying im buying cool he said sure my screens blank anyway cant gear myself up for a go at ginkoba ginger gumdrops lets see what time is it ten make it brunch eleven im over in baja beverly hills edris and pico east of century city theres a noahs bagel right down the block nope too dinky how about the kosher deli on pico near robertson sure i know the place or maybe i should go for something even pricier the delis fine yada yada he said maybe ill get an extra sandwich to go i arrived ten minutes early secured a rear booth and nibbled sour pickles while i waited the deli was clean and quiet two elderly couples bent over soup one young bewigged orthodox jewish mother corralled five kids under the age of seven and a mexican weight lifter in bicycle tights and a sleeveless sweatshirt trained on chopped liver and a rye heel and a pitcher of iced tea adam green showed up at he was a tall lanky darkhaired kid wearing a black vneck sweater over a white tshirt and regularcut blue jeans that transformed to easyfit baggy on his ectomorphic frame sizethirteen sneakers gangly limbs a face that wouldve been teenidol handsome but for not quite enough chin his hair was short and curly and his sideburns dropped an inch lower than milos a tiny gold hoop pierced his left eyebrow he spotted me immediately plopped down hard and grabbed a pickle killer traffic this city is starting to entropize he bit down chewed grinned la native i asked third generation my grandfather remembers horses in boyle heights and vineyards on robertson finishing the pickle he lifted a mustard jar rolled it between his palms okay now that were auld acquaintances lets cut to the chase whats really up with shawna just what i told you yeah yeah i know another investigation but why cause some other girl dropped off the face of the earth something like that i said something like that i always thought it would make a good book shawnas story death of a beauty queen something like that youd need an ending though a waitress came over i ordered a burger and a coke and green asked for a tripledecker pastramiturkeycorned beef deluxe with extra mayo and a large root beer and to go i said he showed lots of teeth and slapped his back against the booth dont think youre safe yet when we were alone again he looked ready to ask another question but i got there first so you think shawna was dead soon after she went missing actually at first i thought shed gone off with a guy or something you know a fling then when she didnt show up i thought she was dead am i right why a fling cause people do that am i right about her probably being dead could be i said did you learn anything about shawna that you didnt put in your articles he didnt answer had another go at the mustard jar what i said he blew out air its like this her mom was a nice person basic as in countrified i dont think shed been to la in years she kept talking about how noisy it was so here she was someone whod grown up in this hick town raised a daughter all by herself shawnas dad died when she was little some kind of trucker just like a country song and the daughter turns out to be gorgeous goes on to become a beauty queen miss olive shawnas idea entering pageants her mom never pushed her at least thats what she said and i believe her there was something about mrs yeager straight salt of the earth she supported herself and shawna waiting tables and cleaning houses they lived in a mobile home shawna was her main source of pride then shawna wins that olive thing announces she hates santo leon is going up to la to study at the u mrs yeager lets her go but she worries all the time about la the crime then it happens her worst nightmare comes true i mean can you think of anything worse i shook my head he said mrs yeager was destroyed completely it was pathetic she comes up here by herself no money not a clue as to what things are like the u just the size of it scared her she hadnt made any plans to stay anywhere ended up in a crappy motel near alvarado for gods sake she was taking twohour bus rides to westwood taking her life in her hands walking around macarthur park at night no ones giving her guidance no ones giving her the time of day finally she gets her purse snatched and the u puts her in a dorm room but still no ones really paying her any attention i was the only one he frowned to be honest i went after the story in the beginning because i thought it was a cool humaninterest hook then after i met mrs yeager i forgot about that mostly i sat there while she cried it kind of soured me on journalism he put the mustard jar down finished his pickle snagged another you liked mrs yeager i said thats why you didnt answer my question about material you kept out of your articles youd hate to do anything that compounded her grief the point is what good is it gonna do if no ones found shawna yet shes probably never going to be found youre doing some profile thing to collect data whatever reason but you probably dont care either so whats the point why add to mrs yeagers misery it might help solve another case i said maybe shawnas too he chewed noisily lowered his head it might mr green no answer what did you find out about shawna i said it wont be released publicly unless lives are at stake he looked up lives at stake sounds ominous his eyes were bright blue charged with curiosity hey here comes the grub the waitress brought our sandwiches my burger was good and i ate half before putting it down adam greens order was a massive thing dripping with cold cuts and coleslaw and he chomped furiously i still dont see why i should tell you anything he finally said its the right thing to do so you say yes i do he wiped his lips held the sandwich like a shield look i need something out of this if anything gets resolved what happened to shawna or the other case youre working on i need to know before any of the media cause maybe i should write a book or at least an article for a magazine he wiped his mouth the truth is it stayed with me shawna she was so gorgeous smart had everything going for her here she was just a few years younger than me and then it was all over for her ive got a sister her age at the u no brown he placed what was left of his sandwich on his plate reverentially like an offering were talking great story elements here if its not a book it could be a screenplay you learn something ive got to know deal if the case resolves youll be the first writer to know that sounds kind of ambiguous its not i said without taking my eyes off him he tried for impassive fell way short just a kid i felt exploitative told myself he was over twentyone had come here voluntarily was trying his own wheelanddeal okay okay he said its no big thing anyway the basic point is that shawna might not have been such an innocent farm girl he took another giant gulp of sandwich washed it down with root beer i waited shawna and this isnt fact its just my assumption thats why i never published it along with not wanting to hurt mrs yeager also i did tell riley and the unicops and they ignored me the fact that youre here tells me they never even bothered to put it in their file because obviously if they did youd have read it what did you learn adam okay he said shawna mightve posed nude done a photo shoot for duke magazine or what she thought was a shoot for duke magazine cause i think it mightve been a scam when did she do this mightve he emphasized and i dont know probably sometime during the first part of the quarter would be my guess not long after she arrived he nodded howd you learn this i said i saw a picture what im pretty sure was a picture of shawna and the way her roommate reacted when i brought it up told me i was probably right mindy jacobus yeah mindy i bugged her a lot cause she was the last person to see shawna alive she never wanted to cooperate said she and shawna were close she didnt want to badmouth shawna maybe she was being sincere but i also think she was a little jealous whyd you figure that youve seen pictures of shawna i nodded mindy was cute but she was no shawna im not saying there was overt animosity between them but something about the way she talked about her i couldnt put my finger on it i just felt it whatever the reason mindy really didnt want to talk about shawna i kept bugging her showing up at her dorm room catching her in between classes playing ace newshound he smiled wistfully i mustve been a real pain in the ass today shed probably have me arrested as a stalker but i was like driven things bothered me like why didnt shawna have a boyfriend mindy had a boyfriend any goodlooking girl can have a boyfriend at the snap of a finger right mindys answer was that shawna was a supergrind end of story went to class came back to the dorm and studied went to the library and studied some more but i checked out the grinds in all the libraries and no one remembered seeing shawna and neither did the librarians i also managed to get hold of shawnas library records big nono dont ask me how shawna hadnt checked any books out the entire quarter your article said she was headed for the library the night she disappeared i said that was the official story mindys story and the unicops believed it but im not sure mindy believed it i think she was covering for shawna because she got all shifty when i bugged her about it and finally i got her to admit that the reason shawna didnt have a boyfriend was because she liked older guys mindy had tried to fix her up with a buddy of her boyfriend and shawna had turned her down flat said she preferred older guys grownups was the term she used youre thinking she was having an affair with an older man i said it crossed my mind he said but i was never able to take it any further mindy got all pissed off at me and got her boyfriend he was this refrigeratorsized behemoth named steve to warn me off i wasnt about to risk life or limb so i backed off i did suggest to the unicops that they check out whether shawna had ever been seen with an older guy maybe even a faculty member but they brushed me off why a faculty member campus life is isolated what other older men do students come in contact with but no one cared not even my editor she pulled me off said they needed to run more political stories he shrugged being on the receiving end of all that apathy and hostility was an eyeopener so now i write jingles which is whoring but goodpaying whoring douche and toothpaste dont slam the door in your face the photo you saw i said tell me about it it was the first time i went to the dorm to talk to mindy maybe two days after shawna was reported missing i dont know if youve seen the dorms but the rooms are tiny cells really two people in an area barely big enough for one and not enough closet space so you tend to keep your stuff out in the open shawna must have been a neat freak cause shed stored her junk in shelves above her bed i was surprised the police hadnt confiscated it doesnt that show you how seriously they were taking the case anyway i stuck my hand up to pull down her stuff i really had nerve got hold of some books and saw this magazine in the middle of the stack recent copy of duke which was kind of weird in a girls room right i grabbed the stuff when mindy had her back to me then she turned and started screaming at me and knocked everything out of my hand thats when the photos fell out of the duke blackandwhites clearly nudies mindy scooped them up too fast for me to get a good look at them stuffed them back in the duke shoved all of it under her own pillow continued screaming at me it all happened really fast but i did see a killer bod and big blond hair and that would fit shawna mindy starts shoving at me yelling at me to get out and im saying whats with the skin shots and she says its none of my fucking business then she says it belonged to steve and im out in the hall and the door slams he took another bite of sandwich it was almost as if she decided to give me some answer so id drop it and maybe it was steves but then what was it doing on shawnas shelves in the middle of shawnas books did you tell anyone about this the unicops and riley just like with the olderman theory same reaction thanks well look into it maybe they did though my guess is if the pictures were of shawna mindy mightve gotten rid of them to save shawna embarrassment any idea where mindy is now she was older than shawna would be a senior by now dont imagine it would be that hard to find her you never tried i was out of it did those few stories then moved on but like i said shawna stayed with me though i never thought id be talking about her again is our deal still on sure i said you think any of what i told you might mean something im not dismissing it adam older man younger woman duggers ad nude pictures sexual hangups id thought dugger a prude but prudes can have secret lives maybe duggers donation to the kids at the church had been a guilt offering adam green was staring at me i said so maybe the older man in shawnas life was a photographer someone who claimed to be working for duke why not i mean i cant see a sleazeball like that actually working for duke cause whatever else duke is its bona fide right theyd have to be careful couldnt assign some psycho to take pictures of young girls right but this is hollywood thereve got to be armies of low lifes roaming around with cameras and bogus stories everyone says shawna was smart but she had gotten bigtime strokes for her looks and she was still a country girl how much of a stretch is it from posing in bathing suits and wearing a plastic crown to taking off the suit and if shawna did have a thing for older men couldnt she have been vulnerable to some guy coming across mature and sophisticated makes sense i said youre not bullshitting me no youve put together a logical scenario he grinned i do that once in a while maybe i will write a screenplay chapter wondering if mindy jacobus was also a psych major i called mary lou at the department and asked her to look up shawnas roommate that girl she said lauren i read about it im so sorry dr delaware that poor mother what does this mindy have to do with it maybe nothing i said but you know how it is sure hold on several minutes later shes not one of ours so i called letters and science shes an econ major or was she didnt reenroll this year you dont think she could also be no i said feeling my heart jump was any reason given for her dropping out i didnt ask if you can stay on ill call over there again sure a longer wait then nothing ominous dr delaware thank god she got married changed her name to grieg but the files didnt get put together so we saved her some red tape shes only enrolled in one business class this quarter has a job at the med center in public relations i thanked her and hung up even if i reached mindy jacobus grieg what would i say to her fess up about your missing roommates secrets no reason for her to respond with anything other than a call to security there was another reason not to confront her i was off my game my surveillance of benjamin dugger had turned out to be an amateurish fumble milod been gracious enough not to point that out and when dugger had confronted me hed steered the conversation in another direction but no sense adding to my list of gaffes id check in with the pro see what he thought about talking to mindy later at the end of his workday when leads had either borne fruit or deadended no way to know how milo would react to what id learned about shawnas posing for skin shots he was reluctant to consider her as a factor in laurens death and all i really had to fuel my suspicion was a college newshounds hunch but as i sat there mulling adam greens intuition refused to fade maybe because it fit my own premonitions shawnas venture into the skin trade firmed the linkage between her and lauren so did the fact that both girls had studied psychology talked about becoming doctors grown up deprived in the daddy department in shawnas case literal fatherlessness in laurens a cold hostile relationship with lyle teague id treated enough girls in similar situations to understand where that could lead the search for the perfect father and who better than a seemingly gentle older man like dugger a man with a psychology doctorate no less to fill the void shawnas beauty pageant appearances would have put her in front of an appreciative crowd while still in her teens stripping and hooking and runway modeling had done the same for lauren i thought of her and michelle youth and agility and sexuality playing to a sea of middleaged leers the following day lauren had talked about the power during my attempt to treat lauren those few pitiful hours shed been uncooperative passiveaggressive seductive during her final visit sullenness had erupted into outright hostility yet jane claimed shed admired me that id meant a lot to her and knowing me had fueled her career choice and andrew salander had backed that up it was precisely the ambivalence youd expect from a girl with a father like lyle teague could i have been smarter then i thought of something else jane teague had also found solace with an older man perhaps lauren hadnt veered as far from maternal influence as shed thought lauren and older men gene dalby had thought lauren older she dressed older playing for someone sophisticated when lauren had vented at me id sat there and taken it because that was part of my job and because my shame at being at the party still resonated but another man a man whod contracted to lease laurens body might not have been so understanding if laurens ambivalence had twisted into verbal abuse gretchen stengel had put it perfectly men paid to have it on their terms and challenging the rules or trying to leave the playing field just wouldnt do lauren had never been anything but a pawn but her bravado i do great with tips said shed fooled herself into thinking she was a queen the way shed died trussed shot in the back of the head spelled out cold execution the killer making it clear that he was in charge the hallmarks of a professional job because the killer wanted to make it look professional or was he the type of man who kept his hands clean and hired professionals just another business deal superficially it was hard to see benjamin dugger he of the frayed collar delivering goodies to children engaging in something like that but if the man had sexual hangups and money just because he affected a professorial stance didnt mean he wasnt capable of the worst kind of cruelty either way someone had been there to teach lauren a final horrible lesson selfdelusion was the mothers milk of prostitution and fantasies of control were no protection against the worst kind of sore loser i made the call to the west la station at five pm milo was away from his desk and a detective named princippe told me hed gone out on a call any idea where nope i left my name hung up and went out for a run when i got back the sun had set and milo hadnt called back i showered and changed and robin phoned a few minutes later telling me shed gone out to saugus to look at a rumored store of seasoned tyrolean violin maple that had turned out to be wormed and worthless and oak to boot now im stuck on the freeway she said sorry guess its not a bad day compared to other peoples like who you dont know good point i said you all right hon im fine want to go out or should i fix dinner sure i laughed which either just feed me that seems reasonable i said youre not getting into anything iffy are you no why should i good question im fine i said love you love you too she said but there was something other than affection in her voice i was grilling steaks and feeling quite useful when the phone rang again and milo said whats up anything new on dugger talked to his exwife he said sounding rushed located her in baltimore english professor at hopkins and guess what she loves the guy not romantically as a person bens a terrific person no serious personality defects that she was willing to divulge whyd they divorce we grew in separate directions sexually i said i didnt ask professor freud he said with exaggerated patience it wasnt appropriate bottom line she was amused that the police would be interested in him he probably alerted her to the fact that youd be calling as a matter of fact i dont think he did she sounded genuinely surprised anyway something else just came up citywide homicide sheets came in this afternoon and a downtown case caught my eye two bodies left in an alley near alameda late last night or during the early morning the industrial area east of downtown man and a woman shot in the head then doused with lighter fluid and torched the woman had only one arm the right one at first they thought it was burned off but the bodies hadnt burned long enough to do that michelle he kept reciting coroner says an old amputation theyre trying to roll prints off whats left of the right hand but whatever skin hasnt been broiled is sloughed and messed up and it doesnt look promising hopefully shes got a dentist the day after we talked to her same thing visàvis prints on the male but they did find some scorched blond hairs white male six foot or so the junkie she lived with i said lance i asked ramparts narcotics to pull up users named lance hopefully ill have something soon youre talking as if theres a doubt i said silence its them and now im wondering if my visit signed their death warrant using the singular shouldering the blame someone who didnt like michelle talking about lauren on the other hand a girl like michelle couldve been into anything that place she lived dope was flowing in and out those tough guys next door or someone was watching her apartment made me for what i am figured michelle had squealed i wouldnt have noticed i wasnt looking out for surveillance i said gretchen knew you were looking for michelle she gave you nothing but ingrid came up with michelles last name its not a stretch to think ingrid told gretchen yeah he said with forced calm the possibility occurred to me so i called in a favor asked one of the other detectives in the office to keep an eye on gretchens movements for the next day or so so far it hasnt come to much she had a late lunch at the same place again with ingrid went back to her boutique stayed till three then got in her little porsche boxter and drove to the beach duggers place no no hold on she bypassed santa monica completely took sunset straight to pch broke the speed limit all the way to malibu turned off at paradise cove one of those big gated estates that front the highway the top was down on the boxter the whole time she was gabbing on the cell phone looking carefree even when she was waiting at the gate she was yapping it didnt take long for her to get buzzed in and my guy didnt need a map to know where he was hed worked security for a party there several times the duke estate the palace tony duke built on mammaries talk about your silicone valley apparently duke hires offduty cops all the time contributes to the police benevolent fund part of the whole respectability thing i guess its no surprise gretchen would know duke back when she was riding high she was on every a party list tony duke i said maybe theres more to it i told him what id learned from adam green youve been busy too he said evenly i didnt see the harm no harm done he said all this kid saw was some skin shots he doesnt know they were for duke shots hidden in an issue of duke tony duke has a thing for young blondes doesnt he both shawna and lauren fit that bill im sure tony duke has blondes lining up to be treat of the month but his rep is for screwing them not killing them and why would he go for a call girl like lauren no accounting for taste i said i suppose but some college kids screenplay fantasies and gretchen taking a drive to malibu doesnt exactly get my heart beating malibus where lauren placed those calls to the pay phone exactly you see tony leaving xanadu to take calls at a gas station can you tolerate more hypotheses sure hit me i gave him my olderman theory rambled about power and dominance the vulnerability that shawna and lauren mightve shared tony duke i ended talk about an older man so youre trading dr dugger for the sultan of skin i adapt to changing circumstance fifty plus thousand in laurens account would be chump change for duke hed also have a good reason to want her laptop milo didnt reply in the background a siren wail climbed like a slide trombone solo then dopplered into silence tony duke he finally said christ i hope youre wrong thats just what i need whats that big game small gun chapter for forty years tony duke had preached the gospel of meaning through pleasure converting a generation and scooping millions from the collection plate the easy life was his creed for forty years every issue of duke had splayed that dogma above the masthead over four decades duke pictorials had grown a bit more daring but the magazines format hadnt changed much since its first issue goldentoned milkfed female nudity personified by the treat of the month combined with suggestive cartoons bigbrotherly advice on dress drink and the acquisition of toys token ventures into political journalism when duke published his maiden issue photographic essays of bare breasts pouting lips and willing thighs were nothing new pinup calendars had been gas station fixtures for years and nature pictorials had occupied a stable market niche since the invention of the camera but all that was underthecounter stuff supposedly for guys in raincoats and lowered fedoras sex as dirty in the finest american tradition marc anthony dukes revolutionary act had been to veneer the skin rag with respectability now suburban dad could purchase t a at the corner newsstand and be regarded as classy rather than creepy with its winking scamp logo and gloriously uddered freshfaced models duke magazine had been a major force in the crumbling of sexual censorship barriers and tony duke had fought his share of legal battles but his victories in court proved ultimately to be marketshare defeats as each landmark decision allowed successively raunchier publications to achieve legitimacy now in a world where hardcore porn rentals were the numberone videostore commodity dukes airbrushed sensibilities seemed almost quaint when tony duke hit the papers these days it was usually because hed thrown a fundraiser for some worthy cause all this and whatever else i thought i knew about him had been gleaned from the papers california farm boy morphed to starving bookkeeper to failed hollywood scriptwriter to the author of a dozen forgettable science fiction paperbacks then finally to head of the gutsy publishing venture that had earned him twenty beachfront acres and the kinds of toys his readers could only dream about but the papers printed what you gave them and no doubt duke employed a fleet of publicists he had to be what seventy by now older man as far as i knew hed never been implicated in anything violent on the contrary he had a reputation as someone who genuinely loved women years ago id caught the tail end of a televised interview with him some biographical feature on a network that deluded itself as substantive duke had come across still boyish if a bit frail a small narrowshouldered goateed ludicrously tanned elf of a man with an easytolistento drawl and friendly brown eyes small brown face under a steelhued hairpiece your eccentric favorite uncle on shore leave from his latest jaunt to locales exotiques brimming with ribald anecdotes naughty jokes and the unspoken promise that he might one day take you with him as i watched the steaks sizzle i continued to wonder about marc anthony duke and lauren teague and shawna yeager a few years ago when our house was being rebuilt robin and i had rented on the beach in western malibu during that year i mustve zipped past the duke estate hundreds of times never thinking about what went on behind those foliageshielded walls i had only the faintest memory of a green expanse palms and pines banks of devil ivy geraniums rubber plants the gate that had admitted gretchen stengel tony duke had made a fortune knocking down barriers but he hid behind high walls milo was right if duke was involved it was a whole new game i made a salad mixed iced tea set the table tempted spike outside with porterhouse and bolted the dog door robin came home just as i had everything in place she looked tired and pale and her hair was half tied half loose a beautiful woman anyway but i wondered if tony duke wouldve noticed this is wonderful she said washing up and pecking my cheek i took her in my arms kissed her face rubbed her back ran my fingers through her curls gently so as not to snag the sounds she made and the way she melted against me said i was doing okay even though most of my concentration was spent blocking out the faces of dead people she found a bottle of cabernet that id forgotten about and as we ate and drank my appetite returned we did the dishes together took a walk without spike holding hands not saying much the night was cold enough for visible breath and the smog had traveled somewhere else winter california style was finally arriving id check the garden tomorrow maybe cut back some roses see what the pond needed basic stuff concrete stuff time to get away from being useless when we got back home i got another peck on the cheek and a tired smile robin got into bed with a stack of magazines and i went to my office and switched on the computer marc anthony dukes name pulled up sixteen quick hits mostly press pieces and the official duke magazine website decorated with grinning portraits of the man himself and thumbnails of pastied and gstringed treats through the years that could be enlarged with a click i scanned for a while learned only one new fact two years ago tony duke had gone into ultraleisure mode and passed the daytoday operations of duke enterprises to his daughter anita the accompanying pr photo showed an indigorobed duke posing proudly with a sternly attractive brunette in her thirties wearing a strapless black evening gown anita duke was taller than her father by several inches a shapely woman with smooth bronze shoulders and nice teeth displayed by a tentative smile that appeared anything but happy described as an investment banker with a columbia university mba and ten years experience on wall street these will be years of market growth and consumersensitivity for duke enterprises she predicted soon well be moving fullforce into cyberspace i searched for something less laudatory found a couple of bible belt organizations listing duke enterprises as a tool of satan then some paeans from fans doityourself stuff with tony duke featured high on mostadmired lists from one of these i learned that duke had been widowed two decades ago and remained single until four years ago when hed hooked up with a former treat with the improbable name of sylvana spring the girl who tamed tony with whom hed sired two children any taming though had been shortlived duke and sylvana had concluded an amiable divorce last year the kids were proof claimed the admiring webmaster of tony dukes eternal virility eat your heart out viagrachompers beautiful sylvan and the rugrats still live in a guesthouse right there on tds palatial malibu spreadorama the man is ultragenerous and toocool then pages of downloaded cartoons and centerfold photos copyright infringements i supposed duke tolerated one unlined doeeyed poutylipped face after another spongerubber buttocks geometrically barbered pubic triangles and breasts peachtoned and pinknippled identically upswept pneumatic in a way that nature had never conceived i logged off returned to the bedroom night chill had seeped in and robin was wearing a flannel nightgown buttoned to the neck i was just about to get you she said ready to go to sleep i am her hair was pinned and shed scrubbed her face clear of makeup her eyes still looked tired and her lips were chapped a tiny pimple that i hadnt noticed before had sprouted on her forehead i got into bed rolled next to her smelled toothpaste breath the merest eau of perspiration as she began to stretch away from me i kissed her touched her she said i look horrid wasnt planning to then she sighed hiked up her gown drew me to her held me tight she was wet when i entered her came quickly chewed on my nipple and rocked the pleasure out of me when her body peeled away from mine she was already asleep i lay there on my back feeling the thump of my heartbeat feeling alone she began snoring lightly and her hand snaked across the bedsheet touched my arm found my index finger her pinkie curled around the digit and held on deep in slumber but gripping my finger hard not daring to move i waited for sleep i awoke the next morning knowing id dreamed but struggling to retrieve the details something to do with a party palm trees blue water naked flesh or was i imagining that i took a very hot shower dressed made coffee and brought it to robins studio she was goggled and gowned about to enter the spray booth with a new mandolin feigned patience when she saw me after a few minutes of sipping and chat i let her be and returned to the house thinking about parties again tony dukes lifestyle the kind of opulence that might attract a girl like lauren would be even more of a lure for the olive queen of santo leon had shawna yeager covered for a bash at the duke estate with a story about going to the library i drove to the u hurried into the research library checked out spools of la times microfiche and searched the social calendar for mention of any parties thrown by tony duke over the last year nothing given dukes reputation that seemed odd and i retrieved the previous years worth of spools covered another six months with still no mention of bashes or fundraisers at the malibu estate maybe there were certain parties tony duke kept out of the papers or maybe finding himself a father again the king of the easy life had changed his ways i kept searching finally found something nearly two years ago a starstudded benefit for a free speech organization that had earned duke two paragraphs in the social pages and was accompanied by photos of the man gaggles of treats and various screenfamous faces a plastic surgeons bragging session anita duke too standing behind her father wearing a conservative dark pantsuit and that same edgy smile as she looked down at her father his attention was elsewhere he held two children in his lap a plumplooking baby not more than a few months old and a twoyearold boy with a chubby face surrounded by cloud puffs of vanilla ringlets no lounging duds for dad he wore a dark suit white shirt dark tie the toupee was gone and his bald head was exposed in full iridescent glory older and smaller than in the official duke shots as captured by the paper the man resembled nothing but a model grandfather paternal pride read the caption magazine mogul marc anthony duke relaxes with daughter anita and her halfsibs tykes baxter and sage only the absence of son ben prevented the evening from being a complete family reunion son ben i hurried out of the microfilm room raced to the reference stacks found whos who pulled out the most recent copy and paged furiously to the ds duke marc anthony dugger marvin george b apr par george t and margaret l baxter m lenore mancher june dec children benjamin j anita c m sylvana spring cheryl soames june div children baxter m sage a the rest didnt concern me son ben professor monique lindquists laughter rang in my ears the sex angle if thats what you want from ben dugger dugger dressed and drove below his means used his fathers real surname eschewed the camera casting off notoriety rejecting what his father stood for both now his research made sense the mathematics of intimacy reducing sweat and libido to grids and statistics the antiduke sins of the fathers bearing some kind of guilt had his church visit been part of a chronic quest for absolution an older man filling the daddy void when id learned about gretchens visit to his fathers estate id veered away from dugger but now i was right back where id started maybe it hadnt been tony gretchen had come to see shawna yeager posing for duke magazine lauren reminding herself to call dr d to talk about intimacy getting a job with dugger spending time with him in newport beach coffee shops meals dugger claimed were no more than vocational guidance dugger blushing and sweating as he insisted intimacy hadnt crept into his time with lauren but pseudointimacy was exactly what lauren had sold and a man could be forgiven for failing to see the truth selfdelusion lauren shot to death michelle shot to death maybe because lauren had confided in her shawna posing for someone who claimed to be working for duke there had to be a syllogism floating somewhere in that tangle i had bad news for milo chapter shortly after five pm he called me back official confirmation on michelle and the boyfriend no triumph in his voice his full names bartley lance flowrig bachelors degree in shoplifting and burglary mostly real dumb stuff no violence maybe he and michelle got desperate and tried to break into the wrong house neighborhood like theirs that could be dangerous maybe i said but guess what he took the news of ben duggers lineage more calmly than i expected so maybe lauren told michelle about something dugger would like kept private a nasty kink something at odds with his niceguy image something that could damage him as well as his dad or expose the link to his dad he seems to be doing his best to hide his family background once lauren was gone michelle and lance decided to profit from the information gretchen knew youd get to them eventually tipped off someone at the duke estate he let out a long low whoosh of resignation then laughed tony duke and dr ben no way id have made that connection thats exactly the point i picked up some kind of sexual hangup and ill bet i was right dugger wears frayed shirts distances himself from his father and everything his father stands for but maybe its a case of protesting too much running from his own quirks so youre back on junior what about senior who knows i said but at this point that visit to newport doesnt seem like a bad idea not that dugger wont be prepared he just about invited you to drop by but throw out shawnas name at a strategic moment and see how he reacts and check out the staff see if anyone looks antsy shawna he said who mightve posed for duke or someone she believed was working for duke what if dugger only used his connections once in a while to attract young gorgeous blondes not a bad ploy at all especially when he had a genuine link to back it up could throw in a visit to the estate and maybe he scammed lauren too despite her years on the street she couldve been seduced by big bucks maybe those calls to malibu were hooking up with junior his not wanting her to call him at either his home or daddys someone as nondescript as dugger couldve used that phone booth without being noticed a rich kid he said pretending to be regular folks okay lets do newport tomorrow i love orange county how can you not dig a place that names its airport after john wayne sure you want me along i said to dugger im the bad cop exactly at nine am milo rolled onto my property i had my keys out and headed toward the seville no he said slapping the drivers door of the unmarked well take the ferrari i want this to look official hence the tie excellent choice by the way nice power stripes italian i checked the label so it says i regarded the blue polyester ribbon riding his paunch wheres yours from the planet vulgaro he tugged at the knot licked his pinkie pretended to slick his hair spiffed and ready for action what a team as he drove past the gateposts i said you tell dugger we were coming he nodded mr cooperative sounds a little depressed though i seem to have that effect on people when we reached sunset i said leo riley what about him how would you rate him on the ace detective scale average why adam green had the feeling riley was phoning in the investigation on shawna just biding his time till retirement then again hes kind of a mouthy kid and had nothing to offer riley but guesses about an affair with a professor leo i called him a few days ago hes living out in coachella because i did look up the yeager file and theres not much in it left a message he hasnt called me back not much in the file because there wasnt much to know or was green right about riley maybe both he said no leo was no workaholic still there wasnt much to go on she told her roommate she was going to the library and never came back like i told you before leo figured it for a psycho sex thing and i cant say i argued with him he even made some crack about it turning into a serial killer and by that time hed be playing golf in the desert and growing skin cancer lets see what he says when he does call back meanwhile ive been thinking about gretchens trip to dukes place what do you think collecting for services rendered gretchens never been picky about what she sells something else he said what salander said the whole deal about lauren not wanting to be controlled by her mom during the notification interview jane abbot did all the right things griefwise but basically she gave us nothing usually the family throws something at you wild guesses suspicions useless stuff sometimes a real lead jane cried a lot but there was none of that from her so i called her last night left a message his eyes shifted toward me she still hasnt gotten back to me which leads me to the fact that she hasnt called me once since the notification that is also not typical alex your usual middleclass homicide i get bombarded with messages what progress has been made how soons the autopsy gonna be over when can we claim the body have a funeral generally my problem is playing shrink and clerk and still trying to do my job this lady not only doesnt she get in touch on her own she doesnt take the time to call back meaning meaning is there anything more i should know about her no i said i barely knew her barely knew lauren he gave a cold smile and look where that got you the price of fame yeah alex i guess what im saying is theres something about jane like maybe she knows something she isnt letting on the duke angles nice and juicy but what if this all traces back in some way to laurens family jane that asshole dad whatever i did some checking on ol lyle couple of duis but thats it still you know better than anyone this was not one happy family is there anything i should be looking at i thought about that as sunset sloped upward and the onramp appeared milo pushed down harder on the accelerator and the unmarked kicked shuddered and jammed into high gear maybe jane hasnt called back because shes gone into seclusion i said with mel where they both check into some rest home so thats my answer huh dont waste my time in the valley i cant think of anything fair enough his hands were white around the wheel as he sped onto the freeway narrowly passing a jaguar sedan and eliciting angry honks fuck you too he told the rearview mirror alex lets say there is no big family issue but what if lauren got hold of juicy info on dugger or duke or whoever and passed it along to jane maybe jane reacted strongly told her to keep her mouth shut whatever and that was the control thing lauren talked about to salander lauren had been out of the house for years i said had just reconnected with jane their relationship was still thawing that doesnt mesh with her confiding something explosive but maybe when times get rough sometimes the chicks return to roost so maybe jane hasnt been in touch with me because shes scared has an idea what led to laurens death and is worried it could be dangerous for her too that would be enough to get her to hold back on a lead to laurens murder i know i know now its me whos hypothesizing but when im finished with dugger i definitely want another try at her makes sense i said he grinned fiercely makes no sense evidencewise but thanks for the emotional validation im flopping around like a fish on the pier i know you like dugger but he just doesnt bother me i dont pick up any guilt vibe sure he reacted strongly to the news of laurens death but my immediate impression was it was just that news okay he was sweating and maybe he and lauren were doing the dirty lets see if any of those newport restaurants remember serious smooching but still he doesnt give off any of that fearhormone stink hes depressed not spooked what the hell he could be a primary psychopath hogtied her shot her dumped her and ate a candy bar afterward and im being played like a cheap harmonica have you seen anything that points to that level of disturbance i mean you shouldve heard the exwife ready to beatify the guy psychopaths dont get anxious but they do get depressed lets take a closer look at him today milo frowned rubbed his face sure what the hell at least well get another trip to the beach just before lax the freeway clogged we rolled slowly toward el segundo and when the clog gave way milo said what do you think tony dukes worth couple of hundred million the magazines not what it used to be i said but sure that wouldnt surprise me why do you ask i was just thinking big stakes if something dugger did do placed the old man in jeopardy as in sexual violence cause dukes image is good clean licentiousness right a few miles later think about it alex john wayne airport the guy spent world war ii on the warners lot and hes a combat hero welcome to the land of illusion maybe thats why dugger likes it here newport beach sits forty miles south of la milo violated as many traffic laws as he could think of but the lax slowdown turned the trip into a full hour exiting at the south he stayed on the highway as it became newport boulevard sped past miles of basic socal strip mall and some spanking new shopping centers with all the charm of theme parks on prozac the first evidence of maritime influence boat brokers appeared as we switched to balboa and soon i was seeing lots of anchor motifs restaurants claiming fresh fish and happy hour and people dressed for the beach a silvery winter sky said the sand would be gray and cool but there was no shortage of bare skin i opened the window ten degrees warmer than la salt smell clean and fresh between this and santa monica ben duggers lungs would have to be pink and pretty a few blocks later balboa turned narrow and residential beautifully landscaped twostory homes lining both sides of the boulevard beach view to the west marina vista across the street a turn onto balboa east took us past more sparkling windows bougainvillea flowing from railings porsches and lexuses and range rovers lolling in cobbled driveways then a twoblock lowprofile commercial stretch appeared and milo said should be right around here the shop fronts were shaded by multicolored awnings more shade from street trees immaculate sidewalks easy parking bird chirps the merest drumbeat of the tide rolling in lazily cafés chiropractors wine merchants beachwear boutiques a dry cleaner the address dugger had given for motivational associates matched a onestory seafoam green stucco structure near the corner of balboa east and a street no signage just a teak door and two draped windows the immediate neighbors were a dress shop with a window full of chiffon and a storefront eatery labeled simply chinese restaurant behind the glass front of the café an asian man played the deep fryers at warp speed as the woman next to him chopped with a cleaver the aroma of egg rolls mingled with pacific brine we parked got out and milo knocked on the teak door the wood was highly varnished like a boats deck with so many coats laid on the thump barely resonated ben dugger opened and said you made good time he wore a white shirt under a gray crewneck widewale green cords brown moccasins with rawhide laces the sweater showcased dandruff flecks hed shaved recently but not precisely and dark hairs hyphenated a rawlooking neck behind the thick lenses of his glasses his eyes were bloodshot and resigned and when they met mine the pupils expanded i smiled he turned away milo said easy ride scenic dugger said come on in and admitted us into an offwhite anteroom set up with cream canvas chairs and tables piled with magazines and hung with photos of the ocean in various color phases an unmarked door at the back took us into a larger space empty and silent and lined with a white door on each wall the entrance to the left had been left open revealing a very small baby blue room furnished with a single bed draped by an amish quilt and a plain pine nightstand stacks of books on the stand along with a cup and saucer and a pair of glasses dugger continued toward a door to the right but milo paused to look into the blue room dugger stopped and raised an eyebrow milo pointed at the blue room youve got a bed in there sleep research dugger smiled nothing that exotic its a genuine bedroom mine i sleep here when its too late to drive back to la actually this was my home until i moved the whole building just this room kinda cozy you mean small said dugger still smiling i dont need much it sufficed he crossed to a closed door and took out a key ring double dead bolts a sign marked private hed unlatched the first bolt when milo said so how long ago did you move to la the keys lowered dugger took a deep breath all these questions about me i thought this was about laurens employment just making conversation doctor sorry if it makes you uncomfortable duggers lips curled upward and his long grave face managed a low inaudible laugh no its fine i moved a couple of years ago newport too quiet dugger glanced at me again i smiled and again his eyes whipped away not at all i like newport very much but things came up and i needed to be in la more so i opened the brentwood office its not really in full gear yet when it is i may have to close this place down whys that too much overhead were a small company ah said milo things came up yes said dugger releasing the second bolt come lets meet the staff on the other side of the door was a large bright office pool partitioned into workstations the usual offwhite blandness computers and printers and bracket bookshelves potted plants and cute calendars stuffed animals on shelves the smell of lilac air freshener sheryl crow from a cassette player over the watercooler four women stood by the watercooler all blandly attractive ranging from midtwenties to midthirties each wore a variant of sweaterandpants and it came across as a uniform dugger rattled off names jilda thornburgh sally patrino katie weissenborn ann buyler the first three were research assistants buyler the secretary was already equipped with laurens time cards milo flipped through them began questioning the women yes they remembered lauren no they didnt know her well had no idea who would have wanted to hurt her the word punctual kept coming up as they talked to milo i searched for signs of evasiveness saw only the discomfiture youd expect from honest people confronted with murder ben dugger had retreated to a cubicle dominated by a large framed zoo association poster koalas cute and cuddly and had turned his back to us occasionally one or more of the women looked his way as if for support the women surrounding himself with females like father like son milo said dr dugger if you dont mind id like to see that room the one where lauren worked dugger turned certainly as he walked toward us milo said oh yeah one more thing gang shawna yeager anyone by that name ever work here four headshakes youre sure said milo not as a subject or a confederate or anything else dugger said who milo repeated the name no said dugger eyes steady doesnt ring a bell ann buyler said im sure but ill check she pecked at her computer keyboard called up a screen manipulated the mouse no no shawna yeager who is she dugger asked milo a girl so i gathered detective lets see that room said milo then i dont need to waste any more of your time chapter back in the inner lobby milo said so whore your clients youre not thinking of contacting them said dugger not unless the need arises it wont duggers voice had grown sharp im sure youre right sir i am detective but why do i get the feeling you still suspect me of something not so doctor just routine said dugger i really wish youd stop wasting your time here and go out looking for laurens killer any suggestions where said milo how would i know i just know youre wasting your time here and as far as clients go in terms of the intimacy study there isnt one its a longterm interest of mine goes back to graduate school our commercial projects tend to be much shorter attitudinal focus groups a specific product that kind of thing we work on a contractual basis the timings irregular when were in between projects i focus back on the intimacy study and nows one of those times said milo yes and id appreciate it if you dont talk about clients to the staff ive assured the women that their jobs are secure for the time being but with the move you may be revamping so youre financing the intimacy study on your own there isnt much expense said dugger that woman you mentioned shawna was she murdered as well its possible my god so this youre thinking lauren couldve been part of something part sir a mass murderer a serial killer pardon the expression milo jammed his hands into his pockets you dont like the term doctor its a cliché said dugger the stuff of bad movies doesnt make it any less real when it happens though does it sir i suppose not do you really think thats what happened to lauren some psychopathic creep duggers voice had risen and he was standing taller assertive aggressive locking eyes with milo milo said any tips in that regard speaking as a psychologist no said dugger as i told you before abnormal psychologys not my interest never has been how come i prefer to study normal phenomena this world we need to emphasize whats right not whats wrong now ill show you my room ten by ten sandcolored walls matching acoustical tile ceiling the same kind of canvas chairs as in front similar coffee tables but no magazines no pictures dugger peeled back a corner of the carpet and exposed a series of stainless steel slats bolted to a cement floor soldered to some of the panels were wires and leads and what looked like integrated circuit boards so they just sit here and you measure them said milo initially we tell them theyre here for marketing research and they fill out attitude surveys it takes ten minutes on average and we leave them in here for twentyfive fifteen extra to get acquainted with the confederate if they so choose said dugger how many do i cant give you a precise number but people do tend to be social i watched his lips listened to his words for import flat tone no commentary implied or expressed maybe that said plenty milo walked around the room seemed to fill it with his bulk running his hand along a wall he said no oneway mirrors dugger smiled too obvious everyone watches tv set me straight on procedure doctor said milo how do you ensure that the subjects and the confederates dont meet after the experiments over the subject leaves the room before the confederate while the subject is debriefed the confederate is moved to a private waiting area behind the main office and we monitor subjects exits walk them out watch them drive away theres simply no opportunity for subsequent contact and theres no one a loose cannon a subject who resented being deceived who mightve wanted to harm lauren no one said dugger we prescreen with a basic test of psychopathology you dont like abnormal psychology but you recognize its worth dugger twisted his collar as a tool milo paced some more scanned the ceiling he stopped pointed to a small metal disc in the corner lens cover you film them were set up for video and audio recording its an option do you keep the tapes no we transcribe the data numerically then reuse the tapes said dugger nothing youd want to hold on to its a quantitative study the main findings are the informational bits that transmit from the grids to our hard drives as well as the confederates observations the confederates report back to you we interview them about what duggers lips tightened qualitative data variables that cant be numericized weird behavior no no nuances observational impressions measures the grids cant pick up and you have no interest in abnormality dugger pressed himself against the wall i really dont see the need to discuss my research interests the fact that lauren was murdered sickens me just knowing someone whos been murdered sickens me but how well did you know her doctor dugger stepped away from the wall his eyes rose to the ceiling look i know what youre after and you couldnt be further off the mark i told you the first time i never slept with lauren the idea is ridiculous and disgusting milos shoulders bunched like a bulls as he stepped closer to dugger duggers hands rose protectively but milo stopped several feet away disgusting a beautiful girl like lauren whats disgusting about sleeping with a beautiful girl once again sweat beaded duggers upper lip nothing i didnt mean it in that sense she was a lovely girl it just wasnt like that she was an employee its called professionalism an employee with whom you had dinner several times jesus said dugger if id have known that would set you off id never have mentioned it we talked about psychology her career plans thats it beautiful girls arent your thing either duggers hands lowered curled into fists opened slowly he smiled brushed dandruff from his sweater as a matter of fact theyre not per se im sure youre constructed differently but external beauty means very little to me now please leave i insist you leave well said milo remaining in place if you insist oh come on said dugger why does this have to be adversarial i realize its an occupational hazard but straighten your sights lauren deserves that his head dropped and he covered his eyes but i saw what he was trying to conceal the glisten of tears before we got back in the car we stopped at the chinese restaurant got some egg rolls and wontons to go showed the proprietors laurens picture yes said the cook in perfect english she came in here a few times chicken fried rice to go alone always alone why routine investigation said milo what about dr dugger from next door no said the cook all these years weve been neighbors and hes never come in maybe hes a vegetarian milo drove six blocks pulled over ate a roll in two bites scattering crumbs and not bothering to brush them off i got to work on a wonton greasy and satisfying howd he react when i popped shawnas name i didnt pick up anything striking no reaction at all i said which is interesting in itself wouldnt you expect some puzzlement or as you remind me from time to time sometimes a cigar is just a cigar he opened the envelope with the time cards that ann buyler had given him and i read over his shoulder ten to twenty hours a week the last pay period three weeks ago i said so either duggers concealing something or lauren lied to salander about going to work during the break dugger concealing what you dont believe him about no hankypanky with the help no attraction to mere physical beauty he was sweating again noticed that and did you see those tears when he went on about lauren whats with the guy hes holding back something still eating he pulled away from the curb and i slapped his sleeve lightly mean bad policeman you made him cry jesus youve turned into a hard case he said finishing another roll and reaching for a third that marketing company of his i said theres a phony feel to it he got really defensive when you asked him about clients claimed to be between jobs maybe because he doesnt get many doesnt need to because hes got funding from the duke foundation overtly or otherwise and that wouldve raised the blackmail stakes what if the old mans getting tired of financing juniors supposedly pure lifestyle especially with ben distancing himself from all tony duke regards as holy but still takes the money what if dukes looking for an excuse to cut ben off a nasty scandal would play nicely into that more than duggers reputation could be at stake well lets see if anyone around here remembers him doing anything scandalous with lauren or anyone else we spent the next two hours cruising newport and showing laurens photo to restaurant servers and hosts dropping ben duggers name getting absolutely nothing more than once someone said a face like that i wouldve remembered a kid in a seafood joint said if you find her can i have her number as we left the final restaurant milo said if dugger and lauren were trysting they werent doing it over food maybe foods not his thing either how about motels he groaned but nodded another hour was lost questioning desk clerks same result milo cursed all the way back to the maybe the guys gay i said you sense any hint of that what im supposed to have gaydar touchy low blood sugar anything left in that bag one wonton hand it over between mouthfuls maybe he is gay or asexual or virtuous or lord knows what asexual i said wouldnt that be something the grand stud spawns a son whos anything but you dont like him i wouldnt wanna go bowling with him either guys a priss but being tony dukes kid isnt grounds for a warrant hes untouchable with regard to lauren and sos all his intimacy data when we get back im getting on the horn to central and the coroner see if anythings come up on michelle if they pull a bullet out of her head and it matches the nine millimeter in laurens maybe i can talk to someone about leaning on gretchen right now its time for that second facetoface with jane abbot speaking of which he placed another call to the sherman oaks number got another taped reply this time he hung up without leaving a message ive also got a call in to westside vice about gretchen be interesting if shes gotten active again if anything leads back to her and duke ill be on junior like a rash lets hit the abbot house see if the neighbors know where jane and mel are ill leave my card in the mailbox and if she doesnt respond to that ill really want to know why would you consider a detour to westwood i said mindy jacobus works at the med center in public relations adam green feels she didnt want to be helpful any statements from her in rileys file just the library story green checked out the library no one remembers shawna ever being there he looked at his watch gazed through the windshield at the clean stretch of freeway midday lull just a few trucks and cars and us in the fast lane under a browning sky that mocked the virtues of progress nice little offramp in westwood he said why the hell not adam green had described mindy jacobus as no shawna but she turned out to be a stunning young woman with flawless lightly tanned skin and one of the healthiest heads of glowing black hair id ever seen a tall longlegged sylph in a pale blue knit dress and highheeled white sandals she strode out of the public relations office into a hallway that reeked of rubbing alcohol carrying a gold cross pen moving with a confidence that made her seem older than twenty more planes than curves tony duke would probably have walked right past her so maybe that was what green had meant but her stride was a hipswiveling sashay that transcended lack of flesh yes she said with a publicists ready smile her id tag read m jacobusgrieg assistant publicist milo had given the front desk his name only no title the smile wavered when she got a good look at him no way could that face that tie mean philanthropy or any other brand of good news when he flashed the badge her confidence shut down completely and she looked like an overdressed kid whats this about shawna yeager ms jacobus how weird we were in an administrative wing of the med center far removed from clinical care but the hospital smell that alcohol stink brought back memories of mass polio vaccinations in school auditoriums my father accepting the needle with a smile biceps tensing so hard the blood ran down his arm i five years old fighting to squelch my tears as a whitecapped nurse produced a frigid cotton swab weird said milo mindy jacobusgriegs fineboned hand clutched the pen tighter closing the door behind her she moved several feet down the hall and settled a lean rump against pale green plaster the decor was photos of med school deans and famous benefactors at blacktie galas some of the angels were showbiz types and i searched for tony dukes face but didnt find it hearing shawnas name again she said its been over a year has something finally did you find her not yet maam maam made her flinch so why are you here to follow up on the information you gave during the initial investigation now a year later yes maam what could i tell you that i didnt already say back then well said milo were new on the case just doing our best to see what we can learn and you were the last person to see shawna yes i was just before she left for the library thats what she said she glanced down at her left hand the third finger was circled by a gold wedding band and a onecarat diamond ring she rubbed the stone reminding herself shed made progress since then milo said newlywed last june my husbands a rheumatology resident i dropped out temporarily to help pay some bills does shawnas mom know youre back on the case are you in contact with shawnas mom no she said not any longer i did stay in touch for a while a few months agnes mrs yeager moved to la and i tried to help her get adjusted but you know sure said milo nice of you to help her a tiny pink tongue tip darted from between mindys lips then retracted she was pretty destroyed any idea where she can be reached shes not working at the hilton anymore beverly or downtown beverly said mindy thats not in the file you must be missing a bunch of stuff that other detective the old one he seemed a little is he your friend milo smiled detective riley yes he did tend to get a little distracted i never felt he was really paying attention anyway thats where agnes worked i was just thinking about her on christmas because shawnas birthday was december twentyeighth and i knew her mom must be going through hell i wouldve invited her to my parents house but we all went to hawaii what did mrs yeager do at the hilton cleaned rooms she needed something so she could stay in la and she couldnt find any decent waitress jobs the u let her stay in a grad student dorm for a few weeks but then she had to leave she didnt know the city at all almost ended up near macarthur park i told her to stay as far west as she could and she found herself an apartment near la brea and pico cochran south of pico so she stuck around for a few months maybe she moved back home i dont know back to santo leon i said uhhuh she rolled the pen between her fingers milo said so the last time you saw shawna was that night she said she was going to the library remember what time that was i think i said eightthirty it couldnt have been too much earlier cause i was out with steve my exboyfriend tiny smile he had football practice until seven and i used to pick him up and wed have dinner in the coop and then hed walk me back to the dorms shortly after i got back shawna left i studied for a while went to bed and when i woke up she still hadnt returned was the library a usual place for her to study i guess youre not sure the hand clutching the pen tightened in the papers the campus paper mostly they said no one remembered shawna in any of the libraries trying to make out like shawna had lied but the libraries are huge so what does that prove i had no reason to doubt her footsteps and laughter caused her to gaze down the hall a group of people in suits passed and someone called out her name hey guys she said flashing the sunny smile then turning it off as she faced us is that it when shawna left was she carrying books shed have to be said mindy shed have to be even if she wasnt telling the truth about studying she wouldve covered herself right i mean with no books id have said something and i didnt so sure she mustve had books i wouldve noticed if she hadnt been logical agreed milo but do you specifically recall seeing books blue irises bobbled no but why do you doubt her just trying to collect as many details as i can maam well no way i can give you details after all this time but the logical thing was she had books probably psych books thats all shawna read she was really into it psychology medicine all she did was study a grind i said remembering the phrase shed used with adam green not in a dorky sense she was just serious about her grades do you think she could still be alive milo said anythings possible but unlikely milo shrugged mindy shut her eyes opened them she was so beautiful if shawna did make up the story about going to the library what do you think she was covering for i dont think she was covering and if she was i wouldnt have the faintest the pen slipped from her grasp she moved fast and caught it could she have been hiding the fact that she had a boyfriend said milo mindy licked her lips why would she hide that you tell me said milo gently mindy edged away from him i have no idea did shawna have a boyfriend ms jacobusgrieg not that i knew milo consulted his pad funny going over the file i copied down something about a boyfriend for some reason i thought that came from you no way why would i tell anyone that must be a mistake then oh well the smooth skin behind mindys ears had pinkened milo began paging through his pad blank pages from where mindy stood she couldnt see that here it is possible boyfriend maybe older guy per mj looking up he favored mindy with an innocent look i assumed mj was you but maybe something got scrambled probably the flush had spread to mindys jawline milo kicked the wall lightly with the back of his shoe lets talk theoretically okay if shawna did have an older boyfriend any idea who he coulda been how would i know i just thought the two of you living together being close we lived together but we werent close anyway it was only for a couple of months so you guys werent real friends i said we got along but we were different for one i was older a screwup landed me in a room with a freshman different worlds exactly said mindy relieved at being understood different how asked milo smiling im social she said i like people always had lots of friends shawna was more of a loner interesting trait for a beauty queen oh that well that was back in santo leon didnt count no no im not putting it down its just i gathered that back home shawna was pretty important but up here she was just another freshman i went to uni had tons of friends here from high school she didnt i tried to she didnt make too many of her own friends i mean she probably wouldve it was only the beginning of the quarter not too social i said not too so back in santo leon shed been a big fish in a small pond but in la she had trouble distinguishing herself yes i mean she was beautiful but kind of country unsophisticated also her basic personality was i dont want to say stuck up more like private she did like to keep to herself like when steve would come over shawna would ignore him or leave she said she wanted to give us space but you thought maybe she was being a bit antisocial i said to be honest kind of thats why i didnt pay much attention that night when she left for the library she was gone a lot a lot yes nights nights and days i really didnt see her much did she spend nights away from the dorm no she said she always was there in the morning thats why when i woke up and she wasnt i thought it was weird but still still what said milo i didnt freak or anything you know this was college we were supposed to be grownups milo twirled his own pen blue plastic bic so there was no boyfriend you know of right and this other note ive got about maybe it being an older man did shawna ever say anything about liking older men mindys back was flat against the wall another upward glance both of her hands clenched the pen ms jacobusgrieg is this is all this going to be publicized thats not our priority cause it was really no big deal and agnes what was no big deal mindy shook her head i told a reporter some pest from the cub and he told the police about a conversation shawna and i had a conversation about what guys what girls talk about all the time i shouldnt have opened my mouth and that pest shouldnve repeated it repeated what mindy mindy rubbed one sandal against the other i wouldnt want to ruin shawnas reputation ruin it in what way raising rumors because whats the point a year later why should her mom read it and get upset milo moved closer to her placed his weight on one foot looking very tired what hurts mrs yeager the most is not knowing what happened to shawna thats the ultimate hell for a parent so anything you can do to clear it up would be a good deed mindy bit back tears i know i know but im sure its nothing indulge us unless it leads to a solution well keep it close to the vest the flush had overtaken mindys face coppery glow beneath the tan but nothing healthy about it it was really just a single conversation she said swiping at her eyes again maybe three weeks into the semester steve had a friend who thought shawna looked hot and he asked if shawna wanted to be fixed up shawna said no she had too much studying but then she went out and not to the library this was a friday morning and she said something had come up suddenly she had to leave early for the weekend something back home in santo leon but the thing is she was all dressed up and made up nothing like what youd expect just to take the bus home so i asked her who the guy was said she wasnt wasting stockings and all that lip gloss on some campus loser and she gave me this i can only call it an off look know what i mean real serious almost angry but not angry upset like youd hit a nerve i said exactly she gave me the off look and said mindy i would never date anyone my age give me an older guy anytime cause they know how to treat a woman and thats when it hit me the way she was dressed a suit all that makeup its like she was trying to make herself look older so i wondered and thats what i told that pest from the cub which is probably what youve got in there pointing to the pad but i dont know for sure she added you didnt ask her said milo i tried i can be nosy i admit it but like i said shawna was private she just kind of blew me off picked up her suitcase and left so older men know how to treat a woman said milo you think she meant financially thats the way i took it cause shawna liked things talked about becoming a psychiatrist or a plastic surgeon getting herself a big house in one of the three bs brentwood bel air beverly hills like shed read about that in some magazine i mean she actually took the bus into beverly hills once walked up and down rodeo drive unsophisticated kind of adorable really into stuff said milo clothes cars she said one day shed drive a ferrari from being a plastic surgeon or marrying one maybe both said mindy she ever talk about any professors she really liked what you think it was a professor theyre the older men on campus no she never said okay thanks for your time said milo flipping through his pad then slipping it into his pocket mindy smiled and her posture had just loosened when he said oh one other thing and thisll stay as private as possible too there was mention of some photos shawna mightve posed for for duke magazine oh please snapped mindy that stupid idiot the weirdo from the cub weird how obsessive like a stalker he wouldnt leave me alone kept dropping in at the dorm doing his big reporter thing the last straw was when he barged right past me started poking around our stuff the whole duke thing came up because steve had left some magazines around sports illustrated gq and yes some playboys and dukes too you know guys and the idiot has the nerve to start poking around in the stack and these loose pages fall out of the duke and green the idiot grabs them and says whoa is this shawna i grab them back and tell him to keep his filthy mitts off and his mind out of the gutter and he gives me this knowing smile this smirk and he says whats the matter mindy why shouldnt shawna pose god gave her the bod and the hair disgusting talk thats when i threatened to scream and he left but he kept hassling me and i had to get steve to warn him off maybe you should be looking at him did he know shawna before she disappeared i said no i dont think so i was just talking in the sense that he was weird anyway thats where that duke stupidity came from so shawna never posed of course not why would she do that same reason any girl does money fame or maybe shed met an older guy who was also a photographer no said mindy no way shawna wanted to be a doctor not a centerfold thats not the kind of money and fame she wanted none of us want that its demeaning shawna entered beauty contests said milo and hated it miss olive oil whatever she told me she only did it for the prize money and because she figured it would look good on her u application she wasnt that kind of girl what kind is that a bimbo she was smart another quick study of the ceiling white knuckles around the gold pen one hand let go and began tracing the outline of her narrow hip her face had turned salmon pink her eyes jumped around like pachinko balls demeaning she said milo smiled at her let it ride chapter as mindy returned to her office the corridor filled with people milo said that chinese food made me thirsty we rode a crowded elevator down to the med school cafeteria amid the clatter of trays and the odors of mass fodder we bought cokes and settled at a rear table behind us was a cloudy glass wall looking out to an atrium so he said mindy not a terrific liar i said her complexion wouldnt cooperate and she was squeezing that pen hard enough to break it especially when she talked about the photos adam green said they were loose blackandwhites not magazine pages mindy tried to make him out as some nut but he seemed pretty credible to me and mindys explanation makes no sense why would her boyfriend keep skin mags in her room green wondered if both shawna and mindy had followed up on a solicitation to pose that would explain mindys nervousness he nodded especially now that shes an old married woman you didnt press her on it i felt id gone as far with her as i could for the time being even if shawna did pose for nudies theres no proof it was really a duke gig and not some con man with a business card fact is i cant see duke using some psycho photographer too much at stake and i cant exactly march into tonys corporate headquarters and demand access to the photo archives his beeper went off he read the number cellphoned couldnt get a connection and stepped outside the cafeteria when he returned he said guess who that was lyle teague mommy doesnt call me but daddy does what did he want have i gotten anywhere was there anything he could do forcing himself to be polite you could just about see his hands clench through the phone lines then he slips in a question about laurens estate whos in charge whats going to happen to her stuff do i know whos handling her finances oh man he shook his head the vulture circles when i told him i had no idea about any of that he started to get testy poor lauren growing up with that sometimes i think your jobs worse than mine he bought another coke emptied the can i said the one thing mindy did confirm was shawnas attraction to older men that and a duke angle real or not does provide a possible link between her and lauren dugger he said older man rich smart a psychologist no less he fits shawnas list and talk about business cards hes got paternity to back it up for all we know he uses the magazine as a lure same for the intimacy study double life huh mr clean by day god knows what after hours even by day hes strange i said he has no current clients but keeps that lab going putting people in a strange little room and measuring how close they get to each other sounds more like voyeurism than science to me and he was running ads prior to both shawnas and laurens disappearances his staff said shawna had never been to newport so he destroyed records or met shawna another way taking glam pictures or he used some other premise mindy said shawna got all dressed up for that weekend thing back home she didnt buy the story assumed the obvious a date shawna was eighteen years old hungry for the finer things talked openly about digging older guys it wouldnt take a genius to seize upon that and exploit it and heres something else to think about a year has passed between shawnas disappearance and laurens death but that doesnt mean thereve been no victims in the interim i checked for that he said right after you told me about shawna no obvious similars things happen i said stuff no one knows about especially when theres money involved he didnt answer but he didnt argue we left the med center and walked to the no parking zone in front where hed left the unmarked a parking ticket flapped under the windshield wipers he crumpled it and tossed it in the cars backseat i said at the very least it would be worth talking to shawnas mother she might be able to confirm or deny the weekend event in santo leon maybe shes still working at the hilton someone else to make miserable he said yeah yeah lets blow by after that im heading out to sherman oaks to see jane abbot happy mothers day the beverly hilton sits at the western edge of beverly hills just east of where the la country club begins its dominance of wilshire the drive from westwood was five minutes the hotels personnel office was cooperative but careful and it took a while to find out that agnes yeager had left the hiltons employ nine months ago she didnt stay long said milo problems no problems at all said the assistant personnel manager esai valparaiso a small friendly man in a tight brown suit we didnt dismiss her she just left valparaisos thumb flicked the edge of the folder without notice it says here any idea where she went no sir we dont follow them and her job was to clean rooms yes sir she was a housekeeper one could i have her most recent address valparaisos hands spread atop his desk i hope she hasnt done anything that reflects upon the hotel not unless griefs bad for your image twelve hundred cochran milo said reading the slip as we headed for the car the place mindy told us about he plugged agnes yeagers name into dmv no wants warrants violations but the address is back in santo leon maybe she gave up moved back he got the area code for the farm town called information not listed okay lets have a look at cochran the apartment was a sixunit dingbat just south of olympic on the east side of the street whitestucco box faced with blue diamonds remnants of sparkle paint glinting at the points an open carport packed with older sedans and a spotless concrete yard where there shouldve been lawn no yeager on the mailbox in front and we were about to leave when an old black man leaning on a skinny chromium cane limped out of the front unit and waved his skin was the color of fresh eggplant shaded to pitch where a widebrimmed straw hat blocked the sun he wore a faded blue work shirt buttoned to the neck heavy brown twill trousers and bubbletoed black work shoes with mirrorpolished tips sir said milo tip of the hat so who did what to who officers the cane slanted forward as he limped toward us we met him midway to the carport milo said were looking for agnes yeager sir cracked gray lips canted downward agnes is this about her daughter something finally happen with that you know about her daughter agnes talked about it said the man to anyone whod listen im around all the time so i ended up doing lots of listening bracing himself on the cane he held out a horned hand which milo grasped william perdue i pay the mortgage on this place detective sturgis mr perdue nice to meet you youre talking about mrs yeager in the past tense when did she leave perdue worked his jaws and placed both hands on the cane the straw of his hat brim had come loose near the band and the sunlight poking through created a tiny lavender moon under his right cheekbone she didnt leave of her own will she got sick nine or so months ago happened right here my niece was down visiting me from las vegas shes a traffic dispatcher for the police there works the morning shift and tends to get up early so she was out that morning just before sunrise she heard it a big noise from agness apartment twisting slowly perdue pointed to the groundfloor unit across from his agnes fell down right inside her door the door was open and the newspaper was on the floor next to her she went outside to fetch it took a step back inside and collapsed tariana said she was breathing but not too strong we called they said it looked like a heart attack she didnt smoke or drink all that sadness was probably what caused it sadness over her daughter it cut her to the bone the cane wobbled but perdue managed to draw himself up any idea where she is mr perdue they took her right down the block to midtown hospital tariana and i went to see her there they had her in the intensive care and we couldnt get in she didnt have insurance so a while later they moved her to county hospital for evaluation thats a far trip for me so i just called her she wasnt in much of a state for talking said they still didnt know what was wrong with her but shed probably be moving out shed send someone for her things sorry about the rent she owed a month i said not to worry and dont be concerned about her things either there wasnt much she rented the place furnished i had everything packed up two suitcases and tariana brought them over to county hospital thats the last i heard from her i know she was discharged from county but no one would tell me where mr perdue said milo did she have any ideas about what happened to shawna sure did she figured shawna had been killed probably by some man who lusted after her she used that word sir lusted perdue pushed up the brim of his hat yes sir she was a pretty religious woman one of those with a strong sense of sin like i said no drinking or smoking and once she got home from work she sat and watched tv all night lusted said milo did she tell you why she thought that it was just a feeling she had shawna meeting up with the wrong gent she also said the police werent doing much no offense that the officer in charge didnt communicate with her one time i met her out back we were both taking out the garbage and she was looking sad and i said whats wrong and she just started bawling thats when she told me that shawna had been a little difficult back home and that shed tried her best but shawna had a mind of her own wild in what way i didnt ask her sir said perdue sounding offended why would i pour salt in her wounds of course said milo but she didnt give you any details she just said she regretted the fact that shawnas daddy died when shawna was a baby that shawna never had any father didnt know how to relate to men properly then she started crying some more talking about how shed done the best she could how when shawna announced she was moving down here to go to college it had scared her cause shawna was all she had but she let her go because you couldnt say no to shawna shed do what she pleased like entering those beauty contests agnes never approved of that but shawna wouldnt be refused agnes figured you had to cut the apron strings now look whats happened william she told me then she just cried some more pitiful perdue ran a finger over his upper lip the nail was hardened crossgrained like sandstone but carefully shaped i told her it wasnt any of her fault that things just happen i lost a boy in vietnam three years i spent fighting hitlers war and i came back without a scratch my boy flies over to vietnam two weeks later he steps on a mine things happen right they do sir said milo they do indeed we drove to crescent heights crossed sunset as the street shifted to laurel canyon and headed for the valley woman with a heart condition said milo im gonna kick her off the ledge what do you think about what she told perdue about shawna being wild wild because she had no father in her life i said wild in a specific way i think her mother knew of shawnas attraction to older men meaning maybe shawna had older boyfriends back home maybe he said but that could also mean that shawnas story about heading home for the weekend was true she got dolled up for some santo leon lothario it went bad he killed her dumped her somewhere out in the boonies thats why shes never been found if so there goes the lauren connection no i said agnes mightve been aware of shawnas tendencies but i doubt she knew about a specific hometown boyfriend if she had wouldnt she have given his name to the police even if the police werent listening leo riley he said sob still hasnt called back he probably couldnt tell you much anyway milo i think agnes yeager knew shawnas pattern and suspected history had repeated itself in la but she didnt know the specifics could be the thing that bothers me is that whoever made shawna dead really didnt want her to be found but just the opposites true of lauren and michelle and lance were talking bodies left out in the open someone flaunting maybe wanting to set an example or scare someone off something professional none of that fits with a sex crime so the motives were different i said shawna was a lust killing the others were eliminated to shut them up we passed the laurel canyon market and the road took on a steep grade milos foot bore down on the accelerator and the unmarked shuddered as the trees zipped by my heart began racing oh man what what if shawnas death is the secret lauren found out somehow tried to profit from it talk about something worth killing for he was silent till mulholland how would lauren find out i had no answer for that he began pulling on his earlobe took out a panatella asked me to light it and blew foul smoke out the window well he finally said maybe jane can elucidate for us glad youre here angry smile this might require psychological sensitivity we drove up to the gates of the abbot house just before four pm both the blue mustang convertible and the big white cadillac were parked in front but no one answered milos bell push he tried again the digital code sounded four rings broken connection last time it was hooked up to the answering machine he said cars in the driveway but no ones home probably just as we thought i said they went away took a taxi he jabbed the bell a third time said lets talk to some neighbors and turned to leave as the third ring sounded we were nearly at the car when mel abbots voice broke in please this is not this is then a dial tone milo studied the gate hiked his trousers and had taken hold of an iron slat but id already gotten a toehold and i made it over first chapter we ran to the front door i tried the knob bolted milo pounded rang the bell mr abbot its the police no answer the space to the right of the house was blocked by a ficus hedge to the left was an azalealined flagstone pathway that led to the kitchen door also locked but a groundfloor window was half open alarm screens in place said milo doesnt look like its been breached wait here unholstering his gun he ran around to the back returned moments later no obvious forced entry but somethings wrong replacing the weapon and snapping the holster cover he flipped the screen on the partially open window shouted in mr abbot anyone home silence theres the alarm register he said glancing at a side wall systems off okay boost me i cupped my hands felt the crush of his weight for a second then he hoisted himself in and disappeared you stay put im going to check it out i waited listening to suburban quiet taking in what i could see of the backyard a blue corner of swimming pool teak furniture oldgrowth trees screening out the neighboring property pretty olive green shadows patching a lawn skinned in preparation for fertilizer someone had plans for a verdant spring eight minutes passed ten twelve why was he taking so long should i return to the car and call for help what would i tell the dispatcher as i thought about it the kitchen door opened and milo beckoned me in sweat stains had leaked through the armpits of his jacket his face was white whats going on i said instead of answering he showed me his back and led me through the kitchen blue granite counters were bare but for a carton of orange juice we hurried through a floralpapered breakfast nook a butlers pantry the dining room past all that art and milo ran past the elevator into the living room where melville abbots trophies were gloomed by blackout drapes he vaulted up the stairs and i followed when i was halfway up i heard the whimpering abbot sat propped in bed cushioned by a blue velvet bed husband hairless skull reflecting light from an overhead chandelier slack lips shellacked with drool the room was huge stale someones vision of versailles gold plush carpeting mustardandcrimson tapestry curtains tied back elaborately and topped by fringed valances french provincial replica furniture arranged haphazardly the bed was kingsized and seemed to swallow abbot the bed husband had slipped low against a massive swirl of rococo headboard of tufted yellow silk lots of satin pillows on the bed several more on the carpet the chandelier was murano glass a snarl of yellow tendrils crowned by multicolored glass birds a small picasso hung askew above the crest of the headboard next to a dark landscape that couldve been a corot a folded wheelchair filled one corner the straggling white puffs of melville abbots hair had been battened down by sweat the old mans eyes were vacant and frightened lashes encrusted with greenish scum he wore maroon silk pajamas with white piping and lapdissue handcuffs around his wrists to his left a few feet from the bed redbrown splotches rorschached the gold carpet the largest stain spread from under jane abbots body she lay on her left side left arm stretched forward legs drawn upward ash hair loose and fanned across the thick pile a silver peignoir had ridden up exposing stillsleek legs a sliver of buttock swelling beneath black panties bare feet pink toenails graying flesh greentinged purplish suggestions of lividity at ankles and wrists and thighs as dead blood pooled internally her eyes were half open filmed the lids swollen and blueing her mouth gaped and her tongue was a gray garden slug curling inward one rubycrusted hole blemished her left cheek a second punctuated the hairline of her left temple milo pointed to the floor next to the nightstand a gun not unlike his mm near the draperies he drew the clip from his trouser pocket put it back when i got here he was holding it abbot gave no indication of hearing or comprehension saliva trickled down his chin and he mumbled what are you saying sir said milo drawing closer to the bed abbots eyes rolled back reappeared focused on nothing milo turned to me i walk in and he points the damn thing at me i almost shot him but when he saw me he let go of it i kept trying to find out what happened but all he does is babble from the looks of her shes been dead several hours im not pushing him without a lawyer present its van nuyss case i called them we should have company soon enough mel abbot groaned just hold on sir the old mans arms shot out he shook his wrists and the cuffs jangled hurts theyre as loose as they can be sir the chocolate eyes turned black im mr abbot who the hell are you detective sturgis abbot stared at him sherlock bones something like that sir constabulary said abbot state trooper stops a man on the highway have you heard this one probably said milo aw said abbot youre no fun chapter milo scanned the bedroom as we waited i could see nothing but tragedy but his trained eye located a bullet hole on the wall facing the bed just to the right of the wheelchair he drew a chalk outline around the puncture mel abbot continued to hunch stuporously in the bed cuffed hands inert milo wiped his chin a couple of times each time abbot yanked his face away like a baby repelling spinach finally the howl of sirens three blackandwhites on code two a muttandjeff detective duo from van nuys division named ruiz and gallardo a squadron of cheerful bantering paramedics for mel abbot i stood on the landing and watched the emts set up their mobile stretcher milo and the detectives had moved out of the bedroom out of the old mans earshot talking technical sidelong glances at the old man a moist slick of snot mustached abbots upper lip janes corpse was within his line of vision but he made no attempt to look at her a paramedic came out and asked the detectives where to take him all three cops agreed on the inevitable the prison ward at county general the short d ruiz muttered love that drive to east la no place like home ese said gallardo he and his partner were in their thirties solidly built with thick black hair perfectly edged and combed straight back he was around sixtwo ruiz no more than fiveeight but for the height differential they could have been twins and i began thinking of them as outgrowths of some mendelian experiment short detectives long detectives anything to take my mind off what had happened it didnt work my head wouldnt shake off images of jane abbots final moments had she known what was coming or had the flash of the gun been sensation without comprehension mother and daughter gone a family gone not a happy family but one that had cared enough years ago to seek help a restraint strap unbuckled with a snap and the emts advanced on abbot he began to cry but offered no resistance as they eased him onto the stretcher then he gazed down at the body and screamed and waxy arms began striking out one paramedic said now come on in a bored voice snap snap the paramedics went about their work speedy as a pit crew and abbot was immobilized i ran downstairs retraced the path through the house and out the kitchen door to the flagstone pathway the sun was relenting and the lowest quadrant of the sky was striped persimmon a few neighbors had come out to stare and when they saw me they edged closer to the gates a uniform held them back someone pointed and i ducked out of view stayed close to the house which was where milo found me taking the air breathing seemed a good idea i said you missed the fun abbot managed to slip an arm out and grab hold of one of the emts hair they shot him up with tranquilizer poor guy pathetic but dangerous you really think he did it you dont he slapped his hands on his hips im not saying it was premeditated but hell yeah he was holding the gun and that hole in the wall fits with a shot fired from the bed my best guess is it happened last night they probably had the gun in a nightstand somehow he found it was using it as a teddy bear jane entered the bedroom freaked him out and boom suburban security goes bad we see it all the time alex usually with kids which is what abbot really is right the nightstand drawers within arms reach theres another gun in there older revolver a thirtyeight unloaded so maybe jane was being careful but not careful enough she forgot about the clip in the gun tragic accident i said youre the detective he stared at me spit it out jane was an experienced caretaker i cant see her letting him get near a gun she had her hands full alex people get careless perfectly competent parents turn their backs while snookums toddles over to the pool he stared down the length of the house therere no signs of forced entry there was a box of loose jewelry in janes dresser and a nice fat safe in the bedroom closet combinationlocked not to mention all those paintings ruiz and gallardos first order of business will be to see if the gun was registered solid citizens like them arent likely to own an illegal piece if it was theirs that pretty much clinches it he took baby steps turned in a small tight circle hitched his trousers least i know why she didnt return my calls youre right about the art i said if its real its worth a fortune one hell of an estate one hell of a community property i wonder who inherits he rotated faced me eyes half closed but alert like those of a resting guard dog and the point is mel abbots only child died ten years ago janes just a few days ago now mel will be declared incompetent and someone else will be placed in charge of all the assets probably a courtappointed conservator my guess is relatives will start lining up i wonder whos next in line from a legal standpoint some cousin from iowa so what maybe not i said jane mentioned a prenup but that couldve applied only to divorce not death if mels will signed everything over to jane that wouldve put lauren in place to inherit but with lauren dead her closest living relative could step up to the plate and look who just called you and asked about laurens finances his head shot forward and the eyes opened wide daddy dearest oh man you have a devious mind he did call hours after jane died jane and lauren both hated his guts thered be no reason for him to think anyone made him a beneficiary any will come up for lauren not yet if she died intestate i said her estate will end up in probate and be up for grabs im no lawyer but my bet is that as her closest living blood relative lyle will have a strong claim sure getting through the paperwork will be a hassle and therell be estate taxes to pay but if those paintings are real even a chunk would be serious money lyles hurting financially a picasso or two would do wonders he offs his ex and plants the gun in the old guys hand like you said no love lost between them cmon alex he cant be stupid enough to do it and call me the same day talk about obvious he frowned but it wasnt obvious was it not till your warped mind seized upon it you are one creative puppy he began pacing along the side of the house low chatter from the front of the property created an irritating soundtrack noise but no reason lyles calling you was blatant i said but like you said people get careless did he seem the subtle type to you the guys angry depressed out of work drinks stomps around his property with a loaded shotgun if thats not a recipe for violence i dont know what is youre saying he did jane and lauren no big bad duke conspiracy or shawna coverup who knows i said the other thing to think about is everyone around lauren is dying which fits with jane not being more forthcoming because she did know something explosive either way pinning it on abbot seems awfully convenient for arguments sake lets say lyle was the shooter he shows up and jane just lets him in she mightve even with tons of hostility there was that early bond the years theyd been together familiarity chemistry ive seen it plenty of times working custody cases the nastiest divorces two people trying to rip each others hearts out in court then they find themselves alone and end up in bed maybe lyle put on a big show of grief thats the one thing they shared laurens death for all we know he didnt even come to kill her they started talking lyle segued into money talk like he did with you jane lost it and one thing led to another so whys the old guy still breathing because lyles no genius but he did have an inspiration picture it this way the argument begins downstairs jane orders lyle out he refuses she rushes upstairs thinking to lock herself in the bedroom then call the police lyle goes after her gets in the bedroom shoots her its dark they couldve wrestled from a spot near the bed the hole in the wall he misses that time but hits his mark twice and jane goes down abbots asleep maybe deeply hes probably on medication the gunshot wakes him he sits up disoriented a senile old man confronted with sudden loud noise and darkness his consciousness is clouded anyway he wouldnt have focused immediately where were his glasses on his nightstand he couldve seen nothing lyle spots him considers killing him realizes abbots no direct threat and comes up with a better idea plant the gun near or in abbots hand and leave quietly he mightve even pressed abbots finger on the trigger and fired and thats where the hole in the wall came from even if abbots head does clear and he recalls some details whos going to believe him whats his story a mystery intruder with no signs of forced entry a bogeyman who leaves his weapon behind but ill wager abbot comes up with nothing hes out of it a few days in the prison ward at county and hell probably be completely vegetative a door slammed at the front of the house we stepped forward to see the paramedics trundle abbot out the old man lay strapped on the stretcher eyes closed mouth agape as the emts carried him across the motor court they chatted and seemed relaxed no threat from the cargo neighborly necks craned as abbot was loaded into the ambulance siren sonata as the uniform at the gate cleared an exit path and the ambulance sped away two vans drove up one white with the coroners logo on the door was allowed through the gates the silver one with a network affiliates call letters on the roof next to a satellite antenna was waved to the curb the party begins said milo at least its ruiz and gallardos bash i can just hear tonights broadcast i said as a young redhead in a yellow pantsuit stepped out of the news van a sherman oaks man was arrested today on suspicion of murdering his wife neighbors described melville abbot as friendly but feeble thats still where the facts point alex guess so i said and ruiz and gallardo do seem like nice guys why complicate their lives oh my he said what the hell went down during your childhood to make you enjoy complications when my mother was pregnant with me she got startled by an obsessivecompulsive pit bull the woman in yellow approached with a cameraman and a soundman in tow the boom hovered over her coiffure as she flirted with the uniform at the gate smiles all around then the cop shook his head and the reporter pouted and the news crew drifted toward the growing clot of suburban observers milo said lets get the hell out of here just walk straight through and dont make eye contact if ms bubblehead chirps remember shes a vulture not a canary you heading home he laughed harshly you kidding i love the goddamn valley hey how about a nice little jaunt to reseda the commuter rush ventura boulevard was constipated and a glance at the freeway overpass revealed a chromium still life milo stayed on surface streets sitting too straight in the drivers seat jaw muscles pumping lips twisting one big hand shoving aside the hair lick that shadowed his brow repeating the futile gesture over and over silent talking to himself assessing the possibilities id inflicted upon him i mightve felt guilty but my mental camera was working overtime too flashing images of jane abbots graygreen corpse then the trussed bundle of ruin that had been laurens final pose i tried to switch channels but the alternative fare wasnt any prettier michelle and lance burned to cinders shawna yeager brutalized unthinkably then kicked into a hidden grave agnes yeager probably still pictured her only childs beautiful face but by now shawna would be nothing more than bones mothers and daughters entire families disappeared past haseltine the traffic eased up milo said finally the same soilandpaint smell the same irate dogs when we reached the chainlink around lyle teagues property the sun was a brickcolored skullcap on a flat gray pate of horizon and the smear of illumination in the lower sky had dulled to excremental brown grimy chemical light revealed the shabby neighborhood at its worst a few kids with shaved heads lounged in front of the apartments across the street slouching and drinking enjoying delusions of immortality their grins shifted to fear and distrust as we pulled up when milo parked a bottle shattered against the curb by the time we got out of the car the kids were gone the beefy padlock on teagues front gate was in place but the pickup with the chrome pipes and the overgrown tires was missing and we had a view of the carport littered with machine parts and broken toys gone i said milo peered through the chainlink diamonds this one i dont scale let me call his number as he reached for his cell phone the houses front door opened a crack then wider as tish teague stepped out into the dirt holding the hand of a brownhaired girl around five years old the childs eyes were open but she looked sleepy the second mrs teague wore a baby blue tank top and tootight white shorts that sausaged her hips her bra strap did the same for her torso turning her into a mass of soft rolls supported by pasty dimpled legs blue tattoo on the left biceps her hair was drawn up at the top rubberbanded into an offcenter thatch milo waved but she just stood there bland pale pudding of a face aiming for stoic mrs teague milo called is your husband home headshake her mouth formed no but the sound failed to make it across the yard where is he maam instead of answering tish returned inside came back minus the child and with her hair loosened walking halfway across the dirt she stopped folded her arms under her bosom and shouted hunting hunting what usually he brings back birds or a deer milo muttered danl boone to tish wheres he hunt maam up near castaic what do you need him for doing some followup maam may we come in followup on what your husband phoned me today and i was getting back to him how longs he been gone tish blinked three times coupla days so he mustve called me from somewhere else he have a cell phone nope but he did take camping gear yeah guns too hes hunting said tish what the shotgun i dont know what he takes he wraps everything up in plastic i dont pay attention to guns why all these questions just curious what youre saying lyle could shoot someone milo paused has that been on your mind ma no way she said he keeps that stuff just for home protection and hunting thats all and i like that hes a good man whyre you hassling him i dont mean to hassle maam so you havent heard from mr teague in two days i told you he dont have one of those she pointed to the cell phone her tone said the deficiency was a crime for which someone needed to be blamed hmm said milo well he did call me well he didnt call me tish aimed for defiance but her gray eyes filled with hurt she stepped a few yards closer sometimes he uses a pay phone what did he want to talk about lauren her what for she was his daughter maam not if you asked her what do you mean maam crossing her arms she covered several more feet stopped well before the gate bare feet toes grayed with dust the nacre of chipped pink polish glinting through she wasnt nice to us lauren wasnt not to me or him or the girls i thought she brought the girls christmas presents tish smirked oh sure big deal she comes in wearing her cool clothes and her cool makeup and hypers them up with all that candy and junk and then when she leaves im nice enough to thank her and say she can take home some of the apricot pie i baked from fresh apricots because thats the kind of person i am she laughs at me and looks down at the pie slice im offering her and says no thanks like i stuffed shit in a crust or something then she says at least youve got better manners than him thanking me which you should cause i didnt have to do this and im like what do you mean and shes like you better believe you should thank me cause you dont deserve a damn thing from me youre not even my family and neither is he and neither are your rugrats tishs lip trembled just like that nasty mean one minute shes playing with the girls and then shes insulting us i couldve trashed her back but i just said well sorry you dont like apricot pie goodbye and she laughed again and was like i came here cause ive got class something youll never know chubby then she pranciepranced out the door tish released her arms let the wrists go limp she prancieprances around like shes doing one of her strip dances which is the class she had a stripper and a whore so whos she to be snobbing and styling on me i was so mad it gave me a migraine but at least she was out of here then just as im closing the door she turns around and starts coming back and im like okay tish you controlled yourself good but shes asking for it i really thought we were gonna get into it and i tell you i was ready but she musta figured that out or maybe it was the girls running around the house in and out of rooms screaming and wild all hypered up cause of her or maybe she was just a chicken whatever she didnt come back she didnt come back all the way just stopped in the middle right back there gesturing behind her then she gives me a look and laughs and shakes her ass outta here laughing loud so the neighborhood could hear thats what she was after to humiliate us milo said so what do we do for the next round of yuks try to find lyle we got in the unmarked and he drove back to ventura boulevard sure he said lets call out the hounds and track the sonofabitch and when we find him well have a weenie roast and tell ghost stories while were at it we can work in some fishing fishing and hunting i said wonder how many firearms hes packing given that bad eye of his he wouldnt be much good with a bow and arrow janes dead and he just happens to be gone i said ill call the sheriffs up at castaic see if they can locate him but im not putting in a requisition for a search party lyle may have all the charm of a warthog with piles but at this point before the ballistics and the registration on the gun that did jane come in hes no suspect and her other husband is ruiz and gallardo should have word soon enough on all of it even if the gun was registered to jane or mel i said that doesnt rule out an outside shooter lets say jane was afraid made a run for the bedroom and grabbed her own gun but whoever frightened her got hold of it when it comes to theories you are human flypaper my friend first dugger for dr bloodlust now father of the year for lyle ive always been goaldirected me too he said least thats what my thirdgrade teacher said but screw goals i need to connect the dots and right now i dont even have a pencil at white oak he said the thing that bothers me is maybe i narrowed my focus too quickly im not saying the duke thing or lyle is wrong but theres always the danger of tunnel vision what do you mean i know lauren meant something to you but the hard truth is she sold her body for a living and women who do that live dangerously the whole thing could trace back to some other john hell i havent even followed up on her supposed modeling the garment industry connections theres a real clean business for you sweatshops and kickbacks what about shawna and duke i said he rotated his head winced rubbed his face i dont know alex my gut still tells me shawna isnt related to the rest of it your guts worth listening to thanks doc see you next session we traveled in silence all the way to beverly glen and valley vista where milo began the trip back to the city he let out a long raspy sigh i respect your intuition also alex but even an oc pit bull takes a breather between bouts lets both step back for a while maybe try to relax chapter robin said first the daughter now the mother we were on the big couch in the living room she was sitting at the far end just out of reach still wearing her work overalls and her red tshirt id come home determined to put everything aside had ended up talking about all of it laurens aborted therapy phil harnsbergers party michelle shawna jane abbot mel abbots senescent terror death kills confidentiality youre making it sound like a confession she said whose yours the whole sordid tale as if youve done something wrong as if youre a main player in all of it and not just an extra she looked away its almost as if shes seduced you lauren not sexually you know what i mean i guess i shouldnt be surprised seductions how she made a living i dont see that at all she got up went into the kitchen returned with two bottles of water and handed me one sitting just as far whats wrong i said you saw this girl what twice ten years ago yet youve convinced yourself that youre obligated to clarify every detail of her life people like that dont lend themselves to solutions for them its always problems people like that outcasts troubled souls patients call them what you will didnt you tell me one thing you had to learn so as not to become a toxic sponge was how to let go its not a matter of letting go what then alex her voice was low but there was no mistaking the edge is there anything else thats bothering you i said that she said was very shrinky sorry your minds a fine piece of machinery alex ive never encountered anything like it youre like a precisely tuned watch always ticking relentless but sometimes i think you use what god gave you to dig ditches lowering yourself these people i reached for her and she allowed me to touch her fingertips but she exerted no stretch that would have allowed me to hold her the thing is she said you get yourself on a track and you just keep running people around this girl tend to die alex and you havent even considered the possibility that you might be in danger the people whove died knew her well she sighed and got up listen ive got work to catch up on catch you later what about dinner not hungry you are not happy with me on the contrary she said im very happy with you with us thats why id like us both to keep breathing for a while theres no danger i wouldnt do that to you again to me why dont you start thinking of yourself check out your own boundaries what youll allow in and what you wont she bent and kissed my forehead i dont mean to be cruel baby but im weary of all this surmising and ugliness you did what you could keep telling yourself that i spent the night alone listening to music but ingesting no harmony trying to read anything but psychology waiting for robin to come back in the house by eleven she hadnt and i went to bed early for me and woke at am fighting the urge to bolt exhausted yet charged using every relaxation trick in my repertoire to fall back asleep i endured the tension for two more hours until robins eyes opened and i pretended to be ready to greet the day she smiled at me tousled my hair showered alone but made coffee for both of us and sat down with the first section of the paper if jane abbots murder had made the edition she didnt say i took the metro pages nothing there by eight shed headed back to the studio and i was running up in the hills harder than usual punishing my joints trying to sweat off adrenaline id promised myself to avoid the paper but when i got back i thumbed quickly and found the summary of jane abbots death on page worded nearly exactly as id predicted senile husband shocked neighbors domestic tragedy investigation pending i finished up some court reports a couple of personal injury cases where kids had experienced psychological sequelae and a custody battle with wealthy protagonists that might never end unless the principals died printing signing sealing and addressing my findings to various judges i reviewed my ledger books and tried to figure out if id owe taxes in april by eleven i still hadnt figured it out by eleventhirty robin bopped in spike in tow and informed me she had to deliver two repaired dangelico archtops to the los feliz home of a movie star who was considering playing elvis in an upcoming flick elvis never played dangelicos i said that should be the worst of it this guys got a tin ear a peck on the cheek hard maybe dismissive and she was off by noon i was jumping out of my skin at twelveeighteen i gave up and drove away west toward santa monica the ocean figuring id just cruise by ben duggers highrise then take a nice relaxed drive north on ocean front down the ramp to pacific coast highway malibu day at the beach nothing to do with lauren because lauren had left no clues in malibu and why should i avoid an entire coastline i could be as californian as anyone but when i passed the building dugger was standing out in front and i reduced my speed to a crawl standing alone checking his watch looking rumpled and tense in a tan corduroy sport coat white shirt gray slacks flicking his wrist again glancing at the ramp of the underground parking garage circling the block i returned cruising as slowly as i could without drawing the ire of other motorists that left me mere seconds to stare but it was enough to catch a glimpse of a greenjacketed figure the diminutive gerald pulling up in duggers old white volvo getting out saluting opening the door for dugger dugger gave him a tip and got in i drove fifty feet veered to the curb parked in front of a hydrant waited until the volvo chugged by allowing three cars to get between us i began the tail knowing this time i couldnt risk discovery figuring i could pull it off no reason for him to suspect he turned right onto wilshire headed east to lincoln picked up the east freeway and transferred to the south the route to newport beach probably just checking out the office soon the seville and i would be several dozen miles older with nothing to show it beat sitting around the house working at mellow but instead of continuing to orange county he exited at century boulevard and continued west lax signs all over flying somewhere i hadnt seen luggage but perhaps the car was already packed he headed into the airport maintaining the threecar shield i stayed with him as he entered a parking lot opposite terminal several airlines shared the lot most prominently american the driver in front of me had trouble figuring out how to take the ticket from the machine and by the time i got inside the volvo was nowhere in sight no parking spaces on ground level and i took the ramp down hoping dugger had done the same sure enough i spotted the volvos square back just as dugger nosed into a corner space between two suvs he got out and alarmlocked the car carried no luggage as he headed for the elevators i chanced parking the seville in an illegal space and hurried after him i hid behind a concrete pylon as he stepped into the lift ran over in time to read the illuminated numbers two flights up the footbridge to american airlines vaulting up the stairs i cracked the stairwell door and saw him lope past but he didnt take the right turn toward the escalator that led down to the ticket gates continuing straight toward the army of phony nuns and preachers hawking for nonexistent charities he dropped a coin in a cup and walked hurriedly to the metal detectors long queue of travelers at the single device in service and one sleepylooking security attendant so no problem putting space between us there i watched dugger place his wallet and keys in a plastic dish and keep his eyes on them as he sailed through but the two people in front of me set off the machine and i was forced to cool my heels as dugger disappeared around a bend finally i got through and walked briskly through hordes of travelers and loved ones flight attendants and pilots no sign of dugger during the moments id lost sight of him he couldve gone anywhere the mens room a shop any of the gates i strolled up the corridor trying to look casual searching for a flash of tan jacket then i came to an elevator that led to the private lounge the admirals club members only a woman sat behind a counter to the right busy at her computer dugger was a rich kid why not affluence could also explain no luggage he might have turnkey access to hideouts in aspen the hamptons jackson hole santa fe as i approached the elevator the woman behind the counter smiled may i please see your membership card sir i smiled back and walked away the elevator was in open view of the terminals main artery if dugger was in there i had no way to observe his comings and goings without being spotted myself no there he was twenty feet in front of me stepping out of a mens room i ducked behind an automated insurance machine and pretended to estimate actuarial odds as dugger whipped out a handkerchief and blew his nose a nice heavy rush of newly arrived travelers added further cover dugger stashed the hankie and consulted his watch again paused at a bank of tv monitors set into the wall resumed walking checking arrivals not going anywhere meeting someone i stayed behind dugger as he entered the main reception area a wide circular noisy space around which the bigbodied jets docked he bought a pretzel at a kiosk took a nibble frowned tossed what was left into a trash basket yet another consultation of his watch nervous a newsstandsourdough bread outlet occupied the center of the terminal and i stationed myself at the paperback rack pulled out a stephen king and stuck my nose between the covers i had a good clear view of dugger as he made his way to gate a walked up to the glass wall that offered a view of the landing strip and peered through a big fat sat in the bay he walked over to the desk asked the ground clerk something remained expressionless as she nodded plenty of empty seats in the arrival lounge but he stayed on his feet paid further homage to his watch took another gander at the plane very nervous i was too far away to read the flight information at a placing the book back on the rack i edged closer the flight numbers remained blurry but i was able to make out new york dugger remained near the glass wall for a while before pacing some more tugging at his collar rubbing the crown of his scalp where the hair had deserted it when the door to a finally opened he gave a small start and hurried forward he edged to the front of the greeting crowd standing with three uniformed livery drivers holding signs and a young shapely woman rocking twoyearold twins in a dual stroller the limo drivers clients emerged first a whitehaired couple a bespectacled black giant in a fivebutton creamcolored suit and a bedraggled sallow unshaven wraith in his twenties wearing dark shades and a foodstained tshirt whom i recognized as an actor on a cheesy tv comedy then duggers quarry thickset swarthy man in his midforties wearing a wellcut black suit and glossy black silk shirt buttoned to the neck black hair in a dense dark crew cut beetle brows simian hairline only inches from the shelf of his brow not tall fiveeight or nine but at least one ninety maybe more a dense cubic mixture of muscle and fat his brown neck bulged over the collar of the silk shirt suggestions of upperbody bulk and massive strength were enhanced by good tailoring flat prizefighters nose huge hands squinty eyes thin lips he toted a single piece of carryon a sleek blackleather bag that dugger offered to take black suit refused scarcely nodded at dugger barely touched duggers hand as they shook no smiles exchanged just a curt nod from black suit and the two of them were off black suit running a palm over his bristly head dugger hurried to keep pace as the stocky man pressed toward the ground transportationbaggage claim sign then black suit pointed to the newsstand looked right in my direction said something changed direction and headed toward me how could he have seen me no there was no alarm in his eyes just that same solid flatness i backed away just in time to find an observation point behind a support column as the two of them reached the newsstand they didnt enter remained near the register in front of the candy rack where black suit stopped and considered chewing gum options lifting packs reading ingredients finally he settled on a doubledecker juicy fruit popped two sticks in his mouth pocketed the wrappers chewed energetically as dugger paid the cashier the two of them exited the reception hall black suits luggage was among the first to bounce down the ramp onto the carousel a pair of midsized valises in that same expensivelooking ebony leather probably calfskin first class tags once again black suit rebuffed duggers attempt to tote swinging the strap of the carryon over his shoulder and hefting a suitcase in each hand with no apparent strain id hovered at the neighboring carousel well concealed among a group of arrivals from denver keeping dugger and black suit in steady view trying without success to read their lips very little conversation anyway mostly onesided dugger made an occasional comment while black suit chomped his gum and played sphinx i stuck with them on their rapid march to the parking lot was two minutes behind the volvo as it left the airport back on the freeway north return to la this time dugger took the wilshire west exit and drove into brentwood and i assumed hed be heading for his la office soon to be the exclusive headquarters for his alleged consulting group but once again he proved me wrong passing the blackandwhite office building and continuing into santa monica back to the ocean front highrise then why hadnt he switched to the west no he was swinging a quick right onto nineteenth street i turned too in time to see him hook another right nosing into an alley that fed into a parking lot behind several storefronts stationing the volvo in an empty slot behind a rear door red white and green sign brooklyn pizza guys plastic pie above the lettering i stopped backed up to the mouth of the alley the sevilles grille barely extending past a driveup dry cleaners just close enough to see the white car dugger stepped out of the volvo looked at his watch yet again black suit was more relaxed than hed been at the airport swinging his legs out with unexpected grace looking up at the sky stretching yawning still chewing like mad dugger made for the door to the restaurant but black suit just stood there and dugger stopped the thickset man squeezed his eyes into slits scratched his head buttoned his suit jacket and rolled his neck working out kinks after the crosscountry flight but other than this gesture showing no signs of discomfort no anxiety either on his broad brown mask of a face mr tough guy he said something to dugger who returned to the car and produced a white tissue black suit extricated his gum wrapped it in the paper placed the paper in his pocket then he nodded waited as dugger held open brooklyn pizza guys back door and passed through with an imperial air gourmet lunch for a goombah the guy had brooklyn all over him the way she was hogtied and headshot tells me this was all business central casting goombah i was willing to bet the pizza joint sported checked tablecloths and strawwrapped chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling sometimes people defy stereotypes mostly they lack imagination goombah traveling firstclass with expensive luggage highpriced specialist a guy who lived well when a wellheeled client was paying the bills i drove up the alley exited at twentieth street drove to the drugstore where dugger had bought goodies for the churchschool kids and bought a cheap camera the wonders of technology for a few bucks you could get one with a zoom then back to nineteenth where i parked on the street and returned on foot to brooklyn pizza guys alley entrance stationed myself behind a dumpster and hoped no one would spot me i was lucky the neighboring businesses were a hearing aid store and an employment agency and neither seemed to be meriting any rearentrance traffic but the dumpster reeked of rotten produce and it was thirtythree smelly minutes before dugger and black suit reemerged the restaurants air conditioner chugged away more than loud enough to cover the sound of my click click click nice clear medium shot of the two of them side by side closeup of dugger biting his lip then one of black suits impassive face and flat dark eyes i kept the camera going as they made their way back to the volvo filling the roll with side and rearviews caught them walking in step no amiability all business dugger backed the volvo diagonally across the alley and aimed it west i gave him a twominute lead before starting my own engine chapter dugger drove all the way to ocean avenue bringing a hit man home that surprised me but instead of turning left toward the highrise he made a right and swung into the leftturn lane only a truck between us now but the height of the cab kept me safely out of view as we sped down toward pch i switched to the right lane got close enough to see dugger behind the wheel sitting straight head not moving black suit turned from side to side catching an eyeful of the mansions lining santa monicas gold coast the whiteclapboard palace william randolph hearst had built for marion davies now a crumbling mass of planks generous expanses of beach parking lot that afforded a clear view of the pacific churning and silver under a charcoal cloud bank gulls flecked the clouds with avian static a few wetsuited surfers had paddled out yards from the tide line despite breakers that degraded to a dribble the ocean is never anything but beautiful black suit taking it all in sightseeing dugger stared straight ahead and put on speed he sped through the palisades and into malibu past the latest slide zone and caltranss feeble attempt to battle nature with concrete barriers and sandbags and pink gritty fiberglass slopes as genuine as caltrans promises a few more wet winters and the coastline would look like disneyland black suits head had stopped swiveling fixed on the ocean easy choice the land side was shopping centers and pizza joints and schlock shops not much different from what hed encounter in brooklyn i followed the volvo through carbon beach la costa past the private road that led to the colony the emerald hills of pepperdine university where the commercial clutter gives way to brown mountains black gorges orange poppies and more than a hint of what malibu must have been like when the chumash indians roamed latigo beach the cove colony escondido no suspense i knew exactly where dugger was headed and was ready well before his leftturn signal flashed and he pulled into the center turn lane he stopped a quarter mile before the paradise cove intersection and ramirez canyon a towering plastic sign advertised the sand dollar restaurant and the trailer park that bordered the restaurants private beach malibus estate zone a half mile broken by a handful of gates each handcrafted and unique and flanked by old trees and hedges tooperfect beds of flowers closedcircuit tv cameras no trespassing warnings prime of the prime the few multiacre malibu properties blessed with sheltered coves and sandy beach and views of the shipping channels that lead to asia the gate that held duggers interest was a tangle of burnished copper tentacles shadowed by the palms and pines i remembered as well as gigantic rubber trees and schefflera and sagos and birdsofparadise blazing flamelike in the afternoon sun he must have had a remotecontrol unit because before he completed the turn across pch the octopus arms swung open and he sailed through i had my cheapie camera ready and hustled for shots of the volvos rear end as it vanished into green click click click the gates closed i was going no farther but dugger had a busy day lined up chauffering black suit to daddys place the pleasure dome conceptual lightyears from the little cell in newport that dugger had once called home for all his rumpled guy pretense attempts to distance himself from his father and what his father represented when things got rough junior returned with the volition of a homing pigeon walking in step with a coldfaced man in a black suit business tying up loose ends who was next i returned to santa monica found a motophoto with a free duplicates banner had a cup of coffee while my film developed then inspected my handiwork most of the roll was taken up by rear shots too distant to be useful but i had managed to snag dugger and black suit together in fullfrontal midrange and in two individual closeups nice clear view of the volvo passing through the coiling copper gates but once again too far to catch the license plate tony dukes address was partially obscured by greenery but no matter those tentacle gates were unique i drove home robins truck was gone and i was ashamed for being happy about that hurrying into my office i called milo the gun that killed jane was registered all right he said no greeting no preliminaries and guess who i said charles manson lauren she bought it two years ago at a big five on san vicente not far from her apartment she probably figured in her line of work she could use protection or maybe she was just another single woman wanting the security of firepower looks like she lent it to her mother and stepdad got hold of it another unfortunate accident so far thats how its going down alex what will mel abbot be charged with i asked the das office is brainstorming because its a tricky situation old helpless guy like that no one dares question abbot until he has a lawyer but hes in no shape to hire one of his own volition hes also too rich to qualify for a public defender but they may assign him a temporary pd anyway in addition to an advocate from competency court ruiz and gallardo are searching for relatives someone willing to assume responsibility meanwhile abbots got a comfy bed in the jail ward at county and the shrinks say itll be a few days before they can even try to get an accurate picture of his mental status once he gets an attorney then what no ones eager to make a showcase out of it my guess is hell be quietly committed nice and neat i said if you call a dead woman and a pathetic old guy ending his days on the funny farm neat everythings relative i said unfortunately i just made a mess what are you talking about i described my afternoon he didnt answer but i had a pretty good idea about the look on his face finally you followed him again i know i said but this time i was really careful he definitely didnt see me the main thing is what i saw you think duggers personally escorting a hit man you had to see the guy he sure doesnt look like a brain surgeon whatever he is alex if he flew in today from new york he didnt kill jane last night in sherman oaks granted but he couldve killed lauren and michelle and lance maybe theres a team musical mafiosi he said thats how id do it if i had the money use pros the locals dont know cover my tracks by transporting them back and forth all that flying means paperwork alex if the guy is a professional a really heavy hitter hed have to worry about that and like i said if youre the contractor a supposedly lawabiding fellow like dugger why would you also pick the guy up at the airport yourself take him out to lunch in plain view then truck him straight to daddys place in broad daylight and give someone the opportunity to snap pictures so you have no interest in looking at the passenger list that he said would require a warrant and grounds okay fine i said he likes black cause hes a priest lost his collar tony duke flew him out for spiritual guidance listen alex i appreciate all youve want me to toss the photos pause you have clear shots of this jokers face clear enough in duplicate he made a sound not a sigh too weary for a sigh ill come by tonight he didnt chapter by ten the following morning my phone was still silent either my brooklyn pizza lens work had paled in comparison to some new lead milo was chasing or given the benefit of a good nights sleep hed decided the snapshots were a waste of time still it was unlike him not to call robin was smiling again and wed made love this morning though id felt some distance probably my imagination when in doubt torment your body i put on running clothes stepped out into a cold wet morning and struggled clumsily up the canyon shoes squeaking on stilldewy vegetation stumbling along the earthen patchwork laid down by a fastshifting sky when i returned the house was echoing hollowly silent but for the whine of the circular saw from robins studio i changed into a sweatshirt old jeans and grubby shoes stuck a dodgers cap on my head and left the air had chilled even further and the sun hid behind a big iron saucer of the same sooty hue as yesterdays cloud bank a tongue of wind whipped past me rattling trees twanging shrubs the earth smelled of loam and iron not winter in any real sense but in la you learn to live with pretense on days like this the ocean was still beautiful i took sunset to the coast highway encountered no obstruction and was speeding past tony dukes copper octopus by twelvethirty no cars were parked on the shoulder and all the gated estates looked forbidding continuing to the paradise cove intersection i turned onto the speedbumped asphalt that dips down past ramirez canyon and ends at the beachfront clearing where the sand dollar sits as i passed the restaurants plastic sign i noticed a rectangle of whitewashed plywood staked a few feet in painted crudely in red the dollars renovation continues sorry folks please remember us when we reopen this summer i bumped my way past the oleanderplanted berms that nearly concealed the trailer park on the north side of the cove no chain had been slung across the blacktop and the splintered placard warning that beach parking was twenty bucks a day if you werent eating at the restaurant appeared in its usual spot bottomed by the halfhearted announcement boogie board snorkel and kayak rentals so far so good west of spring street renovation usually means extinction the dollar was going the way of all la landmarks and i didnt know how i felt about that it had been nearly three years since id tackled a fishermans breakfast from the redvinyl cradle of a sand dollar window booth back in the days when robin and i had rented a drafty beach house ten miles up the coast as we waited out the reconstruction of our burnedout home then a patients childhood nightmares drew me into a longunsolved abduction and murder and the victim turned out to be a waitress at the dollar the questions id asked had overridden six months of generous tips some time later id dropped in for breakfast again hoping all had been forgotten it hadnt and i never returned i drove fifty more yards and the shack that serves as the paradise cove guardhouse came into view the lowered gate was more symbolic than functional i couldve lifted it by hand squeezed the seville through i wondered if it would come to that then i saw movement through the shacks window and the attendant was ready for me when i drove up shaking his head and pointing at yet another sign that reiterated the twentydollar tariff older man seventyfive or so with blue eyes and a beefjerky face shielded by a battered canvas hat big band music played from a tape deck in the shack closed he said down below through the twisting branches of giant sycamores i could see ocean and what remained of the restaurant the redwood façade and half of the shingle roof were in place but empty holes gaped ulcerously where the windows had been and through the wounds was a clear view of walls stripped to the studs and snarls of severed electrical conduit what had once been the parking lot was now a table of raked brown dirt filled with backhoes tractors and trucks sheets of plywood stacks of twobyfours no workers in sight no construction noise big project i said oh yeah said the old man stepping out of the shack he wore a khaki shirt and gray twill pants cinched tight by a skinny maroon vinyl belt didnt see the sign huh they should stick it right out front on the highway so folks dont bother to turn ill raise the yardarm and you can swing a uey i saw the sign i said and held out a twenty he stared at the bill theres nothing to do down there amigo theres still the beach not much of it they got wood and cement blocks and all kinds of garbage piled all over the place havent even had a decent film shoot in months only thing they could film right now would be a disaster movie they might be hotshots but someones not making money they corporate syndicate how longs it been going on months almost a year he looked back at the site owner died kids inherited squabbled sold out to some chain seafood outfit and they sold to some holding company they say theyre gonna preserve it make it even better mostly i see guys in suits driving in and out every so often they bring in a squad of mexicans and theres some hammering and nailing for a few days then weeks of nothing but they keep paying me and they dont bother the rest of us who live up there his thumb hooked toward the mobile homes be nice though to have somewhere to eat out without driving to malibu road yeah i said waving the twenty gonna take a look anyway for old times sake youre sure i dont even think the porta potties are working i can handle it wait till youre my age nice car take much maintenance just a bit its old but it works he smiled like me he started to take the money shook his head aw hell forget it someone asks you though you paid thanks dont thank me just change the oil every two thousand miles and keep that thing alive i parked south of the construction zone well away from the heavy machinery gulls picked and pecked in the dirt and a dozen more birds perched noisily atop what was left of the roof the shingles that remained were windwarped and saltgrayed and shitspecked the birds looked happy enough squawking and jockeying for space i got out righted my baseball cap and ambled south along the cove veering diagonally toward the waterline medium tide no beach chairs like in the old days just plenty of open creamy sand the ocean was even lazier than yesterday oozing in slowly like a giant glue spill its retreat discernible only as the gradually deepening stain of watersaturated silica off at the southern edge was another shack whiteframe like the guardhouse and not much larger the blackboard bolted above the door was crowded with sloppy script in that same bright red proclaiming kayaks snorkels wet suits cold drinks rusty hasp bolted i kept walking walls of bluff rose behind me against the dirt stood a bank of five bright blue plastic andy gumps three of the latrines marked hims two hers next to the male loos was a large pile of something under layers of bright blue tarp i headed toward what was left of the paradise cove pier a few storm seasons ago the gangly structure had been windsheared in two the juttying face washed out to sea and never replaced now the remains condemned and blockaded by county chain link were a listing bleached skeleton the vantage point for yet more noisy gulls and a big solitary dignifiedlooking pelican whod distanced himself from the din a squirt of light hit me fullface as i walked across splotches of yellow sand the glare made me squint and lower the brim of my cap false dawn in the afternoon the flying saucer cloud bank had reversed direction gliding out toward japan and leaving behind a pinkpearl residue through which sun struggled to leak the light that made it through was glossy almost liquid squibs of golden ointment even in this ruinous state the cove was a glorious bit of geography thinking of what tony duke and his neighbors owned i sighted down the coast aiming for a glimpse of the beach estates that claimed the bluffs but the shoreline curved sharply and the only home i spotted was a single glassandwood thing on stilts squat and aggressive ovoid as the cloud bank a door slamming from the direction of the latrines made me turn as a voice behind me said cool huh i completed the swivel focused on a redtan stubbled face a wiry midsized man wearing only baggy red swim shorts standing a few feet away swinging a key chain fatfree torso corded arms knees deformed by calcium knots coarse peroxided hair with black roots was a crown of thorns above his narrow face his sharp nose was crooked and zincwhitened and a puka shell necklace circled a gullet starting to sag the stubble on his chin was white as the zinc forty maybe older you were checking out that starship enterprise deal right he said eyeing the house on the sand know who owns it who dave dell the gameshow host the gameshow host and megagazillionaire guy started out as an am disc jockey bought up malibu land back when lincoln was president got himself a sweet chunk of bluff man hes partnering with the dudes whore doing that cocking his head at the restaurant renovation downtown dudes nice investment i said thats what they live for more and more and more borrowing someone elses money he laughed thing is except for that house of his dells all those humongoid things are on bluffs and most of them got no beach at all they got their views to china but they dont have serious sand because of the way paradise is shaped even the ones that do got some and even at low tide it aint much little squares where you can sit and watch your money wash away cause the whole damn beach is disappearing really you bet man inches each year maybe more you never heard about it sounds familiar i said global warming or something i wasnt sure it was true oh its true all right global warming el niño la niña la cucaracha the ozone layer all that shit one of these days were gonna have this conversation from la brea he laughed again and shook his head the yellow thatch was saltstiff and it didnt vibrate meanwhile a bum like mes got all this sand for free and they got their little private patches of nothing you actually pay twenty bucks to come down here didnt carleton tell you everythings closed up he did but i wanted to see it anyway i pointed down the coast still beautiful yeah another grin sly youre bullshitting me man carleton dont charge no one no more he and the other trailer folk are pissed about what they done to the dollar and i cant say i blame them so they let anyone in free who wants to which isnt too many he shrugged and the puka necklace rattled used to be you couldnt find a parking space and they were filming commercials all the time now its el quieto which is fine with me things change and then you die bye man enjoy as he walked away from me i said i heard tony duke lives in one of those bluff houses he stopped turned hell yeah its nothing but his type and hollywood assholes up there he rubbed his chin looked up into the sun in the full light i saw a canker sore sprouting under his lower lip raw spots on his forehead glistened precancerously dukes place is about five properties down i swam by a few times seeing if i could maybe catch a look at some of those girls he keeps there no luck too bad snort like id know what to do if i found something howd you know which place is his easy you cant see the house its set far back like most of them but dukes got this wooden cablecar doohickey running along the side of his bluff little box on tracks that goes up and down everyone else has steps but hes got that guess the guys serious about leisure like he says wants to waste his calories on pussy not climbing stairs its a cool little deal that car but i never seen anyone actually using it a funicular i said if you say so other guys have gone by there too swimming kayaking especially when dukes got a party going everyone wanting an eyeful of pussy maybe catch some looker sucking dick something you could take a picture of and send home to mom he laughed the gizmos always at the top of the bluff locked up and when dukes partying theres bouncers there big meat like iron pumpers standing on top of the cliff like theyre waiting for someone to piss em off i hear he uses offduty cops for that wouldnt surprise me even scarier right right anyway no one ever gets to see any girls does duke throw lots of parties he used to like every two months youd see the superstretches lined up on pch valets heat lamps caterers trucks the works but not in a long time he thought not in a real long time a year maybe more maybe hes getting too old for it that would be a hell of a thing wouldnt it cool old dude like that living on caviar and viagra surrounded by pussy but losing the desire cause it wouldnt matter how wrinkled his nut bag was and how far down it hung theres one perfume that opens up pussy faster than kama sutra love oil he rubbed his index finger with his thumb and sniffed money i said eau de cash he assented does it every time so old tonys on viagra i said that a fact i dont know if its a fact man but thats what you hear look the dudes got to be what seventy eighty a hundred fifty my dad used to buy his magazine hell maybe the lead in his pencil still is righteous hes got a young wife i seen her she comes in once in a while to the dollar for breakfast used to when there was a dollar he cupped his hands six inches from his chest rack on her never looked happy but i heard she popped a coupla kids for old tony what was she unhappy about who knows the dudes who used to work the parking lot said shed style up in this very cool expedition black with gray trim on the bottom big tires righteous running boards chrome wheels always open her own door before they could reach her then act pissed that they hadnt gotten there in time always in a big hurry the parking dudes used to joke about that she had to rush because the old guy needed her home by the time the viagra kicked in cause thats the way that stuff works you know you drop a pill wait for the old pecker to salute the flag but you only got so much time to pour the pork before its back staring at your shoes he lowered his hand in a long slow flutter maybe thats how the viagra thing started cause she was always in a hurry anyway money dont buy everything right give me my sand a few waves and im styling he pinched his adams apple and touched the canker sore briefly i looked for a surfboard didnt see one you ride huh i said when i can no shape today he laughed hard never any shape here you dont surf paradise man this is work thats my office pointing to the rental shack thought everything was closed hey they pay me to show up i show up he swung the key ring in a wobbly arc you open for any business at all i said i wouldnt snorkel out there man too much silt and a sky like this is gonna reduce your visibility to zippo i was thinking a kayak the crooked white nose lowered as he gave me a long appraising look you dont know squat about waves but you dont have that tourist smell about you either tourist from la i said i used to live in malibu out past leo carrillo came back for old times sake over by el pescador past el pescador over the county line near neptunes net livingston beach he said cool riding zone prime shape you ever try to surf did some boogie boarding i said i graduated that when i was in third grade man moved right on to the heavy stuff i was a hotdogger back in high school got three minutes of footage in water demons ii then my ears went chronic infections the doctor said no more i said screw the doctor but now my head hurts all the time no matter how much advil i drop so i hold down the rides to once a week you serious about a kayak sure why not he looked me up and down again guess no reason its cold out there but its glass except for the rips which way you gonna go south i smiled maybe catch a look at old tonys place he laughed figures but dont get your hopes high he led me toward the rental shack said its a pretty easy day for paddling but going south you are gonna be pushing against the currents you look like you got the shoulders to handle it but just know that okay were not talking lake arrowhead also there is some riptides along the way small ones but theyll bump the boat so dont be looking for tits and ass and start getting pushed out further than you wanna be thanks for the advice how much is the rental hold on he said another thing no matter how glassy it looks and how good a rower you think you are your clothes are gonna get soaked i tell people all the time but they never listen and sure enough they come back with their clothes all stuck to them pissed off only way to stay dry is use a wet suit man i can rent you that too make it a combo i said how much he licked his lips peeled a speck of zinc from his nose first i gotta unlock the place then i gotta find a flashlight so i can check the suits make sure theres no cracks from all the time they been sitting there then i gotta check em for spiders and scorpions crawling in cause we get them here scorpions i said near the beach little black nasty ones you think of em as desert dudes but theyre here man hibernating or whatever probably hitched a ride in on some truck from tj so i gotta stick my hand in and shake out the suit i appreciate it exterminator fees gonna cost me too he laughed well he said normally its twenty bucks an hour for the boat twelve for the suit six for mask and fins so that would be thirtyeight up front and we usually take a drivers license for deposit no mask and fins i said just the boat and the suit your feet are gonna get cold i can live with it your choice man okay how long you planning on staying out cause i wasnt planning to be here all afternoon i mean i show up but i dont make a big thing out of it know what i mean couple of hours at the most couple of hours yeah i can handle that so that would be sixtyfour bucks but for you lets make it a package say fiftyfive even and i wont even take no deposit cause where the hell are you gonna go if its cash wink wink cash it is i said reaching for my wallet he selected a key from the ring slipped it into the lock on the rental shacks door rusty the ocean never stops eating kind of freaky idnt it cool too the oceans gonna be here for a billion more years and were not so why worry about anything the kayaks made up the mass beneath the blue tarp and he pulled a yellowtrimmed white singlerider and a paddle from the shack i stripped behind the tiny building as norris after i paid him he volunteered his name readied the kayak standing naked and shivering in the frigid air i doublechecked the suits neoprene sleeves and legs for creepiecrawlies once i slipped into the rubber sheath the warmth was nearly immediate hey said norris as i emerged he was kneeling next to the boat and wiping down the interior with a filthylooking rag mr lloyd bridges man theres a zip compartment on the left leg for your wallet and keys you can leave the rest of your stuff in your car cool car by the way long as you get back in time i wont steal it jamming the rag in the rear pocket of his shorts he slapped the boats fiberglass flank picked you a good one you ever done this before yup so you know that even when they feel like theyre tipping over theyre probably not if you wanna pick up speed just keep that rhythm going hand over hand and dont let go of the paddle itll float but it can get away from you and if it does i got to charge you we toted the kayak to the waters edge then he eased it into the ocean and held it steady as i climbed in go for it man he said shoving me off you see any serious pussy i want to hear about it chapter the placid ocean meant broad shallows and i had to maintain a twentyfoot distance from the shore to keep the kayak out of sand as i cut through the water a weak misty breeze washed my face after this mornings clumsy jog working my arms felt good and so did being alone in the vastness of the sea i picked up speed as i passed dave dells glass bowl the house was huge but shabby from up close gray paint scarred by wind and salt lowered curtains no signs of inhabitance the next property meandered along the bluff fronted by clumps of roughcut shrubbery and backed by pines twisting spastically rickety steps to the beach dangled the bottom dozen steps had been sheared off as i continued south the breeze picked up and now i was working a bit just to keep from veering back toward land a few minutes later the first sign of riptides appeared narrow pipes of coiling water braiding the skin of the pacific as i passed over them the kayak bucked then settled down gently three more estates two with intact steps so steep they were little more than ladders norriss tale of a fastvanishing beach might have been hyperbole but signs of erosion were obvious in the furrows that corrugated the bluffs an outcropping of rock fingers stretched into the water and i pushed the kayak farther out to sea skimming the eastern border of a floating mass of kelp suddenly the sun hid itself again and the water got dark i was a good fifteen yards from the tide line when tony dukes funicular came into view dukes property was wider and higher than those of his neighbors and his property line was more sinuous a series of scurves created as the cliff twisted and relented the hillside had been planted with succulents but all that remained were scraggly graygreen patches and the erosion scars were long and deep impossible to mistake for anything but inevitable down below was dukes patch of beach a spoonshaped hollow visible only from the water the funicular was a lowkey affair redwood car and dark metal tracks blending in with the mountainside the passenger compartment rested atop the cliff shadowed by a brown metal arch that i assumed was some kind of power source the tracks dropped from the hilltop to the sand in a nearvertical drop adhering to the dirt as if by magic if plants couldnt take root could metal bolts be trusted someone thought they could nestled in the spoon were a woman in a beach chair and two small whiteblond children i was too far away to make out the womans age her big straw hat and blowsy white dress provided no help the kids looked to be around three or four the smaller one a girl in a pink onepiece bathing suit sat in the sand legs splayed digging with a bright orange shovel and adding sand to a green bucket several feet in front of her a naked boy ran along the shore kicking water picking up clumps of seaweed and tossing them ineffectually at the ocean the womans body was loose in a way that could mean only sleep or hypnosis in the sand near her right arm something glassy kicked back reflection i stopped rowing backpaddled to remain in place and watched them the naked boy saw me stared back raised his arm not a greeting a tightfisted wave combative the woman didnt move i resumed rowing slowly the breeze bumped me over a riptide and water splashed into the boat the air was colder and the pool around my bare feet had become an ice bath when i was well past the duke estate i looked back the little boy had lost interest in me was in thighhigh water splashing i drifted past several more properties caught sight of a couple of cathedralsized houses but no people the wind had grown adamant and my feet immersed in salt water were numb i crossed a few more rips found easy water sat there for a while bobbing and staring out across the ocean wondering why id come a shadow passed over the kayak as a pelican a big fat gray creature maybe the bird id seen atop the pier glided toward the horizon i watched the bird cross the kelp bed and settle waiting dipping retrieving gulping oblivious to anything but the task at hand a jowly monarch i rowed a bit more hit increasingly angry waves fifty minutes had passed since id slipped into the wet suit time to get back id be bringing back no tales of naked babes for norris and nothing of an evidentiary nature for milo the little towheads were most likely tony dukes second installment of offspring and the woman could be anyone as i began the row back i decided not to tell milo of my little ride maybe hed call today maybe not onehanding the kayak into reverse i began my return trip rowing faster and staying as close to the shore as the shallows would allow because the wind had kicked up the waves working up a chilly sweat by the time the funicular appeared the cable car remained at the top inert but the woman in the white dress was on her feet now hatless running golden hair streaming arms spread wide her mouth open too as she raced for the water i was too far to make out the words but i could hear her scream and the tone was unmistakable panic the little girl in the pink bathing suit hadnt budged and the orange shovel was still in her hand but no sign of the naked boy then i saw him a little white dot bobbing in the water maybe twenty yards due north of the kayak just a towhead no arms bouncing like a pingpong ball so insignificant that i might have mistaken him for flotsam a stray bit of styrofoam the goldenhaired woman ran into the ocean just as the ocean swelled and the boy disappeared i rowed toward the spot where id spotted him saw the riptide tight luminous funneling no sight of him the woman was in the water the little girl had gotten to her feet and was toddling after her i began rowing frantically found my progress too slow wormed my way out of the kayak and dove into the icy water even a quiet ocean can make a man feel weak this ocean cared nothing for my selfesteem i dove stroked dove stroked fixing my eye on the spot where the boy had gone down thrown off by the rips and by waves now freshly stoked by a fullforce wind the funnels werent strong enough to pose a danger to someone of my size but they slowed me down made it harder to focus on my destination i swam as hard as i could got close to the spot still no sign of the boy there he was ten yards farther out face whitened by sunlight bouncing no sign of his arms but he seemed to be staying afloat treading water good swimming skills for his age but how long could he last the water was icy and i felt my own muscles clog i threw myself into the currents concentrated on keeping his blond head in my sights watched helplessly as he went under again and when he resurfaced he was five yards farther from shore being rolled out to sea slowly but inexorably the womans screams sounded behind me audible above the roar of the tide i changed course widening the angle of juncture as i estimated where the rips would take the boy and swimming toward that point thinking about all those drowned kids id evaluated at western peds active little boys mostly survivors with damaged brains i reached the spot no boy had i miscalculated where the hell was he a quick glance back at the shore told me i hadnt lost my bearings the woman in the white dress was swimming too but shed covered only a third of the distance was having trouble as the garment bloused about her like a deflated parachute behind her the chubby little girl edged toward the water i started to warn her caught sight of the boys head then his entire body fifteen feet ahead tossed like a scrap of kelp as a wave pushed him up and dunked him out of sight and now he looked scared i raced toward him only to see gravity return him to the depths yet again his arms were thrashing wildly losing control flinging myself across the riptide that had snared him i reached out got hold of wet hair a skinny arm then a small bony torso that writhed in my grip circling his body with one arm i held his head above water and began paddling back toward land he fought me kicked my ribs butted my chest shouted in my ear tiny teeth bit down on my earlobe and it was all i could do not to let go strong for his size and despite his ordeal he was feisty growling and spitting intent on chomping my ear again i managed to pinion both his arms and forced his head away from mine using my chin as i continued toward the beach he howled and bucked and butted his little skull against my collarbone when the water shallowed sufficiently i stood and held his thrashing little body at arms length his scrunchedup triangular face emitted a hoarse cry of outrage good strong lungs nicelooking kid four or five down he screamed put me down shitpoop asshole down soon enough my little gentleman i said catching my breath behind me a woman sobbed baxter and slender white hands tipped by long red fingernails yanked the boy from me i searched for the little girl in the water up to her knees the woman in the white dress was hugging the boy her back to the little girl i pointed should i get her or you the woman swiveled sharply young very young same triangular face as baxter greenblue eyes followed my finger and she froze the baggy dress had soaked her to the skin gauzy white cotton deepening to flesh tone as it clung to her torso outlining toofull breasts the grayish purple assertion of nipples a sweep of abdominal swell tiny tidepool of navel pit the stippled outline of white lace bikini panties labial cleft visible beneath the lace oh she said but she still didnt move and the toddler was now up to her waist laughing and splashing tiny little thing two and a half was my guess with plenty of baby fat a convex tummy a budmouth open in wonderment white hair topknotted sand crust on her belly the wind was strong enough to rustle the trees along the bluff and foothigh breakers slapped the sand baxter said the woman voice quivering look at what sage is doing you guys are going to kill me still holding the boy she moved toward the girl tripped fell dropped the boy who ended up with a mouthful of sand and began choking and screaming i hurried toward sage hearing the woman call out ohmigod im so stooopid i reached the child just as she fell on her rear and gulped water and broke into sobs when i swooped her up she stopped crying immediately giggled touched my lip with a tiny gritty finger giggled again and tried to poke my eye hey cutie i said cootie heh heh poke poke i restrained the finger and she found that hilarious i carried her back to the blond woman and handed her over baxters mouth was clean and grinning crookedly he glared at me proclaimed no fish and shook his fist he thinks he was fishing said the woman he thinks its your fault he didnt catch anything sorry i said baxter scowled big fisherman said the woman i cant believe he actually did that he never did it before thats kids i said always something new no fish opined baxter fiss echoed sage what you have an opinion too you little wild thing said the woman she bent and stared at both kids that was silly really silly both of you were silly right no reply baxter had turned profoundly bored and his sisters attention was taken up by the sand at her feet the woman said you wild wild things for all i know there are sharks out there that could eat you sharks to me isnt that true before i could answer she repeated sharks to eat you the possibility made baxter smile wider but for a few sand scratches on his chest he looked unscathed oh you think its funny would you like that huh would you to be eaten by a shark gobbled up like youre his big mac or something would either of you like to be a big mac no way said baxter cocking one leg i eat him the little girl giggled youre impossible said the woman youre both impossible she straightened folded her arms under her breasts turning the nipples into twin torpedoes she had a husky but girlish voice beautiful lightly freckled white skin looked barely out of her teens full soft lips dainty chin long neck and the greenblue eyes were enormous and widely spaced under plucked eyebrows no makeup but for the extravagant red talons and toenails glossed in the identical shade fuckin shark said baxter fug shaaf said the girl oh jesus said the woman grabbing each of them by the hand and shaking her head breathing hard and fast but her breasts barely moved too big and too firm and the rest of her was too slender to support a chest that robust solidity courtesy the scalpel i dont think i stared but maybe i did because she seemed suddenly to become aware of her body of being for all intents stripped naked by the secondskin wet dress she gave a tiny knowing smile flipped her hair peered into my eyes as i forced them to keep away from the curves below trailing her eyes now i saw flecks of amber in the big clear greenblue irises down her own body then her gaze shifted to me as she conducted a quick appraisal of my wet suit smiling again she turned and clenching a child in each hand dragged them back to the spot where shed fallen asleep walking slowly with a swivelhipped tiptoe prance that jiggled her rear i followed and she had to know that but she paid me no mind all the way to her beach chair the straw hat lay halfburied in the sand the shiny thing id seen from the kayak was an evian bottle i realized id forgotten about the kayak and turned sharply the boat had come aground upended almost square with the spot where id brought baxter the ear biter to shore i jogged over pulled it out of the tides way became aware of the throbbing in my ear touched the lobe inspected my finger no blood but those little teeth had done their job and the flesh was still dimpled and hot back in the spoonshaped shelter the woman in the wet dress remained on her feet saying something to both kids sage looked up at her but baxters attention had drifted back to the ocean and when he moved toward the water the woman held him back then she waved at me i jogged back please tell him she said when i arrived there are sharks out there right smoothing down the soaked dress pressing the fabric flush against her skin fuckin shark said baxter growling happily and gnashing those killer teeth eat eat eat eat eat eat grrr sage laughed well arent there the woman demanded of me big killer whites or whatever as big as dragons like from jaws she gnashed too small sharp white incisors of her own her nipples had swelled to cherries there just might be some kinds of sharks in there i said to the kids sharks and all kinds of other fish there you go said the woman listen to this man bax he knows with all those sharks and fish and sea monsters in there youd be nothing but food right the boy chortled and tried to break free once more the woman held on to him and whined stop youre hurting my arm you are really going to kill me wild thing and you should know better too sagearooroo what got into you you always hated the water sage dropped her head her lips trembled oh no said the woman scooping her up dont start crying now cmon sweetie nibbins cmon cmon no tears now youre a good girl you dont have to cry good girls dont have to cry sage sniffed cried oh please sagey mommy just doesnt want anything to happen to you okay you understand sages nose began running and she licked away snot baxter said ew boogers and yanked on his mothers arm she yanked back raised her voice now just set yourself down both of you pushing both children down onto the sand good now just stay there dont move or no tv and no pizza or fao schwarz or digimon or pokémon or nothing okay neither child responded good to me you must think im a horrible mother but hes impossible never sits still when he was a baby every time i walked through a doorway carrying him he used to stick out his head and bump banging his head on purpose raising these lumps i used to worry everyone would think he was abused or something you know a glance back at sage and now you too the little girl said uuuuu the woman blew a raspberry smoothed her dress again heightening the virtual nudity shes usually my good one what a day i smiled she smiled back stuck out her hand i havent thanked you have i im really horrible thank you sooo much im cheryl alex thank you alex thank you very very much i dont know what i wouldve done if you hadnt the greenblue eyes took another trip down my wet suit do you live around here no i was just kayaking well thank god you were if you hadnt happened to tears filled her eyes ohmigod its just starting to hit me what couldve im so she shivered hugged herself looked at me as if inviting a hug but i just stood there and she emitted several highpitched whimpers plucked at an eyelash now her lip quaked both kids stared up at her sage seemed stunned and for the first time baxter looked penitent i squatted down beside them sifted sand through my fingers mama kie said sage with wonder her lower lip jutted mama will be fine i said drawing a small circle in the sand sage dotted the middle baxter said mommy cheryl stopped crying crouching down she gathered both children to her artificial breasts mama fine said sage yes i am nibbynib thanks to this nice man thanks to alex she held on to the kids as her eyes locked onto mine listen i want to give you something for what you did not necessary i said please she said it would make me feel better to at least you saved my babies and i want to give you something please she pointed up at the top of the cliff we live here just come up for a second youre sure its okay of course i am im ill bring the car down and we can ride up youd be helping me anyway it scares me the car im always afraid theyll fall out or something you can hold on to baxter youll be doing me a favor okay sure her smile was sudden warm rich as she leaned over and kissed my cheek i smelled sunscreen and perfume baxter growled thank you so much she said for letting me give you something she walked over to the straw hat lifted the brim and pulled out a small white remotecontrol unit the push of a button triggered the cable cars descent soundless but for an occasional bump where an odd rail protruded neat huh she said to the kids neat right not too many people have something this cool neither child answered i said sure beats climbing cheryl laughed tossed her hair well you couldnt exactly climb that unless you were a a lizard or something i dunno i mean i like to work out weve theres a great gym up at the house and im real physical but no way could i climb that right no way i agreed noay said sage i could climb it said baxter pizza cake sure you could honey cheryl patted his head it is kind of neat being able to ride down whenever you want he it got put in a long time ago muffled thump as the car came to rest six inches above the sand okay here we go all aboard ill take sage and you hold on to him okay the compartment was roofless glass panels in a redwood frame redwood benches large enough for four adults i got in last feeling the car sway under my weight cheryl sat baxter down but he immediately stood no way josé she said returning him to his bench and stretching his arm toward mine i gripped his hand and he growled again and glared i felt strangely like a stepfather close the door alex okay make sure its locked good okay here we go another button push and up we went hugging the cliff the transparent walls gave the ride a weightless feel floating in air as the view expanded to infinity a brief dank wave of vertigo washed over me as i caught a stunning brainfull of ocean and sky and endless possibilities norris might be right about the millionaires and their pitiful scraps of beach but this was something too the trip was less than a minute of baxter squirming sage growing drowsy and cheryl staring at me from under halflowered lids as if i had something to look forward to her legs were long smooth subtly muscled perfect and as she flexed she allowed them to spread offering a view of soft inner thigh highcut lace panties the merest hint of postwax stubble and goose bumps peeking out beyond the seam baxter was staring at me i held on tight to his hand when we reached the top the car paused for a second changed course drifted horizontally bumped to a halt under the metal arch home sweet home said cheryl at least kind of chapter the funicular set us down on a concrete platform and we walked to a waisthigh redwoodandglass fence set twenty yards behind the cable unit the barrier stretched the width of the property at least three hundred feet and halfway to the northern edge a husky man in a gray uniform stooped and sprayed glass cleaner from a blue bottle the area between the cliff edge and the fence was a hundred thousand dollars worth of packed brown malibu dirt no need to conserve space the expanse before me was twenty acres minimum maybe more twenty calculated acres the earth had been bunched into toogentle slopes of a symmetry that wouldve amused mother nature then cloaked with emerald sod beds of tropical vegetation had been cut into the grass and medallions of flowers sprouted baublebright granite paths some hooded by pink marble arbors laced with scarlet bougainvillea others sunwhitened sickled through perfect lawns under the selective shade of specimen trees maybe half a thousand trees grouped in copses and pruned sculpturally as calculated for size and shape as cheryls breasts the beat of the ocean continued to work its way up but it competed now with new water music waterfalls at least a dozen minicataracts tumbling into rock pools that seemed to sprout from nowhere the soda spritz of skywardaimed fountains jetted from freeform rock ponds some occupied by swans and ducks and pink flamingos bird cries in the distance didnt belong to any native species and something that mightve been a monkey shrieked i said sounds like someones got a zoo all kinds of animals said cheryl smiling enigmatically and moving several steps ahead of me long blond hair flapping against her back sage was slung over her shoulder sleeping soundly cheeks bunched tiny mouth a vermilion squiggle baxter held my hand without offering resistance his pace had slowed and his eyelids fluttered and when i lifted him into my arms he didnt fight and i felt his body go heavy against mine cheryl walked faster lagging slightly behind allowed me to check out the estate no buildings in sight just greenery and now the fountains ejaculations had drowned out the ocean a few acres to the right the lawn sloped to a silver mirror an unfenced darkbottomed swimming pool the size of a small lake no birds how did they keep them out no swimmers either but for us and the glass cleaner no humanity the place had all the intimacy of a restricted resort and i halfexpected some officious sort to dart out from the shrubbery and check my membership card cheryl turned onto a path and we passed behind beds of tall flowering pampas grass hedges of variegated mock orange a grove of twostory hollywood junipers studded with bluegray berries the trees obscured the rest of the property and i caught up with cheryl when her hip bumped mine a couple of times and i didnt react her jaw set and she surged ahead of me again the junipers gave way to a planting of cattails and i resumed sneaking peeks between the stalks up ahead and to the right were high peachstucco walls black angled court lights hinted at tennis and a rubbery thumpthump said relaxed competition a sharp twist of the pathway revealed a building a quarter mile up at the terminus of a palm colonnade more peach walls and an italianate heap the size of the white house under a royal blue roof the pathway forked and cheryl chose the route that took us away from the house through an allée of orange trees several smaller buildings cropped up along the way acres away similarly colored heavily plantshrouded then a few people women in navy blue uniforms sweeping the walkways stout darkhaired women with bowed legs dresses hanging below the knees norris and the parking lot dudes would be crushed we entered a dark bamboolined culdesac walked five hundred feet turned sharply east at the end of the path stood a onestory house only twice the size of the average suburban dream a trellistopped front loggia was burdened by a mass of halfdead trumpet vine more bamboo towered at the back the same peach walls and cerulean roof up close i saw that the stucco had been sponged to a mottled finish and lacquered glossy the worn mediterranean villa look complete with artificial age scars at the corners peeled back to reveal ersatz brickwork huge double doors of weathered walnut looked genuinely ancient but any attempt to evoke the aegean or le côte dazur was killed by the roof tiles some kind of spaceage composite too bright too blue cheesy enough to top a pizza here we are said cheryl over her shoulder my place nice she tossed her hair its temporary i used to have a place of my own then whats the difference she hurried toward the double doors yanked the handle resistance pitched her forward and sages head bobbled locked she said i left it open shit someone mustve locked it patting the pockets of the dress shit i didnt take a key now i feel really stupid hey it happens she faced me and the bluegreen eyes narrowed are you always this nice nope i said you caught me on a good day ill bet you have lots of good days she said touching my pinkie with hers but making it sound like a character flaw she licked her lips lovely california girl face fresh healthy unlined even the freckles were perfectly placed natures bounty if you discounted the aggressive mammaries okay she said it looks like im going to have to go find someone to let me in i can leave you with baxter and take sage no i guess you better come with me sure i said she gave a soft breathy laugh you have absolutely no idea where you are do you no idea who owns this place someone with a good stockbroker id say she laughed thats funny her eyelids shuttered closed then opened slowly where exactly are you from alex as in the turnip truck huh im from la cheryl where like the valley west la oh she thought about that because the valley can be a far place sometimes people dont know whats going on over the hill so youre saying this is some kind of famous place i shrugged sorry well she winked conspiratorially i bet you really do know without knowing you know take a guess okay i said some kind of celebrity a movie star if youre an actress im sorry for not no no she giggled ive acted but thats not it someone rich and famous now youre getting warm she looped her pinkie around mine and i thought of how robin had held my index finger as she slept cmon she said guess then one of the double doors opened and she jumped back as if slapped a couple stood in the opening the woman was tall thin slightly stooped in her late thirties with broad shoulders and long limbs squarejawed face black brooding eyes mahogany hair tied back in a ponytail too many worry lines for her age despite the wrinkles a chapped slice of mouth and the grainy vestiges of teenage acne on chin and cheeks she was attractive in a forbidding way some men would go nuts for the challenge she had on a slimcut burgundy pantsuit with black velvet shawl lapels and matching cuffs any curves she mightve owned were concealed by the loose drape of the suit but the gestalt was poised and feminine no jewelry lots of foundation masking the blemishes no problem recognizing her anita duke marc anthonys heir apparent and the new ceo of duke enterprises ben duggers younger sister i searched for resemblance saw nuances of shared chromosomes in the stoop and the sad eyes the man beside her was a few years younger thirtytwo or three and an inch shorter he wore a cream linen suit pink silk tshirt beige sandals without socks a platinum watch with a face the size of a snowball flashed from under his left sleeve thick wrists bristly reddish hair curling up to the knuckles his face was a full ruddy sphere atop a soft seamed neck long thick coarsely wavy hair the color of dirty brass flowed over his ears and trailed past his collar some recession in front exposed a high domed brow sooty puffiness below deepset hazel eyes gave him a sleepy look he had a small straight nose no upper lip to speak of but the lower slab was full and moist and when he smiled at cheryl his teeth were snowy and perfectly aligned strongly built the slightest suggestion of pot above the waistband of his linen trousers if he took care of himself hed remain crudely handsome for a decade or two if not hed end up a falstaffian cartoon cheryl said anita duke softly her eyes were on me what are you guys doing here said cheryl did you lock the door i left it open we had no idea where you were so we locked it cheryl whos your friend alex he i was down on the beach and he ended up helping me helping you anita looked me up and down same onceover cheryl had delivered down on the beach but this scrutiny was impersonal flat and suspicious without the slightest flavor of flirtation trained eye accustomed to judging flesh the longhaired man had been examining cheryls wet dress one of his hands began massaging a button of his suit i had a little trouble said cheryl trouble said anita no big deal said cheryl so whatre you guys doing here we dropped by said the man he had a high nasal voice without looking at me he said doing some diving cheryl said he was boating kent baxter got a little bit in the water and he helped me so i thought it would be nice anita broke in are you saying baxter couldve drowned no no it never got to that point its no big deal guys he just got in the water before i could stop him and the waves got a little i wouldve reached him just fine but alex here was passing by and he was nice enough to jump in thats all alex said the man named kent sounds kind of exciting anita duke shot him a sharp look and he shut his mouth it was no really big deal guys cheryl insisted you know what a good swimmer bax is its just that i had sage on my hands too and by the time alex helped me and i wanted to thank him so i asked him to come up so i could give him something a tip said kent anita said well thats certainly the gracious thing to do to kent why dont you show him our appreciation honey and then you can see him off talking softly but no mistaking the imperiousness theres nothing men despise more than being ordered around by a woman in front of another man longhaired kent smiled and dipped his hand into his trouser pocket but the anger settled around his eyes and his mouth and he threw it back at me a crocodile billfold appeared and he pulled out a twenty and waved it in my face here you go my friend a little more than that kent said anita after all kents mouth turned down and his eyes disappeared among fleshy folds how much you be the judge sure said kent forcing a smile another twenty joined the first id say another offered anita kents smile hung on for dear life out came the billfold again and he thrust the sixty dollars at me my wifes the generous type no thanks i said no tip necessary take it said anita its the least we can do its just as she said no big deal cheryl said anyway i need to get the kids inside ill help you with them said anita give me baxter hes always a handful for you stepping forward she placed her hands around the boys rib cage took him from me kept her face close to mine lets make it an even hundred dollars and then you can go alex nothing i said ill go anyway oh dear said anita holding baxter tight she walked into the house cheryl flashed me a look helpless apologetic then followed kent said let me give you some advice when someone offers you something you should take it just out of courtesy he waved the three twenties donate it to charity i said he smiled i thought i was okay youre a stubborn guy lets get you back to your canoe placing a hand on my shoulder squeezing a little too forcefully and when i resisted he dug his fingers in even harder i freed myself from his grip and his hands rose protectively boxers instincts but still smiling i turned and headed back down the pathway he caught up laughing his pink tshirt spotted with sweat he wore a strong cologne orange brandy and anise and some other scents i couldnt pinpoint what exactly happened with cheryl and bax just what cheryl said the kid wasnt drowning you just decided to play hero at the time it seemed the right thing to do im asking because sometimes she gets careless he said not intentionally more like she doesnt always pay attention pause did she wave for you or did you just volunteer i saw the boy out in the water couldnt tell he was a good swimmer and went after him thats it oh boy he said chuckling ive rubbed you the wrong way sorry i just wanted to know for the sake of those kids im their uncle and more often than not the responsibility falls on my wife and me i didnt answer he said were talking child welfare here my friend i volunteered i said i probably overreacted okay he said so now ive got a straight answer finally grin youre making me work bro he wiped his forehead we walked to the fence in silence when we got there he placed his hand on the gate latch look you did a good deed i really would like to compensate you how about two hundred cash and we call it a deal also id appreciate it if you dont tell anyone about this you live around here tell who anyone sure i said nothing to tell he studied me you dont know who she is i shook my head he laughed whipped out the billfold i shook my head forget it you really mean it dont you he said what are you one of those samaritan guys okay listen if theres anything i can do for you like if you need some work do you do construction stuff or maintenance ive always got something in development did you come from paradise i nodded the restaurant he said thats one of mine were going to turn it into a landmark so if you need a gig he slipped a white business card out of the fold kent d irving vice president and projects manager duke enterprises duke i said not the magazine yes the magazine bro among other things i smiled then how about a free subscription hey theres an idea he slapped my back drew his head back and looked into the sun edging closer crowding me give my office a call well send you a coupla years worth i said i can see why you wouldnt want me talking to anyone can you harder slap well there you go and i know youll show some class not showing class would make a lot of people very unhappy and you dont look like the kind of guy who wants to spread unhappiness god forbid god doesnt always forbid it he said sometimes we have to look out for ourselves he held the gate open waited until id walked to the cable car and boarded then produced a remotecontrol unit of his own big smile and a thumb flick and i was descending he waved byebye i waved back but i was staring over his shoulder a hundred feet beyond by one of the rock ponds where a man in tennis whites stood and tossed something to the flamingos thick torso bulky shoulders a cap of cropped black hair black suit now in tennis whites drawing back his arm he pitched to the birds scratched his head watched them eat kent irving kept his eye on me as i sank out of view chapter when i got back to the broken pier norris was sitting in the sand legs yogicrossed smoking a joint as i dragged the kayak to shore he got up reluctantly and looked at his bare wrist hey right on time any wildlife he offered me the j no thanks just birds the feathered kind oh well he said toking deeply listen any time you wanna take a ride let me know keep bringing cash and ill keep giving you a discount ill bear that in mind yeah good idea what is bearing shit in your mind and not somewhere else rocking on his knees he settled sucked hungrily on the cannabis stared out at the darkening ocean i drove up from the cove to the coast highway turned right and parked on the beachside shoulder with a hundredyard view of the entrance to the duke estate one more hour what could it hurt i ran the tape deck as i slumped in the front seat old recording of oscar aleman riffing on a shiny silver national guitar in some thirties buenos aires nightclub aleman and the band peeling off a haha rendition of bésame mucho that would have done spike jones proud but no mistaking the artistry seven songs later the copper tentacles spread and a gardeners truck emerged hooked a left and sped by then nothing as the rest of the album played out i inserted another cassette the la guitar quartet listened to one complete side and was about to pack it in when the gates swung back again and a black expedition shot out and barreled south on pch silvergray trim along the bottom of the door panels oversized tires chrome running boards windows tinted nearly black cheryls car as described by norris but no way to tell if she was behind the wheel i followed from a safe distance the expeditions brake lights never flashed not even around sharp curves and it paid no homage to the speed limit the former mrs duke in her usual hurry she hadnt displayed any signs of impatience down on the beach or up at the estate why was she still living at the estate a year after the divorce maybe not of her own free will the appearance of anita duke and kent irving had thrown her the two of them letting themselves into the guesthouse without apology anita calling the shots cheryl had capitulated easily to anitas will under the thumb of the duke family some sort of custody issue kent irving had alluded to her poor maternal skills and baxters near drowning backed that up perhaps the duke clan was pressuring her to give up the kids had negotiated her staying close were the kids with her right now the expeditions black windows made it impossible to know i stayed with her past pepperdine university maintained the tail as the suv turned off on cross creek bypassed the fastfood joints and the newer businesses fronting the shopping center and entered the malibu country mart the vintage stores were a series of lowrise wooden buildings arranged around ushaped parking lots and topped by hunter green banners nice view of the malibu hills and landside homes in the distance not too many vehicles at this time of day and i waited until the expedition found its spot hogging two spaces opposite dream babies fragrance and candle boutique i parked the seville as far away as i could near the dumpsters a pattern seemed to be forming cheryl duke climbed out of the suv slammed the door and headed for the candle shop alone no kids shed changed into a red silk tank top that exposed a band of flat ivory belly pipestem white jeans and white sandals with high heels her hair was pinned up loosely and big whiteframed sunglasses blocked the top half of her face even at this distance the bottom half seemed grim she threw back the dream babies screen door and entered and i sat there checking out the neighboring establishments more shoppes than shops bikinis and gym wear nostrums to sooth the skin and the ego souvenirs and tourist art a couple of cafés on opposite ends of the u the eatery farthest from the candle shop advertised coffee and sandwiches and provided two flimsy outdoor tables i took the long way over to avoid being spotted bought a bagel and a cup of kenyan roast from a sicklylooking kid with a blue goatee and a popeye tattoo on the side of his neck someone had left a folded times on the condiments counter and i expropriated the paper and brought it outside both tables were dirty and i cleaned one off and sat down and busied myself with the daily crossword puzzle keeping my head bent except for brief glances at the fragrance boutique ten minutes later cheryl duke exited toting a pair of shopping bags she hooked immediately into brynnas bikinis spent another quarter hour inside and i made my way through the acrosses before being stymied by a fiveletter word for old fiddle she reemerged with an additional bag dipped into bolivian shawl and snuggle for thirteen minutes and when she left that store she was toting three more sacks but looking no happier heading my way i lowered my head filled in a few more blanks came up with rebec for the fiddle because it was the only thing that made sense just as id wrinkled my brow over a threeletter clue for catullus composition i heard her say alex i looked up feigned surprise saw my twin reflections in her sunshades smiling surprised mr innocent hey i said know a sixletter word for indian pony starts with c and ends with se she laughed no i dont think so i cant do that stuff this is weird seeing you again do you come here a lot when im in malibu how about you sometimes we probably passed each other without knowing it probably she said doing some heavy shopping she placed the bags on the ground no just its just something to do maybe its like karma or something seeing you or like when you think about someone and then they keep turning up you know i grinned the sunshades said i was doing okay karma sounds fine to me care for some coffee no thanks the dark lenses moved from side to side taking in the parking lot her bare arms were smooth and lightly freckled no bra under the tank top those nipples again sure why not ill go get some let me i stood and handed her the puzzle see what you can do with this in the meantime cream and sugar a little milk and some artificial sweetener as i turned she took hold of my arm leaning forward and giving me a view of fat white breast tops her finger made a tiny circle on my elbow also decaf she said when i returned she was hunched over the paper whiteknuckling the pen tongue tip protruding between her lips her hair was down and it looked freshly combed i think i got a couple of them she said lynx for wild cat right and burnett for comedienne carol but not that pony one maybe cochise isnt that indian or something hmm i said handing her the coffee no i dont think thats it this connecting ones mayfly so there has to be a y in there oh right sorry i sat down picked up my cup she did the same mmm good she said sipping people who do these things puzzles i always think its amazing ive got street smarts but i never really cared much for school which streets i said phoenix arizona hot like an oven sucked i left there when i was seventeen dropped out before graduation fibbed about my age and got a job in las vegas rollerblading in magic wheels the skating show i guessed yeah you know it i used to be a great skater skated since i could walk magic wheels i said that went on for a while didnt it years but i was only in it for six months sprained my ankle and it healed okay but not good enough for serious skating then i got a place in the line at follies du monde off came the sunglasses her eyes looked serene talking about herself had relaxed her i sat back and crossed my legs looked at the three diamond rings on her right hand the threecarat ruby on her left a showgirl i said well it really wasnt all that just your basic dancing and kicking she said first thing they did was change my name the producers they said i was gonna be a headliner needed a new name whats wrong with cheryl cheryl soames she said its not exactly parisian so whatd they come up with sylvana spring she stared at me waiting it was like a big meeting between me and the choreographer we came up with it together sylvana pretty i thought so it means the woods so like lets take a walk in the woods and spring because whats the best time to walk in the woods the spring i thought it was kind of fresh and poetic anyway i danced my tush off for a year but they never made me a headliner but i kept the name another injury no she frowned and put the sunglasses back on its all politics who does what to who so howd you end up in malibu that is a long long story she tapped the newspaper looked away would you mind if i break off a tiny bit of your bagel i havent eaten all day watching the carbs but i am kinda droopy take all of it no no just a nibble dont tell me youre on a diet no she said i just watch because i mean how long do you have what you have she broke off a crumb chewed swallowed took a bigger bite ended up finishing half of the bagel kids napping i said yup finally its hell getting them tired enough to nap thats why we were down on the beach what a day so anyway i figured why not use the time to look after little old me makes sense i said i want to be honest with you cheryl your brotherinlaw told me who owns the property my brotherinlaw kent irving he said he was baxters and sages uncle which would make him your brotherinlaw right he gave me his card with duke enterprises on it i didnt realize i was on famous ground she frowned hes not their uncle he just likes to say that because its simpler to explain what do you mean his wife anita shes actually their sister baxters and sages their half sister not their aunt that makes her my stepdaughter so i guess kents my stepsoninlaw she giggled pretty weird huh it is a little complicated shes a lot older than me and im her mom dont laugh okay if i start laughing this coffees gonna go right up my nose tipping down the sunglasses she flashed greenblue innocence it is complicated sometimes i cant believe im in the middle of it hey i said blended families happens all the time i guess so kents their brotherinlaw i said and he works for he is your husband right youre married to the famous tony duke not anymore she looked into one of the shopping bags pulled out a red string bikini and held it up what do you think the little i can see is nice oh you she said men they just cant visualize okay i said closing my eyes im visualizing the little i can see is terrific she laughed and dropped the swimsuit back in the bag men think naked is the best but let me tell you a little bit of cloths a whole lot sexier her hand lowered toward her coffee cup digressed and brushed against my knuckles so youre the exmrs duke she slapped my wrist lightly dont say it like that i hate that being an ex being any kind of mrs im twentyfive years old just think of me as cheryl okay or even sylvana mrs is like someone old she breathed deeply and her breasts budged reluctantly cheryl it is i finished my coffee went in for a refill and bought another bagel here you go more nutrition no way she said showing me a palm a few bites of that and ill bloat up and have to be rolled home but after another sip of coffee she began taking tiny chipmunk nibbles and within moments shed gnawed off the top of the bagel look she said i shouldnt even be talking about this anita kent tony weve been divorced for a year if you need to know but what the hey no one can tell me what to do right right the thing about tony is i still feel close to him hes really a great person not at all what youd think what would i think i said you know the whole sex thing the dirty old man stuff i really did do love him just in a different way now hes shaking her head i really shouldnt be talking about this i ran a finger across my lips dont mean to pry youre not prying im blabbing the thing is its totally my life right why should i be always listening to people telling me what to do who tells you what to do anita and kent she picked up the crossword puzzle squinted at the grid blinked these letters are tiny i probably need a new contact lens prescription you know i think that pony clue might be cayuse thats got a y and i think i remember some indian word like that from arizona cayuse ponies whatever take a look what do you think she pressed forward bosoms resting on the table slid the paper toward me you know i said i think youre right excellent a huge smile spread across her face as i filled in the blanks and for a moment she looked very young you must be smart doing these maybe i should start doing them too she said to keep my mind active i get bored a lot theres not much to do at the estate i know i know its everyones idea of paradise what am i bitching about but believe me its boring theres tennis but i hate tennis cause of the sun and how many laps can you swim how many times can you ride that cable car up and down up and down and stare at the ocean even tonys zoo hes got these rare goats and some monkeys and other stuff but it smells bad and its noisy and i dont like animals even the kids are bored with it when theyre up and running around i keep pretty busy but when they nap like now i want to put them both in preschool but so far it hasnt worked out why not so many details she said finding the right place arranging transportation making sure about security security i said like a bodyguard at least somewhere we can be sure theyll be safe there are plenty of movie stars in malibu and they send their kids to preschool but we want to be especially careful could i ask a personal question i might not answer it fair enough i said if youve been divorced for a year why are you still living there well she said thats another long story her hand rested on mine i still want to thank you for being there you know because baxter can swim but he couldve been in trouble i didnt want to make a big deal about it in front of anita so i have something else to thank you for not saying anything no problem what do you do for a living she said this and that i have some investments ooh she said that sounds rich i bet youre not as rich as tony no argument there her hand trailed up my arm tickled my chest touched my lips withdrew why am i still living there she said well after the divorce i had my own place up in los feliz hills a really cool place tony got it for me because of the gates and the security it was a real safe place or at least we thought so tony wanted the best for me sounds like a friendly divorce he was sweet anyway me and the kids were in this great old house in los feliz lots of land all these fancy details this gigantic bathroom with a view of the hills and close to hollywood so one day i took the kids to the egyptian theatre to see a bugs life it was cool they had this whole sideshow next door about bugs and stuff computer games toys bax and sage went crazy afterwards we went out for dinner and ice cream and it was late when we got home and sage was already sleeping on my shoulder and bax was pretty close to conking out anyway i turn the key and we walk into the house and instead of greeting me with a big bark the way she always did bingles thats our dog was this gorgeous standard poodle who won a ton of shows instead of greeting us bingles is lying in the entry hall not moving with her tongue stuck all out and her eyes real dull oh boy i said i freaked alex if the kids hadnta been with me i wouldve screamed baxter runs over to shake bingles but i could tell from the way her tongue was sticking out that she was gone and im screaming at him not to touch her and then sagey wakes up and starts crying and then i smell it this horrible gas smell i got us all out of there fast called anita she sent a driver for us brought us out here sent some specialists to los feliz turns out there was this massive gas leak the house was old and the pipes werent great and somehow the main flue got clogged or something they said it was lucky we left when we did because all the windows were closed because it was a cold night they said we couldve died in our sleep or if ida lit a match the whole place couldve gone up they fixed the problem but weve been here ever since eventually ill get another place but closer to tony because he is their dad scary i said close call just like today she rubbed my thumb with two of her fingers and the gems in her rings glinted there must be an angel looking down on me or something she finished the rest of the bagel anyway thats how hollywood me became malibu me again you never did say how you got from vegas to malibu oh that she said wiping crumbs from her lips after they wouldnt make me a headliner i got bored and decided to see what i could find in la figured id try modeling or acting or something i had some money saved up got myself a neat apartment in the marina hit the agencies but they didnt want fullfigured girls and i didnt want to do sleazy stuff you know i nodded nudies hardcore i mean the bodys beautiful but you have to keep standards anyway i checked out a few agents for commercials but they were all losers id started thinking about taking a boring job or something then one day i saw this ad in the paper offering good money for being in a psychology experiment and i said girl if theres one thing you know its psychology cause back when i danced it was all psychology fix your eyes on certain guys in the audience and play for them pretend you know them and they know you it set the tone so you could be realistic you know it made it more real and that pleases the audience and when the audience is happy everyones happy connecting i said exactly she rolled my thumb some more so i figured what the hey it might be fun doing some psychology so i checked out the ad and the guy running it was really sweet and it turns out all he wanted me to do was be in a room with some guys just be myself and see what they would do thats it he the psychologist was measuring reactions to what he called stimuli for commercials ads whatever i guess he figured i was pretty stimulating another good thing it was down in newport beach so during lunchtime i got to sit on the sand and chill ive always loved the ocean there isnt much of that in phoenix all you had to do was sit there and he paid you that was it she said like modeling but better cause there was no photographer making me twist in weird positions and ben the psychologist was a sweet sweet guy never made a move on me which for me is a twist you know squeezing my thumb i said ill bet and she grinned at first i figured he was just waiting for the right time but then i could see he just wasnt into it so i started to think he was gay which was fine i like gay guys i mean i wasnt disappointed or anything like that i am not like that suddenly her voice hardened as if id accused her of something her nail dug into my thumb and i lifted it gently i said men come on to you even though you dont encourage it exactly you listen dont you i mean really listen on good days hes like that too ben a good listener anyway i did this experiment for a month or so and finally he did ask me out but not like a comeon more like fatherdaughter being friendly wanting to know how i enjoyed the job he took me to the ivy at the shore he was a perfect gentleman wanting to know me as a person we had a real good time even though i didnt feel any you know sparks and then and this is the karma part were leaving to get into his car waiting for the valets to bring it up and this other car drives up this gorgeous maroon bentley azure and another guy gets out older really welldressed really wellgroomed but mostly im looking at the car cause how many of those do you see chauffeur chrome wheels a million coats of lacquer but ben is staring at the guy who gets out he knows him and the other guy knows him too the two of them start hugging and kissing and im thinking i was right he is gay then ben says cheryl this is my father tony and the other guy bows and kisses my hand and says enchanted cheryl im marc anthony duke which shocked me because once i heard the name of course i connected it to the face but you dont expect someone like tony to know someone like ben let alone be his dad ben doesnt even go by duke he uses the real family name and hes nothing like tony i mean nothing you couldnt have two guys more different she paused to catch her breath licked her lips threw back her shoulders and thrust out her chest anyway thats how i met tony and i mustve made an impression because the next day he called me said hed gotten bens permission which was a twist right so cute he asked me out and the next thing i know were flying to acapulco and the rest as they say is history basically he swept me off my feet whoa i said whoa nelly she said now you tell me something and be honest okay okay ill bet when i told you id been married to tony you figured id posed for him and thats how he discovered me right you figured i was a treat of the month not really oh yes you did she insisted slapping my wrist everyone assumes that and thats okay but tony always told me i was his special treat did you know im the first woman he had babies with since ben and anitas mom died and i gave him beautiful babies adorable her fingers spiderwalked to my wrist youre very nice so what kind of investments do you do i own some properties sounds profitable i get by nice she said good for you having time to hang out but youre intellectual i can tell that i have a sense for people so what else besides boating do you do for fun play a little guitar i love music tonys tonedeaf but he pretends to like music for parties you know he brings in the best live bands catch wizard the last one we almost got the stone crew sound like incredible parties sometimes she said other times it was a thousand strangers invading and stuffing their faces and all these tramps from the magazine shoving their tits in tonys face sometimes it was for causes like charity you know and tony would let other people come in like retarded people burn victims thank god i wont have to deal with that anymore because of the divorce i said that and tony doesnt throw parties anymore how come things change she freed my hand ate more bagel i am definitely going to bloat up i doubt that so did ben turn out to be gay she stared at me who cares not me just making conversation well hes not she said hes just one of those you know not into it like a priest asexual there are people like that you know life would be pretty boring without variety i said she smiled you like variety i thrive on it me too seeing as we both thrive on it would you like to get together or something when i said touching the side of her face she drew away smiled how about right now no just kidding got to get back to feed the kids before someone accuses me of neglecting them but maybe someday you could glide by in your little canoe and i could just happen to be on the beach maybe wearing this tapping the bag with the bikini that sounds very good i said she reached into a bag brought out a small appointment book wrote down a number tore out the page this is my private cell phone i feel privileged i said taking the slip she reached out took my face in both her hands kissed me too hard on the mouth pressing her teeth against my lips and ending with the merest swipe of tongue this has been very cool alex lately no one seems to be appreciating me bye now chapter hypotheses confirmed ben dugger used his experiment to pick up women young blondes relinquished his catch when dad asserted a preference snaring women but acting the perfect gentleman asexual at least in the beginning something off sexually monique lindquists laughing aside about his not wanting to talk about sex rang in my ears so did cheryl dukes remark about not wanting to be judged neglectful definitely worried about losing her kids the accidental gas leak living at the estate as the duke family called the shots black suit also bunking down there playing tennis more than just hired help threads of suspicion a net but nothing that told me why lauren and the others had died nothing to tell milo as i drove back home i wondered how id recount the day to robin hey hon i played frogman and spent most of the afternoon flirting with a much younger woman cheryls private number was wedged in my wallet there was no reason for her aroma to linger in my nose but i kept catching whiffs of suntan lotion and good perfume i arrived just before five spike greeted me at the door with a dismissive snort but no sign of robin he led me into the kitchen and groused until i fed him some leftover brisket and thats where i found the note taking a nap alarm set for sixthirty i checked the answering machine four messages none from milo booting up the computer i plugged in anita duke came across the personal website of another woman with the same name a computer programmer in nashville offering the universe a peek into her private life why do people do that the anita i was looking for merited a dozen hits almost all of them citations id already pulled up the transfer of executive power from father to daughter but down at the bottom of the list a twoyearold citation from entertainment news caught my eye duke magazine exec weds magazine heavy anita duke ties the knot with boyfriend in malibu ceremony i downloaded and printed in a starstudded oceanview ceremony this past weekend the only daughter of magazine tycoon marc anthony duke was married to her companion of several years anita catherine duke a graduate of wellesley college and columbia university business school and newly appointed ceo of duke enterprises was given away this past saturday by her father and stepmother sylvana as she tied the knot with kent irving former president of mladys couture an la garment manufacturer and now projects manager for duke enterprises the nuptials took place under a veil of secrecy at the posh shadowridge lodge in the hills of malibu but sources cite the attendance of several showbiz heavies including the rest was all famous names and catering details no mention of a honeymoon or of brother bens presence at the happy event mladys couture the rag trade laurens turf before kent irving had married himself into the duke family now i did need to talk to my friend the detective i got hold of him at the robberyhomicide room oh happy days he said despite my express instructions andy salander has split i was trying to reach him to see if he knew more than he originally told us about laurens schmatte connections ive spent the bulk of the past two days downtown deadending on that no one at the fashion mart remembers her doing runway work and none of the modeling agencies ever signed her up which probably means another lie her real gig was hooking and whos going to admit being involved with that i did find a couple shirts at discount but thats about it for productivity funny thing you should mention the rag trade ben duggers brotherinlaw used to be involved in that outfit called mladys couture oh he said well how about you just borrow my badge and give me a few days off in palm springs you hate the desert i hate this case more mladys couture ive got the mart directory right here hold on nope no listing lets try the phone book uhuh zilch no surprise i said the story said former president irvings moved on to brighter prospects howd you find this out i thought about telling him of my day at the beach said hurtling through cyberspace the mlady connection was cited in anita dukes wedding story it makes me wonder irving married anita two years ago but they probably dated for a while before that lets say six months to a year thats part of the time period lauren claimed to be working the mart i agree modeling was a cover she was hooking but the garmentbiz part of it might have been true if irving was one of her clients a bigtime regular throwing around big money his marrying megamillions would make that an embarrassing bit of biography what if lauren tried to profit from that told michelle et cetera et cetera and michelle did the same or someone thought she was going to as in gretchen stengel who also knew irving from the good old days and told him and he had the problem taken care of long silence so now youve got a new bad guy big bucks at stake an executive type would fit with the professional hit scenario as well as leaving the bodies to be found warning off others it would also explain the theft of laurens computer records in addition to anitas money irvings got a top job at duke enterprises and hes part of a group thats developing paradise cove lots at stake any way to find out if his name comes up in gretchens case file and dr dugger no more sexy secrets im not abandoning him i said just suggesting an alternative and even if dugger wasnt directly involved in the murders he couldve set everything into motion without intending to by trying to get something going with lauren bringing her to the duke estate she and irving came facetoface talk about a blast from the past and she started leaning on irving that could explain duggers strong reaction when we told him about laurens death he was surprised but hes also aware of his role in it however unintentional suspects irving he cant say a thing because he doesnt want to expose his family so he claims innocence cooperates up to a point starts sweating when you get too close to his personal life all this from cyberspace and where does shawna yeager figure into this grand production that i dont know unless irving had something going with her too this guy gets around maybe im totally off base i said but wouldnt a look at the gretchen files be a place to start the gretchen files he said are a problem the feds took over from the locals theyre the ones who prosecuted her they orchestrated the plea bargain throughout the whole thing no customers names were ever exposed and believe me the papers tried to get hold of gretchens files that was the whole point of the deal protecting johns in high places gretchen kept her mouth shut in return for a short sentence ill call the us attorney but dont get your hopes up first though i need to find andy salander his rabbit really bugs me when did he leave middle of the night no notice a months rent due packed all his clothes left the furniture behind the landlord is not pleased and neither am i salander was the last person to see lauren alive with all due respect to your creative mind wouldnt it be a peach if this comes down to a stinking little roommate thing you really see salander overpowering trussing and shooting lauren in the head then dumping her in the trash i said doing the same to michelle and lance and burning their bodies alex ive been doing this too long to be surprised by anything for all we know michelle and lance were shot because of something totally unrelated to lauren and jane mel abbot shot jane friend thats the way its going down and i have nothing to say it shouldnt what i do have is salander cutting out after he gave his word that he wouldnt i was just by the cloisters the manager said salander didnt show up for work yesterday or today didnt phone which is a switch hes always been reliable somethings definitely not right maybe hes scared i said knows something he shouldnt jane abbots death just hit the news maybe salander figured he could find himself in the same situation and panicked because he knows what jane knew what lauren has this big valuable secret and she tells everyone lauren was a loner and lonely salander made a point of telling me what a good listener he was and perhaps lauren didnt tell him everything merely hinted around or gave him a partial story now that people are dying hes worried thats enough fine he said maybe but if he knows something thats all the more reason for me to go after him asap the manager at the bar says he had an onagain offagain boyfriend and thats the lead im chasing could be onagain i said the first time i met salander he was waiting for someone to show up implied it was a former flame some sort of reconciliation whos the boyfriend some film agent who works for one of the big outfits manager thinks andy said william morris he dropped in at the cloisters infrequently drank singapore slings schmoozed with andy not too friendly with anyone else last time was months ago but ive got a description forties dark hair slim tiny little eyeglasses armani suits and maybe a name manager thinks he heard andy call this guy jason or justin im heading over to morris right now maybe theyll buy my screenplay didnt know you had one throw cash at me and i can write one in a couple of days win an oscar have you seen the crap that gets onscreen what cop against the odds charming genius cop as sensitive soul and savior of the world i laughed if you deadend in beverly hills you might try salanders parents he had a snapshot of them in his room taken in yeah bloomington indiana called this morning salanders mother hasnt spoken with him in nearly a year seems andy senior has troubles with his only childs lifestyle junior left home a year shy of high school graduation never returned to the old homestead he sends mommy a christmas card and she mails him money that she saves from the grocery stash when i hung up she was crying i love my job anyway thanks for the irving info feel free to call with additional inspiration actually what try to stay calm i said if i could get calm i could stay calm what ive been traveling through more than cyberspace i told him about my day at paradise cove the time with cheryl duke meeting anita and irving catching sight of black suit in tennis garb so you actually met the guy just for a few minutes long silence kayaking its good exercise alex he said then he trailed off more dead air finally mr schmatte wears linen and the goombah plays tennis summer fun in the winter maybe joe mafiosos another kind of pro brought in to improve the old guys backhand hes built more like a power lifter fine fine but lobbing balls across the net makes him even less likely to be some hoodoo hit man if he was they wouldnt put him up on home turf alex i cant believe you actually took out a goddamn boat and did marine surveillance no law against enjoying the great outdoors i said lucky i was there the boy mightve drowned an exaggerated sigh hissed through the receiver myyyy heeero so now mommys bonded with you you going to date her very funny you took her number what was my choice how about selfrighteous indignation you mightve told me at the outset that you knew irving from more than the internet i was waiting for the right moment he laughed whats the use okay so is there a reason other than the garment link that irving twangs your antenna whats he like in person he kowtows to his wife but likes to come across in charge styled hair dresses like reruns of miami vice toughguy swagger he impressed me as someone who wants to be seen as a player if bad taste and phoniness were felonies la would be one big penitentiary he said okay hes got poor fashion sense thats why he bombed in the garment game give me something else something ominous that i can work with before i go chasing around town cant i admitted im just trying to connect the dots there is one other issue that might or might not be relevant cheryls pretty nervous about being judged a neglectful mother and irving suggested to me a perfect stranger that she was i think he wants that information out there ive done enough custody consults to develop a nose for impending conflict and this one reeks of it rich families are the worst enough funds to pay lawyers for too long and its never about the kids its about control and money in this case big money cheryl said she and duke split amicably but that could be wishful thinking or just a lie or taking the kids from her might not even be dukes intent the feeling im getting is that hes receded into the background hasnt thrown a party in nearly two years cheryl implied there wouldnt be any more dukes handing the corporate reins to anita and by extension to kent irving so maybe its all part of anita and irvings power grab those two kids are heirs two more slices of the pie if anita and kent can gain custody of baxter and sage they consolidate their grip on the empire a power grab also fits the need to get rid of nuisances like blackmailers who push too hard i can see irving hiring a hit man maybe even being arrogant enough to put the hit man up at the estate because mobbing up is glamorous forget what i said about screenplays he said you write it ill sell it the other thing i said is i was right about dugger using his experiment to pick up women i told him about cheryl being a confederate in the intimacy study dugger wining and dining her only to pass her along to tony duke the experiment he said applied science dutiful son young blondes i said both father and son like young blondes so despite what dugger claims im not eliminating shawna from whatever scenario turns out to be true sex money take your pick huh quite an amalgam im an equal opportunity theorizer lauren bought a weapon for selfprotection mightve been carrying it the night she was murdered but never used it that would fit with her knowing the killer underestimating the threat lauren loved the money she got from hooking but what really turned her on was the power dominance if the killer was a john or posing as one she might have been deluded into thinking she was in charge the killer dispatched her dumped her took her gun for future use setting up janes death using laurens gun on jane then planting it on mel abbot a family gun an obvious accident creative he said terrifyingly creative any major flaws to the logic no answer i said it would sure be good to get a look at janes papers see if she left behind anything provocative what about lyle teague he show up yet suspect number one trillion he said no i called the castaic sheriffs and they promised to look for his truck they havent called me yet so i assume hes still out there hunting which is what i should be doing ive still got those photos of dugger and black suit oh yeah those let me see how the time shakes out ill have my people call your people forty minutes later he called visited the morris agency andy salanders onagain is probably a guy named justin lemoyne fits the description and he called in sick yesterday canceled all his appointments and guess what hes your neighbor lives right on beverly glen maybe half a mile down im on my way there now want to meet me and give me those photos if andys there you can observe my masterful interrogation psych the lad out robin would be sleeping for another half hour i said sure justin lemoynes home was a petite beautifully maintained white bungalow that had obviously once been the guesthouse of the spanish colonial mansion on the neighboring property a pair of canary island pines sentried the door and wisteria vines twisted above the handpainted tile address numerals the front yard was planted with droughttolerant specimens obviously new a single garage abutted the house no car in the driveway traffic on the glen was a slow choke i got there before milo parked and waited no movement in or around the bungalow but the same could be said for every house in the neighborhood the only signs of life were the pained looks of the motorists caught in the crush as they filed past miles of inanimate real estate as if everyone were leaving la in anticipation or the wake of the latest disaster milos unmarked finally appeared spewing exhaust bumping over the grass parkway bordering lemoynes driveway and bounding over the curb he drove up behind the seville exited while yanking the knot of his tie and headed straight for the door by the time i got there he was jabbing the bell no answer a hard knock elicited the same result hey he said eyeing the traffic lets hear it for quality of life his skin was gray around the edges and his eyes seemed to be fighting to stay open i offered the envelope containing the black suit snaps he stuffed them in his jacket pocket another bell jab nothing lets try the neighbors at the mansion a blackuniformed fairhaired maid with a lumpy face answered and milo asked her about justin lemoyne oh heem she said in a slavic accent the look of disdain was unmistakable problem neighbor maam he ees you know she proffered a limp wrist flitflit gay yah homo does that create problems ms ovensky irina you here so dere must be problems big smile gold incisor vat did he do awfficer something wit a keed does he

they carrying luggage suitcases yah two big suitcases maybe dey stay away and we don get no deebark dem deebark dem de dogs have a right to sing no two suitcases said milo back at the unmarked not a yearlong cruise but enough for a while he glanced back at the mansion irina ovensky remained in the door and she smiled and waved a saint i said the type you take home to mom he waved back smiling his jawline knotted as he opened the car door got in took out the envelope okay lets have a look at these flipping through the photos quickly he paused at a closeup of the stocky mans face he does have that mechanic look still what i said holds if he was doing wet work for the dukes why would they keep him close if i have time ill run this by the organized crime task force didnt know there was one i said since the fifties not much mafia in la so for years the task force guys enjoyed long lunches now theyre tied up with asian and latin drug gangs but who knows maybe this mugll show up in their files the morris office is closed but ill be there first thing tomorrow morning see if i can learn anything about justin lemoynes travel habits before they kick my butt out to south rodeo think i should wear a designer suit you own one yeah fashion by sir kay of the mart i put a call in to a guy at the das office who worked on gretchens case lets see if kent irvings name shows up for what thats worth i also placed my third call to leo riley still no answer so much for professional courtesy i said more likely hes got nothing to tell me we lawenforcement types dont like to dwell on our failures meanwhile im packing it in for the evening rick has informed me that were going to eat at a genuine restaurant tonight where we will pretend to be persons deserving of fine cuisine and impeccable service and then maybe a movie he says if i bring the phone he will dismantle it with surgical precision frustrated i tend to do that to people chapter i cracked the bedroom door robin was curled on her side the top sheet pulled down to her bare belly mouth parted breathing slowly as i approached the bed and shut off the alarm clock her eyes opened a minute to six i whispered good morning she yawned and stretched i got tired didnt see you much today whatd you do took a little drive up the coast oh i was thinking maybe wed have dinner somewhere at the beach guess not now that youve already the beach is one thing i said the beach with you is another kissing her chin what a sweet guy but all the time thinking malibus a small place running into someone i knew would not be pretty by the time we left the house it was eight pm and we reached the coast highway twenty minutes later i bypassed all the trendoidinfested spotsoftheweek and tried a place wed never been before a graywood café resembling an oversized bait shack perched on a mound of dirt above pch on the land side just past big rock where massive mudslides are the rule and thirtyfootwide beach properties level off at a million and a half bucks the decor was rickety picnic tables sawdust floors daily printed menus with all the polish of a high school bulletin char broilers on overdrive beery dialogue the room was high enough to catch a clean vista of black ocean and if the grandmotherly old waitress who greeted us with hello dearies had ever harbored showbiz illusions they predated technicolor several miles before paradise cove we huddled at a tiny table in the corner gorged on the mixed seafood grill fresh corn creamed spinach decent chablis terrible coffee having a life and when robin said you seem a little more relaxed i hid my surprise and nodded innocently cheryl dukes number sat in my wallet but robin never goes through my things i reached for her hand she allowed me to hold it for a few minutes then let go and i wondered if i was less olivier than id given myself credit for everything okay i said everythings fine just a little tired still guess so we went to bed without making love and i slept restlessly the next morning she was up way before me and by the time i reached the kitchen she was heading out with spike errands i said elvis again he still thinks he can sing stay safe you too me she said thats never an issue for me before i could respond she was gone i didnt hear from milo until three pm no progress on lemoyne and salanders travel plans couldnt get past the front desk at morris and the prosecutor who handled gretchens case has been kicked upstairs to washington dc her assistant has taken over and she says kent irvings name doesnt ring a bell i asked her to check anyway i suppose theres a chance she will i asked her about garment guys period and she did admit that gretchens girls had worked the mart servicing buyers that kind of thing but the main reason im calling is i identified your mr goombah the task force knows him didnt have to go to the task force i had the photos spread out on my desk last night and when rick came in to drag me out to dinner he glommed on to them and said how do you know maccaferri as in dr maccaferri first name rene the guys a renowned physician alex bigtime researcher headquartered in paris but he consults to the national cancer institute rick recognized him because he attended a seminar maccaferri gave last year prostate cancer its his specialty oh i said tony dukes sick and dutiful son went to the airport to pick up his doctor i laughed so much for my bigtime mafia theories hey you tried maybe the rest of its worthless cancer thats why the parties have ended why cheryl said thered be no more tony passed the banner to anita because hes in no shape to run things that may also be why cheryl and the kids moved back the gas leak story could be a ploy to keep tonys illness quiet hold on he said maccaferris no big bad torpedo but lauren and a lot of people are still dead so lets not be too hasty and im still left with little andy salander alex the more i think about his cutting out so abruptly the less i like it he and lemoyne packing and leaving in the middle of the night its a clear rabbit the rest of my day will be spent on the phone with the airlines maybe ill luck out anyway thanks for trying have a nice day renowned physician so much for my bigtime intuition milo had been gracious but was the rest of it including suspicions of ben dugger just as off base still dugger was an odd man whod paid good money to lauren and cheryl and who knew how many other beautiful blondes to sit in a cold little room and entice men hiring female flesh compiling data that hadnt been published or put to any apparent use hidden cameras grids in the floor voyeurism masquerading as science dugger had eschewed the flash and spark of tony dukes lifestyle for what i thought of how easily dugger had relinquished cheryl to tony duke the moment the old man had made his interests known the personal trip to lax to pick up maccaferri a job easily accomplished by a factotum maybe dugger was a strong adherent to the fifth commandment but perhaps now that his father was seriously ill there was a more practical reason to be attentive back to the money millions of dollars worth of motivation tony dukes death was more than theoretical now one day perhaps sooner rather than later duke enterprises would be divvied up ben duggers lifestyle was far from lavish but his market research seemed to generate very little income and someone had to pay for the oceanview highrise offices in newport and brentwood and now he was closing down newport and shifting operations to brentwood same reason sticking close to dad during the final days dependent upon dads good graces but with his sister at the helm of duke enterprises was he in danger of being cut off knowing how ben and anita got along would help answer that and the only indication i had was the fact that thered been no mention of bens attendance at anitas wedding then there was the matter of the two other sibs sage and baxter and kent irving of the pink shirt and hollywood wink all in all high risk for conflict for the type of endgame litigation that meant big winners and catastrophic losers bigtime rage cheryl aka sylvana was no genius but she had to be aware of the financial ramifications that could explain her anxiety about being branded a bad mom yet that hadnt stopped her from dozing off on the beach or giving me her private number poor judgment pliable unlike lauren toughened by years on the street big tips i thought back to jane abbots first call to me panicked about laurens disappearance even though lauren had been on her own for years had traveled in the past because the two of them had finally started to reconnect and lauren had confided in her maybe even bragged about her lucrative dodge perhaps jane had tried to talk lauren out of the blackmail scheme the control issue lauren had complained about to andrew salander lauren refusing signing her death warrant and that of her onetime partnerfriend michelle and her mother milo was chasing down salanders whereabouts and maybe that would lead to something but i couldnt help thinking that any solution lay crouching behind the walls of the duke estate high walls electric gates closedcircuit tv cable car that shimmied up and down the cliff side all of it emitting a clear message keep out stupid and for the life of me i saw no way in chapter las first commandment when in doubt drive years ago ages ago when i arrived in the city as a college freshman the first thing that hit me was the streets are asphalt rivers in high school id played guitar in a wedding band and filed paper at an architects office in order to scrape up enough cash for a pukecolored emphysemic chevy nova that my father a ford man despised quoth harry delaware its crap but at least you earned it nothing you dont earn is worth half a crap that bondoed ducttaped chariot whisked me from missouri to california and when it reached my dorm promptly sputtered and died for most of the first year i was left to the mercies of las afterthought bus system house imprisonment the following summer a series of latenight jobs had earned me a moribund plymouth valiant chronic insomnia and the habit of stumbling out of bed before dawn cruising dark empty boulevards and wondering about my future now i sleep later but the urge to escape on wheels has never died its a different la from my college days traffic all bunched up and angry and irrevocable less and less open space until you get up in the santa monica mountains or out on some old stretch of blacktop made redundant by the freeways but i still love to drive for the sake of driving its a trait i share with a certain subsample of psychopaths but so what introspection can be a sucker game after milo hung up i sat at my desk listening to the empty house wondering if robins increasing absences had to do with more than her work wondering how i couldve been so wrong about rene maccaferri he sure doesnt look like a brain surgeon and what else id screwed up i got into the seville tony duke sick maybe seriously so amid malibu splendor i switched on the tape deck listened to the fabulous thunderbirds being tough enough at way too high a decibel level tooling up the glen to mulholland turning east into the hollywood hills playing with turns and twists zoned out wanting to empty my head without intending to i ended up in the heart of hollywood and back at sunset boulevard no more relaxed still plagued with supposition about laurens pathway from rebellious kid to garment center hooker to whatever shed been when the bullet had bounced around in her brain i remembered the paper shed written for gene dalbys social psych class iconography in the fashion industry women as meat bitter about the tradeoffs shed made had that played a part in fueling a blackmail scheme or had she just been greedy it took a long time to crawl through beverly hills and the eastern fringe of bel air two of the three bs to which shawna yeager had aspired and when i reached the glen i got caught in the jam and crawled feeling strangely at home like a member of some vast inertial conspiracy no stress from the automotive stalemate the chrome clog was no worse than the neural traffic in my head i was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the day when i realized id inched toward justin lemoynes house as i passed the white bungalow a flash of movement caught my eye the garage door closing just a foot of opening at the bottom as the wooden sheet slid into place at the first side street i managed to hang a left across both lanes hooked a threepoint turn pulled to the corner and waited seven minutes later the garage door opened and a red mercedes convertible its top up nosed out with its left turn signal blinking whoever was at the wheel was trying to swing across and head south letting the mercedes in wouldnt have ruined anyones day but human kindness was at an ebb and the red car just sat there for a long time blinking finally a gardeners truck relented and the convertible was allowed to join the gonowherefast club ten car lengths later so was i trying not to dwell on the ludicrousness of my tail job of ben dugger and dr maccaferri i tagged along struggling to keep the mercedes in view no mean challenge because the red car squeaked through the light at sunset and left me in a queue of five cars i kept my eye on its rectangular taillights right turn by the time i followed suit no sign of the red car and i rolled along with all the other automatons at a bracing fifteen miles per then brake lights flashed in series and the congestion that anticipated the freeway put the mercedes back in my sights thirty yards up in the lefthand lane i managed a few lessthancourteous lane changes and when the mercedes chose the sepulveda alternate to the southbound freeway id narrowed the gap and was able to make out the cloudy outline of a solitary driver through the convertibles plastic rear window he stayed on sepulveda crossed wilshire and santa monica and olympic driving as quickly as traffic would permit past the spot where laurens body had been dumped across pico and venice into culver city then a right turn at washington a quartermile zip and a quick swing into the parking lot of a small hotel called the palm court north side of washington twostory mock colonial wedged between an arco station and a flower shop auto club badge of approval tacked above the door clean white clapboard façade that i couldnt help comparing to jane and mel abbots house the parking lot was sungrayed onethird full the mercedes pulled to the far left side well away from other vehicles and came to a short stop a man got out and hurried toward the motels glass doors forties tall slim and sunkenchested with long stringy arms and kinky graying hair he wore a snug yellow polo shirt over pressed khakis brown loafers no socks tiny eyeglasses carried a cardboard file case in his hands justin lemoyne making a quick trip back home for paperwork he shot a worried look over his shoulder as he shoved the doors and stepped in the phone booth at the arco station smelled of tooold burrito but the dial tone was clear i called milo at the station and before he could speak said finally something real yeah theyre both in there he said returning to the seville and leaning in the drivers window room two fifteen they checked in yesterday under lemoynes name it had taken him a quarter hour to arrive hed left the unmarked on the opposite side of the lot conferred for a couple of minutes with the desk clerk emerged nodding cooperative fellow i said ethiopian fellow studying for the citizenship exam very yessir nosir i promised not to bring in a swat army if he didnt fuss or notify lemoyne and salander he seemed duly impressed by the badge why should he know that justifying a warrant let alone a gi joe ground assault is about as likely as ghaddafi marrying streisand lets hear it for tv and here i was thinking it was my commanding aura he also volunteered that salander just called down and asked where he could order a pizza he directed them to papa pomodoro on overland told me theyve got a guaranteed half hour delivery or its a freebie so im gonna knock on the door in five minutes and just maybe theyll open it with pepperoni expectations and when the real delivery boy shows up i said well have a party thanks for noticing lemoynes car alex hard not to i was right there and they say no one in las neighborly if he checked in under his own name lemoyne wasnt exactly being cagey i said driving up to his house in broad daylight staying this close to home doesnt smell like a frantic rabbit then whatre they doing here vacationing in culver city maybe taking a breather i said giving andy salander time to figure out what to do with the information he got from lauren or he was laurens partner in crime no sign she shared the wealth she was the one with the wardrobe and the investment portfolio salander barely scraped by on his bartenders salary no i think she took him in for company nonsexual company just like he said and he became her confidant maybe she didnt even give him details just told him enough for him to figure things out when people started dying reconciling with lemoyne couldnt have come at a better time for him allowed him to leave the apartment move in with lemoyne he told lemoyne of his suspicions scared lemoyne enough to bunk down here and he didnt call me because because why should he milo if hes a tv baby how many times has he seen the old witness protection bungle story not to mention all those police corruption scenarios fictional or otherwise untrustworthy he said moi he gazed at the hotel or maybe the two of them are trying to figure out how to take over the blackmail scheme he looked at his watch okay time to be simon the pie man wait here and if its okay for you to come up ill let you know if the delivery guy does show up you can say the pizzas yours and pay him is the department going to reimburse me he dipped in his trouser pocket and pulled out his wallet put that back i said just kidding sure he said flashing teeth i can be trusted seven minutes later a small finefeatured black man in his late twenties stepped out of the palm court sighted across the parking lot spotted the seville and waved i jogged over and he held the door open after ushering me into the skimpy dim booth the hotel passed off as a lobby he led me to a chipped brownmetal elevator cupped his hand over his mouth and spoke so softly i had to lean toward him detective sturgis rogers you to ascend sir thanks room two fifteen you may take the elevator please the lift rattled dangerously and the onestory ride took nearly a minute the second floor was a single low pinkvinyl hallway crowded with graygreen doors fitted with cheap locks the sandcolored carpeting beneath my footsteps was unpadded and grimy around the edges midway down the corridor an ice machine gurgled do not disturb signs dangled from three knobs and every few feet canned laughter oozed through the vinyl no sign on i knocked and milos voice said enter blue room gold bamboo over turquoise paper a queensized bed made up carelessly with a navy spread a blackpainted desk and chair a nineteeninch tv bolted to the wall rental movievideo game box riding on top no closet just open shelves next to the bathroom door bare but for two sixpacks of budweiser and a collection of chinese takeout cartons a pair of older vuitton suitcases had been shoved into a corner sad as impoverished nobility justin lemoyne sat on the edge of the chair twirling an unlit cigarette between the fingers of one hand his shoes were off and the file case id seen him take from the car rested near his bare feet in his lap was a blackbound script and on the desk was a cell phone and a thinkpad up close he looked older early fifties neck puffing and hollowing in all the wrong places facial skin losing its grip on the bone the kinky hair was worn down over his collar at the back but a feathery precise hairline in front said transplant behind the tiny glasses his eyes were dark bright uncertain andy salander was perched near the foot of the bed dressed similarly to lemoyne in khakis and a polo shirt his white with an olive collar on the nightstand near his elbow was an open can of bud the ashtray on the opposite stand overflowed with butts and the room reeked of tobacco and restless sleep milo stood behind them up against the beige chenille drape that dirtied the light leaking through the rooms single window salander said hi there doctor in a breakable voice lemoyne gripped the script and pretended to study dialogue hi i said this is justin said andy pleased to meet you justin lemoyne sniffed thumbed pages mr salander and mr lemoyne are on retreat said milo the question is from what last time i checked it was a free country said lemoyne without looking up justin said salander the older man looked up yes andrew i we forget it excellent idea andrew oh my said milo such a simple question lemoyne said nothings simple and you have no right to invade our privacy to salander you didnt have to let him in and theres absolutely no reason we should permit him to stay i know justin but to milo hes right maybe you should go detective sturgis now im hurt said milo knock it off said lemoyne the cute stuff chafes weve already put up with the indignity of being frisked and having our belongings pawed through if you have something to say say it then let us be milo fingered the drapes pulled them aside turned and peered through the window gas station view he let the chenille drop if i lived in beverly glen i wouldnt retreat here mr lemoyne to each his own you of all people should know that salander winced milo smiled the thing is andy this whole free country thing people recite it like a mantra but were really not all that free the law imposes restrictions ive got handcuffs in my pocket and i can take them out place them around your wrists and take you to jail and be operating in a perfectly legal manner a tiny tremor scooted across salanders lips lemoyne kept turning pages hes trying to intimidate you andy to milo thats rubbish on what grounds the thing is andy said milo theres a legal status called material witness that can reduce your freedom substantially same for suspect salander blanched i didnt see anything and i didnt do anything that may be so but my job is to suspect not to adjudicate and after a couple of days in custody bullshit said lemoyne starting to get up stop scaring him please stay seated sir bullshit lemoyne repeated but he settled back down this is obscene oppressive you of all people should milo turned his back on lemoyne the thing that bothers me andy is i specifically asked you to be available because youre the last person who saw lauren teague alive and that makes you a definite material witness from my perspective the fact that you agreed to be available but reneged makes you an interesting person long pause salander said im sorry oh christ said lemoyne stop talking andrew shut up you went back on your word andy that and the fact that youre hiding out in this garden spot we are not hiding said lemoyne picking up the phone im calling my lawyer ed geisman geisman and brandner be my guest said milo of course once that happens i wont be able to control the ensuing publicity agent and suspect apprehended in cheap hotel im sure you can fill in the blanks halfturning back toward lemoyne it was my impression that agents preferred to sell stories not create them defame me and ill sue you if i defamed you id deserve to be sued sir but release of accurate facts doesnt constitute defamation salander said justin this is crazy why are we fighting i didnt do anything all i want is i dont care about the story quiet snapped lemoyne milo smiled edged closer to the bed the story so this is a story conference he laughed you guys are taking a meeting its not like that said salander wiping moist eyes stop blubbering ordered lemoyne its unbecoming im sorry justin stop apologizing let me guess said milo stepping between the men insiders view of a blond beautys murder are you thinking big screen or made for tv no said salander no no its just justin said if we registered the idea with the writers guild we could be protected it would be like life insurance ah said milo you think if someone comes gunning for you the writers guildll ride to the rescue must be a new service they provide salander began crying you asshole said lemoyne you enjoy scaring him dont you hes already scared said milo isnt that right andy dont call him by his first name its demeaning call him mister treat him with respect i dont care what he calls me justin salander sniffed i just want to be safe thats the problem said lemoyne what is panic in salanders voice you dont care you always fall short in the caring department as well as in the thinkingthingsthrough department stop it justin lemoyne slammed the script shut this is bullshit ive got appointments on hold canceled meetings do what you want andy its your life take it where you want to the thing is said milo i dont care if you register the story make a million bucks from laurens death its the american way but not before you tell me what you know because if you hold out that puts into play yet another restriction of your freedom withholding evidence oh bullshit said lemoyne this is just total bullshit im out of this andrew i need your help justin lemoyne gave a sick smile oh i dont think so andy i think you do just fine by yourself i dont salander wiped his nose with his arm i really need support justin thats a brandnew shirt use a tissue for gods sake salander looked around the room helplessly milo located the kleenex box on the floor and handed it to him what should i do justin do what you want silence i dont know said salander throwing up his hands he reached for the beer can no more said lemoyne youve had enough salanders hand jerked back he hugged himself oh he said this is so restrictive lemoyne shook his head im leaving but he didnt move what should i do salander repeated milo said how about telling the truth arms still wrapped around his torso salander began to rock his smooth forehead creased thinking hard lemoyne said for this i give up a lunch at le dome chapter salanders decision came moments later heralded by a long breathy sigh yes i am scared he said shivering first lo then her mother no mention of michelle and lance he had more to fear than he knew milo said jane abbots death confirmed your suspicion salander nodded milo leaned over him i need to tell you andy there may be others as well oh my god terror tactics muttered lemoyne milo stepped over to the desk and shadowed the older man a little fear wouldnt be a bad idea for you either sir lemoynes face lost color but he smiled ive swum with the sharks my friend milo smiled back youve swum with trout my friend were talking great white ah said lemoyne i shudder what others said salander associates of lauren said milo now tell me what scares you andy i think i may know why lo was murdered i mean i cant be sure but right from the beginning i wondered about it wondered about what andy the money its always about money right more often than not salander rocked some more milo said tell me about the money she lo i always wondered how she supported herself cause she never worked much except for that parttime research job and that couldnt pay for moschino and prada and jimmy choo right also her attitude she had that relaxed thing about money that you only get if you have it know what i mean in fact when i first met her i thought she was a rich kid inherited wealth but she said shed been on her own for years so i mean i wasnt nosy but it made me wonder she was a fulltime student where was it all coming from then after i moved in maybe a month after she happened to leave some mail out on the kitchen counter on top was investment stuff her portfolio from some broker up in seattle im no snoop but she left it right out there on the table so how could i help but see the zeros lots of zeros lots salander agreed i never asked her about it we never talked about it and she was supergenerous when we went out for a meal together she always insisted on paying when we antiqued shed buy me things cuff links vintage shirts must be your boyish charm muttered lemoyne salanders hand balled once upon a time you thought so stop picking at me lemoyne brought the script closer to his eyeglasses salander said youre a grump but i still love you justin lemoyne whispered something what said andy love you too salander smiled thank you low grumble welcome milo said so the source of laurens money puzzled you did she ever talk about any other jobs shed held before the research thing modeling said salander she said shed modeled i told you that didnt i anything besides modeling salander stared down at the bedspread no like what the girl was a hooker said lemoyne i keep telling you that you dont know that justin oh jesus andrew i met her she had hooker written all over her milo said how many times did you meet her mr lemoyne two or three times in passing but that was enough to know what she was she was highpriced no doubt about that but she had the moves the look the walk the whole phonyclass thing going on for all i know she was trained by gretchen stengel you know gretchen stengel i know of her said lemoyne everyone in the industry does weve never lunched but ive certainly seen her around and run into many of her little vixens back when gretchen was plying her trade you couldnt go anywhere that was anywhere without tripping over them easy to spot said milo lemoyne rolled his eyes even for you sherlock gretchen went for a type cool but remotely friendly the ready rap the body the clothes the clothes were always the tipoff a girl who shouldnt have been able to afford five grand worth of couture but wore it well lemoyne smiled and closed the script not that it helped if you knew the difference between real class and bullshit every one of those girls had a certain commonness trailerpark trying to morph into grace kelly he crossed his legs beleeeve me detective that takes more than aerobics and a crash course on what fork to use still you can fool most of the people to salander she was a hooker andy salander gazed up at milo milo said she did have that in her past andy oh another labored sigh im très naïve arent i i guess it was right there in front of me but i just didnt want to know not that it wouldve mattered i dont judge why should i judge and i swear the whole time we lived together she never did anything illegal or brought anyone home i guess when she took those long weekends she was she told me i cant be blamed for believing her okay fine im naïve and stupid staring at lemoyne lemoyne shook his head and reopened the script milo said what did she tell you about the long weekends andy salander squirmed i didnt say anything when you first came around because i wasnt sure and it looks like now maybe it didnt have anything to do with it now that youre telling me she was the thing is i didnt want to make things complicated lemoynes laughter cut him off youre babbling andrew they have no clue what the hell youre talking about milo edged closer to salander what andy her family said salander her real family she said she was going out to malibu to reconnect with them since shed learned who her real father was tony duke i guess she was fantasizing right its the worlds greatest fantasy right live your life one way and then find out all of a sudden that youre on a whole different level milo sat down on the bed so did i milos notepad was out his tie was loose when and how did she learn about this andrew when was last year said salander maybe a year ago just before we started rooming together how is her mother told her the two of them had started relating again they hadnt talked for a long time and then jane started making overtures and they began trying to patch things up slowly having lunch once in a while it was at one of those lunches that jane told her theyd finished off a bottle of wine gotten all girliechatty and jane just spilled it out she said shed met duke while working as a flight attendant on a jet duke had chartered taking some models and a bunch of other people to the big island of hawaii for a big photo spread and partying jane ended up serving duke personally and he invited her to spend the layover at some mansion he was renting and it happened jane and los dad the one she thought was her dad the asshole were going together but hadnt decided to get married when jane found out she was pregnant she convinced him to marry her talk about your false pretenses said justin lemoyne it really does have story elements the funny thing said salander finding out about duke caused things to make sense for lauren like why she couldnt stand her father the one who raised her she said shed never related to her father shed always felt like a stranger to him like thered been this wall between them now she understood it jane never told him about laurens true paternity i said lauren said no way his temper was too bad for that the marriage broke up anyway but jane told lauren the whole time she was pregnant she was paranoid he would find out do something violent luckily lauren resembled jane paranoid but she kept the baby i said she told lauren shed always wanted a baby tish teagues outburst came back to me recounting laurens cruel parting comment you dont deserve a damn thing from me youre not even my family and neither is he and neither are your rugrats no blood connection between lauren and lyles little girls yet lauren had sought them out brought them christmas presents only to withdraw ambivalent how lonely she mustve been so jane told lauren about a year ago said milo when did lauren tell you soon after i moved in maybe a couple of months later at first after we started rooming together she was real up happy all the time probably cause shed just found out but then her mood changed she slid way down being a natural listener i kept trying to help her open up when she did it was after id cooked this big italian dinner and wed finished a whole bottle of chianti cheap wines the great conversation starter right milo shifted his bulk what was her mood when she told you at first she was kind of giddy about it like isnt that cool my real dads a zillionaire but then she got real quiet i thought maybe because she felt shed missed out on stuff all those years she couldve been a princess i said something to that effect but she said no that wasnt it at all she wouldnt trade her life with anyones but the whole thing had just thrown her off balance and this was the main thing after jane told her she got all freaked out and started pressuring lo to forget about it not to try to get in touch with duke lauren thought that was cruel and manipulative and she was right dont you think you cant just go and dump something on someone then try to hold them back lo was furious at jane i said thats when she complained about jane wanting to control her yes exactly she said jane was a coward and a liar and totally full of shit to think she lauren would just sit there and let someone else make up the rules she was also mad that jane had tried to bribe her to keep quiet said it was sleazy bribe her how after jane got divorced she was real poor for a while so she wrote to tony duke and he started sending her money for her and for lauren even though lauren wasnt in the picture she and jane had lost contact for years jane claimed she spent only her part put laurens share aside when she and lo connected she started giving lo a regular allowance but she never told lo where it really came from milo and i exchanged glances both of us remembering the deposits in laurens portfolio a hundred thousand payment four years ago then fifty a year since big money said milo lauren didnt specify but it mustve been right said salander all those zeros and the way she dressed but the point was jane wasnt up front about it lied to lauren about where laurens allowance was coming from what did she tell her that her second husband was giving it to her to jane and that jane was sharing with lauren out of the goodness of her heart lauren believed that hes a rich tv producer mr abbot real generous with jane jane was living like a rich woman now but then when jane was trying to pressure lauren not to blow the lid off the duke thing she told lauren where the money had really come from tried to make herself a saint like i put myself on a limb for you all those years you never talked to me i still put your money aside and then she offered to give lauren even more money if shed stay away from tony duke why was she worried about that she told lauren it would create a big mess there was nothing to gain from it lauren suspected what she was really worried about was ticking off tony duke and jeopardizing her own allowance protecting her butt in los mind jane was just trying to buy her off and she was tired of being bought salander turned silent i guess i know now what she meant ding said lemoyne miming a bell ring milo said so jane wrote a letter to duke and he just started sending her money jane wouldnt give lo the details that was part of the frustration jane got drunk and spilled out the whole story then she just curled up and wouldnt tell lauren any more can you blame her said lemoyne the girl was a hooker the mother had a golden goose farting into her hand and knew that if duke found out he had a hooker kid that would screw the deal hes mr wholesome tits and ass a daughter who earned her living on her knees would be bad pr smiling at milo right good story line its my job chuckling lemoyne returned to the script so jane tried to hold lauren back i said but lauren wouldnt be held back made contact with the dukes and went to see them in malibu salander said she never gave me the details but she did say thank god for her computer she used it to research the dukes didnt need her mother or anyone else cause she had technology on her side she even showed it to me had this cute little family tree thingie in there this actual little tree full of apples with peoples names on them milo said did you notice any of the names no she didnt let me get that close just wanted me to see the tree and then brought it back into her room like she was proud of it she said it was a genealogy program shed bought it and downloaded it herself salander flinched and then when you called and asked about the computer and i realized it was gone thats when i started to worry that maybe someone wanted to get hold of the family data that and the fact someone had gotten into our place then when i heard about jane salander bit his lip i started thinking maybe lauren had misjudged her mother maybe jane didnt want lauren to get too close not because she was worried about getting cut off but because it was dangerous what if jane really cared and lauren was never able to see that milo stood paced the space between the bed and the window did lauren indicate that shed ever actually made contact with tony duke no said salander all i know about is that tree thingie but he does live in malibu right that humongous place with all the parties what else did she tell you that could help me andy thats it i promise after that one time she spilled her guts she pulled back just like jane did with her mostly she stayed in her room in front of that computer did she ever talk about other family members besides tony duke salander shook his head what about girls shed worked with not that i recall michelle salazar no shawna yeager uhuh she never talked about the past and like i told you the first time she didnt have any friends a real loner a girl and her computer said milo salander said so sad then now what have you told anyone besides mr lemoyne about any of this no a glance at lemoyne and all justin wanted was to write up a treatment and register it he stopped that could be dangerous huh if someone at the guild saw it and oh please said lemoyne no one in the industry reads still said milo fine fine snapped lemoyne fine milo turned to salander andy ill be needing you to repeat everything youve told me for a formal statement salander blanched why its the rules well do it in a couple of days either down at the station or somewhere more private if youre straight with me about sticking around this time more private said salander definitely more private do you think we can move back to justins place i mean if lauren and jane died because lauren was tony dukes daughter and i know about it thats the point son said milo no one knows you know if youre discreet i dont see any imminent danger if youre not i cant promise you anything salander laughed hollowly something funny andy i was just thinking about those times you came into the cloisters and i served you its really a great job tending bar you have the power to make people happy their moods just kind of fall into your hands not just the booze its everything the listening i knew you were a cop someone told me at first it bothered me what an ugly world you must live in i hoped you wouldnt start talking didnt want to soak up all those negative vibes but you never did you just sat there and drank you and that handsome doctor neither of you talked you just drank in silence then left i started feeling sorry for you no offense soaking up those vibes yourself but i also felt good about helping you not that you had a problem but you know what i mean i was in charge got those beers and shots delivered right on the money and everyone was happy and now another laugh ill be discreet all right said salander im the soul of discretion outside i said no imminent danger not if he keeps his mouth shut no grounds for protective custody thats tv crap lemoynes world so was my line about salander being a material witness the truth is he and old justin are free to fly off to antigua any damn time they please he looked back at the palm court cracked his knuckles i always knew it was about money but tony dukes daughter talk about highstakes blackmail i watched the traffic on washington boulevard thinking about things lauren had told me that her parents hadnt been married when shed been conceived that theyd brought me up with lies the wall of ice between her and lyle the remark to michelle about her mother screwing up how early had she sensed something wrong what had the truth done to her jane had called me in a panic after lauren had disappeared knowing what lauren was up to suspecting the fiveday absence was more than just another extended weekend trying to motivate the police but holding back facts that mightve helped even after laurens death milo had felt jane had been less than helpful i thought back to any hints she might have dropped came up with only one laurens never gotten anything from her father and maybe that was my fault guilty she had to have been tormented yet it hadnt led her to finally open up worrying about her own safety justifiable fear and maybe something else lies had been the poisonous glue that held this family together the time line fits i said lauren was arrested for prostitution in reno when she was nineteen called lyle for bail money but he turned her down i always wondered why she phoned him and not jane but maybe it was because she still cared what jane thought still stuck in jail she mightve turned to jane and maybe jane came through but she didnt give lauren any of the money shed collected from tony duke because she didnt think lauren could handle it instead she tried to reconnect with lauren it was a slow process lauren had been on the streets for three years was sitting on a lot of anger and she continued to hook and strip but jane persisted and some kind of bond mustve been formed because two years later when lauren was twentyone jane did give her the money using the mel abbot cover story you remember how jane emphasized to us how well lauren and mel got along he nodded mel being a nice guy made it easier for lauren to believe shortly after lauren received the hundred thousand she set up her investment account went back to school got her ged enrolled in community college quit working for gretchen maybe all of that was part of a deal with jane or lauren really wanted to get her life together every year after that she invested another fiftythousanddollar annual payment milo said a deal give up the life get rich his hand landed on my shoulder and his eyes took on that sad sympathetic droop the look that comes over him when he delivers bad news i know i said lauren continued to freelance cash income most of which she never declared and used for spending money big tips expensive tastes rapprochement with her mother or not lauren had remained a very angry young woman about missing out on all those years as tony dukes daughter about the tradeoffs shed made what andy salander had called every little girls fantasy had become laurens reality only to twist and abort maybe it wasnt blackmail i said just lauren claiming her birthright stepping forward and upsetting the family applecart what someone tied her up and shot her because she wanted emotional validation milos hand got heavy then it lifted his eyes remained sad and his voice got soft i know you want to believe something good about lauren but cold execution and all those other people dying says she tried to use her birthright to hit on the old man bigtime a fiftygrandayear allowance is one thing a chunk of duke enterprises is another maybe i am denying i said but think about it blackmail would only have worked if tony duke had something to hide milo he sent money to jane and by extension to lauren for years if he wanted to eliminate nuisances why not do it right and have them killed right at the beginning because he was dealing with jane and jane was reasonable but once lauren knew the truth things got nasty o impetuous youth jane knew what lauren was capable of thats why she tried to hold her back from contacting duke thats why when lauren disappeared she suspected something was off not that it led her to tell me the truth jane tells her who her daddy is then holds her back i said it was manipulative or just a screwup people make mistakes salanders right about cheap wine jane had been living with the secret for over twenty years her inhibitions finally dropped and she ran her mouth then she realized what shed done tried to get the furies back in the box still i said dr maccaferris presence at the estate says dukes seriously ill why would he be worried now about acknowledging laurens paternity on the contrary wouldnt he want to connect but there are people whod view lauren as the ultimate threat a giant slice cut out of the inheritance pie he jammed his hands into his jacket pockets dugger and his sister lauren carried a gun but never used it my theory was that she knew and trusted the killer half sibs would fit that bill especially a half sib like ben dugger outwardly such a nice guy lauren thought she had him pegged let down her guard she thought she was the actress and he was the audience that delusion cost her a pizza delivery truck sped into the lot stopped checked the address continued toward the front door and screeched to a halt in a no parking zone a kid wearing a blue baseball cap got out toting two flat white boxes milo said yo and waved him over the kid stood there and we jogged to his side hispanic maybe eighteen with hair cropped to the skin aztec features puzzled black eyes here you go friend said milo peeling off two twenties room two fifteen just knock and leave it outside the door and keep the change thanks man sir the kid sprinted for the hotel shoved at the door vanished milo said the pizza olympics offer enough positive reinforcement and wed have ourselves a winning team in track and field he motioned toward the unmarked and we started walking across the lot i said lauren probably thought she was after the money but she was searching for daddy pathetic i wonder he said if lyle ever suspected lauren wasnt his kid why because its just the thing lauren might have told him out of spite his finding out would explain how hostile he was when we notified him also why hes eager to pump me about laurens will not being her blood relative he knows hes got no legal right to anything she left behind but with jane gone whos gonna argue with him and under the law his paternitys presumed the duke familys sure not gonna protest if he ends up with the money in laurens investment account and even if he does manage to connect lauren to duke hed keep his mouth shut about it cause that would squash his claim to three hundred grand to them thats chump change to lyle it would be the windfall of his life lauren did made a crack to tish teague about her daughters not being family so i can see her taunting lyle but he told us he and jane had tried to have other kids but all they could squeeze out was lauren so it was obviously janes problem still if lauren did take a dig at his manhood it couldve led to something else lyles an angry guy who likes to drink and surrounds himself with firearms he couldve just lost it gone after lauren then jane revenge for the lies and now he hopes to profit an alternative scenario he muttered five steps later nah i dont like it if jane suspected lyle had killed lauren thats something she wouldve been happy to spill and lyle doesnt connect to michelle and lance hed have no way to know them no the way lauren was dispatched wasnt a crime of passion lyles just a circling vulture who never gave a shit about lauren this girl had some life short life i said and my eyes began to hurt we reached the car lauren sitting at her computer he said researching her family tree discovering ben dugger learning about his experiment she applied to be a paid subject not for the money for the connection got a confederate job instead because she was beautiful and poised used her looks and her charms to wangle her way into duggers confidence he sweated got irate when you pushed him about having a personal relationship with lauren maybe she turned him on sexually took advantage of that because that was her specialty but eventually she sprang the truth on him guess what im your sister i nodded as family reunions went it was a bust the money but maybe also something else ive always thought dugger had some kind of sexual hangup at the very least hes sexually unconventional if lauren aroused him discovering she was his sister could have ignited some serious incestuous panic and rage toss in lauren trying to horn in on his inheritance and she was finished she couldnt have picked a worse time to surface big tips lauren deluding herself that she was the dancer knew the steps but her life had been choreographed for her he opened the car door and got in inheritance makes me wonder about something else alex that story cheryl duke told you about the gas leak what if that was no accident but an attempt to eliminate another couple of slices my throat got tight and my breath caught baxter and sage the dead dog tipped cheryl off she and the kids got lucky but they also ended up back at the duke estate under the control of the duke family it puts a whole new flavor on kent irvings remark about cheryl being a neglectful mother setting the stage so no ones shocked when the kids fall in the pool or tumble over the cliff or have a grisly mishap on that funicular or drown in the ocean cheryl fell asleep on the beach so shes giving them more to work with true i said shes no genius but why should she suspect people without the capacity for evil cant imagine the worst of intentions people who cant imagine become sweet targets those kids i pictured high walls metal gates closedcircuit tv riptides he shook his head oh jesus i said look alex these people are bad but theyre not stupid bumping off the kids is gonna be messy period doing it so soon after laurens death would be foolish on the chance that anyone ever connects them to lauren but there might be some time pressure here tony duke dying wanting to tie up loose ends before the wills read isnt there some way in just enough to scare them off what i can do right now is call ruiz and gallardo and ask for a look at janes finances if some sort of money link between her and duke can be verified if she made copies of those letters she wrote him thatll go a ways toward establishing a motive and justifying another visit to dr dugger and hinting around the risk of course is that dugger and anita and brotherinlaw pull up their tents get rid of evidence hide behind lawyers do whatever they have to do money and power i said some things never change he started up the car people in their position why should i lie to you getting to them is not going to be easy chapter robin wasnt home that bothered me it also made me feel relieved and that ate at me further shed left a message on the machine alex im still tied up with youknowwho now his publicist wants me to stick around for some photographs showing him how to hold the guitar finger chords accurately silly stuff but theyre paying by the hour after the photo session which could be late we may go out to dinner a bunch of us hes got an entourage maybe at rue faubourg over on hillhurst you can try me there later or sooner here at the studio weve moved from the manse to golden horse sound heres the number be well alex i phoned the recording studio got voice mail left a message was thinking about baxter and sage when robin called back hi i said hi sorry for the long day she sounded tired and distant and not the least bit sorry everything okay sure how about with you youre not still angry why would i be angry i dont know maybe ive been a little absent recently well she said its not like im not used to that you are angry no of course not listen alex i really cant talk right now theyre calling me ah stardom i said please she said well talk later we need to get away together i dont mean dinner and an orgasm real time time away a vacation like normal people take okay that fit your schedule sure are you because whatever youve been involved in that girl has taken you to another galaxy i always have time for you i said silence look i wont go to dinner with the gang they make a big deal about it elvis and his hangerson like summer camp everyone does everything together but im not part of it i dont need to participate no i said finish up do what you need to do and leave you all alone i know you need solitude but i think ive been giving you too much thats what im trying to get across both of us have let things slip its me i said youve been fine fine she said damning with faint praise come on robin sorry i guess i am feeling a little displaced finish up and come home and then well fake out being normal and plan a vacation name the place anywhere but here alex theres nothing going on that a little mellowing out wont cure right nothing i said everything will work out i waited until well after robins phone call until the sound of her voice the tone and the content had finally stopped resonating before pulling the scrap of paper out of my wallet ninefifteen pm my office windows were black and id been imagining a black ocean small faces bobbing in the waves sucked down the circling of sharks a mothers endless wail cheryl duke answered on the fifth ring oh hi hi wow you called you sound surprised i said well you never know oh i said i dont think you get ignored too often no she said merrily not too often so i was thinking maybe we could get together were you hmm well what did you have in mind its a little late for dinner but i could handle that if you havent eaten or maybe drinks ive eaten giggles youve been thinking about food and drink huh its a start ive been thinking about your babies murdered about finding some way to warn you got to start somewhere she said where and when were you thinking im open openminded too i like to think so bet you do hmm i just got the kids down how about in half an hour where another giggle just like that huh johnny on the spot agreeable when im motivated ill bet she said well how about no drinks just some intelligent conversation sure thats fine just conversation at least for now absolutely mr agreeable i try i said try and youll succeed um i cant go too far the kids how about the same place the country mart no she said too public meet me up the beach from where i am down by the old paradise cove pier down where the sand dollar used to be where you got your kayak its quiet there nice and private pretty too i go down there by myself sometimes just to look at the ocean okay i said but theres a gate arm down by the old guard shack park along the side of the road and walk the rest of the way down thats what i do youll see my expedition pulled to the side and know im there if im not it means something came up one of the kids woke up whatever but ill do my best great looking forward to it me too alex at night the drive was an easy glide and i pulled off pch onto the paradise cove turnoff at i navigated the speed bumps and drove slowly searching for cheryls expedition no sign of the suv as the gate arm came into view and i pulled to the left parked sat for a while tried to figure out how id transform what she thought was a date into the scariest conversation shed ever had a date i hoped id get back before robin got home if i didnt id just say id been driving i remained in the seville awhile longer coming up with no easy script wondering if cheryl would actually show and if not would that be enough for me to drop the whole thing and leave town with robin be normal i got out of the car descended toward the construction site on foot using a tentative quarter moon as my compass reached bottom dodged nails and planks and shingles and boards chilly night purplish black sky freckled by starlight the water below inky identically blemished off to the south the remains of the paradise cove pier listed like a drunk pilings angled dangerously toward the ocean someone had peeled back the chain link that blocked access and for a moment i wondered if i was alone but when i stopped i saw no movement other than the breezenudged boughs of sycamores heard nothing but the tide i walked around aimlessly no more insightful than when id arrived a husky engine hum filtered down from the road then a car door slamming footsteps rapid footsteps cheryl dukes hourglass shape appeared seconds later descending the slope smoothly making herself easy to spot in a tight pale cardigan white tshirt and white jeans swinging her arms purposeful but relaxed lithe i said over here and headed toward her she looked at me waved when i reached her she was smiling the cardigan was pink cashmere cropped above her firm waistline straining at the chest i dressed so you could see me oh i saw you all right she laughed threw her arms around my neck kissed me full on the lips her tongue pressed its way through my teeth licked my palate filled my throat retreated she threw back her head laughing wiggling the tongue huge and pointed curling the tip upward and tickling the bottom of her nose see she said size matters all kinds of ways one hand cupped the back of my head as sharp little teeth nibbled at my chin and i thought of her son biting down on my ear a family of carnivores my arms were at my sides and she grabbed my hands and planted them on her rear her breasts asserted themselves against my chest obstructive unyielding her pelvis rotated against mine then the palms of her hands replaced the breasts as she shoved me away thats all you get for now her hair was loose full bleached white by the moon and she turned tossing it into a production shucks i said still feeling her tongue in my gullet aw she said poor baby another soft shove why should i let you fuck me we barely know each other a guy can hope laughing she took my hand as she led me back toward the construction mess wherere we off to i said she pointed to the remnants of the pier i love it up there the way it just goes off into nowhere eternity yeah as we neared the peeledback fence i said is it safe more laughter who knows she pulled me onto the broken promenade let go of my hand and began skipping along the warped boards i felt the wood beneath my feet hum in response my toe caught on a splintered shank and i almost lost my balance cheryl was well ahead of me dancing across planks separated enough for black water to shine through i watched her pick up speed break into a run toward the piers shattered end as if building momentum for a high dive she stopped short inches from the edge shoulders thrown back hair wild hands set on the arc of flesh that curved above the waistline of her jeans i caught up just as she crossed her arms and pulled off her sweater and her tshirt flung both garments aside the manufactured breasts bobbled like saddlebags as laughter shook her upper body nipples big and erect and aimed skyward like the heatseeking weapons they were she edged backward so that the heels of her running shoes tipped over the piers terminus vertigo clamped around my gut as she began bouncing lightly and i backed away aw she said cmon its a great feeling ill take your word for it flyings not your thing not tonight she bounced some more spread her arms probably not any night what if not doing it means i dont fuck you like i said before aw shucks louder giggles but shaky tinged with hurt she began sidestepping along the edge breathing fast she spoke again her voice constricted pretty cool huh i could always balance impressive i can swallow swords too spent some time with the circus something like that she reached the far end sidestepped her way back stood on one foot arched the other behind her into space i watched and didnt say a word and wondered how id ever get across the concept of danger she began humming tunelessly closed her eyes walked several steps blind humming but not without fear starlit streams of sweat ran from her armpits and coursed the swell of her chest she began gasping for breath but kept going finally without warning she stepped away from the void and shouted yes at the sky massaged her breasts and shouted again then she sat down on the misshapen planks drew her knees to her chin lowered her head you okay i said im great cmere i stepped closer and she pulled me down beside her youre a wimp but youre cute nuzzling my neck she leaned her head on my shoulder we could do it right here if i was into doing it she grabbed my hair tugged gently then harder the picture in my mind is were back there hooking a thumb at the edge you on bottom me on top with your head hanging over the side and youre looking up at me deep inside me your balls knocking against my ass so into how im making you feel that you wouldnt care even if you did fall over how does that sound im open to new experiences but youre saying no im saying id rather live a few more years wimp she said airily youd turn down something like that cause of a little danger patting me on the head with smiling contempt she stood bent low swung her breasts toward my mouth then curved away too bad little man i need dedication she said in a hard voice had enough of wimps and losers i got up on my feet tony dukes a wimp smiling she came toward me reached out a hand and stroked my hair again polished nails spit back starlight touching the tip of my chin she reared back and slapped me hard across the mouth my head rocked and my teeth buzzed as if id sucked current from a live wire you dont know me dont make like you do my lip throbbed when i touched it my fingers came away wet you ruined the mood she said by not hanging over the edge aw she said you really are a wimp your loss she patted her crotch what ive got here could snap you like a turtle and drain you like a pump practiced patter hooker talk had she freelanced just like lauren between skating and dancing or had it been her main gig before meeting ben dugger and tony duke she wiggled back into her shirt and sweater spread her legs not enticingly a combat stance and shot me the finger he thinks hes so smart putting me in third person the grammar was more than symbolic and i knew more was wrong than my failure to meet her sexual demands an audience before i could put the threat in place figure out what to do a man emerged from the shadows at the other end of the pier approached us cheryl turned her back and walked toward him he was barely visible because unlike her hed dressed for concealment black sweatsuit black shoes he and cheryl met in the center of the pier everything rehearsed id been the only one adlibbing he thinks hes smart said cheryl kent irving said nothing his brassy hair had been tied back in a ponytail emphasizing the breadth of his round ruddy face impassive face something silvery and reflective in his right hand cheryl flashed teeth and tucked her white tshirt tight baby she said irvings onelipped mouth stayed shut its good you came when you did baby she told him he was ready to fuck me blind wouldve raped me and tossed me over the edge she kissed his ear irving still didnt react he stepped closer i had nowhere to go but into eternity but i stepped backward anyway the automatic in his hand was level with my face he thinks were stupid baby said cheryl thinks he can just happen to be boating by just happen to be sitting there doing his crossword puzzle like its some big fucking coincidence and were not gonna suspect anything asshole i said suspicions a twoway street the police know im here she said right irving remained silent and still how far was the drop how high was the tide would i hit water or slam into hardpacked sand collapsing my spine like a twig if i could calculate the drop in the darkness would rolling on my side help allow me to escape with only crushed ribs internal injuries i hadnt consulted a tide chart had no reason to terrific planning kent irving walked some more and i stood my ground the barrel of the gun was ten feet away chromium lips and a tiny black mouth that said oh cheryl stayed behind irving yammering showing all those teeth tossing her goddamned hair enough irving told her in that thin high voice she pouted sure baby you saved me baby he was an animal wouldve rammed me without mercy just used me and threw me away she placed a hand on his meaty shoulder yeah he said yeah baby so you saved me youre gonna be happy you did you really think its happy days i said the police really do know im here meeting you cheryl he cant afford that youre expendable just like baxter and sage enough irving said softly same word hed used with cheryl the lack of inflection said it all no sweat no strain eyes as animated as gravel business as usual maybe hed hired someone to shoot lauren and michelle and lance and jane but if he had it had been out of convenience not apprehension he could pull that trigger like brushing his teeth eat breakfast moments later without giving it a second thought i said you know im right kent you cant chance her talking to the police sooner or later shes got to go anyway shes stupid and nuts and undependable actually thinks youll leave anita for her and the two of you will end up with all of tonys money and live happily ever after the prince and princess you know better shes no princess youve had dozens like her just another stupid hooker with plastic tits cheryl charged toward me but irving blocked her with his free arm fuck you she shrieked fuck you in hell dont let him talk to me like that baby he cant dis me like that dont fucking let him pushing against irvings arm he closed his hand on her wrist the gun arm had never wavered if hed blinked i hadnt seen it giving him a polygraph would be academically interesting cheryl said give me the gun and let me do him i can do it you know i can ill do it right now just like i did her come on her i said lauren or michelle or jane or shawna the last name caused irvings eyes to wander for the tiniest fragment of a second uncertainty lack of familiarity bitch lauren said cheryl smugly she spat on the pier cunt lauren she thought she could be my friend thought we had rapport that i was just like her she had a point i said you both sold sex fuck you quiet said irving his hand was still clamped to her wrist something he did made her say ouch then baby hurts so good i said what a fun couple so howd you lure lauren art said cheryl making it sound like a disease she thought she was so cool we made a date to meet at the art museum and then a twist of irvings wrist shut her mouth easy he soothed hes the boss got you to set up lauren then do her i said with a woman shed let down her guard two girls and pretty pictures shed already told you her secret tell me did you watch while he hogtied her did you help him toss her in the trash it was great irving rotated his hand again and she cried out i said youre toast cheryl maybe it wont happen tonight but dont make any longterm investments even if you werent stupid and unpredictable you wouldnt figure into his plans because your kids are a problem think about that gas leak whats the next installment kent tossing baxter over the cliff then sage happens to toddle over to the pool or maybe youll just disappear them in the ocean irving smiled cheryl never saw it but his silence made her eyes go wide and scared maybe i will let you do him he told her creative i said her prints get on the gun then a bullet finds its way into her head murdersuicide lovers quarrel out on the pier youre an old hand at that kind of thing took laurens gun out of her purse after cheryl shot her and used it a week later on jane abbot setting the old man up howd you get lauren alone for the kill cheryl girl talk asshole shh said irving no more dialogue yeah i will let you do him lots of bodies piling up i said at least its not one of those senseless crime sprees youve got a definite goal in mind tonyll be dead soon and what he leaves behind is sure worth working for youre doing ben and anitas dirty work and maybe theyll even let you stick around to enjoy the windfall but you never know the rich can get funny with hired help irving didnt move cheryl said baby very softly you do love them right bax and sage sure said irving hes capable of love like youre qualified to be a nuclear physicist i said hell love them as two cute little corpses no way will they make it to first grade baby you sure are a great mom baby cheryl raised clenched fists shut up gimme it let me do him now irving didnt budge keent she whined okay cmere said irving he removed his hand from her wrist and as she stepped forward lowered his arm and circled her waist keeping the gun trained on me reaching around he squeezed her breast pinched her nipple umm she said he pinched her again ow that was too hard sorry said irving cradling her chin he kissed the tip of her nose shoved her hard as she staggered backward he moved fast staring at me as he swung the gun around he shot her twice in the face stepping back to avoid the blood spray by the time she hit the boards the gun was back on me she landed on her side thanks he told me you gave me a good idea yeah i had plans for her but this is even better happy to oblige i said but maybe she wasnt the only one with delusions think about what i said will anita and ben really be happy sharing spoiled rich kids arent big on gratitude he shrugged blood streamed from under cheryls head oil black in the starlight and he inched away from the welling pool doesnt matter does it i said not looking at the body youve got plans for them too really think youre going to walk away with everything he snorted sighed lets get this over with i wasnt lying about the police i said youre a prime suspect they know about your garment biz days meeting lauren back when she worked the mart mustve been a shock when she showed up at the estate with ben good old ben screwing up again picking up another dumb blonde hes got a thing for them doesnt he uses his experiments to find them and to hit on them but once he gets them the poor schmuck doesnt know what to do with them cheryl lauren shawna yeager what happened to her how did she get in the way that same flicker of confusion in his dead eyes cheryls blood kept spreading closer to his shoes and he sidled away again despite myself i looked at her life juice leaking from the mop of blond hair dipping to a low spot between the boards trickling through they say sharks can smell a drop in millions of gallons was the shark internet buzzing irving raised the automatic another blonde i said but lauren wasnt dumb anything but she was a double threat knew you from the bad old days the hookeranight days knew stuff you strongly preferred anita didnt find out about and on top of that she tells you who she is what she wants talk about insult and injury irving sighed again the sweats made him look pudgy his ponytail made him look like nothing but mr midlife crisis and as he aimed the gun at my face a sick sour thought flashed in my head so this is how it happens a clown like this then sorry robin then a voice behind irving shouted kent whatre you doing whats going on and irving blinked and turned as footfalls twanged the pier a man running toward us irving moving reflexively the gun arm wavering realizing his error and pivoting back toward me but id already thrown myself at him and was grabbing for the automatic managing only to jar his elbow he fired up in the air the new voice said oh my god and irving slashed out at me and i chopped at him keeping myself close fighting for the weapon a new set of hands grabbed for irving irving growling now fired again the new voice said oh and went down but irving had been thrown off balance and i brought my knee up hard into his groin and as he doubled over stabbed at his eyes with my fingertips i made contact with something soft and he screamed and stumbled and i shoved him kept shoving him down to the planks got on top straddled him kept hitting him it had been a while since id messed with karate and what i did to him was more blind rage than martial arts chopping at his head and his neck over and over and over using stiff fingers and frozen fists bloodying my knuckles slashing and slamming until well after hed stopped moving the gun had landed several feet from his arm i picked it up aimed it at irving he didnt move his face was pulp a few feet away ben dugger moaned i went to see how he was doing chapter wrong i said by lightyears dugger smiled about what about you about lots of things it was eleven am three days after id watched cheryl duke die during that time robin had left one message on the machine sorry i missed you ill try to call again no home number was listed for her friend debby and when i tried debbys dental office i got voice mail informing me the doctor was out for a week for three days my life had been stagnating but ben dugger had traveled from the ambulance id called to the er at st johns to three and a half hours of surgery tying together blood vessels in his thigh to recovery then two nights in a private room at the hospital now this place bright yellow and vast and dim the air sweet with cinnamon and antiseptic lots of inlaid french furniture everything ornate and antique except the bed which was all function and much too small for the room the iv stand the bank of medical gizmos the room was on the third floor of his fathers mansion doting nurses hovered round the clock but he seemed mostly to want to rest id phoned yesterday to request permission waited half a day for the call back from a woman who identified herself as tony dukes personal assistants assistant had been allowed through the copper gates an hour ago id driven up sat scrutinized as the closedcircuit camera rotated for several minutes then the tentacles parted and a mountainous bouncer type in a fudge brown suit stepped out and showed me where to park when i exited the car he was there escorted me through a fern grove and a pine forest to the peachcolored blueroofed house stayed with me as we entered the building exerting the merest pressure at my elbow propelling me across an acre of black granite iced by two tons of baccarat chandelier hanging three stories above the entry hall commodious enough for a presidential convention flemish paintings carved gilded baseboards and moldings gold velvet walls the elevator cut so seamlessly into the plush fabric that i couldve walked past it finally this room with its canarycolored damask walls bad color for recuperation dugger looked jaundiced he coughed i said need anything smiling again he shook his head pillows surrounded him a percale halo his thin hair was plastered across his brow and beneath the sallowness his skin tone was dirty snow the iv taped to his arm dripped and the instruments monitoring his vitals blinked and bleeped and graphed his mortality the ceiling above him was a trompe loeil grape arbor painted in garish hues silly in any context but especially so now if not for the way i felt i mightve smiled anyway i said i just wanted to whatever you think you did you made up for it he pointed shakily at his bandaged leg irvings stray bullet had passed through his thigh nicked his femoral artery id tied back the wound stanched as much of the bleeding as i could used the cell phone in the pocket of irvings sweatpants to call not even close to a tie i said if you hadnt shown up hey its a soft science he said psychology we study we guess sometimes were right other times weak smile the door opened and dr rene maccaferri marched in those same appraising eyes white lab coat over black turtleneck and slacks pointy little lizardskin shoes on toosmall feet he looked like a goombah playing doctor and i told myself i could be forgiven my theories mr wrong maccaferri ignored me checked the monitors approached duggers bedside they taking good care of you too good rene whats too good im not used to it try maccaferri told him i talked to the vascular surgeon hell be over today to look you over monitor you for infection make sure no thromboses you look good to me but better to make sure whatever you say rene hows dad maccaferris thick black fuzzycaterpillar brows knitted and he glanced at me its okay rene daddy is about the same said the doctor turning to leave okay rene thanks as always maccaferri stopped at the door theres always and theres always duggers eyes went moist when the door closed i said im sorry to add to your burden both of us knew what i meant life had thrown him a double dose of grief anticipation of the loss to come pining for the sister hed never really gotten to know meeting her losing her he turned his head to the side and fought back tears i know the road to hells paved with good intentions but im one of those people who still takes intention into account whatever you did it was because you cared about lauren my throats a little dry could you please hand me that up i poured soda into a paper cup held it to his lips he drank thanks how long did you actually treat her tell me about that tell me anything you can hed shared his story i had no option but to reciprocate i recited speaking automatically while another lobe of my brain remembered the anxiety in his eyes when milo had questioned him about lauren what id taken for guilt had been pain a solitary ache lauren and i agreed to do it the right way not just spring it on everyone there was anita to think about dads illness has plunged her lower than ive ever seen her and she doesnt do well with change and dad himself i was concerned about the impact so was lauren she wanted whatever happened to go smoothly or not at all she said dad knew about her years ago when laurens mother wrote to him he called wanted to meet lauren but her mother put it off said lauren had emotional problems she wasnt ready dad tried a couple more times then dad backed off that was just like him make his offer then not push maybe its a character flaw emotional laziness i dont know sometimes growing up i felt dad was too laidback as if he didnt care but on balance it was better than his trying to dominate anita and me in laurens case maybe if he wouldve pushed how can you secondguess by the time lauren did build up the courage to meet me and tell me who she was dad was sick and weak i was worried abut the shock maybe i whats the use right from the beginning lauren and i got along so well clicked as if wed known each other our whole lives and this is going to sound childish we had fun imagining what things would be like once we our little experiment we called it figuring out a way of integrating lauren into the family i said the phone booth he nodded winced moved his leg and his breath caught that was part of our arrangement when we built up the courage to bring lauren to dads house shed call me at point dume and if it was okay relatively quiet at the house id pick her up i told people she was my friend childish i know i think we both liked the cloakanddagger aspect i would have so liked to know her better longer my little sister at that point hed broken down and sobbed and id turned away feeling low and intrusive until his voice drew me back dont worry ive had enough therapy not to be ashamed of my feelings i guess what i want you to know is that lauren had value to me dammit she deserves to be cried over maybe thats what bothers me the most theres no one left to cry for her but me that time you and sturgis showed up at my apartment and told me what happened to her it was as if my entire world was imploding im not the most spontaneous person but right then i couldve just gone mad of course i didnt too controlled too much at risk the thing about lauren was that she made me feel like a kid something i rarely felt when i actually was a kid the two of us were planning and scheming laughing about what we had in common our differences shed find something we just couldnt see eye to eye on and laugh and say so much for chromosomes that kind of thing no one knew not anita or the women at the office no one at least i thought so then i started seeing things looks passing between kent and cheryl and lauren would be going off with cheryl talking when i asked her about it she just said cheryl was nice but not too bright i never liked kent but never did i imagine how can you imagine things like that poor anita outwardly shes tough but its an act shes always been frail has irritable bowel syndrome asthma migraines most of her childhood was spent in doctors offices kent was vulgar but how could i know i keep asking myself that lauren going off with cheryl more and more was there some way to know no id told him no one knew he asked for more up drank sank back against the pillows closed his eyes a controlled man a kind man delivering toys to a church with no ulterior motive donating percent of his trust fund every year to charity no one had a bad word to say about him because there was nothing bad to say id persisted in thinking of him as a warped killer sometimes a cigar is just a cigar i supposed id saved his life but given all that and the bullet hed taken for me it seemed a feeble twist of reciprocity hed been charitable enough to grant me another false equality sharing lauren as if my stint as a failed therapist could come close to the bond hed shared with her only to have it ripped from him a nice guy in another place another time i wouldnt have minded shooting the breeze with him talking about psychology learning what it had been like growing up tony dukes son but i had nothing more to offer him and what hed been through what lauren had been through would stay with me for a long long time so would the loose ends anita baxter and sage and now i had my own problems to deal with as i rang for his nurse i knew that most likely id never see him or anyone else in the duke family again and that would be just fine chapter the nurse called for someone to see me out and another big man showed up a lobster pink blond with a shaved head wearing a lime green suit over a black tshirt i gave dugger a small salute and walked out of the yellow room nice day sir said my escort using the same elbow steer to guide me through the black walnut hallway gilded niches were filled with statuary urns brimmed with flowers monogrammed ds punctuated the blueandgold carpeting at twentyfoot intervals on the way to the elevator we passed a room whose double doors had been shut when id arrived now they were spread open and i caught a glimpse of a ballroomsized space with zebrastriped walls another hospital bed the stoic dr maccaferri standing by the headboard drawing blood through a syringe that hed jabbed into an iv line another toosmall bed a tiny bald head barely visible above blue satin covers wizened elfin sleeping or approximating slumber gaping mouth toothless motionless the pressure on my elbow intensified mr nice day said please keep moving sir i drove home knowing the house would be empty after that night on the pier id spent hours at st johns hospital had phoned home twice gotten the machine returned just after two am to find robin wide awake in the bedroom packing a suitcase when i tried to hold her she said no early vacation i said everything was wrong and i was talking gibberish by myself she said honey she threw clothing into the valise i got home at ten was worried sick until you just happened to call at midnight honey i alex i just cant take this anymore need time to settle myself down we both do i said touching her hair lets stick with the original plan and get away together i promise maybe in a few days she said suddenly crying you dont know the pictures that filled my head you again then milo told me what happened what were you thinking a date with a bimbo another undercover adventure that nearly got you killed not an adventure anything but i was trying to help some kids the last thing i thought would happen was you can help kids by doing what you were trained for sit and talk to them thats how this started robin unable to keep my voice steady lauren was a patient it just got out of control thats the point when youre involved things tend to expand its like youre a magnet for ugliness you know me im a structured person i work with wood and metal and machines things that can be measured im not saying thats ideal or the only way maybe it means theres something wrong with my psyche but theres something in between alex the uncertainty you keep putting me through every time you step out the door not knowing if youll come back i always come back i reached for her again but she shook her head and said let me go im sorry lets talk about it she shook her head i need perspective then maybe well talk where are you going san diego my friend debby the dentist the dentist she said she and i used to have fun together i used to have friends now all ive got is you and spike and my work i need to expand me too i said ill take up a hobby golf sure she said smiling in spite of herself thatll be the day what impossible if there was something less likely than impossible you and golf would be it alex im not trying to tame you i want you healthy thats the point you standing around on the links in funny shoes all that dead time is not a prescription for wellbeing lets not prolong this ill call you latching the suitcase she headed for the door spikes in the truck im sure you wont mind that not only am i abandoned its for another man she kissed me hard on the lips turned the doorknob said take care when will you call soon a couple of days short hard laugh what i said i was just about to say be careful baby like i always do when were about to go our separate ways rotten habit i shouldnt have to say that chapter the first day she was gone i was miserable and the next one was shaping up the same way when milo dropped by at nine am and showed me jane abbots correspondence with tony duke she kept copies he said in her safedeposit box on the bottom under some stock certificates two letters in the first jane reminded duke of their time in hawaii and informed him he had a daughter a penciled notation on the bottom was dated five days later td called pm no prob with wants to meet l i said probs maybe later in the second jane thanked duke for his quick response apologized for restricting him from lauren describing her as a very bright young lady but unfortunately through no fault of yours dear tony she is currently emotionally ill and highly troubled td called x says he knows doctors put him off lauren gone again no idea where next time bail or not a final page in janes handwriting laid out the financial agreement fifty thousand dollars a year placed in trust for lauren to be supervised by jane with the understanding that jane would do everything in her power to effect a reunion and that by the time lauren reached twentysix duke would get to meet her father and daughter had fallen short by six months i gave him back the papers whats the status on mel abbot he should be released soon though no ones sure where to put him the closest relative they can find is a cousin in new jersey almost as old as mel meanwhile irvings right down the hall from abbot in the jail ward you did good work on his face the da will file multiple counts of conspiracy and firstdegree homicide with special circumstances for mass murder cruelty and profit motive gretchens helping them put the case together in order to plea down her own conspiracy rap the feds finally came through and verified that irving had been one of her bigtime clients all weve got on her is her pal ingrid knowing i was looking for michelle and your seeing gretchen enter the duke estate the next day gretchen works the system again i said what the da wants is irving on a platter and gretchen can fill in the blanks she can also supply the motive for michelle no there wasnt any blackmail no ones sure michelle even knew anything dangerous but irving thought she did to be brutally honest my mentioning michelles name to gretchen signed her death warrant and no im not blaming myself i was doing my job its just the way things happen sometimes he rubbed his face and gretchens still claiming shes never heard of shawna id like to say ive been right about shawna not being part of this but at this point i dont know whats real and what isnt for all i know irving took pictures of her boffed her killed her gretchen set up michelle and lance and she walks maybe shell get hers one day i also found out that irvings rag biz went under because of financial irregularities he left behind an army of creditors and that beach construction project is leveraged to the hilt plenty of claws being sharpened he aint gonna find too many character witnesses what about anita so far she doesnt appear to be dirty he said when i saw her she looked worse than dugger some kind of intestinal problems she actually threw up four times during a onehour interview she seems genuinely shocked by what her husband and cheryl were up to were talking emotionally shattered even my jaded detective ears aint ringing as i was leaving the mafioso doc was putting her on tranqs what else oh yeah charming lyle the model father finally showed up looks like he really was hunting rangers picked him up for shooting a doe out of season caught him skinning it by the side of his truck bigtime fine and they sent him back home bitching all the way asshole actually called me up again yesterday wanting to know if id learned anything about laurens will whatd you tell him well he said i controlled myself didnt allow myself free expression of pentup emotions he ambled to the fridge stuck his head in emerged emptyhanded walked over to the window and played with a houseplant what i told him is lauren died poor which is the truth right chapter by the third day robin still hadnt called and i tried to drag myself out of inertial sludge into a walking depression finding agnes yeager was easy olivia brickerman lcsw a friend and former mentor at western pediatrics now a professor of social work at the gracious old school crosstown had full command of the medical and private insurance data banks and it took thirty seconds for her to pull up the name the age of privacy she said always wear clean underwear yeager agnes mavis dob fiftyone years ago looks like she did some time at county gen from the billing codes endocrinology cardiology some lung workups a psych consult shortterm consult four sessions after that she was transferred to the rehab unit at casa de los amigos for a month then discharged to an aftercare facility in san bernardino sweethaven sounds like something from a kiddie book thats the last thing ive got last billing was thirteen months ago she read off the convalescent homes phone number so hows gorgeous robin terrific and you the same yeah what i dont sound terrific the doctor gets defensive she said cheerfully youre forgetting boychik that before i became a bigshot academic i did what you do and right now my third ear is telling me youre not smiling okay now i am i said actually forcing my lips into position hows that meat but no motion boychik youre sure youre okay im terrific how about you changing the subject dont you think i deserve a more subtle form of resistance im fantastic alex menopause is everything they claim and more but my fine spirits should be obvious unlike other people i dont have that schleppy tone permeating my voice lack of sleep thats all lack of sleep and agnes mavis yeager no i said its complicated with you it tends to be we should have lunch its been a long time you can tell me stories and ill pretend to be your mother its a deal liv yeah yeah yeah meanwhile i wont eat on the chance that if you do call my mouth wont be full a phone call to sweethaven convalescent home leavened by a few lies got me the information that agnes yeager had moved out three months ago forwarding address the four seasons hotel on doheny the personnel office there confirmed that ms yeager was cleaning rooms on the eight am to three pm shift working again so shed mended physically returning to la so maybe she hadnt given up at pm i drove to the four seasons handed the doorman a ten and asked him to keep the seville up front id just had the car washed and waxed and he smiled as he nosed it between a bentley arnage and a ferrari testarossa the lobby teemed with grim skinny things in allblack and i pushed past them and used the house phone to call housekeeping once i got a supervisor on the line i talked quickly and ambiguously said it was important that i speak to mrs yeager old friend some kind of family issue is this an emergency sir hard to say i just need a few minutes hold on several minutes later a weak sibilant voice came on yes mrs yeager my name is alex delaware im a psychologist who works with the police and ive been looking into shawnas case ive just begun nothing to report im afraid but i was wondering if we could talk a psychologist what some kind of research no maam i consult to the police am trying to find some answers i know its been a long time i like psychologists one of them helped me i was sick they thought it was where are you sir down in the lobby here oh well im off in a few minutes ill meet you out on burton way near the employee exit she was there by the time i walked around the corner a small thin grayhaired woman wearing a charwomans pink uniform her hair was cropped and coarse and her eyeglasses were steelrimmed rectangles freshly applied scarlet lipstick screamed from chapped lips and her cheeks had been rouged highwaisted and flatchested she looked ten years older than fiftyone thank you so much for doing this dr was it delavalle delaware im afraid i cant promise you im past promises im parked a few blocks down do you mind walking not at all its a nice day anyway she said at least weatherwise we headed east on burton and she thanked me again for reopening shawnas case i tried to offer a disclaimer but she wasnt hearing it went on about how it was about time the police had never really investigated fully and that detective they assigned riley didnt do a darn thing not that i want to speak ill of the dead he died i said you didnt know just over two months ago retired to the desert and spent all his time playing golf and just keeled over on the golf course i know because i used to call him not too often because frankly i didnt have much faith in him but he was a link to shawna he wasnt a bad man riley just not energetic he did give me his home number when he retired last time i phoned him his poor wife told me and i ended up comforting her so you see im not hoping for miracles but at least i have an open mind cause in my opinion riley and the rest of them never did im not saying they deliberately set out not to care but i feel to this day that they just thought finding shawna was hopeless and never really tried no anger a speech shed recited often what do you think they couldve done publicize more i tried the newspapers but they werent interested you have to be rich and famous to get attention or get killed by someone rich and famous sometimes its like that in la i said probably everywhere but all i know is la cause thats where my shawna died you see im not denying that anymore i got past that the last time i spoke to him leo riley tried to tell me not to hope for the best it was kinda funny the way he got all nervous and stuttery like he was telling me something i didnt know but id gotten there a long time ago no way could my shawna be missing this long without telling me and not be gone all i want now is to know what happened know where she is give her a decent christian burial the psychologist i talked to dr yoshimura she said everyone made a big deal about closure but closure was foolishness made up by people who write books it didnt exist how could you ever heal something like that she tapped her chest it leaves a big hole that can never be filled but you try to learn what you can and if you succeed maybe you coat it around the edges a little she was terrific yoshimura i did counseling with her cause one day i collapsed everything went black and i fell down everyone thought i had a heart attack they put me through every test known to modern mankind found out i did have high cholesterol but my heart was still okay in the end they said it was nerves anxiety dr yoshimura taught me how to relax i became a vegetarian stopped smoking i could accept relaxing from dr yoshimura because she wasnt telling me to get some closure the way everyone else was that was the thing about mr riley he was real relaxed except when it came to talking about real things like the fact that he hadnt learned a thing about shawna hed pretend to listen but i knew he wasnt i called him even after he retired because i figured it was rent he should be paying and now hes gone here im parked on swall we turned up a treelined block full of luxury apartment condominiums and she led me to an old nissan sentra once red now faded to dusty rose the cars trunk was littered with leaves twohour limit she said pointing to a parking sign but usually they dont check sometimes i park in the employee lot under the hotel but sometimes its full and i dont like those subterranean things spooky she unlocked the car do you mind sitting in here all my shawna things are in here i got into the front passenger seat and she opened the trunk and closed it and came back with a footsquare box marked kitchenware and tied with a yellow ribbon that she loosened i know i shouldnt keep it in the car she said but i like to have it close by sometimes i get a sandwich and come out here and go through it dr yoshimura said that was fine looking to me for confirmation i nodded she pulled a small pink satin album from the carton and handed it to me this is shawna when she was little thirty pages of snapshots from infancy to sixth grade mostly solos of a beautiful goldenhaired girl from early on shawna yeager had possessed a flair for the optimal pose agnes yeager was present in a handful of shots darkhaired plain a few others early faded photos featured a very tall fairhaired man with a movieidol face marred by protuberant jug ears in the snaps where he and agnes were together both parents smoked shawna surrounded by loving smiles and haze shawnas dad i said my bob he was a longdistance trucker worked for himself then vons markets he was killed by a drunk driver when shawna was four not even driving walking from the mens room to his rig at a truck stop in indio shawna didnt remember him even when he was alive he wasnt home much but he was a loving man and a virile man not much for expressing his feelings but never a cross word and he did love shawna she got her looks from him colorwise and sizewise he was six foot four and a half a big basketball star in high school shawna ended up fivenine im fivetwo and a quarter as i studied bob yeagers face something struck me i kept it to myself returned the album only to receive another larger bluebound this is her pageant stuff said agnes local newspaper stories each time she won i never pushed her into none of it the first time she saw the miss america pageant on tv she said mommy dat what i want she was four i paged through the clippings endured smile after smile agnes yeager said i know none of this will help you but maybe this the stories this kid reporter for the college paper did he was really interested in shawna wrote up a lot of stories adam green you talked to him i have did he tell you his suspicions about shawna suspicions that shed taken off her clothes and posed for dirty pictures he didnt actually come out and say it he thought he was being subtle but from the questions he was asking i could tell thats where he was leading so of course i got mad and managed to end the conversation and didnt take any more of his calls later i wondered if that had been a mistake cause that boy was the only one who seemed to have any interest in what happened to shawna and even though i got offended do you think theres a chance shawna mightve posed her shoulders rose and fell i wish i could say no way but time passes and your head clears the truth is shawna loved her looks loved her body one day she came home with an old mirror shed picked up at some junk shop and hung it in her bedroom a huge mirror she was fourteen i didnt argue everyone also says choose your battles besides you didnt want to go up against shawna she was headstrong the truth is if she couldve hung four walls of mirrors she wouldve probably my fault a day didnt go by when i wasnt telling her how gorgeous she was and if i wasnt other people were did she have any boyfriends back home the usual boys coming and going shed dump them like the trash one of them this stringbean named mark a basketball player like her dad seemed a little more serious and i asked her if they were boyfriend and girlfriend and she laughed and said no mom you know in that tone they get no mom hes just my boy comma friend mark was her age i said no he was a senior and she was a freshman the older boys always went for her and it was mutual she liked them mature looking old for their age and tall real tall why do you ask about mark just trying to get a feel for her state of mind youre thinking cause she lost her dad she was looking for a dad right someone older and tall maybe some older guy asked her to pose and she did it because she was vulnerable i stared at her she said ive had plenty of time to think so am i right that did cross my mind crossed mine too and dr yoshimuras she and i went all through that her helping to analyze everything but as far as shawna having any much older boyfriends back home i dont think so mostly she didnt have time for dating was really concentrating on her pageants and getting into college thats one thing about shawna she was always a serious student i never had to tell her to study and if she didnt get an a it was a world tragedy shed be arguing with the teacher weak smile and sometimes she got her way let me show you those report cards are on the bottom as she rummaged i said just to be thorough wheres mark now she looked up him oh no he joined the army right out of school got stationed in germany married a german girl he was out of the country when shawna disappeared wrote me the sweetest condolence card when he found out ive got that too right here a heartsandflowers hallmark landed in my palm soppy verse and a blockprinted notation dear mrs yeager please accept our sincerest condolense about shawna we know shes up with the angels astrid and mark ortega and kaylie stapled to the facing page was a studio shot of a skinny blond young man crewcut and mustachioed a chubby brunette woman and a grinning piefaced baby nice boy said agnes but shawna was too much for him she needed someone to stimulate her brain lord knows i couldnt do it never finished high school here we go these are her report cards she handed me a rubberbanded stack twelve grades worth of nearly straight as achievement tests consistently above the ninetyfifth percentile teachers comments shawnas a very bright little girl but she does tend to visit with her neighbors a joy wish they were all like her has a firm grip of the material and loves to learn strongwilled but she always ends up doing the work at the bottom of the stack was a transcript from the u four courses during the quarter shed never finished a quartet of incompletes it arrived after she was gone said agnes when i opened the envelope i just lost it that word incomplete when youre in that state everythings got a double meaning youre looking for something to be angry about i nearly ripped this into shreds now im glad i didnt though i did give away the clothes shawna left behind waited until a few months ago but i was able to do it i stared at the transcript placed it back on the bottom smart said agnes see what i mean yes i do mrs yeager is there anything else well you might tell me what youre planning to do im going to review shawnas file i know that sounds vague and bureaucratic but im just starting out if i think of something may i call you youd better she grabbed my hand in both of hers i have a feeling about you youre a serious person however it comes out youre going to give it your best thank you very very much thank you i said i hope to justify your confidence im not asking for my daughter back she said all i want to do is bury her know where she is so i can visit on christmas and anniversaries that doesnt seem like too much to ask for does it no maam thanks for your time i opened the car door can i have that back she said pointing to the stack of report cards oh sure sorry anything you need a copy of i can get you i gave her hand a squeeze and left chapter five pm the psych building was nearly empty i spotted gene dalby from down the hall standing at his office door keys in hand his gawky frame limned by institutional fluorescence coming or going i said alex hey there going as a matter of fact could you spare a few moments look at this he said i dont see the guy for years and now hes becoming a fixture i didnt speak the look on my face murdered his smile something wrong alex lets go inside gene i really am in a hurry he said things to see people to do this is worth making time for whoa sounds ominous i didnt answer fine fine he said unlocking the door his ring was full of keys and the tremor in his hand made it peal like a wind chime he sat at his desk i stayed on my feet let me lay it out for you i said on the one hand id never have known about shawna if you hadnt mentioned her so thats a point in your favor why would you open a can of worms on the other hand you lied to me pretended not to know her some kind of campus beauty queen was the way you put it shane something or shana i dont recall her exact name but she was in your class i just had a look at her transcript psych dalby monday wednesday friday three pm you taught intro in addition to social the heavy teaching load you told me about he ran his hand through his hair raising spikes oh come on you cant be serious do you know how many kids are in a twentyeight i said i checked with the registrar your section was a lastminute addon for students who hadnt gotten into the four scheduled sections twentyeight kids gene youd remember each student especially a student that looked like shawna his giraffe neck corded this is horseshit i dont have to sit and listen to no you dont but you might want to because its not going to go away his hands clawed the desk he removed his glasses repeated horseshit i said but youre not kicking me out silence so you lied gene and i have to wonder why then when i start adding up some things ive learned about shawna it gets really interesting such as the fact that she had a definite attraction to older men older wealthy men she was very clear about wanting the finer things in life ferraris with your dotcom income youd fit that bill she also prized intelligence what she called intellectuality once again who better than you gene to satisfy that criterion back in grad school you were tops in the class had a talent for thinking profound things out loud alex also i said ive seen pictures of her father he died when she was four so she really didnt remember him probably idealized him did she ever show you his picture gene he glared at me flushed a pair of huge fists rolled along the desktop ripping off his glasses he flung them at the wall they thudded against his books and landed on the rug ineffectual he said cant do anything right bob yeager i said sixfour plus redblond hair jug ears a basketball star in high school werent you a starting forward all the way through college he buried his face in his hands muttered my glory days the resemblance is damn striking gene he could have been your brother he sat up i know damn well what he couldve been yes she showed me a goddamn picture the first goddamn time she came in here during goddamn office hours to talk about an exam allegedly and shes wearing this little black dress sits down and it rides up i stick to the topic shes a bright kid then she whips out this picture of her old man thought it was funny i told her i wasnt a freudian alex i didnt do anything never seduced her its not what you think the whole thing was just a terrible oh shit youre not going to believe me are you whether i do or not isnt the issue gene the police know oh no oh yes but what could they know i said nothing let me explain first alex please okay no promises i said you yourself said if i hadnt told you about her but you did gene on some level you wanted me to chase it oh he said his eyes narrowed and one fist inched closer to me now im on the couch this is bullshit i reached for the doorknob wait you cant bop in here like this and expect me just to capitulate i dont expect a thing i said and frankly right now your peace of mind isnt paramount to me i just spent some time with a woman whos been living a nightmare for over a year knowing but not knowing just like you told me the first time the ultimate parents nightmare and guess what she has something in common with you gene you both despise the word closure you think its poppsych crapolsky but she has a much greater understanding of the terms inadequacy alex please she doesnt expect a miracle gene but she would like to say goodbye visit her daughters grave from time to time maybe leave some flowers he bowed his head again covered his eyes with his hands oh jesus yeah i wanted you to chase it i guess i dont know what the hell came over me i wasnt planning to say a goddamn thing and then you started telling me about that other girl whom i really didnt know thats the truth alex and synapses just started clicking memories its been sitting here all this time touching his belly but still what the hell was i thinking cause i remember you from grad school the bulldog they called you behind your back jokes about your being a goddamn obsessivecompulsive you never let go of anything what the fuck was i thinking tearing at his hair when he stopped i said maybe you werent thinking guilts a great motivator maybe you were just feeling knowing he had something else in common with agnes yeager the great void holes that couldnt be filled shit he said the police already know i nodded a lie but he didnt deserve better and those big hands could do damage in close quarters i didnt okay look just give me a chance to explain this is what happened an accident a goddamn stupid accident okay i stood there fuck you can be a sphinx im listening gene right his adams apple took a joyride his armpits had grown sodden and pink scalp shined where hed raised furrows in his hair yeah i was we were having a thing and dont preach to me about that she came on to me sure i couldve resisted but i didnt didnt want to why would i resist marge and i never forget excuses you dont want to hear them the truth is she was the hottest thing ive ever come across ive been married twentythree years and ive been basically faithful but this girl shawna she was something else gave off a heat she was the girl every guy wants in high school but cant get unless hes a no need to get into that we had a thing it was mutual she was madly in love with me said she was i knew that was horseshit this was a fling once she figured out i wasnt going to leave marge shed end it but in the meantime she could do things with her also she was smart as hell not just a body we could talk even at her age she had things to say number one in my class so there was no conflict of interest no trading grades for he choked on his own saliva endured a paroxysm of coughing filled his mug with cold coffee and swallowed were talking a month five weeks tops alex right from the beginning of the quarter soon after yeah the second time she came in little white dress like a tennis outfit she had this fresh clean smell this perfume of youth it happened i cant change that but after that i was discreet meeting her only offcampus we used to drive up in the hills above bel air find a spot he smiled parking shed make a production of taking off oh man alex it was just what you wanted high school to be like then it got complicated she was also thats the thing about her she was also narcissistic seriously narcissistic really into her looks her brains the whole bit one time she told me she could have the president if she wanted not much of a challenge there but she meant it globally alex any president of anything this omnipotence she had going eighteen years old all that sexual confidence the color left his face even now thinking about her i cant change what happened try to muster some empathy youre a shrink not a judge narcissistic i prompted how did that complicate things it led her to a bad place the wrong people stupid decisions she read some ad in the cub not one of those experiments i told you about i guess i mentioned those to throw you off wanting you to chase it but not wanting it im fucked up all that therapy all those years on both sides of the couch and it doesnt mean a what kind of ad for photographers models some sleazeball outfit in hollywood i dont even remember the name claiming to be freelancing for duke and playboy and penthouse she never checked it out with me probably wouldnt have listened if id advised against it she and her roommate went for it auditioned ended up posing it was supposed to be bikini shots ended up being nudie shots then the sleazes asked her and the roommate to do some lesbian stuff simulation and the roommate didnt want to and left but shawna stayed damn her so fucking in love with herself they brought in another model and she the two of them did it then they mustve realized shawna could be motivated easily so they brought a guy in and she ended up they got snaps of her sucking off some donkey dong okay and she brings them to me on our next the next time we saw each other like shes proud of them brought a whole packet bikini nudies softcore then at the bottom her little mouth doing the hoover saving the best for last like i was supposed to appreciate it get turned on by it he slammed a fist on the desk papers jumped i lost it man just blew yelled at her called her all kinds of names instead of crying she yells back gets aggressive tells me the photographer worked for all the top mags promised her a gig with playboy or penthouse or duke this was going to be her ticket to fame and fortune can you believe that alex smart girl and she falls for a shitforbrains story like that the narcissism i wish i could get across how much this girl loved herself alex half the time when we were together i felt i was nothing more than a vibrator he stopped talking stared at the wall got a glazed look in his eyes what happened gene it was quick i got pissed she got pissed back we had a screaming fight she jumped out of the car we were over by lake hollywood up in the hollywood hills a spot i remembered from when marge and i were dating she got out started running up the road i went after her and she tripped and fell and hit her head on a rock and just lay there silent all of a sudden the whole goddamn city got really silent a big soap bubble of silence and i was trapped inside like a cartoon i got down beside her no pulse no respiration i tried cpr nothing then i got a look at her head and knew i was wasting my time she got hit here brain tissue was leaking out he touched the spot where the back of his neck met his skull the medulla alex basic respiration she was gone i got some plastic tarp out of the car i keep it there for when marge and i buy plants at the nursery wrapped her up and took her somewhere where he didnt answer maybe i should talk to a lawyer sure i said therell be plenty of time for talk but think about it any way you can garner sympathys gonna help you agnes yeager would like to say goodbye he opened a desk drawer and for one panicky moment i thought hed secreted a weapon there but he pulled out paper and pencil drew a square several curving lines im diagramming you a map happy ecstatic i said in someone elses dead voice chapter good map gene had always been
