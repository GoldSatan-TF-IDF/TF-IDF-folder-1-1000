thomas hoover syndrome chapter sunday april am alexa hampton was awakened by a sensation in her chest the alarm wasnt set to go off for another eleven minutes but she knew her sleep was finished not again she rolled over and slapped the blue pillowcase that little sound from her heart and the twinges of angina that catchall for heart discomfort was happening more and more now just as dr ekelman had warned her but she wasnt going to let it stop her from living her life to the fullest as long as she could and right now that meant having her morning run she curled her legs around onto the floor reached for a nitroglycerin tab and slipped it under her tongue known as a vasodilator the nitro lowered the workload on her heart by expanding her veins it should get her through the workout that was when she felt a warm presence rub against her leg hi baby still sucking on the tab she reached over and tousled knickers grayandwhite hair then pushed it back from her dogs eyes her old english sheepdog a huge hirsute offroad vehicle turned and licked her hand knickers was ready to hit the trail shed been dreaming of steve when the chest tightness came and maybe the emotion that stirred up had caused the angina she still dreamed of him often and it was always someplace where they had been together and loved and they were ever on the brink of some disaster that frequently caused her heart to race waking her this time it was the vacation they took six years ago in the spring they were sailing off normans cay in the bahamas she was raising the jib the salt spray in her hair but then she looked up and realized they were about to ram a reef she felt the dreams were her unconscious telling her to beware her current precarious condition if as is said at the moment of your passing your entire life flashes before your eyes then the dreams were like that only in slow motion it was as though she were being prepared for something the dreams were a premonition she had a pretty good idea of what ally had had rheumatic fever when she was five which went undetected long enough to scar a valve in her heart the formal name was rheumatoid aortic stenosis a rare almost freakish condition that had shaped her entire life the pediatrician at mount sinai had told her parents they should think twice about allowing her to engage in any vigorous activity her hearts function could be deceptively normal during childhood but when she got older well why stress that organ now and hasten the inevitable day when it could no longer keep up with the rest of her body she had refused to listen shed played volleyball in grade school basketball in high school and she became a disciplined runner when she went to columbia to study architecture she wanted to prove that you could make your heart stronger if you believed hard enough and wanted to live hard enough now though it was all catching up shed had a complete checkup two weeks ago thursday including a stress test and doppler echocardiogram and dr ekelman had laid out the situation gazing over her halflens glasses and pulling at her chin the normal twinkle in her eyes was entirely absent alexa your condition has begun worsening theres a clear aortic murmur now when your pulse goes up how long can you go on living in denial you really cant keep on stressing your heart the way you have been you can have a normal life but its got to be lowkey dont push your luck living half a life is so depressing shed declared not entirely sure she meant it its almost worse than none at all ally im warning you if you start having chest sensations that dont respond to nitro call me immediately i mean that theres a new drug ranolazine that temporarily shifts your heart over to using glucose as a fuel instead of fatty acids and provides more energy for a given amount of oxygen it will make the pain back off but i only want to start you on that as a last resort thats the final stop before openheart surgery and a prosthetic aortic valve day by day the illusion of normality was getting harder and harder to maintain she had been playing second violin in an amateur string quartet called the west village oldies but a month ago shed had to drop out she didnt have the endurance to practice enough to keep up with the others blast it was having to give up things you love that really hurt still she was determined to keep a positive attitude there was your heart and then there was heart you had to understand the difference she lay back to wait for the alarm and try to compose her mind this sunday morning was actually the one day of the year she most dreaded the anniversary it had been back when steve was still alive they were living in the chelsea neighborhood of new york in a brownstone town house they were renting the rent was high but they were doing all right steve was a political consultant who had helped some fledgling candidates overcome the odds and win important elections in between campaigns here he also got work in the nominal democracies in latin america she was a partner in a small firm of architects who had all been at columbia together and decided to team up after graduation and start a business there were four of themshe was the only womanand it was a struggle at the beginning for the first three years they had to live off crumbs tossed their way by the big boys subcontracts from skidmore and other giants they felt like they were a highpaid version of manpower inc doing grunt work designing the interiors of shopping malls in the midwest and banks in saudi arabia while their prime contractors got to keep all the sexy bigbudget jobs that called for creativity like a glassandsteel office tower in la but then interesting work finally started to trickle in including a plum job to convert a massive parking garage in greenwich village into a luxury condominium through a wild coincidence or luck she had personally designed the apartment she later ended up buying for herself just when everything seemed to be turning around and going her way an event happened that stopped her in her tracks five years ago on this very day april her mother nina phoned her at sixthirty in the morning and in a trembling voice that still haunted announced that her father was dead arthur wade hampton was fiftynine and hed been cleaning his browning shotgun for an earlymorning hunting trip to long islandso hed claimed the night beforeand she was awakened by the explosion of a discharge a horrible accident in the kitchen of their coop in the west village like hemingway thinking back they both realized it was the wrong time of year to hunt anythingbut they both also knew he wanted the world to think that moreover it was precisely the kind of vital lie theyd need to get through the pointed questions and skeptical looks that lay ahead it was a knowledge all the more palpable for being unspoken theres no time like those first moments after a tragedy to create a special reality for yourself it was only in the aftermath that she managed to unravel the reason he owned and operated an interiordesign firm in soho called citispace and he had mortgaged it to the hilt he was on the verge of bankruptcy that was why ally had not spoken to her younger brother grant in the last years she felt she had no choice but to try to salvage what was left of the business and her fathers reputation she left the architectural firm and took over citispace it turned out she was easily as good an interior designer as she had been an architect and before long she had a backlog of work and was adding staff she restructured and eventually paid off the firms debt it was now on a sound financial footing these days citispace specialized in architectural rehabs in the greenwich village area with as many soho and tribeca lofts as came her way the work was mostly residential but lately some lucrative commercial office jobs were beginning to walk through the door anything dependent on luxury real estate can be vulnerable in dicey times but shed been able to give everybody a holiday bonus for the past couple of years shed even given herself one this year in the form of this new condo apartment which she loved another major reason shed taken over citispace was to try to provide her mother some peace and dignity in her twilight years but then irony of ironies nina who was a very lively sixtysix was diagnosed eighteen months ago with earlyonset alzheimers now her consciousness was rapidly slipping away all the things that had happened over the last few years had called for a special kind of heart she had known steve jensen a freelance political consultant for eight years and theyd lived together for three of those before they got married he was warm and tender and sexy and shed envisioned them in rocking chairs forty years down the road theyd been married for only six months when he got a job to help reelect the president of belize at first he was reluctant concerned about human rights issues but then he decided the other candidate the alternative was even worse so he went how many things can be destined to go wrong in your life exactly seven months after her dad died she received a phone call from the american embassy in belmopan belize steve had been flying with the presidential candidate over a stretch of southern rain forest in a singleengine cessna when a sudden thunderstorm came out of the caribbean and the plane lost radio contact that was the last etc she rushed there but after two weeks the rescue officially became a recovery mission except there was never any recovery after two months she flew back alone the loneliest plane ride of her life she still had his clothes in her closet as though to keep hope alive when you love someone so much you think you could never live without themand then one day youre forced toit resets your thinking her dads death and then steves she wanted to love life but life sometimes felt like it was asking more than she should have to give she currently had no one special to spend her weekends with but she hadnt given up nor was she pushing it all things in time except time could be running out brrrring went the alarm and knickers responded with a lively woof she was anxious to get going come on baby ally said time for a treat she struggled up and made her way into the kitchen and got down a box of small rawhide chews it would give knickers something to occupy her mind for the few minutes it took to get ready since she lived at the west end of barrow street right across the highway from the new hudson river park esplanade that defined that mighty rivers new york bank she had a perfect course for her morning runs she usually liked to run down to the park at the rejuvenated battery park city and then back she didnt know what the distance was exactly maybe threequarters of a mile each way maybe slightly more but it fit her endurance nicely the weather was still cool enough in the mornings that knickers could accompany her at full trot in the heat of summer however they both had to cut back shed put on blue sweats got her walkman prepped with a beethoven quintet and was just finishing cinching her running shoes when the phone jangled sunday april am grant hampton listened to the ringing and felt the sweat on his palms for a normal person this would be an insane time to call but knowing his nutbag sister she was probably already up and about to go out for her daily run and this on a sunday morning for chrissake when rational people were drinking coffee or having sex or doing something sensible like retrieving the times from the hallway and reading the columns in the business section he had left tanya his runway model livein to get her beauty sleep and had driven downtown at this unthinkable hour on a mission he was chief financial officer of bartlett medical devices inc which was in imminent danger of going under and taking him with it come on ally pick up the frigging phone he gazed out the windshield of his blue porsche now parked directly across the street from alexas lobby and tried to calm his pulse he hadnt entirely worked out the pitch but that was okay because he wanted to sound spontaneous who was it said sincerity if you can just fake that youve got it made that was what hello thank god shes picked up hi sis remember the sound of my voice long time right come on he thought give me an opening here there was a pause that grant hampton thought lasted an eternity you picked a funny time to call is that all she has to say four and a half frigging years she shuts me out of her life blaming me and then well ally i figured theres gotta be a statute of limitations on being accused of something i didnt do so i decided to take a flier that maybe four years and change was in the ballpark grant do you know what time it is this is sunday and hey this is the hour you do your sunday run right if memory serves so i thought i might drive down and keep you company he didnt want to let her know that he was already there that would seem presumptuous and probably tick her off even more but by god he had to get to her again there was a long pause like she was trying to collect and marshal her anger you want to come to see me now thats a heck of a look theres something really important i need to talk to you about its actually a big favor for you sis youve surely heard of winston bartlett ive also heard of donald trump so well hes got a clinic out in new jersey that grant i know youre a big shot in his medical conglomerate or whatever it is but im not interested in whatever youre peddling im going out to run now he heard the sound of the phone clicking off without so much as a goodbye jesus he thought she really is ticked this is going to be harder than i thought okay here goes plan b he started the porsche and slowly backed to the corner of washington street where he parked again and then hunkered down loving the smell of the new leather seat ally was going to come charging out of the front door in about two minutes with that damned sheepdog that steve gave her assuming it was still around grant hampton was three years younger than alexa and he lived in a different world whereas shed never wanted to be anything but an architect he had aimed directly for nyu school of business after that he had gone to wall street and gotten a brokers license and begun an extremely lucrative career as a bond trader for goldman sachs he discovered he had the nerves as well as a gift for handling big numbers in his head soon he had a duplex coop on the twentysixth floor of a new building on third avenue in the east sixties he loved the money and the pad he also liked how easy it was to pick up models at downtown clubs if you had your own coop a porsche and were six feet tall with a designer wardrobe that was where he met tanya also six feet tall a striking natural redhead who did a lot of runway work for chloe he thought he was making a lot of money but tanya who could order a twohundreddollar bottle of dom perignon to have something to pass the time while the hors doeuvres were being whipped up at nobu taught him he was just barely getting by she was accustomed to screwing men who had some depth to their money but when he tried a financial endeavor on the side it turned into a disaster time to move on he sent around his resume and managed to get an interview with bmd which was looking for someone to help them hedge their exposure in foreign currencies the next thing he knew he was trading bonds for winston bartletts personal account when bartletts cfo died of a heart attack at age fortynine while undergoing oral sex in the backseat of a chauffeured lincoln town car grant hampton got temporarily drafted to take over his responsibilities that was two years ago he was aggressive enough that there was never a search for a replacement he had made the big time and he had done it before he was thirtyfive but now it all hung in the balance if this didnt work out he could end up coldcalling widows out of dun amp bradstreet hawking thirdrate ipos tanya would be gone in a heartbeat ally work with me for chrissake sunday april am as alexa stepped out of the lobby the morning was glorious and clear spring had arrived in a burst of pear and cherry blossoms in the garden of st lukes church up the street but here by the river the morning air was still brisk enough to make her skin tingle the sun was lightening the east setting a golden halo above the skyscrapers of midtown here with the wind tasting lightly of salt the roadways were sundaymorning silent and it was a magic time that always made her feel the world was young and perfect and she was capable of anything this was her private thinking timeeven dreaming timeand she shared it only with knickers who was trotting along beside her now full of enthusiasm ally suspected that her sheepdog enjoyed their morning runs along the river even more than she did as she headed south toward battery park city she pondered the weird phone call shed just gotten from grant seth hampton that was his full name she called him grant but her mother nina always called him seth unfortunately by whatever name grant seth hampton an unremitting hustler was still her brother she wished it were not so but some things couldnt be changed in truth she actually thought grant had exhibited a kind of sequential personality over his life when they were kids hed seemed rakish but also decent at the time of course she was impulsive and rebellious herself admiring of his spunk now she viewed that as his early personality later when he was pushing thirty and the wall street pressure and the coke moved in he evolved into personality number two he lost touch with reality and in the process he also lost his inner moral compass his character bent and then broke under the stress proving she now supposed that he was actually a weak reed after all now she didnt know what his personality was grant grant she often lamented how did everything manage to turn out so bad with you hed been a bond trader for goldman and at family gatherings hed brag about making three hundred thou a year but he had a highmaintenance lifestyle involving downtown models he was constantly trying to impress with jewelry and expensive vacations so that wasnt enough he decided to freelance on the side he set up a web site and with his brokers license opened a retail business trading naked futures contracts on treasuries he managed to get some naive clients and for a while made a profit for them but then the market turned against him or maybe he lost his rabbits foot and he began losing a lot of other peoples money a couple of his clients with heavy losses felt that hed misrepresented the risk and they were getting ready to sue they also were threatening to file a complaint with the sec there was a real possibility he could be barred from the financial industry for life the only thing that would put the matter to rest was if he made good some of their losses but grant who lived hand to mouth no matter what his income didnt have any liquidity a reserve thats for guys who dont have any balls she pieced this story together after the fact somehow hed gotten to their father who bailed him out mainly to save the family from disgrace in doing so he had mortgaged citispace right up to the breaking point when she finally unraveled this poignant tale she realized her father believed he was going to have to declare bankruptcy and close the firm laying everybody off and leaving nina a pauper he thought the only way to save the family from ruin was to collect on his life insurance unfortunately however he botched the plan nobody believed his death was accidental and suicide voided the milliondollar policy grant had always inhabited another planet from her dad but surely these days he was able to support any lifestyle he chose for the last two years hed been some kind of hotshot financial manager for the highstakes conglomerate owned by winston bartlett or so nina said he should be making big bucks had he managed to screw that up somehow anytime he came crawling back to the family for anything it was because he was in some kind of trouble she hadnt seen him in so long she wondered if shed even recognize himnot that she had any plans to see him but what could grant possibly want from her now also why would he pick this morning this anniversary morning to reappear didnt he know what day this was or maybe he didnt actually care hed been living on the east side that fateful morning of their dad is death in a doorman coop he surely couldnt afford and shed taken a cab there to tell him in person rather than do it over the phone when she did her voice breaking she could see his eyes already filtering out any part of it that touched him by today hed probably purged it out of his memory entirely she had reached the vast lawn that had been built on the landfill behind stuyvesant high the hudson river on one side and the huge expanse of green on the other it was manicured and verdant a la grande jatte expanse of grass where you could see visions of wicker picnic baskets and bottles of beaujolais the space was deserted now and smelled of new grass knickers had gotten ten paces ahead of her as though impatient that alexa was slowing her down but then she paused in midstride to sniff at a bagel somebody had tossed come on honey ally caught up with her wheezing time to backtrack my chest is getting tight again goodies at home knickers glared at her dolefully for a moment not buying the argument lets go she resumed her stride back north knowingwell hopingknickers would follow home her senses must have been slowing down too because she honestly didnt hear him when he came up behind her three minutes later sunday april am didnt think i could keep up did you grant hampton quipped from ten paces back guess you didnt know ive started playing handball every other morning half an hour with the man great for the stamina not to mention brown nosing the boss since naturally i let him win she doesnt look half bad he thought maybe shes getting out ahead of that heart problem maybe shes actually okay and im screwed fuck but why is she still so fried at me sure i had a little trouble but everybody has ups and downs nina that hardhearted bitch wants to blame me for arthurs death when it was nobodys fault but his own that the old fart pulled the plug hell i was going to pay back the money he just didnt believe in me he never did what are you doing here grant when she turned to look back at him she realized she wasnt prepared for this moment at all but here he was complete with a trendy ck running outfit shed only seen him a couple of times after the funeral and he looked like life was treating him well the perfect tan the lush sandy hair with an expensive cut that covered the top of his ears like a precise little helmet he was a touch over six feet with athletic shoulders a trim figure and a graceful fluidity to his stride no wonder he scores with models damn how could such a creep look that great i told you im trying to do you a favor he momentarily pulled ahead as though to head her off then looked back and grinned she thought she detected a vaguely demented quality in his gray eyes hey ive turned my life around ally lots of good karma im cfo for bmd and wb lets me handle a lot of his personal investing too she put on a burst of energy trying unsuccessfully to get out ahead of him even though shed rehearsed this inevitable moment over and over in her mind she hadnt realized that seeing him again would be this upsetting why was he here but now that he was maybe she ought to momentarily let go of the anger long enough to find out what he wanted fortunately they were almost back to barrow street so this was going to be quick no way was she going to ask him up look grant declared over his shoulder i think its high time to admit ive been a shit to you and to a lot of people now he slowed enough that she pulled alongside for a long time there back when i worked for goldman i was an immature asshole but at least im mature enough now to admit it i think the window for owning up is past she didnt need his belated mea culpa nothing was going to bring their father back and having a scene on this anniversary day would only demean his memory sometimes its better just to let things rest no thats wrong ally and i want to try and start making amends for all the money dad helped me out with i want to do a kindness for you to repay you and mom as best i can now he was jogging along beside her as smooth as a stroll barely breathing it was adding to her humiliation grant its a little fucking late for that dads gone moneys not going to bring him back and im okay moms okayat least for money well she thought thats true for now but who knows what lies ahead so whats a couple of million or so between siblings anyway right its the price of finding out who everybody is just now she told herself the biggest kindness he could do would be to disappear forever shed thought she was over the bulk of the pain and the feelings of humiliation but seeing him again hearing his voice and looking at his eyes was bringing all of it back she realized she was never going to be over it ally go ahead and say whatever you need to look i cant really do anything about the money at least not right this minutethough ive got a big ship on the horizon assuming a deal im working on comes through but right now im about to try to do you a favor i think i can muddle through without any of your favors grant and i really dont appreciate your showing up out of the blue like this bullying your way back into my life she glanced over and saw his gray eyes were hangdog it was the soulful look he used to melt her resolve but not this time she was yelling at herself inside not to give an inch if she let him anywhere close to her life again she was sure shed only regret it well like it or not i am here at the moment he said once more jogging a pace ahead then twisting his head back they were at the crossing and he could see her building from where they were he had to get a hook into her before she disappeared into that damned lobby time for the bait by the way ally hows your ticker doing these days you still have to watch out for that heart thing look grant ive got a busy morning im going up to see mom not that youd give a damn so thank you for inquiring about my health but frankly what do you care she paused tell you what if your favor is so wonderful ill give you one phone call tonight at home she had knickers leash on a short hold and was waiting for the light to change but ive got to go now shit he thought the hook didnt catch cant be on the phone im telling you i needed to see you why the hell do you think i took the trouble to catch you before your day got started you know i hate getting up this early he stepped onto the curb and stopped ally please listen this is something i can do for you i wont insult you by saying its for old times sake but in a way it is i got you a shot at a big job bartlett wants to redo the ground floor of his place on gramercy park i told him about citispace and he sounded interested and said hed like for you to come by and meet him and help him kick around some ideas she looked at him not believing a word you hacked into my life at seven oclock sunday morning for that you had to see me give me a break what do you really want and this better be good okay he thought cut to the chase youre correct its about your heart what about it make it real he told himself this could be your only shot all right heres the unvarnished deal what i really did for you about five years ago bartlett bankrolled a startup biomed firm called the gerex corporation it was the brainchild of a dutch doctor whose research project had just been sawed off at the knees by stanford university then bartlett moved the entire operation to a clinic at the bmd campus out in new jersey called the dorian institute its all very hushhush but i can tell you gerex has a new procedure in clinical trials that can literally work miracles the head researcher this dutch doctor has pioneered a new treatment using a stem cell procedure to trick an organ into regenerating itself even a heart its like you grow your own transplant now she was finally listening i was talking to the dutch guy late last week he went on picking up a faint positive vibe and hoping desperately he could build on it and he said hes looking for someone in their thirties with a rheumaticheart thingi think its like what you haveto be part of this big clinical trial theyre wrapping up but they have to do it immediately so they can put the data in their final report to the national institutes of health and you thought about me thats very touching grant your idea of doing me a favor is to let some dutch quack experiment on me hey dont be so fast to turn up your nose at this shit he thought how am i going to make any headway his procedure operates at the cell level the way they say it works is he takes cells from your bone marrow or blood or whatever and makes them immortal with this special enzyme and then injects them into organ tissue it causes that organ to start regenerating itself that sounds completely like science fiction besides im not well hes doing it trust me but therere only a couple of weeks left in the clinical trials so everythings on a fast track now if youre the least bit interested youve got to call him tomorrow if you dont im sure hell find somebody else by the middle of the week he reached down and tried to give knickers a pat but she drew away good for her ally thought then he looked up and his voice grew animated ally the dutch doctorhis name is van de vliet by the wayis the smartest man ive ever met id say hes a good bet for the nobel prize in medicine this time next year id put my last dime on it what hes doing is so incredible i shouldnt even be talking about it at least not till the clinical trials are finished but i wanted to do you this favor uhhuh she thought what it amounted to was he was coming to her with another one of his hustles probably they needed somebody to round out their clinical trials and she was conveniently handy you know grant maybe ill just pass i already have a cardiologist she found herself wondering what dr ekelman would say to this radical new treatment all right ally do you want to make me beg i need you to do this when i described you to dr van de vliet i could tell he was very excited this could change everything for you he paused perhaps becoming aware of the pleading tone in his voice for chrissake give me a break is there someplace we can have coffee im not asking to come upstairs or anything i just want to see if we can be on speaking terms long enough to help each other out in a way she was relieved though she was secretly hurt all over again too he wasnt crawling back to her to beg forgiveness for destroying lives no he was back and groveling because he thought she could help him butter up his boss how could she not feel used god that was so like him at that moment she knew there was never any chance hed change come on he said again a lousy cup of coffee theres that little french bistro on hudson street he tried a grin hey ill even buy for a moment she thought she felt her resolve slipping its funny but after you break up a family no matter how dysfunctional you start repressing the bad memories but then something comes along to remind you all over again grant are you hearing yourself she stared at him you sound like youre selling snake oil why was i afraid youd back off youre really doing it because youre pissed okay youve got a right but ive brought you something i think you ought to at least look at he was unzipping his fanny pack and taking out a gerex corporation envelope folded in half christ he thought miserably why is she doing this to me ive got to keep the door open read this and then give me a call tonight like you promised itll tell you more about him she hesitated before taking it it was thick with papers and she was planning to spend the day visiting nina i think ive heard enough already just look at his cv van de vliets hes done a lot of things youve got to take him seriously he urged it into her hand look at it and call me please she took it and then she reached down and patted knickers come on baby lets go up he watched her disappear into the lobby and start shooting the breeze with the doorman some redhaired jerk with a ponytail whod just come on duty damn maybe the best thing would be just to chloroform her and let her wake up in the lab wb needs her chapter sunday april am okay youd better take it from here winston bartlett declared to kenji noda over the roar of the engine he had lifted his feet off the pedals and was unbuckling the cockpit seat belt he liked having a turn piloting his mcdonnell douglas n helicopter on the commutes between his corporate headquarters in lower manhattan and his medical research park in northern new jersey but prudence dictated a more experienced hand on the collective during descent and landing for that he had noda formerly of the japanese defense forces a tall wiry man of few words noda was also his bodyguard chauffeur and curator of his museumquality katana sword collection with the sharp delicious aroma of the pine forest below wafting through the cabin noda quickly put aside the origami hed been folding to center his mind and slid around a special opening in the bulkhead he strapped himself into the seat then took the radio headphones the sky was the purest blue with not another craft in the visual perimeter they were after all over a forest as bartlett settled himself in the passenger compartment he thought about where matters stood there was the very real prospect he had rolled the dice one time too many the daily blood tests at his clinic in new jersey were showing he was disturbingly close to using up his nine lives to look at him though youd never suspect at sixtyseven he was still trim and athletic confident even cocky with a full head of steel dark hair and probing eyes that instantly appraised whatever they caught in their gaze he played handball at a private health club near his gramercy park mansion for an hour every other morning and he routinely defeated men half his age including grant hampton remaining a player in every sense of the term was the main reason he enjoyed flying his md chopper even though his license had been lapsed for eight years it was the perfect embodiment of his lust for life as he never failed to point out his lifelong business success wasnt bad for a city college grad with a bachelors degree in oriental art history he had gotten this far because he wanted success enough to make it happen hed started out in new york real estate but for the last twenty years he had concentrated on buying up small under priced medicaldevice manufacturers with valuable patents and weak bottom lines he dismantled some of the companies and sold off the pieces always for more than hed paid for the whole others he restructured with new management and when a profitable turnaround was in sight he took them public or sold them to a major player like johnson amp johnson the potential winners though the ones with promising pipelines of medical devices or drugs whose fda approval was imminent he relocated here at the bmd campus in northern new jersey but competition was fierce and the bigger players like merck and j ampj had limitless research capital they could write off dead ends a lot easier thus it was that five years ago when his pipeline was drying up winston bartlett took the biggest gamble of his life he acquired a cashstrapped new startup called the gerex corporation whose head scientist was at the cutting edge of stem cell research karl van de vliet md phd had just had his funding terminated and his laboratory at stanford university closed after a political flap by rightwingers bartlett had moved van de vliet here to new jersey and poured millions into his stem cell efforts bleeding bmds working capital white and racking up million in shortterm debt just to keep the rest of the company afloat now though the gamble was paying off this month gerex was winding up stagethree clinical trials for the national institutes of health these trials validated a revolutionary procedure that changed the rules of everything known about healing the human body already his cfo grant hampton was heading a negotiating team hammering out a deal with the british biotech conglomerate cambridge pharmaceuticals to sell them a percent stake in gerex over million in cash and stock were on the table and there were escalators depending on the results of the trials now under way the problem was cambridge had only seen the financial and summaries of data from gerexs successful clinical trials they knew nothing about the fiasco of the beta procedure karl called just before we left and said shes worse this morning bartlett remarked to noda he was removing his aviator shades and there was deep frustration in his eyes god i feel so damned responsible she was having the beta was kristens idea noda reminded him she wanted to do it what he didnt say was on both their minds what about bartlett himself after kristen starr had had the beta and it had seemed successful bartlett decided to have it too now his daily blood tests here at the institute were showing that the telomerase enzyme was starting to metastasize and replicate in his bloodstream just as it had in hers well bartlett went on karl thinks hes got a new idea that might save us hampton is supposed to be on the case this very morning he stared out the choppers window down at the rooftops of his empire at the north end of the industrial park was the main laboratory where stents and titanium joint replacements were tested on animalsmostly sterile pigs though some primate testing also was under way the central area had two large manufacturing facilities where the more complex devices were made the buildings were all white cinder block except for the one they were hovering above now it was at the far south end a massive threestory mansion nestled among ancient pines and reached by a long cobblestone driveway though it was actually the oldest building of the group by a hundred years it was the latest acquisition for the complex it fronted a beautiful tenacre lake and had been a summer palacio of a nineteenthcentury railroad baron around midcentury it was turned into a luxury retirement home complete with nursing services its ornate appointments reminded patients of the frick gallery if one could imagine those marble halls teeming with wheelchairs and nurses bartlett had bought the defunct manufacturing complex next to it eighteen years earlier for the bmd industrial park but it was only six years ago that the owners of the mansion a group of squabbling heirs finally relented and agreed to part with the property it was now a flagship holding of bmd he had an eye for design and he had loved remodeling the old mansion and making it into a modern clinic and research facility he had renamed it the dorian institute and moved in karl van de vliet and the research staff of the gerex corporation he also had put a landing pad on the expansive roof along with a stair leading down to an elevator that could take him directly to the laboratory in the basement kenji noda settled the mcdonnell douglas onto the pad and cut the engines bartlett never let himself worry about the noise the patients in the clinical trials were here at no charge so they really couldnt complain particularly since they were now part of what was possibly turning out to be the greatest advance in the history of medicine if your alzheimers had just been reversed at no charge you werent going to complain about a little hubbub on the roof ill wait here noda said opening the side door his bald pate reminiscent of an eighteenthcentury samurai glistened in the early spring sun bartlett nodded knowing that his pilot did not trust physicians and hospitals taking care of your body was your responsibility kenji noda frequently declared and he trained his own daily he ate no meat and drank gallons of green tea when he practiced kendo swordplay he had the reflexes of a man half his age he never discussed why he had left japan but bartlett assumed it was for reasons best left in the dark bartlett headed down the metal stairs leading to the self service elevator this daily ordeal of flying out to give a blood sample and to see kristen was increasingly unsettling as he inserted his magnetic card into the elevator security box he felt his hand shaking slightly so close to the eternal dream of humankind so close how was it going to end sunday april am dr vee im feeling so much better i cant tell you emma rosen reached out and caught her physician by the collar of his lab coat pulling him down and brazenly bussing his cheek shed been longing to do this for three weeks but hadnt mustered the nerve until now this morning i climbed the stairs to the third floor twice up and back without any chest pain oy can you believe its a miracle karl van de vliet was a couple of inches over six feet with a trim face and sandy hair that some older patients judged too long for a physician his english normally was perfect though sometimes he made a mistake when trying to sound too colloquial but everyone young and old adored his retiring dutch manner and those deep blue eyes that carried some monumental sadness from the past they also were sure he would soon be recognized worldwide as the miracle worker he was the prospect of a nobel didnt actually seem that farfetched emma please i begged you to rest he sighed and checked the dancing electronic pens of her ekg they were in the basement of the dorian institute upstairs the suitesnobody called them roomswere intended to invoke a spa more than a clinic so most of the heavyduty diagnostic equipment was kept in a row of examining rooms down near the subterranean lab for another week at least why wont you listen youve been a very naughty girl i may have to tell your daughter he glanced at the seventythreeyearold womans readout one last time made a quick note on his handheld computer and then laid a thin hand across her brow for a fleeting subjective temperature check shes all but fully recovered he told himself its truly astonishing five weeks earlier she had come through the front door of the dorian institute in a wheelchair pushed by her youngest a bottle blonde named shelly he took one look and scuttled the normal security precautions the frisk for cameras and recording devices emmas low cardiac output had deteriorated to the point that her left leg below the knee was swollen to almost twice its normal size owing to renal retention of fluid and she was so short of breath she required oxygen he hadnt wanted to complicate the clinical trials by taking on another patient at that late date but she had been referred by a physician friend in the city begging how could he turn her away he had removed a microscopic amount of bone marrow from her right ankle extracted the stem cells applied the hormonal signal that told them to develop into heart muscle and then injected a thriving cell factory into her heart since stem cells could be made to ignore the bodys rules to stop replicating after a certain number they were able to reproduce forever constantly renewing themselves the only other cells with that immortal characteristic were cancer cells in fact it was as though he had given emma a new kind of cancerone that produced cells as healthy as those in a newborn today she probably could have run up those stairs although his stem cell technology was going to create a new era in regenerative medicine he had experienced his share of bumps in the road five years earlier stanford university had canceled his research project there since the work he had been doing involved the special stem cells in unused fertilityclinic embryos the university claimed there had been death threats to its president the board of regents had finally decided with a sham show of remorse to revoke his funding they called him in one sunny afternoon in may and pulled the plug he thanked them and tore up his contract by that time he had already demonstrated that using the right chemical signals stem cells could be coaxed into becoming almost any organ inserted into the heart they became new heart muscle replacing scars inserted into the brain they became neural tissue no way was he going to be stopped now they didnt know what they were losing what he needed was a white knight he did some poking around and came up with winston bartlett then floated feelers to bartletts people what if he proposed bartlett acquired the gerex corporation for bmd and made it a forprofit business no more public funding and maddening administrative meddling the research already completed was so close to a payoff after years and years of grinding lab work and thousands of white mice that the deal could be considered an investment where percent of the seed money had already been supplied by taxpayers winston bartlett had liked the sound of that and karl van de vliet had his white knight once his financing was secure he decided to begin by solving the problem that had dogged him at stanford since there would always be a distracting publicrelations problem hounding any researcher in the united states who made use of aborted embryos even if it was to save lives he was determined to find a less controversial way to trick mother nature and garner pluripotent stem cells the name given those that could give rise to virtually any tissue type he had after he moved his research team into the dorian institute just over years ago he had perfected a way to use a human protein an enzyme called telomerase to make adult stem cells do most of the miracles once only thought possible with embryonic cells the phasethree clinical trials over the past seven months had proved conclusively that the technique worked adult stem cells when treated with the telomerase enzyme to arrest the process of cell senescence could indeed regenerate everything from the human brain to the human heart from parkinsons to acute myocardial infarction twentythree days from now when the phasethree clinical trials were formally scheduled to be completed karl van de vliet would have enough data for the national institutes of health to confirm one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of medicine unfortunately however there was that other bit of data that he would not be sharing with the nih the beta thinking about that his heart heavy he turned back to the situation at hand emma youre making wonderful progress he continued on with the banter but dont push yourself too hard just yet she laughed sending lines across her forehead her voice was deep and rich sultry in its own way when you get as old as i am honey you do anything you can get away with what am i saving it for i just might go to atlantic city next week and pick up a sailor well then i may have to have shelly go along and keep an eye on you he said with one last programmed smile then he checked his watch bartlett should be arriving any minute now time to get emma rosen the hell out of here and back upstairs he turned and signaled for ellen ohara the head nurse to start removing the suctioncup electrodes that had been stuck on emma for her ekg ellen had been with him when he was at stanford and her loyalty was unquestioned she had made sure that the beta disaster with kristen hadnt become the gossip of the institute still how much longer could it be kept quiet then sandra hanes the lively darkhaired woman in charge of the second floor for this shift walked into the examination room she knew nothing about kristen perfect timing he said then he drew her aside keep an eye on emma will you try and keep her in her room and quiet as much as you can the last blood work showed her whitecell count over twelve kcmm it could mean theres some minimal rejection rearing its head probably nothing to worry about but can you just keep her away from the stairs for godsake i dont want her tiring herself out ill tie her to the bed if i have to sandra answered the clinical trials had required a mountain of paperwork and her face was strained from working long shifts including a lot of weekends like this one but he suspected she actually appreciated the overtime she was fortyfive divorced and putting a straighta daughter through rutgers she also was a firstrate nurse like all the others at the institute and her loyalty couldnt be more secure still he knew that she and all the other staffers were bursting to tell the world about the miracles theyd witnessed that was why bartlett had insisted on an ironclad nondisclosure agreement in the contract of every employee to be strictly enforced and to put teeth into the security all employees were bodysearched for documents or cameras or tapes on the way in and out to violate it would be to open yourself to a lifealtering lawsuit during world war ii the claim had been that loose lips sink ships here they would render you a pauper for life nobody dared even whisper about the spectacular success of the clinical trials as the examining room emptied out he checked his watch one more time winston bartlett was due any minute now and he had nothing but bad news for the man trying to control his distress he walked to the end of the hallway and prepared to enter the lab whereas the ground floor and the two above were for reception common dining and individual rooms the basement contained the laboratory his private office the examination rooms and an or never yet used thankfully there also was a subbasement accessible only through an elevator in the lab or an alarmed set of fire stairs it was an intensivecare area and it was where kristen the beta casualty was being kept he zipped a magnetic card through the reader on the door and entered the air lock the lab was maintained under positive pressure to keep out the slightest hint of any kind of contaminant it was as sterile as a silicon chip factory the room was dominated by a string of black slate workbenches then rows and rows of metal shelves with tissue containing vials of a highly volatile solvent cocktail he had engineered especially for this project along with a computer network and a huge autoclave and several electron microscopes he walked in and greeted his research team hed managed to keep the core group that had been closest to him at stanford four people who he believed were among the finest medical minds in the country they were the renowned molecular biologist david hopkins phd the strikingly beautiful and widely published endocrinologist debra connolly md and two younger staffers a couple whod met and married at his stanford lab ed and beth sparks both phds whod done their postdoc under him they all were here now in the wilds of northern new jersey because they knew they were making medical history david was waiting his long shaggy forelock down over his brow as always but his eyes told it all karl bartletts blood work from yesterday just got faxed up from the lab at princeton his enzyme level has increased another three point seven percent damn it was happening for sure did you run the computer simulation a onestandarddeviation estimate is that hes going to go critical sometime between seventeen and nineteen days the syndrome van de vliet sighed just like kristen she faked us out there were no side effects for weeks van de vliet shook his head sadly as he set his handheld palm computer onto a side table later he would transfer all the days patient data into the laboratorys server the hewlett packard they all affectionately called the mothership then he began taking off his white coat bartlett looks to be inevitable now david exhaled in impotent despair the frustration and the tension were getting to everybody they all knew what was at stake its in two and a half weeks give or take what had supposedly been a cosmetic procedure had gone horribly awry van de vliet wondered if it wasnt the ultimate vengeance of the quest for something you shouldnt have his ab blood type is so rare if wed just kept a sample before the procedure wed have something to work with now van de vliet said sadly we still might be able to culture some antibodies he hadnt told his research team yet about the other possible optionusing somebody else as an ab bloodtype incubator his lastditch idea was to find a patient with a blood type of ab positive and introduce a small quantity of the special beta telomerase enzyme into them the theory was that this might induce their body to produce compatible antibodies which could then be extracted and cultured in the laboratory if a sufficient quantity could be produced they could be injected into bartlett and hopefully arrest the enzymes pattern of entering the hosts bloodstream and metastasizing into the more complex form that brought on the syndrome and if it did work then there might even be some way to adapt the procedure to kristen karl if cambridge pharmaceuticals finds out about the beta fiasco hows it going to affect how do you think its going to affect the sale if this gets out therell be no sale to anybody bartlett will be ruined and gerex along with him thats everybody here in case youre counting he turned and exited the lab pushing pensively through the air lock and then he walked slowly toward his office collecting his thoughts he was just passing the elevator when it opened sunday april am winston bartlett looked up to see van de vliet as he stepped off the elevator and the sight heartened him as always the dutchman was a genius if anyone could solve this damned mess surely he was the one first thing karl how is she now i think youd better go down and see for yourself van de vliet said slowly as i told you on the phone she still comes and goes i think its getting worse bartlett felt a chill run through him he had once cared for this woman as much as he was capable of caring for anybody and what had happened was a damned shame all he had intended was to give her something special something no man had ever given a woman before will she know who i am she still did yesterday it depends van de vliet replied yesterday afternoon she was fully lucid but then earlier this morning i got the impression she thinks shes in a different place and time if i had to guess id say shes regressing chronologically i suppose thats logical though nothing about this makes any sense bartlett was following him back through the air lock and into the laboratory the intensivecare area below was reachable only by a special elevator at the rear of the lab all these oncecocky people bartlett thought were now scared to death van de vliet and his research team might actually be criminally liable if the right prosecutor got hold of the case at the very least theyd be facing an ethics fiasco but im the one whos about to be destroyed in every sense it had all started when karl van de vliet confided in him that there was an adjunct procedure arising out of stem cell research that might might offer the possibility of a radical new cosmetic breakthrough just a possibility he called it the beta since it was highly experimental he also wasnt sure it was reproducible but he had inadvertently discovered it while testing the telomerase enzyme on his own skin over a decade ago at the time he was experimenting with topical treatments for pigment abnormalities but the particular telomerase enzyme he was working with had had the unexpected effect of changing the texture of his skin softening it and removing wrinkles a change that subsequently seemed permanent the idea had lain dormant while they were preparing for the clinical trials but then bartletts petite amie the cabletv personality kristen starr had had a career crisis that she blamed on aging and he came up with the idea of having her undergo the skin procedure in a mistake with unforeseen ramifications she had then been made an official part of the nih clinical trials after she had gone for over a month without any side effects bartlett had elected to undergo the procedure himself then it began in kristenwhat david had solemnly named the syndrome van de vliet had immediately and illegally terminated her from the clinical trials removing her from the nih database she was now being kept on the floor below in the subbasement intensivecare area as they stepped onto the elevator to go down bartlett found himself wondering how many of the staff here were aware of the real extent of the crisis van de vliet had said that only three of the nurses knew about kristen and the syndrome fortunately they all were trustworthy two had even been with him back at stanford they would never talk but what about the rest theyd all fawned over kristen starstruck by her celebrity and theyd spill the beans in a heartbeat if any of them found out the story would be everywhere from variety to the page six gossip column it would certainly mean the financial ruin of bartlett medical devices if gerex went under everything else went with it on the other hand he thought ruefully what does it matter if i end up like her i wont even know it happened wb the telomerase enzyme is completely out of control in her now van de vliet continued first it metastasized through her skin and into her blood then it began directing its own synthesis ive tried everything i know to arrest it but nothing has worked i still have a faint hope though if we can make some headway on your own situation he paused and his voice trailed off in the meantime though i think it would definitely be wise to move her to another location there are too many people here the risk is enormous word is bound to get out sooner or later you must have someplace of course bartlett nodded id rather have her in the city and closer to me anyway but let me see if i can talk to her first i need to try to make her understand though its probably too late for that he told himself they stepped off the elevator and entered a highsecurity area a long hallway illuminated only with fluorescent bulbs using a magnetic card as a key bartlett opened the first door they came to as always he was dismayed by the sight for a moment he just stood looking at the thirtytwo yearold woman sitting up in a hospital bed mutely watching a flickering tv screen showing the cartoon network he had truly cared for her perhaps even loved her for a time then he walked over kristy honey howre you feeling she stared at him blankly kristen had been a vivacious blueeyed blonde whod had her own showbiz gossip show on the e channel till it was canceled during a scheduling shakeup six months earlier she had a nervous breakdown declaring to bartlett that her show had been canceled because she looked like a crone hed told her it wasnt true but if she was so distraught about her appearance then maybe there was something he could do for her van de vliet had once mentioned an experimental skin procedure bartlett turned back to van de vliet feeling the horror sinking in karl goddamit weve got to reverse this lets talk outside van de vliet said bartlett kissed kristens forehead in preparation for leaving her lifeless blue eyes flickered something he thought it was a flash of some old anger who could blame her he told himself but back then who knew hed wanted to give her a gift like none other not quite the fountain of youth but maybe a cosmetic version her skin would begin to constantly renew itself and hed been right the promise of having her skin rejuvenated was just what shed needed to get her selfconfidence back for more than a month the miracle seemed to be working and there were no side effects her skin was becoming noticeably softer and more supple she was elated screw nih trials and the fda he then decided it was working for kristen by god he would try it himself he wasnt getting any younger but no sooner had he had the procedure too than kristen started evidencing side effects first it was little things like lapses in shortterm memory next as it got progressively worse she could no longer remember why she was at the institute then she couldnt recall her name where she lived and now could it be that god cant be cheated and when its tried god brings down a terrible vengeance when they were outside in the hallway he said i have a place on park avenue thats empty at the moment we used to spend weekends there and i can arrange for a fulltime nursing staff all of it he paused has anybody called here about her lately just her mother katherine whos getting pretty frantic the woman is unbalanced certifiable god help us if i told her to see what she could find out from kristens publicist good bartlett had told kristens midtown publicity agent the nosy arlene of guys and dolls inc that kristen had gone to a private spa in new mexico to rethink her career and didnt want to be disturbed she desired complete solitude any communication with her would have to be handled through his office he looked at van de vliet karl tell me how bad it is for me now for you he hesitated this was the question hed been dreading the telomerase numbers from yesterdays blood sample are not encouraging as i told you your topical enzyme application has metastasized into your bloodstream and started to replicate just like it did in kristen were seeing a process known as engraftment these special cells have learned to mimic any cell they come near they become the tissue that those cells comprise and begin replacing the healthy tissue with new in kristens case we think its now entered her brain and it seems to be supplanting her memory tissue with blanks the same side effect could eventually evolve in you that doesnt begin to describe the real horror bartlett thought its too impossible to imagine the only thing left is to find some way to cause your body to reject the enzyme van de vliet said im optimistic that we might be able to grow some telomerase antibodies in another patient with your blood type then culture enough of them to stop the syndrome in its tracks its worth a try frankly i cant think of anything else but your blood type is ab which is extremely rare also the problem is that wed possibly be putting that other person at severe risk too lets go back up to the lab bartlett said that idea of yourshampton thinks hes got somebody a woman in her late thirties he put his hand on van de vliets shoulder were going to get her on board however we have to chapter sunday april am stone aimes was staring at the email on the screen of his compaq armada and feeling an intense urge to put his fist through its twisted spiral crystals what do you do when youve come up with an idea that could possibly save thousands of lives using simple webbased technology and then the piece gets spiked by your newspapers owners at the very last minute because it exposes some important new york hospitals to unpleasant but constructive scrutiny what it makes you want to do is tell everybody down on the third floor to stuff it and walk out and finish your book undistracted by corporate asscovering bs or unfortunately by a paycheck around him the newsroom of the new york sentinel a weekly newspaper positioned editorially somewhere between the late lamented new york observer and the village voice was in final sunday countdown with the monday edition about to be put to bed the technology was state of the art and the room flickered with computer screens blue pages that gave the tan walls an eerie cast composition spellchecking everything was done by thinking machines and the reporters thirteen on this floor were mostly in their late twenties and early thirties and universally underpaid the early morning room was bustling though it felt to stone like the end of time nobody was paying any attention to him but that was normal everybody was doing their own thing besides nobody else realized hed just had a major piece killed at the last minute now he felt as though he were frozen in place in this room in this job in this life the book he had almost finished was going to change a lot of things it would be the first major explication of stem cell technology for general readers stem cells were going to revolutionize everything we knew about medicine and the research was going further than anyone could have dreamed the possibility of reversing organ degeneration even extending life was hovering right out there just at humankinds fingertips it cried out for a major book he had read everything that had made its way into the medical journals but the study that was furthest along was privately funded and now cloaked in secrecy it was at the gerex corporation whose head researcher was a dutch genius named karl van de vliet the company had been bankrolled by the medical mogul winston bartlett after van de vliet lost his funding at stanford winston bartlett of all people but that was another story thirteen months earlier the gerex corporation had trolled for volunteers on the national institutes of health web site referring to a pending special study the notice suggested the study might be using stem cell technology in some fashion if that study was what stone aimes thought it was it would be the first to use stem cells in stagethree clinical trials nobody else was even close karl van de vliet was the ball game unfortunately however his study was being held in an atmosphere of militarylike secrecy why even the identities of the participants in the trials were like a state secret since winston bartlett owned gerex it surely had been ordered by him you had to wonder what that was all about whatever the reason stone aimes knew that in order to finish his book with the latest information he had to get to van de vliet but bartlett had forbidden any interviews and gerexs clinic called the dorian institute was offlimits to the public and reportedly guarded with serious security but he thought perhaps he had just come up with an idea of how to get around that he stared a moment longer at the dim reflection coming back at him from the antiglare screen which now informed him that his cover feature had been chopped truthfully it was happening more and more this was the third time in eight months that a major muckraking piece had been axed also as he stared at it the reflection told him he wasnt getting any younger the hairline was no longer where it had been in his college photosit was up about half an inchand the blue eyes were sadder the lines under them deeper still the tousled brown hair was thick enough the brow mostly wrinklefree and he still had hope he wasnt exactly young anymore but neither was he getting on the willy loman years remained safely at bay he was thirtynine and divorced with an exwife joyce who had departed to be a garden designer in northern california taking with her their daughter amy on whom he doted he had a onebedroom rentcontrolled apartment in the east nineties on the top floor of a fashionable brownstone he was socially unattached as the expression goes but he was so compulsive about finishing the book that he spent weekends hunched over his ibm aptiva nursing a sixpack of brooklyn lager and writing deathless prose the truth was he was lonely but he didnt allow himself to think about it hed always vowed hed amount to something by forty and now it was as much for amy as for himself she lived with his exwife near el cerrito california and she meant the world to him the mortifying part was he was a week behind with this months support check and he knew joyce needed the money it made him feel like a callous deadbeat dad when the real culprit was an unlucky confluence of inescapable bills hed make it up next week but hed sworn he would never let this happen that was why he had a larger game plan get out of this frigging day job and finish the book the time for that plan to kick in was approaching at warp speed this last insult was surely gods notsosubtle way of informing him that his future was in the freelance world every day out there would be a gamble but he could write anything he damn well pleased there was a parable set down by the ancient taoist philosopher lao tzu that stone aimes reflected on more and more these days it was the story of two oxen one was a ceremonial sacrificial ox who for the year before he meets the axe was feted with garlands of lotus flowers and plied with ox goodies the other was a wild ox who had to scrounge in the forest for every scrap but the story went on the day the ax was to drop what wouldnt that ceremonial ox give to change places with that haggard struggling underfed wild ox thats the one he empathized with the one who was out there half starved but free the sentinel was an iron rice bowl that normally never let anybody go except for grossest incompetence or flagrant alcoholism on the other hand getting ahead was all about office politics kissing the managing editors hindquarters and copying him on every memo to anybody to make sure nobody else took credit for something you thought of on the plus side he knew he was a hell of a medical journalist there was such a gap between medical research and what most people knew the field cried out for a stephen hawking of health a medical carl sagan the way he saw it there was room at the top and he was ready for a major career breakthrough he had done premed at columbia before switching to journalism and these days he read the journal of the american medical association from cover to cover every issue along with skimming the many other journals now on the web the piece that just got cut was intended to show the world that investigative journalism was alive and well and trying to make a difference hed documented that hospital mistakes were actually the eighth leading cause of death in the united states the institute of medicine estimated that medical errors caused between fifty and a hundred thousand deaths a yearrivaling the number from auto accidents or aids hed gotten enough data to be able to quantify how many of those deaths were in leading new york hospitals yet there was no federal law requiring hospitals to report mistakes that caused serious injury or death to patients the reason seemed to be that the medical lobbyhed named nameshad successfully turned back all attempts by congress to pass such a law even though it was a formal recommendation by the institute of medicine the problem was once you admitted you screwed up you could get sued so there was no formal accountability but and here was the constructive part if patients medical records were put on the webeverything even their medicationsit could make a big dent in the alltoofrequent hospital medication foulups that alone could cut accidental hospital deaths in half hed pitched jay grimes the managing editor to let him do a fivethousandword piece for the sentinel jay had agreed and even promised him the front page jay liked him but since all the real decisions were made by the owners notsoaffectionately known as the family there wasnt much jay could do to protect his people stone now realized that more than ever the email on his compaqs screen was from jane tully who handled legal affairs for the paper apparently jay didnt have the balls to be the hatchet man so hed given the job to jane who could throw in a little legal mumbo jumbo for good measure and she hadnt even had the courtesy to pick up the phone to do the deed instead shed sent a frigging email see attached corporate says legal implications convey unacceptable risk consider an oped piece that way the liability will be all yours love and kisses and of course by corporate she meant the family or more likely their runningdog attorneys down on nassau street it was really too bad about jane she was a younglooking thirtysix and had her own legal practice with a large law firm in midtown but she always dropped by before her sunday brunch to answer any legal questions that might be pending before the sentinel was put to bed stone knew pretty well how her mind worked he should jane tully was his former very former significant other they d lived together for a year and a half on first avenue in the east sixties but she was type a tailored armani suits and always on time and he was a type b elbow patches and homecooked pasta the denouement had been seismic and full of acrimony and accusations so was she killing this major piece out of spite he wondered just to prove one last time who really had the cojones actually it would have been nice to think so that would put a human face on this gutless travesty but the attached memo had enough legal jargon that another reason was immediately suggesting itself the owners of the paper the family the fuckedup twins harry and bosco and their mother adeline the heirs of edward jordan actually were afraid of a lawsuit the attachment had the fingerprints of the familys attorneys all over it jane was just carrying out marching orders and sure enough there at the bottom was a second message unsigned and not part of the original memo she had written clearly itmb that was their old code for i tried my best well jane baby who the hell knows maybe you did damn it wasnt supposed to be like this he wasnt trying to be a carl bernstein for chrissake for once all he wanted was to report a story exactly the way it was and then try to help he ultimately wanted to fix not fault he hit a button and printed out a copy of everything then minimized the screen grabbed his jacket and walked down the hall was this the moment to quit it was except he couldnt afford to hed never managed to put enough aside to take off a year and live on air and write and still get that fifteenhundreddollar check out to joyce and amy every first of the month he got to the bank of elevators and pushed the button for the third floor and stepped on the inspection sticker framed just above the controls actually told the whole saga of why his cover story about sloppy procedures in new york and national hospitals had been killed the building was owned by bartlett enterprises the real estate holding company of winston bartlett the sentinel held a very favorable lease renewable for another ten years at only a percent increase when it rolled over in seven months the jordan family had gotten it in the early s when new york real estate was still in the toilet from the stock market crash of and for once winston bartlett really screwed up now it was about a fifth of the going price per square foot so naturally he was about to do everything he could to break the lease he was that kind of guy the jordan family owners of the sentinel probably figured that a big lawsuit by the ama or somebody would overtax their legal budget and give bartlett a shot at their soft underbelly thus no boats were to be rocked the elevator chimed and he stepped off on three this floor had subdued lighting and understated birch paneling pale white in the reception area it was as though power didnt need to trumpet itself everybody knew who had it he waved at rhonda the receptionist and strode past she glanced up then said does she know youre coming she knew full well he was headed down to see jane unlike most organizations which take sunday off this was always a big day for the sentinel with all hands on deck thought id give her a little surprise no kidding she was reaching for the phone i think maybe i should not necessary he was charging down the hall feeling kneedeep in the thick beige carpet ive got a feeling shes expecting me janes door was open and she was on the phone but when she saw him she said something abruptly and hung up he strode through the door then slammed it the decor was bold primary colors like her take on life explicit okay he demanded what the hells going on how about the real story love you know you cant hang the family out with that kind of liability she declared then got up and came around her desk and cracked open the door half a foot and youre the one person here i cant have a closeddoor meeting with itll just get people talking again good let the world hear its time everybody on this floor learned what a bunch of gutless owners we have he watched the crisp way she moved pictureperfect inside her deep blue business suit complete with a white blouse and a mans red tie seeing her here hair clipped short glasses in an office brimming with power youd never guess she liked nothing better than to be handcuffed during sex stone have you ever considered growing up she settled back into her chair the desk was bare except for her notebook computer an expensive ibm thinkpad t power all the way the familys attorneys are just trying to keep us from getting dragged into court at least until we can get the papers lease on this building renewed were going to need to focus on that negotiation not be distracted by some massive libel suit brought on by an irresponsible mudslinging piece you practically accused the ama of bribery and you named three senators one from new jersey for chrissake stone there might be a time for that but this is not it this was exactly the reason hed expected what it really meant was the family was scared stiff of winston bartlett they figured he was going to go to court to try to break the sentinels lease let me ask you a question whatever happened to journalistic ethics around here remember that statement of purpose they have everybody sign before they could be hired all the news without regard you know we were both so damned proud to be a part of that now youre helping them kill anything thats the slightest bit controversial is that what weve come to stone what the new york sentinel has come to is to try and stay out of legal shit till their lease is renewed she brushed an imaginary lock of hair from her face a residual gesture she once used to stall for time when she actually did have long hair just let it go wont you to get the signed and notarized documentation wed need to run that piece assuming we even couldwould cost a fortune in time and resources well he told himself there was possibly something to that from a legal standpoint but this was not the moment to let sweet reason run riot okay look if you or the family or whoever the hell believe im going to go quietly youd better get ready for some revisionist thinking if this piece gets spiked after all the work i put into itand dammit jane you know i can document everything i write thats the way i workthen i bloody well want something back from this gutless rag actually its something i want from you youre not really in a position to hey dont try to ream me twice in the same morning he walked around her desk and gazed down at the street the sundaymorning traffic was light he also noticed that there was a public phone on the corner good hed be using it in about eight minutes then he took a moment to reflect on how nice it was to actually have a window of any kind you know the saying the pen is mightier than the sword im about to prove that once and for all but theres something i need i need a half hours face time with one of bartletts employees a certain dr karl van de vliet he runs a company that bartlett bought out called the gerex corporation strictly for factchecking theyve got some important clinical trials going on at a clinic in new jersey that i need to hear about she looked at him in sincere disbelief stone how on earth am i supposed to you talk to the familys lawyers theyve gotta be talking to bartletts attorneys by now make it happen and why exactly because i have a book contract jane and in the process i need to find out everything there is to know about winston bartletts biggest undertaking ever he has bankrolled something that could change the face of medicine youre doing a book about bartlett her astonishment continued growing and appeared to be genuine jesus you didnt tell hello thats because who or what i write about on my own dime is nobodys effing business around here now he was thinking about winston bartlett and wondering why hed never told her the most important piece of information in his life it was how he was connected to the man he often wondered if maybe that was why he was doing this book on stem cells knowing that half of it would end up being about bartletts selfserving takenoprisoners business career his infinite cruelty was the book actually revenge you know youll have to get permission to reprint anything youve published in the sentinel the paper owns the rights to didnt you hear me he smiled its a book my book theres no editorial overlap whos the publisher they exist trust me his small publisher wasnt exactly random house but they were letting him do whatever he wanted it didnt start out being a book about bartlett per se he went on but now hes becoming a central figure because of whats going onor possibly not going onat gerex she was losing her famous poise what what are you writing the end of time the beginning of time i dont know which it is you see the gerex clinic in northern new jersey has clinical trials under way on some new medical procedure involving stem cells at least thats what i think theyve clamped down on the information but i believe van de vliet whos the head researcher there is perilously close to one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history i just need to get all this confirmed from the horses mouth is that what you want to interview him about he was available for interviews until about four months ago i actually had one scheduled but it abruptly got canceled bang suddenly theres a total blackout on the project they just shut down their press office completely when i call i get transferred to his cfo some young prick who likes to blow me off for starters id like to know why its all so hushhush stone private medical research is always proprietary for gods sake sooner or later he undoubtedly hopes to patent whatever hes doing a privately held corporation doesnt have to report to anybody least of all some nosy reporter that was true of course but stone aimes knew that the only way his book would be the blockbuster he needed to get free of the sentinel was to tell the real story of what gerex was in the process of achieving and to be first doing it for which he needed access make it happen because like it or not winston bartlett is about to be the subject of a major volume of investigative journalism ive already got a lot of what i need that wasnt precisely the case but there was no need to overdo brutal honesty the only question is does he want it to be authorized or unauthorized its his choice winston bartlett stone knew all too well was a man who liked nothing better than to see his name in the papers in fact he used the free publicity he always managed to get with his jetsetting lifestyle to popularize his various business ventures like donald trump he had made himself a brand name so what was going on here was he just playing his cards close to the chest waiting to make a dramatic big announcement or was he keeping this project secret because he was worried about some competing laboratory beating him to a patent or was he hiding something had the clinical trials out in new jersey gone off the track was he keeping the project hushhush because something was going on he didnt want the public to hear about had stem cell technology turned out to be an empty promise or had there been some horrible side effect they didnt want reported so could you just raise this with his attorneys because if he lets van de vliet talk with me directly he can be sure ill get the story right we can do this the easy way or the hard way its up to him stone i hope you have an alternative career track in the advanced stages of planning because the minute the family gets wind of this that youre writing some tellall about bartlett theyre going to freak even if youre doing it on your own time you still work here at least for the moment your name is associated in the publics mind with the sentinel he knew that which was why this was going to be all or nothing just do me this one itsybitsy favor jane its the last thing ill ever ask of you he was turning to walk out and look on the bright side when the family finally sacks me for good and all you wont have to write me any more nasty memos telling me to be a good boy he walked to the elevator and took it down the next thing he had to do was make a phone call and this was one that required a pay phone hed thought about it and decided one possible way to encourage bartlett to open up was to try to bluff him to make the man think he knew more about the clinical trials than he actually did there was only one way he could think to do that in premed days stone aimes had shared a dorm room at columbia with dale coverton who was now an md and a deputy director at the national institutes of health his office was at the national heart lung and blood institute one of the nice things about having friends who go way back is that sometimes over all those years something happens that gives one or the other a few chips to call in such was the case with stone aimes and dale coverton dales oldest daughter samantha a blondhaired track star and math whiz hadat age thirteendeveloped a rare form of kidney cancer and needed a transplant she was given six months tops to live stone aimes had done a profile of her in the paper he worked for then the new york globe and hed found a transplant donor a young girl on long island with terminal leukemia who was able to the knowing shed saved another persons life the two had met and cried together but samantha was alive today because of stone aimes it was a hell of a chit to call in and hed sworn he never would but now he felt he had no choice the truth was dale coverton would have walked through fire for him the question was would he also violate nih rules stone hoped he would he stopped at the pay phone at the corner of park and eighteenth street an area where nine people out of ten were wearing at least one item of clothing that was black it also seemed that six out of ten who passed were talking on cell phones he took out a prepaid phone card and punched in the access number and then the area code for bethesda maryland followed by dales private athome number it was after all sunday morning hey atlas hows it going that had been dales nickname ever since he lifted two kegs of beer okay empty over his head one balanced on each hand at a sigma frat blast their senior year it now seemed like an eternity for dale two wives ago and for stone one wife and two livetogethers hey truth and justice over and out it was their all purpose old code phrase for i aced the quiz i hit with the girl im doing great my man i need some truth stone said justice may have to wait a big delivery truck was backing up against the sidewalk its reversegear alarm piercing and deafening the midmorning sun was playing hideandseek with a new bank of clouds in the south that thing you told me about is that it dales voice immediately grew subdued he was a balding blond guy with just enough hair left for a combover beyond that his pale gray eyes showed a special kind of yearning he wanted truth and justice to prevail dont do anything that wont let you sleep nights but this situation is very special i was hoping i wouldnt have to come to you about what we talked about last month but im running out of time and ideas he paused listening to the sound of silence i suppose its too much to ask well i still havent seen any data or preliminary reports the nih monitor for those particular clinical trials is a woman called cheryl gates and shes not returning anybodys phone calls the truth is she doesnt have to but another possibility is she doesnt actually know beans and shes too embarrassed to admit it if somebody wants to keep a monitor in the dark for strategic commercial reasons its easy enough to do well how about the other thing the thing we talked about the list he sighed i was afraid you might come to that thats a tough one truth and justice hey you know i didnt want to ask but im running out of cards he sighed again there was a long silence and then you know youre asking me to give you highly restricted access codes to the nih web site we shouldnt even be talking about it so officially the answer is no thats for the record strictly your decision but he had his fingers crossed even as he was ashamed of himself for asking in the first place maybe this is gods way of letting me even up things a bit it cant be something easy or it doesnt really count does it i could end up knowing more about these trials than the nih does stone said because it doesnt sound like you guys actually know much at all let me think about it and send you an email tonight whatever comes up itll be scrambled eggs thanks atlas scrambled eggs was a reference to a madeup code system theyd used in college a name or number was encoded by interlacing it with their old phone number this time the interlaced number would be an access code for proprietary nih data i do not think im long for the world here at the sentinel were forming a mutual hostility society i sure as hell hope youve got a new career concept ready for the day when they give you the ax dales attempt at a light tone did not quite disguise his concern funny but thats the second time ive received that advice in the last half hour i deem that unlucky stone sometimes i think you ought to try not living your life so close to the damned edge maybe you ought to start practicing a little prudence just to see what it feels like im that wild ox we used to talk about i like to scrounge but i also like to look around for the biggest story i can find im trying to get an interview with a guy on bartletts staff maybe our scrambled eggs will flush him out just take care of yourself and keep in touch you too and they both hung up was this going to do the trick he wondered as it happened stone aimes already knew plenty about bartletts business affairs he had been a lifelong student of bartlett the man and as part of his research into the gerex corporation he had pulled together an uptodate profile of bartletts cashflow situation if you connected the dots you discovered his financial picture was getting dicey bartlett was overextended and like donald trump in the early s he needed to roll over some shortterm debt and restructure it but his traditional lenders were backing away he had literally bet everything on van de vliet if his research panned out then there was a whole new day for bartlett enterprises that had to be what he was counting on to save his chestnuts the funny thing was bartlett didnt really like to spend his time thinking about money one of his major preoccupations was to be in the company of young beautiful women usually leggy models bartlett also had an estranged wife eileen who reportedly occupied the top two floors of his mansion on gramercy park rumor had it she was a paranoid schizophrenic who refused to separate or give him a divorce she hadnt been photographed for at least a decade but there was no reason to think she wasnt still alive and continuing to make his life miserable another tantalizing thing to know about winston bartlett was that he had bankrolled a zen monastery in upstate new york twenty years ago and went there regularly to meditate and recharge he had once claimed in a forbes interview that the monastery was where he honed his nerves of steel and internalized the timing of a master swordsman the forbes interview was also where he claimed he had quietly amassed the largest collection of important japanese samurai swords and armor outside of japan for the past five years he had been lobbying the metropolitan museum of art to agree to lend its dignity to an adjunct location for his collection and to name it after him the bartlett collection winston bartlett lusted for the prestige that an association with the met would bring him at the moment some of his better pieces were housed in a special groundfloor display in the bartlett building in tribeca most of the collection however was in storage he had recently bought a building on upper park avenue and some people thought he was planning to turn it into a private museum well stone thought if the stem cell project works out he could soon be rich enough to buy the metropolitan he walked back to the lobby of his building and stood for a moment looking at himself in the plate glass yes the older he got the more the resemblance settled in winston bartlett shit thank goodness nobody else had ever noticed it chapter sunday april am when ally and knickers walked into her lobby alan the morning doorman was there just arrived tuning his blond acoustic guitar watching over her condominium building was his day job but writing a musical for off broadway about billy the kid was his dream he was a tall gaunt guy with a mane of red hair he kept tied back in a ponytail while he was in uniform and on duty everybody in the building was rooting for him to get his show mounted and he routinely declared that he and his partner were this close to getting backers were gonna have the next rent so youd better invest now was how he put it alan had the good cheer of a perpetual optimist and he needed it given the odds he was up against knickers immediately ran to him her tail wagging hey nicky baby you look beautiful he effused then he struck a bold e minor chord on his guitar like a flamenco fanfare and reached to pat her come here sweetie hi alan hows everything seeing him always bucked ally up he usually came on duty while she was out for her run and she looked forward to him as her first human contact of the day he was younger than she wasearly thirtiesbut she thought him attractive in an east village alternativelifestyle sort of way he was very proud of the new yin and yang tattoos on his respective biceps she admired his guts and his willingness to stick to his dream no matter the degradation of his life in the meantime doing great ms hampton things are moving along alan ive told you a million times to call me ally anything else made her feel like a hundredyearold matron hey right i keep forgetting then he nodded at the manila envelope grant had just given her pick that up on your run i was ambushed by my exbrother he passed it along whats that mean he asked with a funny look brothers are for keeps unfortunately youre right alan the whole thing was long ago and not far away enough she was urging a reluctant knickers on through the inner door seeing him just now was sort of like an aftershock from a big earthquake in another life sounds like you need a hard hat he said and turned back to his guitar humming and dreaming she took the elevator up to the top floor and let herself into her apartment as always feeling a tinge of satisfaction at where she lived home sweet home her loftstyle apartment was in an idiosyncratic building whose sixyearold renovation had been designed by her old architectural firm just before she had to leave and take over citispace it was their first big job in the city she was the one who had designed the large atrium in the middle and the open glass elevators that let you look out at tall trees as you went up and down she loved the building but at the time she couldnt have begun to afford an apartment there later when she could none was available then she heard through the managing agent that a german owner after completely gutting his space had to return to his homeland in a hurry and was throwing it on the market for half what hed paid shed built a bedroom at one endwalling off an area with glass bricks that let light throughand installed a country kitchen at the other but beyond that it was hardwood floors and open space and air and light along with a panoramic view of the hudson river out the north window and a central skylight that kept her in touch with the sky and the seasons in much of manhattan it was possible to go for months and not actually walk on soil you could completely lose the sense memory of the feeling of earth beneath your feet she didnt want to lose the sky too since she couldnt afford a brownstone with a rear garden the next best thing was to have a giant skylight what she really dreamed of was to someday have a vacation home on the caribbean side of the yucatan where she could wake to the sounds of the surf and play bach partitas to the seabirds in the coconut palms she felt there was something spiritual in the pure sound of a stringed instrument it was sweetness and joy crystallized it went with the sound of surf they belonged together she had actually researched and designed that dream house already the place itself would be based on the mayan abodes of a thousand years ago on stilts with a bamboo floor and a palmfrond roof to provide natural ventilation and since this was all a dream she could fantasize that steve was alive and was there too maybe this was her version of the muslim paradise a land of milk and honey and infinite beauty and pleasure sometimes late at night when the world was too much with her she would put on headphones and a bach cd and imagine she was on that beach in the yucatan gazing up at the glorious stars the other thing she wanted to do someday was memorize the first violin score of all the beethoven late quartets but now any intensive playing which was more tiring than it looked brought on chest pains after a few minutes shit she felt like she was slowly being robbed of everything she loved she decided to stop with the negative thoughts and get ready for the stressful day to come she just needed a few quiet moments to get mentally prepared for it the first thing she did was give knickers an early morning snack then a fresh bowl of water and a large rawhide chew to occupy her energy for part of the day after that she would shower and change for the trip uptown she had to dress for the rest of the day which eventually might include going down to the office if she had the time and inclination so she decided to just throw on jeans and a sweater she didnt pay any attention to the envelope grant had given her she just tossed it onto the burnttile breakfast counter she told herself there wasnt time to look at it now but she also realized she had a very serious psychological resistance to opening it she hadnt anticipated that just seeing him once more would make her this tense and angry his proposition was surely part of some kind of scam shed vowed never to believe him again it was going to take a lot of persuading to get her to break that resolve look at it later whenever she gave knickers a goodbye pat and headed out the door in times gone by she took knickers with her since her mother loved to give her sinful sugar treats and fuss over her but these days ninas condition was never predictable knickers was one confusing element too many on the trip uptown she always stopped at zabars for some smoked fish that she could pass off as kippers and some buttery scones nina was born in a little place called angmeringonsea in southern england and she was an unreconstructed brit she insisted on oatmeal the nutty slow cooked kind for breakfast on weekdays and kippers and dark tea on weekends now when ally visited she never knew what to expect some sundays nina could be as spunky as phyllis diller and other times she seemed to barely recognize her though she sometimes wondered if her mom just acted that way so shed leave sooner and let her get back to her spanishlanguage soaps she claimed to be watching them to study hispanic culture but ally suspected the real reason was their racy clothes and plot lines and today on the anniversary of arthurs tragic death would she even remember him earlyonset alzheimers could proceed at a frightening pace nina had been a notable auntie mame kind of figure around greenwich village for decades she smoked woodbine cigarettes fiendishly and was forever giving homeless people food and handouts she had adopted the garden at st lukes and worked there weeding and pruning and planting and nurturing from late spring to early autumn as soon as afternoon tea was completed she waited an only moderately decent interval before her first scotch and soda room temperature no ice one should have a little something shouldnt one arthur joined her to have a cocktail after work once in a while but mainly he successfully kept his mouth shut about her smoking and drinking everyone knew she was destined to live to a hundred cancer was surely terrified to go near her but then the alzheimers struck one of ninas greatest gifts was an unerring bs detector she had been skeptical about grant since he was in his twenties she deemed him a hollow suit full of vapid ambition she also believed his irresponsible behavior was a contributing factor to arthurs death though she did not have the same ferocity of feeling about it that ally did she had had him pegged as a nogoodnik for so long that she already had zero expectations about his character in any case grant contributed nothing to the care of nina and that suited ally just fine as part of the posttragedy financial restructuring she sold their greenwich village condo which was too big and too full of memories for nina to continue living there she then found her a rentregulated onebedroom apartment in a wonderful old building on riverside drive and when ninas earlyonset alzheimers progressed to the point where she couldnt really be relied upon to take proper care of herself she arranged for a very conscientious and sprightly woman from the dominican republic to be her fulltime caregiver maria was devoted to nina and ally didnt know anyone who could have been more nurturing she had been there for nine months and she also used ninas space to babysit periodically for her daughter natalie who had a darling five yearold son what would the next stage be ally wondered fearfully and would her mothers medical insurance pay for it whatever it was she didnt know the answer and she was terrified aging it was natures process to make way for the new but why did the last act have to be so cruel seeing her mother this way made her sometimes think that perhaps arthur was luckier than anyone knew hed managed to miss out on having to watch the woman he loved go into a humiliating decline then she thought about her own mortality the heart condition that refused to get any better dr ekelman had never been more serious slow down take it easy watch out for warning signs shed said everything except start saving up for a transplant or maybe she was just postponing that announcement as long as possible dammit why couldnt she do something to make her heart stronger that was the most frustrating part of all the rest of her body could still have run a mile before breakfast she could traipse all over lower manhattan saturdays shopping for herbs in chinatown and shoes in soho damn why wouldnt her heart get with the program half an hour later a big zabars bag on the seat beside her she found a space for her toyota right on riverside drive just across from the park she took a final look at the sky which was bright and blue and cheerful and then bag in hand she headed up ninas building was a dark brick prewar and had no doorman though the supers apartment was right off the lobby allowing him to receive packages and generally keep an eye on comings and goings to ally the bland inevitably tan hallways in many old west side buildings had a musty quality to them that always left her depressed but her mothers eighthfloor apartment was light and airyafter ally had had it remodeled and redecoratedand she couldnt have wanted a more cheerful home the wallpaper was a light floral pattern and the overstuffed furniture was buried in enough pillows to please martha stewart and in the living room there was the piano her mother once played now covered with photos from happier times and a stereo system with a turntable when she buzzed maria came to the door with an unusually bright smile great ally could always tell immediately from marias face whether her mom was having a good day or bad day today she knew immediately was going to be good miss hampton she was asking about you wondering when youd get here maria said she remembered this is the day you come maria was half a head shorter than ally and her hair was dyed a defiant black she had an olive complexion and her fine features made her a handsome woman for late fifties she always wore bold silver jewelry that might have done more for her daughters than for her but ally liked the spunky persona that went along with too many accessories she still had a trace of her spanish accent even after all the years in new york on days when her mother was cognizant maria was the perfect companion for her ally handed over the zabars bag and walked in hi sweetie nina was on the lounger where she spent most of her waking hours yes she was definitely having a good day today shed done a full makeup number her face could only be described as youthful no matter that she was past sixtyfive she had elegant cheekbones and a mouth that was still sensuous and her blue eyes remained lustrous though nowadays they often seemed to be searching for something or someone no longer there she had a colorist come in every three weeks to keep her hair the same brunette it had always been and that had a way of making ally fantasize she hadnt aged at all ally also felthopedshe might be looking at a spitting image of herself some decades hence you could do a lot worse the tv was on sound turned low and her mother was staring at the multihued screen probably the tape of a spanishlanguage soap shed somehow missed three cosmeticheavy women in deeply cut blouses were arguing all appearing either angry or worried or both in times past nina was always starting some new project claiming that was how she kept her mind alert she had taught herself french and had a very good accent particularly for a brit just before the alzheimers hit she decided to try to learn spanish as something to divert her mind and keep it active she also wanted to be able to chat with the increasingly hispanic workforce in restaurants and delis now though ally thought her mom was continuing the language study as part of a program of denial nina knew her mind was being stripped from her but she was determined to try to wrestle it back by giving herself mental challenges the struggle was hopeless of course but her spirit refused to admit that ally bent down and kissed her clear white forehead hey hows it going look at those pathetic creatures she declared only barely acknowledging allys presence if boobs were brains theyd all be einstein in my day women knew how to make themselves attractive simplicity less is more yep ally thought this is going to be a good day shes obviously spent an hour on makeup for all her complaining she probably watches marias soaps at least in part to glean cosmetic tips who knew maybe she was learning spanish too like she claimed dear god let her do it maria was looking into the zabars bag oh shes going to love this could you come in the kitchen and help me fix a tray thats strange ally thought maria thinks im all thumbs around food preparation and she never wants me in the kitchen the apartment was old enough that the kitchen was a separate room with an open doorway when they stepped inside maria set down the bag and turned to her there was a man here yesterday i never saw him before he said he was your brother is that true ally felt a chill go through her body your mother seemed to know him maria went on but i wasnt sure whether she might have just been pretending sometimes you never know what she gets or doesnt get shes a good faker what what did he want well the first thing seemed to be that he wanted to ask your mother a question about you then he started trying to talk her into going to some clinic out in new jersey where they might be able to help her mind shit what is he up to is he trying to get to me through nina you said he asked mom a question about me what what are you two whispering about came a voice from the doorway all kinds of secrets ally glanced up and smiled maria was just telling me about a visitor you had yesterday mom do you remember if anyone came to see you pish of course i remember seth but sometimes i think id just as soon not she stared at ally those searching blue eyes boring in do you ever see him anymore funny you should ask she thought then she wondered why not tell the truth she couldnt think of any reason not to as a matter of fact mom grant came by my building this very morning i hadnt seen him in ages he called and said he wanted to meet me while i was out running i told him to bug off but he came anyway he wanted me to lets just say hes still wheeling and dealing nina looked at her for a long moment he showed up here yesterday morning darling out of the blue after all those years when he didnt give a shit excuse my francais i acted like i didnt quite know who he was but i got every word hes still spending his salary on clothes he talked a lot saying he knew a mana doctor with some kind of experimental treatmentwho could turn back the clock on my or at least stop it he could give me a chance to take my mind back and then he left his card he wanted me to talk to you about it and then call him back grant you bastard you didnt say a word about any of this whatre you trying to do no need for rocket science he was using nina as bait this was his way to make sure she was dragged into whatever shenanigans he was up to if he got nina out to that place in new jersey whatever it was it would be like he had a hostage she was so angry she was gasping for air and she felt that damned tightness in her chest coming on i told maria to throw the card away nina went on but then i got to wondering what if its true you dont really think of course not nina declared but ally wasnt sure how much she meant it probably he just needs money thatll come next id guess hes hoping ill give him a down payment for this treatment whatever it is thats surely whats going on trying to take advantage of a senile old woman nina didnt appear to be fooled or was she sometimes she did her thinking out loud before coming to a conclusion seth may be barking up the wrong tree with me ally she went on im not sure i want any of his miracle cures ive lived my life im tired she looked away when youre young you never think about what its like to be old but then when you do get old you somehow cant imagine being young again having to do it all over her voice trailed off yes ally thought youve had plenty of pain you wouldnt want to relive nina sat back down on her flowered chaise and closed her eyes do you know what day this is i was hoping youd remember she reached and grasped her hand its been five years today exactly i still have nightmares about it the horror nina said her eyes still closed but he did it for me you know he thought the insurance was all that would save me and then when it didnt so now weve got to hang on with all weve got for him she opened her eyes and looked directly at ally one day soon maybe sooner than we think im going to be mad as a hatter time ally time has played a cruel joke god the prankster is keeping me in physical health so i can experience every step of my own degradation then she glanced back at the spanish soap and went on i hope you know how to enjoy life while youre still full of it dont miss a minute im going to try mom ally squeezed her hand again and for that moment sensed nina was her old self she wasnt going to tell her about dr ekelman and the latest heart news but if she did the response would probably still be the same just live life for all its worth you never know if theres even going to be a tomorrow would you put on some janacek she said finally aiming the remote at the tv and clicking it off one of the string quartets ive had my fill of hispanic tarts ive learned a good deal of spanish from them but sometimes i think understanding what theyre saying just makes it all that much cheaper that was when ally realized with a burst of joy that nina still had an interior life that she was carefully hoarding what else was going on in that mind the sense of the night closing in do not go gentle please stay awhile with me she got up and went over to the record cabinet her mother still had her collection of old s today they were called vinyl with conductors from decades ago like bruno walter and arturo toscanini she found a janacek string quartet no a rare mono pressing by the old budapest string quartet fifty years ago and put it on the turntable still loving those first crackling sounds that raise your anticipation she remembered how nina would put on a record in the evening after dinner with roomtemperature scotch in hand and make the family sit and listen she suspected that had a lot to do with her own desire to play the violin herself someday and then in high school she started lessons better late than never now though she sensed there was something nina wanted to tell her and this was her way of setting the stage after the music had played for almost three minutes nina listening with eyes closed as though in a rapture as the movement clawed its way toward an initial theme in an elusive minor mode she turned and looked at ally he didnt tell you he came to see me did he seth i guess he forgot ally said it was a lie neither of them believed ive been thinking over all he was trying to say i didnt get everything at the time but i guess my feeble mind was recording it now its all coming back he was talking about arthur and his suicideally we both know thats what it wasand how he felt responsible and how he was finally going to be able to make up for all the harm hed done to me and to you but he was worried you might not want to go along with this special treatment for me she was studying ally as though searching for an answer maria had discreetly departed for the kitchen he kept talking about this doctor he knew at this clinic he swore this man could perform a miracle for me he said i should do it whether you approved or not ally looked at her wondering what to say this was getting too devious for words then nina went on ill probably not remember anything about this by tomorrow but i just wanted to tell you when you get as mentally addled as i am now you compensate by developing your other senses i call it your sixth sense and ally i think hes involved in something thats evil and he wants to draw me into it maybe both of us she stopped carefully framing her words i sensed a kind of desperation about him i dont know exactly what it was as ally listened the janacek quartet swelling in the room scratches and all she felt more and more like an utter dunce she hadnt caught any of this in grants comeon but now nina was right about that sixth sense but what could the real story be grant was more a simple con artist than some embodiment of evil think the music man in designer threads not darth vader evil was surely too strong a word he was just the consummate selfpromoting hustler the troubling part was he was so damned good at it mom youre wonderful today why dont we all three go somewhere for brunch now right now theres a new french place just down columbus that needs checking out she had an eerie foreboding it might be their last chance no honey you brought some smoked fish didnt you thats all i want nina dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand besides no one in this town knows how to brew a proper pot of tea then the next thing ally knew she was back to musing out loud about grant i cant stop wondering he said this doctor he knows might work a miracle for me what am i supposed to think ally was trying to decide whether a glimmer of hope even though it was almost certainly false might be a healthy tonic for nina just now mom grant gave me some materials about that doctor ill read them tonight i promise she was listening to the janacek quartet soar and it was bucking her up let me see what i can find out he wants me to start in right away nina pressed i think he said there are some studies going on at this clinic but theyre almost over its free now and unless i go soon i cant get in the program he said he would take me out there monday morning if i wanted but if i go with anybody i want it to be you hes such a bastard ally thought she glanced at maria whod been watching from the kitchen door and listening to all that had happened she was looking very upset and she motioned ally toward the doorway with her eyes let me get a glass of water mom she headed for the kitchen did you hear all the things shes talking about she asked when they were out of earshot maria nodded a lot of what your mother said is true it was very strange at the time she acted like she didnt understand him now i realize she did or maybe it all just came back to her what do you think is really going on ally was studying her hoping to get at the truth she seems a lot better today maria paused a moment miss hampton i dont believe your mother is going to be with us much longer i saw my own go through much the same thing theres always a glimmer just before she looked down and stopped you said grant asked her something about me what i dont think she remembers he was asking her about your blood type it seemed a very strange question ally couldnt think of any reason why he would be asking that maria what was your impression of him overall just that he seemed very nervous very uneasy she hesitated as though uncertain how to continue he wanted something miss hampton that much im sure about but this doctor he wants to take her to it sounded to me like he does things that are against the laws of nature grant wants me to go out to that clinic too whatever you do just stay close to her maria said finally picking up the tray with its smoked fish and teapot covered with a knit cozy she may not have that long maria had a seers mystical bent that sometimes troubled ally what if she was right it was moments like this when ally truly missed having someone special in her life chapter sunday april pm the afternoon was waning when ally finally headed back downtown days like today she couldnt help coining away buoyed feeling her mom was going to be cogent forever in fact ally was more worried about herself just now about two oclock shed started feeling that sensation in her chest again but she hadnt wanted her mother or maria to know she was using vasodilator medication she casually said her farewells and got down to the car and was sitting behind the wheel before she popped a nitro tab she immediately felt okay again and as she drove down broadway heading for her office she reviewed all that had happened after their brunch of smoked fish and onion chutney and soda bread and a pot of doublestrength earl grey shed tried to sell her mother on a trip to the bahamas with maria joining them soon maybe at the beginning of summer she wanted nina to spend some time thinking about it but she didnt want to wait too long was this just going to be a distraction at the end of ninas life god she didnt want to think so she wanted to think of it as a rebonding nina had always liked to revisit the devonshire countryside of her childhood in midsummerwhen arthur could take time offalways for just a week but it was as intensively planned as a major military campaign her favorite thing was to trek among the hedgerows and stone fences making charcoal sketches on openedout brown bags in the evenings they would dine en famille at a country inn they went with local favorites like kidney pie then they would stroll the country lanes in the moonlight as a family no tv and she and grant hated everything about the trips booooring but that was long ago and far away when she and grant were still kids now her mom would surely want something restful and some guaranteed sunshine wouldnt hurt either already she had an idea why not rent a house with a private pool say on paradise island where nina could spend a couple of hours each afternoon in the casino shed always loved casinos and never missed a chance to hit the blackjack tables if she was anywhere near one her loss limit was a hundred dollars but she actually beat the house more often than not the teatime scotch hadnt impaired her cardcounting skills nina appeared to like the idea so ally had started making up a schedule in her head the beginning of summer would be offseason in the caribbean and there should be some real bargains to be had she made a mental note to ask glenda her assertive gumchewing travel agent at empress to start trolling for a package what was ally really thinking hoping she was fantasizing she could heal nina all by herself she so desperately wanted to she had a premonition she could will it to happen when she saw her mom on good days she always found herself believing she could somehow make all her days good she was sure of it against all odds what she wasnt sure about was what her mother really thought about grants proposal to enroll her in this clinic in new jersey was this doctors miracle stem cell cure based on a real medical advance or was he some kind of charlatan the first thing to do was to find out more about this supposed medical magician karl van de vliet the envelope grant gave her was still lying there on her breakfast bar unopened she told herself shed read it the minute she got home tonight when the days work was over and she could concentrate the sunday office the interiordesign job she had on her mind was behind schedule and she was feeling a lot of pressure it was for a norwegian couple in their midthirties he was a software programmer working in new yorks restructured silicon alley and she was teaching at the fashion institute of technology together they pulled down over thou a year and theyd decided to stop throwing away money on obscene new york rents they bought an entire floor actually three small apartments of what was formerly a tenement in the west fifties an area once known as hells kitchen but now much gentrified and renamed clinton they had dreams of an openspace loft of the kind made famous in soho when artists took over abandoned factory buildings and gutted the space taking out all the walls because they had combined three apartments they had to file their plans with the nyc department of buildings and modify the buildings certificate of occupancy to reflect the change in the number of dwelling units so far so good but then a woman who was the local member of the district council got wind of the project and sent someone from her office to look over the place the next day the department of buildings approval of their plans was abruptly withdrawn it turned out that there was an obscure law on the books concerning clinton one that even the department of buildings was only vaguely aware of it said that in order to preserve the family character of the neighborhood no renovation could alter the number of rooms in a residential building not the number of apartments mind you just the number of rooms that was when they showed up at citispace in despair they wanted ally to help them by doing some kind of design that would satisfy the law and also give them the open airy feeling they had set their hopes on on the face of it their two goals seemed mutually contradictory and impossible he was short and shy and she was plump and sassy and ally liked them both a lot sometimes in this business she sensed she was helping people realize their dreams and that was a very rewarding feeling real estate was an emotional thing your home was a part of you she always tried to get to know people before she did any designs for them sometimes design was more psychology than anything else but this time she had to solve a problem before she could wax creative if their plan for open space could be stopped by some obscure local provision that even the department of buildings was fuzzy about then maybe there was some other obscure law in the housing code that could be used to fight back the full code had recently been put on the nyc web site so she wanted to go over every page and see what she could come up with and she wanted to do it in the office undisturbed with all the architectural plans close to hand the office was deserted when she cruised in and clicked on the lights she got on the expansive nyc web site and started poring over the housing code though she was still obsessing about nina what if this doctor in new jersey actually could do something for her finish here she told herself and then go home and read the guys cv a pot of decaf coffee later she came across a littleknown fact which she now vaguely remembered from her days as a practicing architect if you installed a fifteeninch drop across a ceiling that was technically a wall in the eyes of the nyc department of buildings the space on each side became a separate room as they say in the movies bingo in fact why not do a honeycomb ceiling that would actually simulate the industrial look they were seeking anyway the ceiling was over eleven feet high there was plenty of vertical space nobody would know it was just a sneaky way to get around a funny local aberration in the building code im brilliant she thought yes dad would be proud she made some sketches and by that time it was after six time to go home knickers was waiting by the door and she gave ally a dirty look and some very disapproving barks by way of penance ally took her on an extra long walk all the way up to fourteenth street and back then she picked up some tuna salad and steamed veggies from a new deli on west tenth street as she settled down to eat at the breakfast bar she felt like a single mom always eating and doing everything on the runand all she had to worry about was a friendly dog how did real working moms do it it was just past nine when she poured a glass of chardonnay and picked up grants envelope and took it into the living room pausing to put some chopin ballades on the cd player the envelope contained a bound folder that was dr karl van de vliets curriculum vitae his resume it was in fact a minibiography that devoted a page to each of his career turns his life story was presented from a godseye view as though it were a novel karl van de vliet had done his undergraduate studies at the prestigious university of maastricht after which hed migrated to the united states and taken a phd in molecular genetics from the university of chicago top of the class following that he went to yale as a postdoctoral fellow again studying genetics from the beginning he focused his research on the mechanisms that govern human cell reproduction along the way hed become interested in something known as the hayflick limitwhich concerned the number of times a cell could divide before it became senescent and ceased to replicate this natural life span controlled the aging process of every organism and it seemed to be natures device for nipping undesirable ie mutant cells in the bud by never letting any cell unhealthy or healthy just keep on replicating indefinitely however there were immortal cells buried within us all socalled stem cells that could replicate forever unchanged they were present at the very beginning of life and all our differing body tissue was created from them some still lingered on in our body as though to be available for spare parts if one could figure out how to transfer the characteristics of those cells to other cells then the possibility existed that we could regenerate damaged or aging tissue in our vital organs the trick was to figure out the mechanism whereby stem cells managed to cheat time his research which was accompanied by a flurry of scientific papers was celebrated and encouraging after three years he was lured away from yale to become a faculty member at johns hopkins which offered to double his laboratory budget he was there for six years during which time he met camille buseine a neurosurgeon finishing her residency she had a doctorate from a medical institute near paris and she was doing research that was similar to his so the biography said they married and became a team and when he was asked by harvard medical to found a department for molecular genetics she was immediately offered a tenured position there too harvard considered it a double coup his research was zeroing in on the telomerase protein an enzyme many scientists believed was responsible for suppressing the aging process in stem cells could it be used to regenerate tissue he was well along on the task of exploring that tantalizing possibility when tragedy struck camille who had worked around the clock during her residency at johns hopkins began feeling weak at harvard and was diagnosed with acquired aortic stenosis after a year struggle she died during a severe cardiac episode my god ally thought thats what i have after camille died he left harvard and its timeconsuming academic obligations and went to work fulltime at a research institute affiliated with stanford university he even formed a paper company to structure the work the gerex corporation but then there came a second strike against him he was doing research using embryonic stem cells obtained from the discarded embryos at fertility clinics after two years of harassment by rightwing political groups stanford decided his research was too controversial and terminated his funding three months later karl van de vliet merged his company with bartlett medical devices and moved his research staff east to new jersey to the dorian institute that was five years past and now his research using stem cells was in thirdstage nih clinical trials the official history ended there though with a strong hint that the final chapter was yet to be written then at the back there was a bibliography of publications that extended for eight pages and included a summary of the most important papers his work on stem cells and the telomerase enzyme appeared to be at the forefront of the field oddly however some of his writings also were philosophical an argument with himself whether his work could be misused to alter the natural limitations life imposes one of those papers from a conference presentation in copenhagen had a summary and in it he pondered whether the use of stem cells to rejuvenate the body might someday give medical science godlike powers the greeks he declared had a myth about the punishment reserved for those who sought to defeat our natural life span when the goddess of the dawn aurora fell in love with the beautiful youth tithonus and granted him immortality it turned out to be a curse since he still reached the decrepitude of age but had to suffer on forever because he could not have the release of death but van de vliet pondered if we could find a way to arrest the aging process in our bodys tissue might we escape the process of aging if so was this a good thing or might this be a step too far that would bring on unintended and as yet unknown consequences well ally thought i wouldnt mind having moms mind restored or my own heart for that matter all in all karl van de vliet was clearly a genius he also was a very complex man but might he be a very gifted huckster as well the inside back cover had a group photo showing him surrounded by members of his research staff all in white lab coats there were two men and two women and each was identified along with a list of his or her academic credentials they were standing on the porch of what appeared to be a nineteenthcentury mansion which had large doric columns in greek revival style the lettering in the marble above their heads read the dorian institute she put down the folder and went into the kitchen and poured herself another glass of wine finishing off the botde her mind was chinning but not because of the words on the page it was that photograph at the back it was dated less than two years ago his phd at the university of chicago was granted in but even if he was a genius and got his first doctorate in his early twenties hed still have to bewhat at least sixty years old by now probably halfway to seventy but in the photo he looks no more than forty well fortyfive at most what the heck is going on she went back into the living room and picked up the brochure and stared at it he had sandy hair that lay like a mane above his elongated brow he was tall and gaunt with high cheeks and deep penetrating eyes but no matter how you gauged him the guy hadnt aged a day since his fortyfifth birthday tops so whats going on that isnt in the package she checked the digital clock on the side tablethe hour was pushing tenand decided to give grant a call three chirps and then yo hampton here my god she thought he even does it at home that synthetic bravado was left over from his trader days youre the luckiest person alive just to have reached me how can i further make your day his tone implied grant its me i think its time for that vital chat it took him a split second to recover and then hey i was beginning to wonder what happened to you if you were going to stand me up or what not call like you said you would long day i was up at moms this morning you knew she was going to tell me right about your little surprise visit and proposal i had a hunch the topic might arise his voice seemed to shrug nonchalantly i thought you should hear it from her instead of from me so what do you think what do i think i think im wondering what youre up to im not up to anything ally except exactly what i told her trouble is i dont know whether she got it i wanted to see how she was doing you know im thinking maybe dr vee can do something for her but i had to see her first she seemed pretty distant but that woman therewhat was her name marie maria whateversaid she has lucid moments so who knows he might possibly help her i think i can arrange to get her into his clinic bartlett gives me a few perks its the least i can do for her so his voice trailed off expectantly grant i need to talk to you about this man i read the stuff you gave me and i still dont know the first thing about him she paused about to speak words she never thought she would if you want to come over ill stand you a drink you serious for my sins ill grab a cab see you in fifteen its begun she thought im about to let grant screw up my life one more time no this round dont give him the chance stay ahead of him sunday april pm i didnt know if i should have brought a bodyguard he was saying as he strode in the door a master of the universe with a leather jacket slung over his shoulder he looked stylish but then he always did he casually tossed the jacket onto the gray couch then gazed around thankfully he didnt try the new york cheek kiss i guess this is not supposed to seem like old times but somehow it does seeing you again hey were still blood kin right dont push it grant shed killed the chopin and put on a bach sonata clear precise thinking was required not sentimentality knickers had rushed to give grant a hello nuzzle happier to see him than ally was whatever this is it is definitely not old times he sauntered into her kitchen looking aroundtrying to act cool but clearly ill at ease youve done a nice job on this place sis he was looking over the rustic counter shed installed you get a deal on the space a bank repo or something the people who had it wanted to sell fast and i made them an offer not that it was any of his damned business why didnt she treat the question with the scorn it deserved she had an old fifth of dewars in the cabinet she poured him some over ice then gave herself a shot of tequila anejo neat to sip she loved the pure agave flavor the more she thought about the situation the more she was sure she needed it he picked up his scotch then walked into the living room and helped himself to the couch ally i know why youre ticked and i dont blame you i feel crummy about dad i really do i guess i share some of the blame he was trying to sound contrite but the reading did not quite rise to the minimal threshold of credibility you share with whom you selfcentered prick nobody else was involved he mortgaged citispace to the hilt and settled those fraud suits to keep you from losing your license or worse you destroyed his business and his life all by yourself he looked as contrite as shed ever seen him look i thought the business plan i had would work out i really did i was managing discretionary accounts but the bond market hit a downdraft when i was long a few of my clients didnt have the balls to ride it out what do you want me to say that i feel like a complete cretin over what happened that a day doesnt go by that i dont hate myself for it his eyes went dead and he seemed to shrivel his body becoming visibly smaller well i do more than youll ever know you didnt seem all that contrite at the time i was operating in a high state of denial back then but now i want to take a shot at growing up i want to start trying to make up for all that if youll just cut me a little slack and give me a chance grant youre working for bartlett enterprises doing whatever it is you do fine thats your job but now you want me to become a guinea pig when this dutch doctor needs one in a crunch or maybe mom too for all i know maybe he needs her as well two guinea pigs so dont try to make this about me and her lets keep it honest its really about you just like always ally a lot of things have gone on since dad passed away ive changed in more ways than you could ever imagine he was all sincerity now his demeanor rapidly evolving to fit the current vibes of the scene im not like i used to be i really mean that ive learned learned that i cant always just be thinking about myself so what changed you the truth was he did seem different in some way she couldnt quite understand but he was always talking about turning over a new leaf especially whenever hed just gotten himself in trouble that part hadnt changed at all ally dr van der vliet i dont know how much i should tell you but hes a miracle worker he paused and looked down at his scotch one thing about him was definitely different she thought there was a lot less bravado and swagger the thing is what hes doing is so powerful im not sure which worries me mostthat its not true that its just some placebo effect or that it is true when i think about the implications his voice trailed off again go on she could tell he was dead serious its not something im sure i should talk about he reached over and touched her hand but its working i swear hes doing things that shouldnt even be possible uhhuh she thought pulling her hand away grant please tell me exactly what you think he could do for mom she wasnt sure she should be having this conversation you want her to go out to the dorian institute right where he does his research and i take it thats where you want me to go too its in northern jersey about an hours drive from the city maybe not even if traffics light but id only want mom to go if you say its okay im not trying to do anything behind your back she breathed a long sigh trying to clear her brain every other word he uttered was probably part of some hustle but what was it why dont we start at the beginning grant i read his cv and believe me ive got a lot of questions for starters how did he convince winston bartlett to bankroll him she took another sip of her tequila then set it down youre his flunky now so you should be able to answer that question you read the materials i left just finished them then you know he lost his federal funding at stanford a few years back when he was at a critical stage of his research using stem cells thats when he came to the man and persuaded him to put up the money to help him take everything private the only way bartlett would play ball was if he could buy the gerex corporation and get threequarter interest in all the patents van de vliet kept the other quarter but now theyre both hoping to sell off fortynine percent to a big pharmaceutical company not american i cant tell you any more than that congratulations she said sounds like your job is secure yeah right that twitch of nonchalance he had when something really matteredeven as a child he would attempt and fail trying not to gloat over some personal success it was moments like this when she realized shed missed seeing him and talking to him when you cut a family member off from you you also cut yourself off from them after all he was her closest blood kin even though he was an unreconstructed shit at some level she wished she could get past the bitterness she felt toward him could it be he really had changed he didnt like the way the scene was going what the hell was her problem he looked at his scotch longingly then got up and went to the kitchen and got another ice cube for it go easy how was he going to get through to her if word of the beta screwup got out the buyout was toast and grant hampton along with it but if ally could be brought in grant she was saying i want to start off by asking you if youve ever taken a really good look at that guy karl van de vliet does he look anything like his picture the one that came with that cv of his sure thats him and i assume youve actually read his resume of course here it comes he thought the thing everybody asks if those dates are right then he has to bewhatat least sixty years old but in the picture he doesnt look a day over fortyfive so whats going on ally youre finally getting it he rattled the ice in his dewars then finally took a deep sip maybe he thought it would help with the courage hes a truly amazing human being thats not an answer grant its a generality she exhaled in obvious exasperation but i want an honest answer about one thing dammit do you actually think he could help moms alzheimers maybe even reverse it tell me the truth just once ally i cant guarantee anything but its worth a shot now he thought hopefully she was sounding like she was starting to come around thank god as for whether dr vee could cure the old bird who knew but hed overheard the nurses talking about how he and his research staff had had some phenomenal luck with alzheimers by the way what happened when you talked to mom he went on did she seem like she understood anything i told her grant she probably understood a lot more than you wanted her to the bad part is she let you give her some hope now whats going to happen if she goes out there and ends up being disappointed its a real possibility he told himself but its probably the only way ill ever get you out there and thats what really matters ally well never know unless you should go too look maybe ill talk to van de vliet but its purely informationgathering she was staring at him so why not tell me the whole story are you doing this for mom and me or are we just being used like lab animals im not sure youre going to believe anything i say he sipped again at his scotch then walked over to the skylight and looked up finally he turned back after dad and everything i had trouble sleeping i know you didnt think it got to me but it was like some bad force had taken over my mind haunting me i became obsessed with death i took off two months and went to colorado camping out there under the stars i did a lot of thinking dad had died suddenly but maybe that was a blessing in disguise the rest of us we all die a little every day why does time do the things to us it does why do we have to grow old and repulsive he drew on his scotch again then continued when i came back i started doing research on aging thats when karl van de vliets name popped up on the internet some paper hed given in vienna years ago it was about the physiology of aging but then tanya came along and i sort of forgot about him then when i went to work for winston bartlett there he was the very same guy it was weird but it was as though god had delivered him is this shaggydog story going to end up being about why he looks so young im getting there he smiled i kept wondering too and then finally i saw an opening in his schedule and took him to dinner here in the city down at chanterelle a social thing eventually after a couple of bottles of serious wine it came out that once upon a time he had done an unconventional experiment on himself it was sort of an accident something about melanoma research so he you asked me why he looks so young well some procedure he did apparently stopped his skin from aging but then he changed the subject and wouldnt talk about it anymore so do i think hes a miracle worker id say hes walking proof of something that you can cheat nature and there is no and thats all i know he came back and settled onto the couch his scotch glass was empty and he yearned for another but that small voice inside was urging discretion this was the moment that could be make or break but to get back to you ally you really should meet him i cant talk specifics about the actual clinical trials but let me just say theyve been very positive theres every reason to think he can help you and mom too he studied her trying to read her mind he wondered if she could detect the anxiety he felt lurking just beneath the surface was she seeing through him the way nina for all her mental debility had seemed to grant has this doctor van de vliet gotten into some kind of medical experiment thats turned into a faustian bargain is his skin rejuvenation a signal that this research has gone over into the twilight zone when a sixtysomething man looks fortysomething theres got to be an unnatural act going on what does it mean maybe it means hes found the thing ponce de leon was looking for the fountain of youth or whatever then hell probably have to pay for it some other way she said getting up mother nature doesnt give out freebies look ive got to give knickers her midnight walk thats your exit cue ill call him tomorrow ill go that far dont blow this chance ally he said setting down his empty scotch glass and getting up he felt hope and it bucked him up it could be the biggest mistake of your life and moms he was at the door before he turned back it was time for the insurance the hedging of bets bartlett had authorized it by the way i almost forgot jesus im going senile myself wb told me to tell you hed like you to come over to his place on gramercy park tomorrow morning around ten if you can work it into your schedule what for that job on his place that i told you about this morning i guess i do know hes planning to renovate the ground floor but just between us hes also got a massive renovation job in the wings so maybe thats whats really on and this is like an audition who knows he bought an old mansion on upper park and hes planning to heavily redo it and turn it into a museum for his incredible collection of japanese military stuff swords and armor and shit hes going to do over the entire interior its part architecture and part design so i gave him your name who knows but i was over at his place this afternoon and he asked about you he said he wanted to see you as soon as possible he even gave me one of his personal cards to give to you here it has the gramercy park address and his private cell phone just like that she looked skeptical but took the card winston bartlett is not a man who dawdles if he decides he wants to do something he just moves on it all he asked was that you bring a portfolio to show him some of your work come on and do it he thought as he headed out the door go and see the man just fucking do it if he cant close this frigging deal nobody can chapter sunday april pm winston bartlett put the newly glazed creme brulee still warm from his preparation in the kitchen below stairs on the bed tray in front of kristen next to her untouched champagne flute she used to love it and he was trying everything he knew to jog her memory hed cooked her favorite supper eggs florentine with barely wilted spinach topped by prosciutto had taken her to bed and now there was champagne and her favorite dessert but she still seemed distracted and distant yes it was a good idea to get her away from the institute but that was merely relocating the problem not fixing it if it could be fixed in the meantime she had to be kept here out of the public eye thank you she said and gingerly took a small bite she had been almost lucid earlier this evening and was leaning against the antique headboard wearing a soft blue nightgown her long blond hair was tousled and down over her breasts her memory might now be a sometime thing but her libido was still going strong do you remember how much you used to like that he asked trying to make eye contact she nodded her head dumbly did she actually remember increasingly he had no idea he had brought her here to stay in this fivestory nineteenth century mansion on park avenue hed purchased it a year and a half earlier for million and he was intending to have it renovated and converted into a museum that renovation however had been put on hold awaiting a decision by the board of directors of the metropolitan museum he wanted the building to be a park avenue adjunct to the met and he also wanted his definitive assemblage of japanese implements of war to be known as the bartlett collection the tax writeoff would be monumental but that was not nearly so important as the prestige it was clear now that this project would not have any momentum until he first got himself appointed to the board of the met unfortunately money alone wasnt adequate majorleague politics was involved he was working on it with a lot of upper east side lunches and targeted charity events he was also taking his time and getting designs and estimates for the renovation the way things were at the moment he didnt have the cash to actually start construction anyway for the moment the place was furnished but unoccupied except for a security guard a part of bartletts personal staff now with kristen here discretion was his uppermost concern he had sent the security guy home this evening so he and kristen could have privacy in the morning two nurses would come on duty one to look after her and another to cook over the past year hed brought her here most weekends it was like having their own shangrila best of all unlike his official residence on gramercy park he didnt have a wife upstairs like some mad in every sense of the word aunt in the attic he had hoped that bringing kristen back here might do something for her memory he still hoped but he wasnt sure in bed tonight she had been as lithe and enthusiastic as ever possibly even more so did she know who he was he couldnt really tell but he still loved being with her the soft skin and the voluptuous curves of her breasts and thighs it made him feel young again since she had been out at the dorian institute and away from him he had begun to feel older and older winston bartlett was sixtyseven andincreasinglyfelt it to begin with his prostate was enlarging itself in spite of all the special expensive medicines he used surgery was increasingly looking like a possibility and his memory was nowhere near what it once was he wolfed down ginkgo and ginseng capsules by the handful but was finding it harder and harder to remember peoples names particularly the new wave of donationhungry politicians who fawned over him and then there was the matter of teeth hed just gone through major periodontal surgery a sign of aging gums how long before his ivories would be replaced by ceramic choppers oh and the heart his cardiologist was talking more and more about stents to alleviate the two constricted arteries in the left ventricle they were already down to percent face it his whole damned body was falling apart probably worst of all the johnson was far from what it used to be not long back it was a daily triple threat soon he might be resorting to viagra as more than a discretionary recreational drug something he was still joking about less than a year ago the dirty secret about living this long is after youve seen everything you ever wanted to see done everything you ever wanted to do bought everything you ever wanted to buy you gradually lose the only thing really worth having youth to try to hang on to it he had been through clinics as far flung as phoenix and lucerne he had undergone regimens of antioxidants and injections of human growth hormone hed tried testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone better know as dhea maybe it had made a difference maybe not sometimes he thought he had more libido and energy but other times he wasnt sure maybe it was just that hed begun working out even harder playing handball an extra half hour every other day he did know his body was continuing to deteriorate shit the beta had to be made to work i dont want to stay here alone kristen said putting down her spoon i want to go back to work honey i cant be here all the time and youre really not well enough to go to work therell be someone here with you its just till you get better he studied her the face that was so young and felt the full weight of the tragedy sinking in do you remember what it was you used to do i dont remember right now i mean exactly i used to talk to people i was in this room with lots of bright lights she didnt actually remember he thought her former producer at e along with everybody else including her harridan of a mother katherine had been told she was at a private health spa in new mexico it had to be kept that way no one must know she was here all the phones had been removed before the ambulance brought her starting at six in the morning there would be a nurse and a nursecook downstairs on a twentyfourhour basis under no conditions could she be allowed to leave not the way her mind was now kristy it wasnt supposed to turn out like this im so sorry but karl is doing all he can were he has a new idea that hes about to explore hes going to his voice trailed off as he stared at her unblinking eyes you dont remember what happened do you but how she looked my god the youth how could a true miracle have such a tragic downside that was when the cell phone on the stand beside him chirped it was the only phone in the place and tomorrow it would be gone no way could she be allowed to have a phone the caller id advised that it was grant hampton kristy ive got a feeling this could take a while he was reaching for his silk robe ill be downstairs on the first floor if you need anything okay she just stared at him mutely he shook his head sadly there wasnt much time left to mend her how in gods name had it come to this as he moved down the spiraling grand staircase he clicked on the phone yeah i was just at her place wb i actually got in which is more than has happened in over four years i think shes on board but im still not entirely sure so just to be safe i told her you wanted to see her tomorrow are you saying you couldnt make this happen with your own fucking sister its were not exactly on the greatest of terms ally and me there was an awkward tone in his voice its hard to explain like i told you i confirmed her blood type on saturday its ab like i thought and i played the mother angle at the very least i think shes willing to drive the old bird out to the institute and meet karl thats a start at least and what about her medical karl wanted to see im working on it i remembered something about her ive got a guy hes going to check on it tonight good bartlett growled theres no time to screw around on this ive set it up for you to meet her tomorrow the way you wanted i think shell show i told the one who really should talk to her is karl bartlett sighed he knows how to handle patients then he could call her tomorrow after shes talked to you if we all pull together on this wb im sure we can get her out there by day after tomorrow tuesday winston bartlett looked at his watch it had just turned monday one less day to find something that would stop the syndrome in its tracks wed better he was clicking off the phone when he heard a wail of despair from the bedroom upstairs and the sound of a champagne flute being thrown against a wall kristen was losing it rapidly now was she still conscious enough to know what was happening to her chapter monday april am the commute from allys west village place to the citispace office in soho was normally a twentyminute brisk stroll and she brought knickers with her a lot the bosss prerogative since her office was arguably homier than her home knickers loved to wander around andshe thoughtguard the computers and drafting tables this morning though ally had an appointment for her at pooch pros the dog groomers near her office a wash and a trim and plenty of pampering betty and misha always fussed over her shamelessly and she gloried in it but now a pounding rain had just come through which meant no walk for either of them knickers would show up looking like a bedraggled mop definitely the moment to take the car alexa hampton liked to say that she wasnt really an auto person hers was a fouryearold toyota light blue and its modesty befitted her needs in new york hopping around soho and the village it made a lot more sense to rely on a bike or on cabs or just plain walk garaging a car in new york cost the equivalent of a studio apartment rental in most normal places and the bottomline truth was she resented the toyotas presence in her life but there were moments when cabs werent the answer and this was one of them fortunately the parking garage she used was just around the corner so she and knickers got there before being totally soaked knickers loved riding in the toyota and she always seemed to know what was coming the minute they turned the corner for the garage this morning she gave a gleeful woof and started panting a sure indicator of joy as they drove the few blocks downtown the rain was easing up but the streets were still shiny ally reached into her bag and took out the personal card of winston bartlett his private residence was on gramercy park the only reason he could possibly want to meet her there was if he did indeed have a job she decided she would call him from the office and confirm the appointment assuming he still remembered it then shed get jennifer to help her assemble a portfolio of their work and make a color copy to leave with him she leaned over and rubbed knickers ears her thoughts were drifting back to karl van de vliet at some level his stem cell technology sounded like the ultimate snake oil was she about to take leave of her common sense to go to see him or even to consider letting him perform some experimental procedure on her mothers mind on the other hand what about him what kind of procedure could van de vliet have done that would stop his own skin from aging if grant had merely told her that karl van de vliet had finally realized the cosmeticians dream and learned how to make human skin youthful and supple again she would have passed it off as just more wall street ipo hyperbole but seeing was believing and it also seemed like there was a lot more going on than just a change in his skin there was something about him in his eyes that felt inconsistent she was still puzzling on that point when knickers jumped up and barked they were passing a garbage truck and the guys were banging the cans into the back shhh she reached to quiet her were almost there baby then she tugged at her leash and settled her back into the seat since the rain was all but over she decided to park the car where she dropped knickers off and then walk over to her office which was only a couple of blocks east she found a spot right next to the awning of pooch pros and the minute knickers was liberated from the car she bounded to the door dragging her leash through the puddles misha was already there to meet her come on my kraceve baby my beauty he reached down and gave her a big hug misha was a gaunt balding blondhaired russian who had once been the hero of the soviet olympic swim team now he looked like he could stand a piroshki or two to plump him up you be big fluff of cloud after we finishing ally followed them in and there was betty ally figured betty assumed her madeup but totally american name was easier than whatever shed used in russia but to ally it just felt weird betty had dark hair a broad smile that wouldnt die and approximately thirty pounds that would have looked better on misha they reminded her of jack sprat et al honey there is problem at your office woman name jennifer call say she try reach you at home but you leave already and you dont answer your cell phone shit i turned it off knickers goes nuts if it rings in the car jennifer was only a couple of years older than ally but shed been with the firm back when allys father arthur ran it and she was the mother figure of citispace she was also allys best friend and had been even before ally came back to run the firm ally felt like she had known her forever these days jen spent a lot of effort trying to create a social life for ally that would include eligible men she kept nagging her to join some clubs anything just get out there ally knew she was right but she was working too hard to take time out she had the idea which she wasnt naive enough to actually believe at a rational level that sooner or later someone who could replace steve would come along yes she was lonely a lot but until this last deterioration of her heart shed spent a lot of evenings and weekends outside biking and hiking around town and she knew plenty of people who were interesting and kind she sometimes thought her problem was that she liked people all kinds of people as long as they were kept slightly away at a psychic distance maybe it was the getting close part that never seemed to work out it had actually been that way ever since steve disappeared she had the premonition that if she got too close to somebody she was destined to lose them now she stood for a second puzzling shed mentioned taking knickers to pooch pros so thats how jen knew where shed be but what could have gone wrong at in the morning jennifer wasnt usually in this early but she was finishing a rush job for a marble bathroom for a couple on the upper east side on days when jennifer did get to the office first shed have the coffee going and an extra bagel for knickers on the chance ally might bring her which she often did but to phone betty just to tell her to hurry that was odd should i call now it seemed pointless she was no more than ten minutes away what else could go wrong in ten minutes she sound very hurry betty declared ally took her cell phone out of her bag and switched it on the office rang only once and then jennifer was there ally youre not going to believe who called here ten minutes ago asking for you winston bartlett my god its like donald trump called well actually it was some male secretary or something he said he was calling to confirm your ten oclock appointment at an address on gramercy park east whats that about jesus ally where are you i dont know what youre up to but this could be big he owns entire buildings for chrissake did you say i was coming i didnt know what to say he left a number to call if you cant make it otherwise hell assume youll be there its only two hours from now all right jen lets put together a folio of our biggest jobs lead with that gut rehab we did on the building down by the south street seaport and put in those two floorthrough lofts we did on that conversion in tribeca the ones with the slate bathrooms and the stainlesssteel countertops in the kitchen ive already started do you know specifically what he has in mind she paused how did he find out about us anyway my creepy kid brother works for him she sighed its a long story be there in a couple of minutes she clicked off the phone betty thanks a lot ive gotta run she turned and gave knickers a last rumple of the ears be good baby ill pick you up by six at the latest what wrong misha was concerned twisting a white towel he was holding big problem nothings wrong actually something probably is wrong i just dont know what it is yet she headed out the door the design firm her father had started and shed kept going now with some architecture thrown in was on the ground floor of an old industrial loft building whose upper floors had been converted into rental apartments in the early s the owner was an exwrestler named oskar jacobi who had turned zen master after a fashion and had a studio upstairs on the second floor he had drifted from wrestling into karate during his thirties and thence into the life of the mind or rather the life of nomind in his late forties now he taught meditation as well as karate and insisted they be learned in that order he served as his own superintendent mopping the halls and setting out the garbage on pickup days the ground floor was zoned commercial and citispace had a lease for all of it which meant she had tons of space oskar had given allys dad arthur a tenyear lease which was now a fraction of the going rate they both knew that and shed more than once offered to renegotiate or move but he said he didnt need any more income and besides he liked having her as a tenant because she reminded him of her father it was a generosity perfectly in keeping with his philosophy that excess money corrupted the spirit shed done the place as a sort of spanish desert flower with burntorange tile floors and all the natural materials she could cram in a lot of her clients wanted the hardedge industrial look in their lofts which was fine by her but she found it too cold for a daily working environment the front was unassuming with small lettering on the window citispace was not a walkin business and she had no metal gates over the windows whats to protect when she marched through the door everybody looked up from their coffee and computers and jennifer led the applause winston bartlett had they finally made the alist this could be the start of something big chapter monday april am ally stepped out of the cab holding the large leatherbound portfolio and checked the number on the card against the bronze plaque above the door winston bartlett lived like a nineteenthcentury robber baron the building had five stories and was adorned with italian marble window lintels that glowed like motherofpearl already she liked his sense of style bartlett was new money but this place had the solemn dignity of old money the front door was eight feet tall and solid mahogany the odd thing was there were two doorbells one read w bartlett and the other read e bartlett that was when she remembered she had read somewhere that he had a wife named eileen but why did she have a separate doorbell winston bartlett had a tabloid reputation as a womanizer perhaps they lived apart if so there it was for all the world to see she found herself examining the late greek revival columns on either side of the door they were marble and meticulously cleaned of soot whose ubiquitous presence in new york meant that eventually everything not regularly scrubbed turned gray it told her that winston bartlett liked things to be immaculate and that he was a stickler when it came to details she glanced up and noticed that she was being observed by a security camera she was reaching out to push the bell for w bartlett when the door magically opened a tall trim japanese man in a crisp black suit was standing in the doorway but he had a muscular build that would be more appropriate for a bodyguard than a butler hello she said i have an appointment with yes he nodded appearing to know exactly who she was hes upstairs in the library please shed expected a grand central staircase in the palladian design but instead there were elevators off to the left of the entryway but even without an obvious staircase the ground floor and its fifteenfoot ceiling were palatial in every sense of the term the marble floors were covered with antique and expensive persian rugs and the light tan wallpaper was flecked with gold leaf giving the feeling it could have been meticulously stripped from some palazzo in venice the lighting fixtures were a row of chandeliers down the middle of the vast room and at the back was a dining table that appeared to be large enough to seat thirty dinner guests the architecture was a showpiece for the extravagant taste of some victorian enemy of the people but what really set it apart was that the walls were lined with exquisitely severe antique swords and armor from japan in a way the room felt like the foyer of a boutique museum an adjunct of the asia society the japanese man directed her to one of the elevators and then got in with her she still couldnt decide whether he was a butler or a bodyguard he had the polished demeanor of the first but the strapping body and deft movements of the latter maybe he was both in any case he looked like he would be quite at ease brandishing one of those long samurai swords the elevator had dark paneling and smelled of freshness partly fresh wood and partly fresh lacquer it was utterly silent as it glided up to the third floor when the door opened she stepped into what appeared to be a large denlibrary except that there was a huge fourposter antique bed at the far corner with its drapes drawn around the side it was definitely something out of another place and time was this bartletts bedroom the space was magisterial in the other corner was a wide mahogany desk covered with phones and papers and two computers from his photos she recognized the man rising to greet her as winston bartlett seeing him in the flesh she first noticed that there was something in his eyes that in another man might be called ruthless but in him it merely came off as determined they were eyes that were accustomed to getting what they wantedbe it a company a building a woman fine ken and please have them hold my calls bartlett said nodding to the japanese man who tipped his head in acknowledgment and disappeared back into the elevator then he turned to her and extended his hand ms hampton i appreciate your making time for me im possibly your newest fan after grant told me about you i had a couple of my people do some research youve been responsible for some very interesting even elegant interiors grant may have told you i have a big project down the road that you might wish to bid on but for now as a way of getting to know each other i wanted to talk to you about a more modest undertaking she thanked him attempting to take it all in she was trying not to admit to herself that winston bartlett was an attractive man in the way that power brings charisma id be happy to hear about what you have in mind i dont necessarily take every job that comes along i always look for challenges she listened to herself and wondered why she was starting off the meeting in such a confrontational manner probably she thought it was because she didnt want to seem intimidated doing highend interior design you come across a lot of wealth and power but this was a whole new level well i guess im the same way he smiled a lot of the things ive done over the years have ended up being a challenge and a risk but now and then something is worth it he gestured toward a couch please we have a lot to talk about he returned to the chair behind his desk and turned off the laptop computer he had been using i brought a portfolio she began with photos theres also a dvd with virtual walkthroughs of some of our projects im not sure what you have in mind but this should give you some idea of the kind of thing we ill look at it he said setting the portfolio aside unopened im sure you live up to your reputation like i said i have two jobs pending so first let me outline the smaller one this building was built just before the prior turn of the century and it was intended to house a small workforce of cooks and nannies and seamstresses below stairs the rooms were lit with town gas and coal was used for heating and cooking then in the twenties everything was gradually switched over to electricity and oil and natural gas but very little effort was made to accommodate the change aesthetically it was just retrofitted thats typically how it was done and i havent really cared until now he went on but lately ive decided i want to redo this place properly starting below stairs and moving up its mainly the kitchen down there that concerns me now i want to remove all the outdated fixtures and go state of the art theres nothing original there anymore just somebodys idea of a modernization back in the fifties so nothing of historic value will be lost i dont want a restaurant kitchen precisely but i want a range with enough btus that it could be granite countertops are all the rage these days he paused then grinned sheepishly i promise i wont start telling you how to do your job work up some ideas without any interference from me and then well see where we go from there do you have any blueprints of this building the original plans he smiled as though to say you ask good questions as a matter of fact they were filed downtown in a littleknown cranny of the department of buildings and i had an expediter i know track them down he paused ms hampton there is one little matter i want to clear with you in advance i know that the newspapers occasionally print things about me that might be termed unsavory you came to meet me here so that tells me something about your feelings toward me but i have discovered that i am a somewhat controversial figure in certain circles id just like to know if you think of me as controversial she found this unexpected new tack in the conversation puzzling was he trying to get a rise out of her i barely know you mr bartlett she said and frankly the private life of a client is none of my business so that question is entirely unnecessary very well he smiled like i said theres a much larger job now in the planning stage i have a building on park avenue in the seventies that im planning to convert into a museum it would be a private undertaking at first but in the long run who knows the job will require extensive alterations of the building and i also plan to have a museum cafe in the lower level anyway theres a lot of work ahead and i thought this would be a good way for us to get acquainted redoing the first floor here would give us both some idea of whether we could work together on a larger project she listened and found herself wondering what he was really up to this conversation felt like he thought he needed to have plenty of bait on the hook first grant and then him a tycoon whos a perfect stranger why monday april am winston bartlett was not finding himself entirely satisfied with the way things were going as he looked her over he had a lot on his mind this was the woman who shared his rare blood type and could represent his last hope so far she seemed smart and courageous given the gravity of what hed heard about her heart condition from karlwhich youd never realize by just looking at hershe had to be courageous to continue on with her kind of spirit but that was not necessarily all to the good she might not be so easy to manipulate inevitably he found himself comparing her to kristen for starters alexa hampton seemed to have a lot more self assurance kristy liked to appear tough on camera but she was riddled with an aspiring actresss insecurities which had played a large part in the current tragedy but you could say she brought that on herself alexa hampton was struggling with something she had nothing to do with and to look at her youd never know it that was spunk in truth this was the kind of woman hed often wished hed marriedsomeone who shared his own gusto for life god had dealt her a particularly lousy hand and yet she still had drive she had more courage in her little finger than that monster upstairs eileen and the fact was she was more appealing than kristen but dont even think about going there coincidentally he said beginning a new tack theres a totally unrelated matter i wanted to discuss with you i understand grant has already told you about the clinical trials currently winding up at the dorian institute which is part of one of my companies he told me about your heart condition and about your mothers alzheimers were working on a new procedure that could be very relevant for both of you the clinical trials are scheduled to conclude in just a few days from now but i spoke with the lead researcher there dr van de vliet and he said theres still time to get you into the program yes grant came to see me and brought me a brochure your brother is very concerned about you and your mother and he specifically asked me to inquire if you had any questions about the procedure that i might be able to answer for you he was watching her carefully all the while trying to keep his tone casual well i think my mother is interested quite frankly she doesnt have much to lose though she may be in denial about that in my own case im not so sure i still dont know anything about karl van de vliet shes still toying with the bait bartlett thought i cant yank the line just yet but shes close shes so close truly the best thing you could do would be to talk to him bartlett said getting up from his desk and walking over to the window and pulling the curtains aside the midmorning light streamed in a momentarily blinding presence ive got to shake this up he told himself as a matter of fact id like for you to meet with karl before we go any further with this job we need to get you well first and your mother hes had some truly amazing successes with both alzheimers and parkinsons its just that this is all so experimental arent there any side effects new drugs or new medical procedures always have side effects well he thought now youve hit on it but that part is best left to karl if you have questions thats all the more reason to check out the clinic he declared time to close the sale he came back and sat down behind the mahogany desk ive seen a lot of medical innovation over the years including a good bit in my own companies but theres never been anything that remotely compares to the promise of stem cell technology and these stagethree clinical trials have shown how many miracles are in the realm of the doable grant said dr van de vliet wanted to include someone with my specific condition in the let me be frank with you he looked across at her and smiled you would be a perfect fit but the trials are going to be over very very soon so hes anxious to get started truthfully im thinking about taking mom out there she said and since were all being so frank let me say im getting the impression that my going out to your clinic is really the reason you wanted to see me today its its the second reason he said the design job is uppermost in my mind but i see nothing wrong with having two purposes in seeing you as someone once said commerce is the mutually beneficial exchange of worth was she agreeing to see van de vliet playing the mother card may have done the trick well why dont we stick to tangible worth she said let me take a look at the space downstairs but youll have to tell me some more about what you have in mind i propose we do it the other way around you go down and look around take measurements make sketches whatever it is you do and then get back to me with some ideas thatll be our starting point he picked up a walkietalkie on his desk and punched a button ken could you please come up id like you to show ms hampton the service floor he clicked it off without waiting for a reply im due down at the office when i get there ill have them cut a check for five thousand dollars as a retainer and messenger it over to your shop is this going to work he wondered maybe i should be pushing harder he examined alexa hampton one last time as he rose to leave yes shes a rare woman wouldnt it be ironic if karl actually could do something for her heart monday april am as ally watched winston bartlett sweep from the room she was still trying to take measure of the man what troubled her was why grant and bartlett were both so anxious to get her and her mother out to the clinic but give bartlett his due he could charm the birds off the trees she looked around the room wondering what the old kitchen and staff quarters would be like certainly not like this the librarybedroom had a rich overthetop feeling with a beautifully molded plaster ceiling a virtual basrelief of fruits and birds and clouds all meticulously painted it wasnt the sistine chapel but had some of that feeling the paneling and wainscot were burnished mahogany and the floor was a mix of hardwoods worked into an isometric design she decided it was probably the most luxurious private residence she had ever seen citispace was mainly known for its creative handling of lofts in the abandoned commercial buildings of soho and tribeca these old mansions of the nineteenthcentury moguls were an entirely different world it was intimidating but she was sure she could do something below stairs that would retain the period flavor of the building while creating the kind of semiprofessional space he said he wanted still it was different from anything else citispace had ever done so he had no way of knowing whether or not she could pull it off again that question why on earth would he hand her this plum job and where was his wife although he liked to be photographed with blond starlets the tabloids always reminded you that he had a wife someplace the two doorbells were a tipoff that that someplace was here best guess she probably had the top floors my god was madame bartlett going to get involved in the renovation a lot of women with superrich husbands and too much time on their hands come to assume that that happenstance creates in them a natural gift for interior design big problem but whatever happened this could be a sweetheart job and maybe shed get a crack at that museum hed talked about that was the kind of thing an architectturnedinterior designer dreamed about she looked up to see the japanese manbartlett had called him kenstepping into the room he was all business monday april am winston bartlett was on the phone to van de vliet the moment he stepped into his limo to head downtown she said shes thinking about bringing her mother out to the institute karl i believe shes ready to do it before she changes her mind i want you to talk to her and schedule an appointment for tomorrow morning if you can ill put in a call to her office karl shes not there now try her cell grant has the number we need to get moving on this ive done about all i can at the moment he was watching the midmorning traffic that was clogging the avenue he always felt claustrophobic in a limo even a stretch the only time he felt free was when he was in the mcdonnell douglas chopper when he was flying the chopper against all the laws of civil aviation dont you think thats a little pushy wb we shouldnt seem too anxious believe me ive had a lot of experience with ambivalent patients all right she should be back at her office sometime after lunch ill wait awhile and put in a call there he paused when was the last time you saw beta one the situation at park avenue i dont want to discuss it over a cell karl this conversation was definitely a bad idea she comes and goes i think its getting worse ill try to get over there late this afternoon and look in on her van de vliet said i want to see her every day karl we cant give up hope never give up hope he clicked off the phone and thought about his crapshoot with god kristen had wanted to play to experiment with the beta but nobody made her undergo the procedure she should never his cell phone rang yeah mr bartlett came a female voice with a brooklyn accent its bernd allen calling put him on shit bartlett thought this is news i dont want to hear bernd was a brit who was in charge of daytoday accounting for bartlett medical devices he was fortyseven and not a risk taker and he was always worried about something that was his job these days he had plenty to be worried about he had been running a weekly projection of the cash flow at bmd and the drawdown was now getting perilous the flagship product of bartlett medical devices had been the balloons used in heart angioplasty that inflate and expand clogged arteries they were marketed together with stents miniature metal mesh supports that keep coronary arteries open after angioplasty the problem was that in percent of the cases the stents manufactured by bmd caused scar tissue to form a process called restenosis and reblock an artery requiring a repeat of angioplasty or even a bypass operation other manufacturers numbers were not any better but a few months back out of the blue hemotronics a competing company near boston had introduced stents coated with drugs that prevented scarring bmds piece of the billion angioplasty market had plummeted from percent to percent and was still dropping like a stone add to that two titanium joint replacements for arthritis patients that theyd pinned their future onalong with millions in cashstill had at least two years of human trials left before they could hope for fda approval long story short bmd was in a mature product cycle with its most lucrative hospital hardware with nothing major in the pipeline for at least two years they had bet the ranch on the stem cell research at gerex wb i just got last weeks numbers back from the green eyeshade chaps downstairs as you asked i had them refine all the assumptions remember the union contract theres going to be a three percent wage increase for all hourly personnel at the end of the month and we didnt hedge our euro exposure and now its going against us thats my own bloody fault and since we dont have any pricing flexibility in that territory at the moment its like a four percent haircut right off the bottom line remember we ran that in a worstcase scenario a while back well chances are were about to see it for real bartlett had been watching the rate of cash burn and trying not to let the problem be evident the logical thing to do start laying off workers in the fabrication divisions was out of the question if you had a makeorbreak deal cooking you couldnt afford to look like you were on the ropes give me some parameters bartlett said you know weve already hit our credit lines at chase about as hard as we dare without them calling for a review so unless we try to refinance some real property say the flagship building downtownand in this interestrate environment any rational lender would put a gun to our headweve got to ink this deal with cambridge pharmaceuticals in two months max right now were living on borrowed money and its about to be borrowed time too you dont know the half of it bartlett thought im already living on borrowed time whats more if word of the beta gets out we can kiss the buyout adios the adverse publicity and legal problems nobodys going to buy into that kind of liability not cambridge not anybody bernd doesnt know about it yet if he did then hed really be worried bernd take a deep breath were on schedule and weve got to make sure we stay that way get hold of grant and tell him i want him to doublecheck the regulatory situation for the cambridge deal i know he already has but i want a memo from our attorneys by noon tomorrow if there are going to be any roadblocks cropping up we need to know about them now we cant afford to be blindsided he clicked off the phone and tried to think in the confines of a limousine it was hard whats it all for unknown to the worldbut unfortunately known to his wife eileenwinston bartlett had a natural son and that son now in his own career despised bartlett it was one of many sorrows he had long since learned to bear all the same he increasingly regretted that he had made such a botch of their relationship the man who was his natural son had done very well for himself professionally had plenty of drive and in fact bartlett believed he himself deserved some of the credit for that what he had done was let the boy fend for himself which was exactly how bartlett was raised make it with your own two hands how else are you supposed to develop any character and it had worked the pity was he now hated winston bartletts guts but bartlett had begun thinking more and more about a legacy what if he could make peace with that son and bring him into the business right now the closest thing he had to a son was grant hampton and hampton was a little too slick and expedient bartlett knew a goldstandard hustler when he saw one the more he thought about it the more he was convincing himself to make his natural son his sole heir assuming there was anything left to pass on monday april am mr bartlett asked me to give you this kenji noda said handing her a large manila envelope as they stepped off the elevator its a copy of the original plans and also theres a blueprint for the current layout along with measurements she took it looking him over again as she did there was something very fluid about his motions he could have been a dancer there was a softness about him and yet you got an unmistakable sense of inner strength she suspected he had something to do with bartletts incredible collection of japanese katana he looked like he could have a connoisseurs eye she walked into the belowstairs service space and looked around the back part which was the kitchen had stone walls that had been whitewashed there also were two massive fireplaces which she assumed had once housed coalburning stoves large greaseandsootcovered gas ranges were there now but the space was fabulous massive loadbearing columns went down the center and a partition separated the front half of the space from the back the front traditionally would have been the nursery and sewing room in short the maids working quarters she turned to the man bartlett had called ken does mr bartlett have a cook she asked this kitchen doesnt look used no he said actually he almost never dines here and mrs bartlett has her meals delivered from various restaurants though she does go out sometimes as well this was the first time she had heard any mention of eileen bartlett she resides on the top two floors he went on she has her own dining room up there where she takes her meals along with an efficiency kitchen so the bartletts did live completely separate lives that explained a lot okay she said i want to look around and get a feeling for the space and start putting together some ideas she was starting to focus on the job the ceiling was lower than upstairs but still the space had enormous possibilities off the top id probably suggest we open this out remove that dividing wall and make a great room with the right kind of kitchen this could be a marvelous contemporary space for semiformal dining and entertaining assuming she thought winston bartlett actually wanted a renovated space to entertain she still had the nagging suspicion that he just wanted her id use materials that have a really warm tone mix different materials for the different parts of the kitchen and the room she thought the cabinets could be mahogany to echo the extensive use of that wood upstairs and the walls around the stove area and the fireplaces could be an earth colored slate and that look could be accented with polished granite countertops in a slightly darker hue there would need to be a highbtu stove probably a big viking with a slate backsplash all around a couple of stainlesssteel sub zero refrigerators and a large bosch dishwasher could be spaced along in the slate and granite and if bartlett wanted it there could be a place for a temperaturecontrolled wine cellar highend design there also would need to be a large stone islandsay a brandy craigwith a couple of sinks anddepending on what he wantedmaybe another high btu stovetop there she turned to ken if you have something else to do i just need to walk around and live in this space a little then i want to make some notes on the plans possibly take a few photos take your time he said ill be upstairs he disappeared into the elevator with his curious catlike gait and was gone in an instant as she looked around she realized the thing that was missing was light wait a minute she thought there must be a garden at the rear of this building there are windows in the front so why arent there any at the back she turned to examine the back wall it was in fact clearly of recent origin and there was a door at one side she walked over to the door which was locked with a thumb latch and opened it and sure enough behind the building was an unkempt space the width of the building that ran back for a good thirty or thirtyfive feet when she stepped out into the latemorning sunshine and looked at the back of the building she realized there also was a row of windows facing the garden that had been bricked shut what a travesty the whole design would depend on whether those windows could be reopened but if bartlett would allow it then there were tremendous possibilities with all this light you could who the hell are you came a raspy oversmoked voice from behind her are you his new tart we agreed he would never bring his whores here ally turned to see a tall willowy woman who appeared to be in her midsixties she had shoulderlength blond hair clearly out of a bottle and a layer of pancake makeup that looked as though it had been applied by a mortician perhaps it would be helpful if i introduced myself she squeezed past the woman in the doorway and walked over to the counter where she had left her bag she extracted a business card and presented it the woman squinted at it obviously having trouble making out the print i work with the design firm citispace and i was asked by mr bartlett to give him an estimate for some renovations she had quickly acquired the sense that the less said to this woman the better im his wife and i still dont know who the hell you are she squinted at ally a moment then glanced back at the card what is citispace its an interiordesign firm what are you then some kind of decorator she grasped the door to steady herself and ally suddenly wondered if she was slightly tipsy actually what we do is probably closer to architecture ally was collecting her belongings hoping to get out before eileen bartlett decided to do something crazy this is the first ive heard about all this she turned and slammed the rear door mind if i ask you a question ally said do you have any idea why those back windows were bricked over its for security she said no one is ever down here thats obvious ally thought which is why this job is so odd this space clearly isnt being used now and the social dynamic here doesnt bode well for a lot of cozy entertaining and dinner parties in the foreseeable future so why is he spending money to renovate and in this big hurry and he just happened to pick me to do this as an audition for designing an entire museum no this whole thing definitely does not compute but of course it does the job is a blatant bribe to butter me up for something look miss whoeveryouare i want you to leave i dont appreciate strange women walking around unescorted in my house im going right now perhaps you should speak to mr bartlett and decide together what you want to do about this space ill tell you right now what i want to do nothing for all i know hes fixing this up so he can move in some tart weve lived here for twentyeight years and hes never done anything down here so why is that tightfisted sob suddenly deciding to renovate that would be an excellent question to ask him youre screwing him arent you she demanded wrinkled brow furrowed and dim eyes seething like that other little whore of his thats why he hired you well let me tell you something ill outlive you both without another word she turned and got into the elevator chapter monday april pm hey how did it go jennifer asked the minute ally came in the door she wasnt sure she knew the answer to that initially the job looked like a lot of fun but now she felt the interpersonal dynamics of working in bartletts home were already a problem even before she started also maybe it was just paranoia but as she took the cab downtown from the mansion on gramercy park she got the impression that somebody was following her in a black suv and the stress of that brought on a tightness in her chest but as she neared their office in soho the vehicle abruptly veered east she had a nitro tab at the ready but she didnt have to pop it theres good news and bad news the good news is hes practically handing us a sweetheart of a job and dangling anotherdesigning a whole museumin our face the bad news is i dont know why he suddenly thinks were so terrific i mean you and i know that but how did he figure it out jennifer looked puzzled you mean he oh did i mention that his crazy wife showed up after he left and essentially accused me of being a hooker i suppose that comes under the heading of bad news great does that mean shes going to start secondguessing whatever we do the communication channels between mr bartlett and mrs bartlett dont appear to be all that great they live on different floors in his placewhich really is a huge old mansion on gramercy park by the wayand the job would be in his part the lower level she explained the bartletts living arrangements he wants to redo the gardenlevel floor it was originally the servants quarters like upstairs downstairs so hes upstairs and shes way upstairs and lets hope she stays there ally fetched herself a cup of coffee checked in with everybody to see how they were doing and then settled herself at her computer she had the latest program in computeraided design cad and she wanted to program in the dimensions and layout of the space and since she had a copy of the blueprints the first thing she would do would be to run them through her flatbed scanner and incorporate them into the program she didnt get a chance to take any digital photos with citispaces snazzy and expensive new nikon but if the job went forward thered be plenty of time later everybodys computers were connected to the net via a broadband dsl hookup and they were never turned off because of that the computers were vulnerable to being hacked so jen had installed a firewall program to keep out snoops she sat down and stared at the screen saver which was an everchanging series of tropical beaches at sunset she sipped at her coffeethis was the one cup she allowed herself each day always saved for the moment when she felt she needed to be most alertand reached to turn on the scanner the tightness in her chest that she had momentarily experienced in the cab had completely disappeared and she felt perfectly normal what was she going to do about her mother and the clinic in new jersey nina certainly appeared to want to go and with the inevitability of what lay in store for someone with earlyonset alzheimers taking her out there was surely worth doing but as for her own heart she wasnt so sure she thought the reward was worth the risk but shed decided to hold off on a decision till she could have a firsthand look at the institute she took another sip of coffee and then tapped the keyboard when she did that the screen would normally bring up the desktop but not this time a file was open and she was certain she hadnt left it open whats this jen could you come here a minute theres something funny the first page of the file that had been pulled up and opened was an id photo of herself this is what was running has somebody been fooling around with this computer jennifer looked puzzled when she saw it not that i know of then how did this get she just sat staring i didnt open this file does this thing have a mind of its own about eight years ago kate gillis at manhattan propertieswith whom ally had an occasional afterwork drink told her shed scanned all her vital personal documents into her computer at home shed said it was an easy way to make a safety backup seemed like a good idea so ally had stored a copy of her birth certificate her drivers license all her credit cards her passport a set of medical records even the mortgage on her apartment shed even scanned in an id photo just for the heck of it she also suggested to grant that he do the same brilliant right well maybe not the reason was shed routinely made an updated copy on a zip disk and then copied it onto this computer here in the office like a second backup i had everything ready for you for your meeting with bartlett so nobody here has touched your computer this morning jennifer furrowed her brow could somebody have picked the locks and come in last night and done this like a prank or something come on thats totally farfetched she was trying to imagine how somebody could have gotten in and out and left no trace impossible this must just be something stupid i did when i came down yesterday after seeing mom i dont remember it but i guess i was pretty tired ive never seen you that tired jens right she thought i was on the citys web site checking the department of buildings housing code but i certainly didnt pull up my personal data computers do strange things but to open a data file for no reason that would require a higher intelligence right jen youre our resident computer expert we leave these things hooked up all the time i know we have a firewall but what are the chances that somebody could defeat it somehow and hack into our computers jennifer was a software whiz and she had all the designs for all the clients on their cad system which they used to create a virtualreality space and allow clients to walk through well thats entirely possible our firewall software is over a year old let me take a look maybe i can reverseengineer what happened if somebody went through pulling up files i might be able to figure it out ally relinquished her chair and stood staring as jennifer started checking the firewall it was scary to think that some stranger could know everything about you but on the other hand what difference could it make she had nothing to hide still it was creepy her social security and credit card information was in that file could that be shit ally youre not going to believe this whoever did this was damned good weve been seriously hacked how do you know she bent over to look our firewall software has been disabled in fact the actual program was uninstalled jesus thats cool i think wed better shut down everybodys internet connection right this minute till we can get some new software thats incredible you mean somebody honey hackers have gotten into microsofts own site even the pentagon so ive heard anything is possible this is not good what are you thinking jen was still staring at the screen and tapping at the keyboard im thinking what a jerk i was i keep all my personal information in that file like a safety backup in case my apartment burned down or something scanned it in my passport drivers license credit cards medical records everything jennifer looked puzzled you can just cancel the credit cards as for the rest of the stuff what could anybody possibly want with it i dont know jen i dont even know if we were hacked by somebody who wants to find out about me or just look at our designs she was reflecting that when somebody goes through your files they want the information for a purpose and that purpose couldnt be positive for you or they wouldnt have started their undertaking with a surreptitious act well im going to check around and download a new firewall program right now shit i dont need this ive got enough on my mind already mom wants to go out to a clinic in the wilds of northern new jersey and see a doctor there and the whole thing makes me nervous oh jesus is the place called the dorian institute by any chance how did im such a scatterbrain i took a message for you while you were gone from a dr van de something i think thats the name of the place hes with he wants you to call him back as soon as possible monday april am would she call back karl van de vliet had to believe she would but nothing in this world was sure on the nineteeninch screen of his office ibm he was scrolling the medical file that hed downloaded earlier that morning how grant hampton got his hands on it he didnt know and didnt want to know yes alexa hampton would be perfect she had aortic valve stenosis well along the same condition that had precipitated the coronary destruction that took camille from him it was the great tragedy of his life he studied the charts carefully trying to assure himself he was making the right choice what if the stem cell procedure on her heart didnt work to fail would mean he couldnt have saved camille after all that was actually the main reason hed kept putting it off he didnt want to know if he couldnt have rescued her but alexa hampton was the obvious candidate her clinical condition had deteriorated to the point that at some level you might even say she had nothing to lose by undergoing an experimental procedure and she was perfect in another way as well other than her heart condition which she could do nothing about she was in excellent physical shape her last blood pressure was over and her pulse was she clearly had been exercising which had been both good and bad for her heart though on balance probably a plus in fact it was indicative of a strong fighting spirit which was often the best prognosticator of all he looked up to see dr debra connolly walking in he had just paged her she was an md who had been his personal research assistant during her grad school days at stanford now she was a full and valued member of the research team just turned thirty she also was a smashing blonde fivenine with a figure that would stop traffic even in her white lab smock she held van de vliet in the reverence always bestowed on a brilliant beloved mentor hi deb i wanted you to take a look at this he indicated the screen she knew all about the beta and what had happened to kristen the syndrome but she didnt know about the plan to subject alexa hampton to two procedures at once one for her aortic valve stenosis and another to develop antibodies to combat the looming side effects of the beta in winston bartlett this is the patient i was telling you about i wanted you to see this lets pray she signs on for the trials because she looks like she could be perfect in a lot of ways but if she doesnt call back he told himself what am i going to do what am i looking at debra asked scrolling the page is this what i think it is its her medical history how did you get it she turned back did she send it no deb and i dont think you really want to know somehow i think i probably should she looked again at the screen were in this together all i know is i got an email from grant hampton and this was an attachment she must have been keeping it on a computer somewhere i understand hes her brother but how he got it i have no idea he said were not supposed to let her know we have it how recent this final battery of tests is less than two weeks old he said pointing to the date on the corner of the page then he scrolled take a look at her highspeed ct scan see that degenerative calcification there now look at the same test last year he scrolled past a number of pages see he tapped the screen then scrolled back to the first image over the past year theres been a significant buildup shes madeto order for the clinical trials and there was another reason he wanted her which he was reluctant to admit to himself there was a photo of alexa hampton in her medical files and something about her reminded him of camille her eyes had a lot of spirit they made you want to root for her it was nothing short of ironic that this woman had the exact same medical condition that took the life of camille who had been at his side during the early stages of the research that now might provide a cure but for camille it had come too late it was more than ironic it was heartbreaking now though to save alexa hampton would be a kind of circular recompense he took a last look then closed the file does she want to be in the clinical trials theres not much time left wed have to get her i just left a message at her office he said revolving around in his chair grant has talked to her and so has wb this very morning shes aware that time is of the essence but theres no guarantee shell do it he glanced at his mute phone if she didnt call back today he had a feeling that winston bartlett might just have her seized and brought to the institute by force i see that her blood type is ab debra said extremely rare funny she should notice he thought is she going to put it together thats the same as bartletts blood type she continued interesting coincidence huh right youre already fond of her arent you deb asked finally he detected the usual tinge of rivalry seeping into her voice without even meeting her dear god he thought dont start that its the same with every attractive female patient under the age of fifty i dont have time for games now the truth was karl van de vliet was turned on by debra connolly what redblooded primate wouldnt be but she was half his age and to act on that attraction would be to guarantee trouble he had enough to worry about without a lab romance besides he was still thinking about camille theyd had the kind of longlasting thickandthin love debra would never understand however she did sufficiently understand the problems with the beta procedure and the syndrome so he had to flirt back she had to be kept on the reservation feign an interest but not enough for it to go anywhere deb shes just an ideal fit for the study thats all nothing more the stem cell procedure for her stenosis should go forward with only minimal risk there was every reason to hope he could rejuvenate the tissue in alexas left ventricle it was merely an extrapolation of the kind of heart procedure that had worked such a wonder for emma rosen the real challenge was simultaneously attempting the beta related procedure the trick was to stimulate the development of antibodies through a moderate dosage of the special beta enzyme tempering it enough that it didnt go critical and begin replicating uncontrollably the way it had in kristen and probably very soon in wb not so low as to be inoperative but not so high that it would go out of control the goldilocks dosage not too much not too little the problem was he wasnt absolutely sure what that dosage was should he tell alexa hampton the full story about what he was doing about the beta that ethical question he had decided he would leave to grant hampton bartletts hustler of a cfo it was his sister after all presumably hed tell her whatever she needed to know to make an informed decision let the responsibility be on his head the phone on his desk finally rang chapter monday april pm stone aimes was floating through cyberspace through the massive data pages of the national institutes of health since the gerex corporation had a complete clampdown on their clinicaltrial results he was attempting an end run by going to the source he was hoping he could find out whether or not karl van de vliets experiments with stem cell technology were succeeding he needed that information to finish his book and he hoped that the remainder of the advance could be used to pay for his daughter amys private school in new york if he got it in time he was dreaming of a life in which she could come back to live with him at least part of the year sometimes particularly days like thismonday was his official day offhe couldnt avoid the fact he was incredibly lonely but first things first he had gone to the section that described the many and varied clinical trials the nih had under way then he used scrambled eggs the entry protocol given to him by dale coverton to circumvent security on the site and get him into the secondlevel nih data files he was hoping to find the names of patients who had gone through the gerex stem cell procedure and could be interviewed it really wasnt all that difficult or evenhe told himselfunethical to get in this far no big deal entry protocols were available to any highlevel nih employee who had the right security grade now he was poking through the reams of proprietary data that the gerex corporation had submitted to initiate the clinical trials it was one of the more ambitious studies hed ever seen not in numbers of patients necessarily but certainly in scope they were indeed running stagethree clinical trials of their stem cell procedure on a variety of maladies there was no doubleblind placebo you either were cured or you were not jesus it was incredible they were shooting for nothing less than the unified field theory of medicine aiming not just to patch some failing element of the human body but to regenerate entire organs among their stated objectives were building pancreatic islets reconstructing the ventricles of the heart reconstituting the damaged livers of individuals with advanced cirrhosis they were also accepting patients with alzheimers and parkinsons christ he said scrolling past page after page how come theyre suddenly so secretive about this if van de vliet had achieved results in just a fraction of those trials it would herald the beginning of a new age in medicine the nih monitor for the gerex trials was cheryl gates just as dale had said her photo was featured along with the introductory description of the trials nicelooking he thought probably late thirties dark hair darkrimmed glasses she wasnt wearing much makeup in the photo probably to emphasize how serious she was sooner or later he told himself he had to find a way to meet her he stared at his ibm aptiva screen a moment longer overwhelmed at what he was seeing then got up and walked into the kitchen and made a peanut butter sandwich whole wheat it was a rehearsal for the possibly hard times to come then he retrieved a brooklyn lager from the fridge it was his day off and the sun was over the yardarm he lived on the fourth floor of a brownstone in yorkville in new yorks east eighties the apartment was small but it was rent stabilized which meant he was paying well under market value a month on a place that probably could go for close to twice that on the open market hed lucked into it after he and jane spliteven though they werent married theyd bought a condo in the west fifties and at the breakup theyd switched the mortgage to her namebut the problem now was how was he going to pay even this piddling rent not to mention child support for amy after he got fired from the sentinel that day he sensed was fast approaching and if it happened before the book was finished he was just three months away from going back to freelancing that was how long his nest egg would last carrying the sandwich and beer he walked back to his office a corner of the cramped living room that had an early american desk and sat down at the frayed chair in front of his ibm so here he was past the first level of security of the nih site zeroed in on the gerex clinical trials somewhere here had to be all the data about the patients who had been and currently were participating he moved on to the results section and opened the first page yes then he looked more closely hello weve got a problem the patient data he was looking at had only code numbers for names the categories of trials also were just numbers without a key there was no way to get a single patient name or differentiate alzheimers from fallen arches then he saw the notice at the top of the page as part of the nih policy on privacy all patient data are aggregated and anonymous shit this was as far as scrambled eggs would take him he needed a higher security protocol to get into individualcase data dale either didnt have it or didnt dare give it out well he thought at least ive got information on the structure of the clinical trials i should print that before the system realizes its been hacked he clicked on the print icon let the games begin his real objective was to try to wangle an interview with karl van de vliet an interview that would have to be approved by winston bartlett maybe what could be gleaned from this level of the nih site would be enough to bluff bartlett into thinking he knew more than he really did in truth interviewing discharged patients would have meant anecdotal information probably not rigorous enough for use in a definitive book but at the moment that would have been a start he lifted the first printed page and studied it stone aimes had seen enough clinical trials over the years to know that the data were reported according to an established schedule obviously the schedule was always adapted to fit the nature of the trials under way but studies that produce the kind of shortterm results gerex hinted at in their early press releasesbefore they clammed upwould probably have a tight reporting schedule possibly even weekly he stared at the page for a moment then lifted out another he wasnt sure just yet what it all meant but he might be able to infer something he was still puzzling over the columns of numbers as the data finished printing what was it telling him he went back and clicked on study procedures this section explained how the reporting was structured he still held out hope that the names of the discharged patients in the clinical trials could be accessed somehow in the past when the fda tested drugs it often happened that the names of the participants were not revealed to the monitor or to anybody the policy was intended to preserve the privacy of study participants but lately it had been under review all that secrecy and nonaccountability had permitted some spectacular fabrication of test data surely the nih had taken this into consideration by now and come up with a system whereby the identities of the participants could be checked and verified that information had to be stored somewhere no such luck it appeared the nih had begun using a modified version of the new fda sunshine policy nih clinical trials had a one week of sunshine provision during which the suitability of test subjects could be evaluated by a review procedure during that time their real identity was in the database but after that the identity information of any patient actually selected for inclusion in the clinical trials was encodedwhere thenceforth it could only be accessed through a lengthy legal process screwed again at this late date the gerex corporation surely was not going to be adding any new names and giving them that week of sunshine according to press releases at the beginning of the clinical trials when gerex was a lot more communicative at this date the entire study should be just days away from being wrapped up he went back to the patient files one last time out of frustration as he continued to scroll he noticed that although the identities of patients and crucial personal data were encrypted the dates on which they entered and finished the trials were all supplied hmmm it was actually more detailed than that there were dates for when a patient entered each stage of the procedure screening initial evaluation admitted into program procedure under way procedure monitoring results evaluation patient release patient followup the time between screening and patient release averaged around five weeks six weeks at most looking at the timesequenced data you couldnt avoid the conclusion that the clinical trials had been a spectacular success no doubt the specific data would reveal whether there had been any adverse reactions but as clinical trials go these seemed to have been without major incident he had a nose for trouble and these looked as rigorous as clockwork hold on a second thats odd what the data structure did not have was a category for termination yet one of the patients had been listed with dates leading up to and including procedure under way but after that the patient was noted parenthetically as having been terminated that was all the information given what could that mean he leaned back with a sigh and pulled on his brooklyn lager okay patients frequently got dropped from clinical trials because some underlying condition suddenly manifested itself and made them unsuitable trial subjects in fact that was preferable to keeping them in a study when they were no longer appropriate but the thing about clinical trials was there always had to be a compelling fully explained reason for terminating a test subject otherwise you could just terminate nonresponsive participants and skew the results no reason was given here he thought again about the one week of sunshine and as a long shot checked to see if anyone had been admitted this week nada but again that was reasonable the entire study was wrapping up which meant in short that he had nothing to work with in terms of people all he had were dates and encrypted names what now he finished the beer and was preparing to go offline when a dropdown screen flickered new data he was being directed to the new applicants sunshine page he clicked back then stared at the screen a name had appeared he couldnt believe his luck for some unknown reason they must still be adding new test subjects at this late date in the trials nina hampton finally he had a name this was an incredible stroke of wait a second name was appearing now the letters popping up one by one as they were being typed in he rolled the mouse to print and felt his hopes surge then his heart skipped a beat the second name was alexa hampton jesus could it be no way too big a coincidence but wait the other was nina hampton isnt that the name of her brit mum that unredeemable piece of work impossible if it was the ally hampton he knew she was a woman he still thought of every day it went back to when they were both undergraduates she was taking a degree in architecture at columbia and he had just switched from premed to the columbia school of journalism wasnt there a cole porter lyric about an affair being too hot not to cool down they undoubtedly were in love but they both were too strongwilled to cede an inch of personal turf it was a combustible situation when they decided to go their own way it was done under the agreement that they would make a clean break and never see each other again be adult and hold your head high and look to the future no recriminations and no second thoughts in respecting that agreement he had gone out of his way not to keep track of her he particularly didnt want to know if shed gotten married had a family any of it thinking back now he remembered that she had had some kind of heart condition she refused to talk about it and now he couldnt remember exactly what it was but that could possibly explain her entry into the clinical trials though it didnt clarify why she was only being added now at the last minute if it was actually her and if so how would he feel talking to her he hoped time had mellowed her though he somehow doubted it not ally what an irony if it was the same alexa hampton she could end up being his entree into the secretive world of winston bartletts gerex corporation the trouble was he wasnt sure he actually wanted to see her again even after all the years the wounds still felt fresh he closed out the nih file and opened people search which he often used to look up phone numbers he started with new york state as a criterion the names alexa and nina undoubtedly belonged to women so they might be listed merely by their initials but start with alexa and be optimistic he got lucky three names and phone numbers popped up one was in manhattan and ally was a dyedinthewool new yorker but he wasnt sure he was psychologically prepared to speak to her that number he decided to save for last though it was by far the most plausible the next alexa hampton lived in syracuse with area code he was still shook up as he dialed the number yeah whos this sure didnt sound like ally but he was playing this straight as a reporter he always started a conversation by identifying himself so naturally he answered stone aimes new york sentinel the fuck you want came the voice it was female but it definitely was not ladylike i dont need any newspapers whoa that definitely didnt sound like ally she was direct but she didnt talk like a sailor sorry maam i have a few questions about your participation in some clinical trials sorry to bother you but i have a deadline shouldnt take a minute you a fucking reporter im doing a story on the gerex corporation are you the what corporation the fuck you talking about seems like im calling the wrong number im very sorry and i apologize listen if youre some kind of weirdo im going to call the cops and have this call traced i said i apologize he hung up and thought about another beer this was beginning to feel like the moment but he resisted the urge and called the next number come on be the right one and dont be ally this one had a area code that meant long island hello came a rusty old voice that had to be in its seventies it sounded oversmoked and just hanging on again definitely not the ally he knew hello maam he said im sorry to bother you but are you trying to sell me something young man the woman asked its not going to do you much good i live on a social security check and its all i can do to make ends meet as is you sound nice but no maam im a newspaper reporter im doing a story on i just wanted to follow up on your admission to the clinical trials for the gerex corporation he felt a surge of hope it wasnt ally but she did sound like a woman who might well be a candidate for medical treatment do you know what day you plan to start what on earth are you talking about she asked young man its ill manners to start asking a body silly questions no matter how nice you might be otherwise ive never heard of this whatever you called it corporation click she sure didnt sound like a patient or maybe she was too far gone to even know if she was a patient or not in any case this was not a promising lead okay he thought go with the one you should have in the first place blast he wanted this to be the one but he just didnt want it to be ally or maybe he did he took a deep breath and punched in the last number which had a manhattan area code the phone at the other end rang five times and then an answering machine came on at this hour she would most likely be at work hello this is alexa hampton im sorry i cant come to the phone now but if youll leave your name and number ill get back to you as soon as possible if youre calling about design work the number of citispace is he felt his heart flip then sink it was ally it was a voice he had heard for years in his reveriesor were they the nightmares of roads not taken she still might not be the new patient in the clinical trials but at least he knew he could reach her the sound of her voice after all this time he didnt realize it would still affect him the way it did so he thought clearing his head shes running a design business now he wondered how that had happened the last time he saw her she was a singleminded student of architecture intensely focused no message dont leave a message it probably would freak her out actually it might freak them both out assuming she was the new patient how the hell did ally get involved with winston bartlett it probably would have something to do with that heart condition she didnt like to talk about he clicked off the phone and settled it onto the desk then he glanced again at the computer screen and decided to go back to the nih files the other woman nina he would look up later allys brit mum must be getting on by now but still it was hard to imagine anything being wrong with her as he remembered nina the woman was well nigh indestructible when he got back to the nih web site and went to the sunshine page it was again blank the two new names nina hampton and alexa hampton were not there anymore they must have been entered immediately into the clinical trials but why now if van de vliet kept to the original schedule the trials would be over in a matter of days maybe he thought this was a momentary screwup i just happened to be at the right place at the right fleeting moment when somebody somewhere was entering those names maybe some nih bureaucrat hit the wrong key on a keyboard someplace in maryland but it was the break hed been waiting for he turned off the ibm and headed for the fridge and another brooklyn lager ally ally ally can it be you this is so weird worse than that it was painful there was that immortal line from casablanca of all the gin joints in all she walks into mine why you dear god coming back he sat down took a long hit on the icy bottle and reached for the phone chapter monday april pm as she hung up ally wondered again what she was getting into but she did want to meet this miracle worker the kind of thing van de vliet was talking about sounded as much like science fiction as anything shed ever heard still his voice was reassuring even mesmerizing and there seemed no reason not to at least check out the dorian institute firsthand but then what help she looked at her coffee cup and wished she dared have a refill but that much caffeine always made her heart start to act up and maybe she didnt need it the conversation with karl van de vliet had energized her and sharpened her senses quite enough she was still thinking about that when the phone rang again there was an electronic voice directory but her own phone was the default if a caller did not care to use it citispace hi ally tell me if you recognize the voice just please dont hang up who was it the intonations were bouncing around somewhere in the back of her brain as though they were a computer file looking for a match the one her unconscious mind was making was being rejected by her conscious mind then finally the match came through and stuck my god it couldnt be the last time shed talked to him was what almost two decades ago the irony was shed been thinking about him some lately as part of taking stock of her life shed been meditating over all the roads not taken and hed been the last man shed actually loved or thought she loved before steve what how did she found she was at a loss for words she figured hed have been the same way if shed called him out of the blue hey this isnt easy for me either but i have a pretty good reason for breaking our vow of silence she was immediately flooded with mixed emotions stone aimes she already knew he wrote for the sentinel or at least she assumed the irreverent reporter by that name who did their medical column was him the tone sounded so much like the way she remembered him there was a lot of passion and he was always editorializing against big medicine he had plenty of raw courage but sometimes he had too much edge that was one quality he had that had eventually gotten to be nerveracking back when they were together now in hindsight she remembered their breakup with both anger and regret she was angry that even though she tried like hell she could never really connect with him at the level she yearned for he always seemed to be holding something back some secret he was afraid to divulge truthfully they both were grand masters at never allowing vulnerability in short they were overly alike they shared the same flaws still after steve was taken away it was hard not to think of stone now and then before steve stone was the only sane lover shed ever been close to but she also knew the bit about letting sleeping dogs lie sometimes that was the better part of wisdom this conversation she finally decided was just going to open old wounds better to nip it right now and add to that she didnt actually know if he was free now or not or what but hed said he had a good reason for callingwhat could that be stone i read your columns in the sentinel so i sort of feel like ive kept in contact i can almost hear your voice sometimes that makes me think you were cheating a little on our deal well she heard herself say some of them were pretty good sometimes you sounded like you knew as much as a doctor dont flatter me excessively or i might want to start believing you he laughed but speaking of doctors didnt you used to have some kind of heart issue how is that these days you really want to know maybe it might have something to do with why im calling best i recall you never actually told me even back when thank you for asking she said i guess its not much of a secret anymore with me popping nitro every other day i have a scarred valve coronary stenosis and its not getting any better i dont know what to do about it short of going to lourdes for a miracle i see he said then he fell silent mercifully he didnt come up with false bravado about revolutionary treatments and you never can tell blah blah blah then he said so is that why youve enrolled in the clinical trials at the dorian institute to be part of their work using stem cells what how the hell do you know about hey ally you know i cant divulge my sources after i knew you i grew up to be a real reporter that was my grand plan remember then this may turn out to be a very short conversation i have nothing to okay okay lets start over he paused and cleared his throat ahem are you the alexa hampton who was formally entered about half an hour ago into the stagethree clinical trials for the national institutes of health being held by the gerex corporation or maybe i should play dumb and begin by asking if youve ever heard of them stone why why are you asking me this it was bizarre how could he know and wait a minute what did he mean about enrolling she hadnt enrolled in anything ally im finishing a majori hopebook about stem cell technology and right now the world leader is the gerex corporation i think but i cant yet prove that their dorian institute out in new jersey is the site of some pretty incredible stuff i was fooling around on the internet on the nih web site looking for information about them andit must have been some momentary computer glitchsomeone with your name popped up for a second along with a nina hampton which made me suspect it was you she was incredulous she was being entered into the clinical trials before she had even seen the place somebody was pushing the pace winston bartlett or van de vliet had taken it for granted that she and her mother would enter the trials worst of all it took a former lover she hadnt talked to in xzillion years to give her this unnerving information nina is your mom right he went on i still remember her fondly i dont think she thought much of me however by the way how is she shes shes not doing all that great ally was still trying to get her mind around what shed just heard but why are you calling me stone if anything ive said rings a vague bell then could we meet someplace and talk i dont think it would be a great idea to do it over the phone thats all i really can say now maybe she thought stone aimes might have uncovered a few things of which she ought to be aware his pieces in the sentinel showed he was a damned good reporter i dont think what little i know about gerex would be any help to you she was attempting to get her mind back together i actually have a lot of questions about the stem cell procedure myself i spoke on the phone just now with dr van de vliet and he described their technology to me in general terms but maybe i should interview you maybe you could explain it to me using that wonderful gift you have for simplification in your columns ally i dont know anything except whats in the public domain theyre privately held so they dont have to tell anybody zilch i assume youve actually been out to the dorian institute which is more than i can say never but youre enrolled im not enrolled in anything to say the least and it bothers me that anybody thinks so but i am thinking about taking mom out there tomorrow if she still wants to go when i talked to him on the phone dr van de vliet wanted me to start the procedure immediately thats scary but he does seem to know what hes doing i take it then that youre leaning toward going through with it she hated the way hed just made her sound so gullible the truth is im more concerned for mom he claims he can help her earlyonset alzheimers and that would mean a lot why was she telling him all this stuff she found herself wondering if hed ever married im so sorry to hear that but the chances are he can what are you thinking she asked finally and why did you call me really whats going on i dont know yet theres a lot i dont know he seemed to hesitate ally is there any chance whatsoever thatwhile youre out thereyou could get me the names of some of the people whove been through the clinical trials the dorian institute is entirely offlimits to the press i tried several times to schedule an interview with karl van de vliet the guy you talked to but no luck i cant get past the corporate people my only hope is to try and find some patients whove been treated and released whove completed the clinical trials but gerex has been ruthless about keeping their identities secret you are literally the first person ive found who has any connection with the institute and is willing to talk about it that is if youre willing stone it would be like the blind leading the blind i dont know the first thing about the place well let me ask you thiswhen you were talking with him did van de vliet happen to mention any occasion where a subject had been terminated from the trials it never came up why do you never mind but when and if you go out there you might inquire about that he paused dont get me wrong im actually gerexs biggest fan i mean considering merely what you told me that theyre claiming to have a procedure that treats earlyonset alzheimers think about it im rooting for your mom sure but thats a nobel prize in itself right there were talking major medical history in the making and and i want to publish the first book about it he paused also a little birdie tells me that something not entirely kosher may be going on out there no proof just a reporters hunch theres a little too much sudden secrecy ally was having a strange feeling come over her she was actually enjoying talking to him shit stone im glad you called i lost two men i loved very much since i knew you and im feeling very alone at the moment i could use some moral support ive got a lot of people bugging me to enter those clinical trials even people id never met before like winston bartlett the new york big shot hes suddenly very concerned about my health i have no idea what thats about but it makes me uneasy there was an awkward lull then ally all im asking is that you just take the measure of the dorian institute when youre out there and tell me what you think about the place are they performing the miracles they announced as their objective look ill help you when and if i actually can so give me your number okay he did i can tell when im being blown off he went on i have a very sensitive blowoff detector but why dont you try a test when youre out at the institute ask van de vliet or somebody why that mystery patient was terminated from the clinical trials see if the question makes them uncomfortable why does that matter so much to you if a patient is dropped for no good reason about the same time they clamp down on information i think it could be fishy beyond that i cannot speculate and while youre at it id love the names of some other expatients anybody i found a list on the nih web site but theyre all encoded so it doesnt do me any good i just want to ask them if the procedure worked or not its information thats going to be made public eventually no matter what come on ally dont you want some testimonials okay look ill try to see if anybody there will give me any info she was realizing she was in a comfort zone when she was talking to him still so much about him remained a mystery he had always said his mother and father were both dead but it was still suspiciously hard to get him to speak about them shed gotten the impression that he didnt actually remember his father that was the part of his life that hed always been the most closed off about either that or he was repressing some horrible memories thanks a lot ally a pause then interested in getting together sometime let me think about it she put down the phone with her mind in turmoil she realized she hadnt asked him if he was attached but the next time they spoke she was going to try to ease it into the conversation chapter tuesday april am ally steered her toyota onto the ramp leading to the george washington bridge the entryway to northern new jersey she was just finishing a phone call to jennifer she wanted her to take a look at the notes and blueprints for bartletts gramercy park project and scan them into their cad program after all the phone calls yesterday shed been too sidetracked to do it although bartlett had declared he wasnt in any hurry he had messengered a certified check to her office monday afternoon the project was a go she wanted to get moving while everything was fresh in her mind before leaving her apartment this morning shed downloaded a map from mapquest and from it she had estimated that the drive up to the dorian institute would be approximately an hourgive or take she had begun the trip early because her mothers mind had been lucid the previous evening and she was hoping that interlude might last into this morning unfortunately it had not nina was sitting next to her now in full makeup but completely unresponsive seemingly in another world when ally arrived at the riverside drive apartment to pick her up marianow silent and uneasy in the backseat reading a spanish novelmet her at the door with a troubled look and shook her head sadly miss hampton i know she was all right when you were here last night but this morning she may not recognize you shell most likely snap out of it and be okay later on but right now shes just in a fog it was all i could do to get her ready when ally walked in nina was sitting in her favorite chair dressed in her favorite black suit her makeup was perfect thank you maria hey sweetie you look great nina stared at her as though trying to place the face and said nothing she just looked confused and very very sad dear god ally thought this is the first time shes completely failed to recognize me it was so disheartening last night when ally had come up to discuss whether or not she still wanted to explore dr van de vliets experimental treatment nina had been completely cognizant ally had tried to explain the concept of neural tissue regeneration using stem cells which was difficult since she barely understood it herself mom she had said this might be something that could reverse some of the damage to your memory at least keep it from getting worse i know it sounds scary but everybody says the conventional treatments for what you have dont work very well or very long then lets go out there and talk to him honey just come in the morning and take me by then ill probably forget everything youve said tonight how prescient ally thought sadly now nina was just gazing blankly ahead silent does she remember anything from last night for that matter what was nina thinking now was she conscious of the fact she was losing her mind and what about the ultimate question do we want to live longer merely to be alive or do we want to stay alive in order to do things to be or to do in her mothers case she knew it was the latter nina had always been full of life ambition and projects would she want to go on living if none of those things were possible you never know for sure about other people even your own mother but ally suspected she would rather not live to see that day now though was she even aware it was coming ally thought back about the first signs nina hadnt yet turned sixtyfive when she abruptly started having trouble remembering little things she began forgetting where shed put items and she gave up on remembering phone numbers and dates initially it had just seemed like a lot of senior moments run together very puzzling but then it got worse shed always loved music and shed always played the piano she loved chopin especially the nocturnes by the time she was sixtysix however she was having trouble remembering the names of her favorite composers she also completely gave up trying to play either from memory or with the music when getting dressed one day she put on her blouse completely backwards it was bad ally had taken her to see four different specialists and they all had concluded that nina hampton suffered from what was known as familial earlyonset alzheimers it was caused by a mutated gene and was extremely rare representing only some percent of all alzheimers cases there were two major drugs currently on the market exelon and reminyl that could relieve some of the symptoms of alzheimers by boosting the action of the brain chemical acetylcholine however nina had not yet declined to the stage where doctors would prescribe those drugs to resort to them was an admission you were at endgame since they usually were effective only for a few months so the dorian institute might well be a long shot worth taking frankly whats to lose this morning she knew was going to be difficult if nina wanted to stay and checked in there would surely be a pile of paperwork ally had had the foresight to acquire power of attorney for her mother three months earlier and shed brought along that document in case it might be needed and maria the wonderful ultimate caregiver was there to help the real challenge however might well be trying to help nina understand what was going on and participate in the decision this was the moment every child dreads when you have to face really face a parents mortality as the green forests of northern new jersey began to envelop them she slipped a cd of bach partitas for unaccompanied violin into the cd player she had loved to play them all her life but now dr ekelman had urged her to put her violin into storage hearing the violin now reminded her of the other purpose of the trip the treatment decision she needed to make for herself in that regard one of the things that kept running through her mind was what stone aimes had said about the gerex corporation instituting a news blackout simultaneously with a patient being mysteriously dropped from the trials those concurrent facts did not need to be ominous but they also could use an explanation what was she going to do was van de vliets stem cell procedure on her heart really worth the risk she honestly didnt know even though the violin had temporarily been taken away from her she had hopes she could gradually get it back there were other ways to try to strengthen a dysfunctional heart well she thought wait and hear him out from the george washington bridge she had taken which turned into and now the green forest held sway it felt like shed gone through a time warp from the beginning of the twentyfirst century to the end of the eighteenth then finally as the second partita was ending the icycold greenwood lake came into view it was associated with those long finger lakes gouged out by glaciers driving past remnants of the last ice age she reflected on how insignificant humans are in the scheme of things suddenly she thought of aldous huxleys novel after many a summer dies the swan about a wealthy madman whod discovered a way to prolong life by eating the entrails of prehistoric fish maybe it was seeing the lake that made her flash on that she was now on greenwood lake road which passed around the west side and there were numbers on several gated driveways as she passed along she suspected the place would be somewhere along the middle of the lakeshore and she was right after a few miles she came to a discreet sign announcing the dorian institute and a large iron gate that protected a paved roadway leading into a forest of trees that was it just forest no hint of a building though she saw signs of some kind of industrial park farther down the road when she drove up to the gate she realized there was a video camera and a twoway intercom when she reached out of the window and pushed the talk button she heard good morning and then the gates parted in the middle and slid back they must be expecting us she thought and drove through the road was cobblestone or rough paving brick it wound among the trees for approximately half a mile and then widened there framed by the lake in the background was a magnificent threestory building with eight doric columns across the front in perfect greek revival style there were windows at ground level but they were heavily curtained built of red brick the building probably dated from the late nineteenth century and it looked every bit like an ivy league dormitory miss hampton i dont like the feeling im getting about this place maria said quietly it is very cold and formal from the outside but inside i sense a place where there is bad magic in the dominican republic we call it santeria i can always tell these things ally knew and respected marias sixth sense but then maria sometimes still acted like a freshly minted citizen just off a green card and she had an innate suspicion of authority evoking buildings her aversion to the dorian institute might be nothing more than that on the other hand ally was having a bit of the same feeling there was something formidable and foreboding about the place that seemed out of keeping with its supposedly benign purpose she felt a moment of tightness in her chest there was a parking area off to the left and she drove into the nearest slot and turned off her engine this was the moment shed been both anticipating and dreading the clock on the dash read elevenfifteen she was fifteen minutes ahead of the appointed hour okay mom how do you feel nina turned and stared at her uncertainty in her eyes where are we ally i dont recognize anything this is the institute i told you about last night can you remember anything we talked about then this is the place you were didnt you say theres a doctor here who can do something for my memory were both here now to just talk to him she turned to the backseat maria can you get moms purse she nodded then reached hesitantly for the door she was clearly reluctant to get out ally walked around and opened the door for her mother okay mom time to stretch your legs ally held her hand and together they headed across the oval brick driveway birds were chirping around them and she could smell the scent of the lake borne up the hill by a fresh wind then through the trees she saw two women walking up the trail that led down to the lake they were she assumed some of the patients they both looked to be in their early sixties but also athletic and nimble one was wearing nikes and a pale green pantsuit the other had on a blue dress and a white cap and ally realized she must be a nurse shed been taking the other woman out for a stroll they were engrossed in conversation but as they approached the woman ally had decided was on staff looked up and smiled a greeting can i help you she introduced herself and nina and maria the woman smiled again but didnt introduce herself in turn were here to see dr van de vliet ally went on about the trials but were a couple of minutes early and i was wondering if we could look around a bit first im trying to understand what the institute is really like well dear the woman said even those of us who work here arent allowed everywhere you know into the research lab in the basement some places here have to be completely hygienic of course for patients who are in the recovery phase strolling around outside is definitely recommended as long as theyre able but thats getting way ahead of ourselves first well have to check you in theres a lot of paperwork for the clinical trials she seemed puzzled theyre almost over you know but come along and ill let him know youre here hes always down in the lab at this time of the morning its well after his rounds theyre so busy now then she turned to the other woman sophie do you think you can find your way back to your room its number twoeighteen on the second floor remember sophie appeared to be pondering the question for a long moment before she huffed dont be silly i know exactly where it is as she strode on ahead the nurse watched her carefully as though unsure what she might do next she pushed a buzzer at the door and then a man in a white uniform opened it and let her in only after sophie had disappeared through the doorway did the nurse turn back im elise baker please forgive sophie if she seems a little confused her procedure is still under way her procedure what she was diagnosed with parkinsons before she came here shes improved an enormous amount but were not allowed to say so why is that were in clinical trials no one is allowed to discuss our results everyone here had to sign a secrecy agreement now maria was helping nina up the steps the porch with its soaring white doric columns was definitely magisterial the front door however was not wooden or decorative it was solid steel albeit painted white to blend in elise walked to the door which had a video camera mounted above it and a split second later it buzzed signaling it was unlocked this is a lot of security ally thought for a clinic doing research on cells are they worried about spies getting in or patients getting out but the locked steel door was just the beginning of the security next they entered a small room just inside the door with an xray machine to see into purses and parcels the first floor is reception and dining elise explained as she swept through the metal detector there are rooms we call them suitesupstairs for patients and the research lab and offices are in the lower area what what is all this security for ally asked the work here is highly proprietary no one is allowed to bring in any kind of camera or recording equipment the guard dressed in white looked like a retired policeman with perhaps a few too many jelly doughnuts over his career he had a beefy red face and a hefty spare tire but he was certainly alert to his responsibilities eyeing the three newcomers with scarcely disguised suspicion in fact ally sensed a palpable paranoia in the air well she told herself medical research is a highstakes game its understandable they would be concerned about industrial espionage after the security check they went through another steel door and entered the actual lobby the first thing she noticed was a grand staircase leading up to the second floor and then to the third off to the right was a modern elevator with a shiny steel door a number of patients were coming down the stairs and heading for a hallway leading to the back they were mostly women whose ages ranged anywhere from fortyfive to well beyond seventy who are these people ally wondered they must have been sufferers of various kinds of debilitating afflictions but now they were certainly ambulatory if not downright sprightly she wanted to talk to some of them watching them moving along chatting and smiling but this was not the moment at eleventhirty we have meditation in the dining hall elise was saying as she led them through the lobby for those who care to participate and after that a vegetarian lunch is served at twelvethirty sharp then she glanced back after you see dr van de vlietand assuming youre admittedtherell be an orientation and then youre welcome to begin participating fully in our activities actually ally said if people are well enough to be in activities why cant they be outpatients these clinical trials require twentyfourhour supervision elise explained heading for the wide desk in the center of the room now if you would all sign in here at the desk ellen can take you downstairs to the medical reception a darkhaired woman smiled from behind the desk then got up and came around a signin book was there on a steel stand ally finally noticed that light classical music was wafting through the room tchaikovskys swan lake suite you must be ms hampton the woman said and this must be your mother we were told to expect you she nodded a farewell to elise who said it was so nice to meet you good luck she then turned and headed for the back ally signed all three of them in good the woman said as she checked the information my name is ellen ohara by the way im in charge of the nursing staff here were ready to go downstairs now ellen ohara had a knowing earnest face that fairly lit up when she smiled she had short brown hair streaked with gray and was pleasantly fullfigured when they reached the elevator she zipped a small plastic card through the reader on the wall and the doors slid open as they emerged on the lower level ally realized they were in the precincts of a very sophisticated medical laboratory occupying most of the floor was a glassedin area inside of which she could see three men and two women all dressed in white she also noticed rows of steel containers that seemed to be ovens or incubators of some kind as well as racks and racks of vials at the far end of the laboratory there was a blackboard on which one of the men was drawing something that looked like hexagonal molecules linking them together thats dr van de vliet ellen said pointing ill let him know youre here the laboratory is a special environment the entrance there is actually an air lock the air inside is filtered and kept under positive pressure she walked over to a communications module buzzed then announced into the microphone dr vee your eleven thirty appointment is here he turned and stared in their direction then smiled and waved next he walked to a microphone near the center of the room and clicked it on ill be with you in a minute can you please wait in the receiving room and ellen can you start getting them ready of course she nodded then clicked off the microphone and turned receiving is just down at the end of the hall next to his office please come with me she led them through a large wooden door into a room with a retractable metal table covered in white paper and several chairs it was a typical examination room with a device on the wall to monitor blood pressure a stethoscope and other examination paraphernalia if youll kindly take a seat ellen said im sure hell be here as soon as he can in a few minutes at most but while we wait i need to take your temperature and blood pressure and start a chart ally where are we nina asked her face was becoming alarmed and maria reached to comfort her are we in a hospital somewhere yes mom its actually the institute i told you about last night the doctor here wants to see if he can do anything to help you oh she said is he the one you told me about i thought that was just a dream no hes real whether he can help you or not that part is whats still a dream but were all praying she looked around at the pure white walls and wondered again what she was getting into meeting a new specialist in the sterile white cold of an examination room could be frightening in itself god how many times before had she done this as she trudged through hmo hell maria was so unsettled she was deathly pale ellen took their blood pressure and temperature including marias even though she protested mildly half in spanisha sign of how unsettling it was to her ellen had only just finished putting all the numbers on clipboard charts for each of them when karl van de vliet opened the door and strode in chapter tuesday april am he had a high forehead and prominent cheekbones just like in the photo and just as in his photo there was a genuine dichotomy between his face which looked to be early forties and unwrinkled and his gray eyes which were much older that was it that was what seemed odd he was different ages underneath his white lab coat he was wearing a black suit and an opennecked blue shirt ally noticed that his fingers were long and delicate like those of a concert pianist and overall he had a kind of ghostly presence as though he were more spirit than man although he looked exactly as he did in the photograph in the gerex corporation brochure in person there was an added dimension a kind of raw magnetism about him it was more than simply a physicians bedside manner it was the allure of a pied piper the first thing you wanted to ask him was how old are you really maybe the next thing youd want to do was ask him to dinner what had she expected maybe a selfabsorbed nerd researcher in wrinkled stained lab attire anxious to scurry back to his test tubes but in person karl van de vliet was debonair and youthful living proof that his photo wasnt retouched and was recent he had to be twenty years older than she was easily but to look at him youd guess he was close to the same age she was dying to ask him about that but she couldnt think of a polite way to raise the subject she introduced herself we spoke yesterday then she introduced her mother and maria mom and i talked last night about the clinical trials and she said shes interested this morning unfortunately im not sure she remembers what we discussed he placed a hand on ninas shoulder and studied her face as he smiled at her embracing her with his eyes well were going to see what we can do about that arent we mrs hampton ive got a question right up front ally said have we already been entered into the national institutes of health clinical trials he seemed taken aback for a moment caught off guard but then he stepped up to the question as a matter of fact i did take the liberty of authorizing the preliminary nih paperwork for both of you of course it doesnt obligate you in any way the thing is theres a lot of red tape so if you do decide to participate the sooner we get that part started the better on the other hand if you decide not to we can just terminate everything at this preliminary stage and you wont even be part of the official record well ally thought that undoubtedly explains why stone saw our names on the nih web site but why did van de vliet look so funny when i brought it up he focused on nina mrs hampton im dr van de vliet youre a pretty lady and weve had some luck helping other ladies like you honey if i had you in my bedroom then maybe you could help me oh my god ally thought shes about to go ribald on us but thats a sign shes coming out of her funk but then she had another thought maybe nina sensed he was older than he looked like that paranormal perception that told her grant was involved in something evil so far however that particular perception hadnt panned out though grant clearly was up to something maria was mortified she blushed and made a disapproving animal noise low in her throat and turned her face away but van de vliet simply smiled even more broadly mrs hampton i dont think you should be talking that way in front of your daughter he gave her a wink what you and i do together is none of these peoples business but i do think we should consider keeping them informed if only a couple of hints ally found herself wanting just to listen to his voice there was an intelligent warmth about it that reminded her of a kindly professor at columbia a truly gifted architect who also could quote keats and make you cry you wanted to give yourself to him my god she thought how am i going to stand up to this man therere some issues you and i need to discuss he said turning back to ally the first thing i need to do is take a look at mrs hamptons records but whatever they say it wont do any harm to run what we call a mental state examination for her to establish a general baseline of cognitive impairment as of now how long will that take actually ellen can start in just a few minutes he said of course well need to hear about the usual danger signs everybody knows does mrs hampton have recentmemory loss does she get confused about places and people does she have trouble handling money and paying her bills the short answer is yes all of those things ally knew had accelerated in the last six months it was the tragic recognizable onset of the latter stages of alzheimers already more than once maria had said there were times when she didnt think nina recognized her more and more she seemed to be confused unable some days to find her way around the apartment and shed started repeating herself she often had trouble finding the right words and she was increasingly paranoid and suspicious maria who had worked with other alzheimers patients feared she might begin hallucinating soon seeing things that werent there ally turned to her it felt obscene to talk about her when she was sitting right there with them mom sweetie do you understand what dr van de vliet is asking do you think you have trouble doing everyday things she knew the answer but she was determined that her mother not be treated like a potted plant ally you know that half the time i cant remember a blessed thing im getting crazy as a bloody coot then nina turned and looked van de vliet in the eye i dont want to lose my mind doctor i dont want to see the shade closing in i cant do crosswords anymore i used to do them all the time and all the music i used to know it was my love and now now i cant tell scriabin from strauss half the time it wasnt supposed to happen that way i thought my mind would go on forever mrs hampton if youll let me what i want to do is try to work on your recollection i dont know how much i can help you with crosswords but then ive never been much good at them myself either your memory of music should improve though there are no guarantees but then im ready to try it doctor she cut in youre all that stands between me and losing the only thing i have left my past next came a burst of rationality now i hate to be a pest but could you explain what exactly it is youre going to do i want ally to hear this too and then maybe she can go over it with me later and help me understand it he smiled and reached over and stroked her slightly thinning hair id be happy to try mrs hampton its actually pretty simple then he turned to ally we touched on some of this on the phone do you want to hear it again yes im still trying to get it all into my simple mind well he began to go back to the very beginning of my interest in stem cells the focus of our research has been directed toward challenging the notorious hayflick limit back in the s professor leonard hayflick discovered that when tissue cells are taken from the body and cultured in a laboratory dish those cells grow and divide about fifty times give or take and then they stop they have reached old age senescence the physical basis of the hayflick limit is a section of dna known as telomere which gets shorter each time the cell divides eventually the telomeres become so short that all cell division stops its like an internal clock telling them the game is over theyve had their innings and youre saying youve found a way to beat the clock to stop the telomeres from getting shorter all cells possess a gene known as the telomerase gene which can restore the telomeres to their youthful length but in most cells the gene is permanently repressed and inactive it is only found in egg and sperm cells and in cancer cells he gazed away for a moment as though collecting his thoughts then he turned back however weve found that by isolating and inserting an active copy of the telomerase enzyme into adult stem cells which can be found in minute quantities throughout the body we can set their clock back to zero we extract cells immortalize them with telomerase and then return them to the body as a youthful infusion and is that what youd be doing for mom thered be a series of injections but given what appears to be her level of mental awareness right now the procedure probably can be accelerated he patted nina on the shoulder all right ally said but can you use the same procedure for someones heart well yes and no he said did you bring your medical records i should have a look at them before making any pronouncements to prepare for this moment shed printed off a copy of the medical files shed scanned into her computer therere a lot of files she said opening her bag ive got copies of my ekgs over the past eleven years dr ekelman my cardiologist says my condition is getting progressively worse she took the folder out of her bag and handed it to him he flipped through the files with what seemed an absent manner almost as though he already knew what was in them and was just going through the motions then he looked up well your physical condition looks pretty good you clearly exercise and i dont see anything here that would suggest a complication as to how your procedure might differ from your mothers i guess the main area of concern is simply the scale he laid her files on the steel table your heart has reached the stage of aortic valve stenosis where cardiac output no longer can keep up proportionately with vigorous exercise and that has put an even larger strain on an already weakened condition what we are about to undertake here corresponds to what might almost be considered an aortic valve replacement though it is done at the cellular level we call it regenerative medicine millions of cells will be involved well attempt to reverse the calcification and also to develop new blood vessels that supply the heart muscle you know this is so risky i remember that not long ago they tried to use fetal cell injections into the brain for treating parkinsons disease and it turned out that the side effects were horrendous why should i assume that this is any safer he looked pained i assure you we dont do anything here that is remotely like that particular unfortunate procedure she stared at the ceiling trying to grasp what hed just said so how risky do you think this is she asked finally truth time he looked away again and sighed there was a long silence in which he seemed to be pondering some extremely troubling thoughts finally he turned back in medicine there is always something that can go wrong even the most innocuous procedure can end up being lethal if thats what the gods want that day he looked at her intently and seemed to try to measure his words but i wouldnt recommend we proceed if i didnt feel that the potential benefits far outweigh the risks she listened wondering something in his voice is sounding cagey what is he leaving out i still want to think about it of course but we can make some preparations in the meantime van de vliet said turning back to nina mrs hampton do you understand anything of what ive said nothing is risk free young man if youd lived as long as i have and then felt it all slipping away youd be willing to take a chance with anything mrs hampton alzheimers is one of the more promising areas of stem cell research weve already had successes here i truly think we can help you in fact ellen can start your preliminaries right now if you like a lot of it you may have done before for example theres a game where you have to memorize the names of three unrelated objects and you have to count backwards from one hundred by sevens finally theres a test where you copy sentences and symbols he chuckled and there was a warmth but also a distant sadness some days im not sure i could even do it all myself in any case its not something you pass or fail but if we do enter you into the trials youll have to stay here for the duration thats absolutely essential wed also like a caregiver to be here with you as long as its necessary ally looked at maria do you think you want to stay here with mom marias eyes were very sad i could stay for a day or two but maybe we should talk we can arrange for someone van de vliet interjected we routinely provide caregivers from our staff when called for and because were still in clinical trials there is no charge ally watched nina brighten and turn to maria you can bring some things from my closet when you go back i want to start right away i just know he can help me ive got a feeling and you know my feelings are always right ellen reached and took ninas hand come dear we have a special office where we handle all the paperwork for admissions we can do the tests there ally leaned over and kissed her mother i love you mom and i love your spirit you taught me how to be a fighter a long time ago and i guess youre still teaching me tuesday april pm karl van de vliet watched the three women leave now he was alone with alexa so far so good he thought with her mother checked in were partway there now what is it going to take to get her with the program im not sensing commitment shes asking too damned many questions it looks like we may have to go to plan b tomorrow too bad after the door was closed he turned back your mother is quite an inspiration he said with a smile ill need those tests to create a baseline but already i can tell shell almost certainly respond to the treatment she fits our success profile id say the odds are heavily on her side then he darkened his look for effect better let her know i dont have to do this he reasoned the truth is we already have enough data on alzheimers that i dont really need any further clinical trials i know the parameters of what the procedure can do and what it cant but when grant told me about his mothers condition i saw no reason not to work her into the trials were winding down now and we have some empty beds dont think im not grateful she said even though i may ask a lot of questions she got the message he thought good alexa im now going to tell you something ive never told anyone else he went on feeling a tinge of sadness arise in his chest he hadnt planned to say this but for some reason he now wanted to perhaps because it was true my late wife camille was a brilliant medical researcher we worked together for many years first at johns hopkins and then at harvard what took her from me was a heart condition very similar to your own that was over a decade ago and i vowed i would dedicate my work to her i wanted the final clinical trial in this program to be on a young person with advanced valvular stenosis but i could never find a patient who matched that profile but you would be perfect he looked carefully at her it was all so true which made this whole scene especially poignant im sorry about your wife ally said i read in your you see if i can succeed with you it would almost seem as though id had a second chance to save her life you bear such a striking likeness to her in several ways you look something like her but more importantly i sense that you share her indomitable will so im not just another statistic to you she seemed to be trying to gauge the depth of his sincerity no one here is a statistic but you would definitely be someone special i see she said still sounding noncommittal am i getting anywhere he wondered just press on youve got to make this happen all right whatever you decide we need to get some preliminaries out of the way for one thing we must have a complete new cardiology exam nothing in the file you brought presents an obvious red flag but still its essential that we have an uptotheminute stress test toward that end ive taken the liberty of arranging for a checkup at the new york university faculty practice radiology on east thirtyfourth street among other things they can run a highspeed computed tomography screening using ultrafast x rays also id like to see a phonocardiogram a sonic analysis of murmurs can tell us a lot about valve abnormalities regardless of what you decide to do here its a good idea for you to have this done regularly anyway youve already scheduled tests her tone of voice told him she was mildly taken aback at the presumption its just that the nyu faculty practice is sometimes difficult to get into on short notice they can be booked for weeks in advance but a cardiologist i know there lev amram has agreed to make room for you this afternoon its a professional courtesy therell be no charge after that and assuming you want to proceed you should get a good nights rest and then come back here as early as possible tomorrow morning you should pack for a threeweek stay though well provide you with pretty much everything youll need here just get her here you know she said i was actually hoping we could do this on an outpatient basis i know you like to have your patients here for constant observation but i run a business that needs me there every day alexa he said putting every last ounce of authority he had into his voice this is not a conventional procedure and its possible you might suddenly need special care of some kind this is an experimental clinical trial so we dont know what can happen thats why i really must insist that you be here twentyfour hours a day he looked at her with great tenderness were talking about the possibility of completely repairing your heart surely you dont expect just to drop by now and then for that all right point taken she said butif we go forward with thisill need to hire at least one temp to be at the office while im gone somebody to at least handle the phone that could take time surely someone there could manage to handle that he said shes getting resistant again he told himself dont let that happen and theres also the matter of your mother i think it would be wise for you to be nearby during the early stages of her procedure when her mind starts climbing out of the abyss its important for a close family member to be there to provide a visual and emotional anchor it truly can make all the difference i fully expect that her functions of attention and recall will return to those normal for a woman her age or quite possibly even better but it will happen a lot quicker if youre here to help her to remind her of things this is a lot to digest ally turned and sat down in a chair all right i might as well get the exam it doesnt mean ive agreed to anything here he heard the ambivalence and knew he had no choice but to do what he was going to have to do tomorrow i will proceed on the assumption that youll be entering the program truthfully if you dont a week from now your mother is going to be asking you why he smiled in any case we need to have those tests done in the city also some blood work here were affiliated with a lab i want to check your tcells and certain other markers like creactive protein and homocystine its something you should do regularly anyway all right then she said finally but after that let me go see how moms doing then ill arrange things with maria somehow and drive back to the city by the way before i forget we have to complete a formal application for your mother to admit her into the clinical trials and we also need a signed liability waiver i assume you have power of attorney for her by now if you dont then we may not legally be able to proceed i have it then lets get started he declared almost certain he had her chapter tuesday april am stone aimes was in his cubicle staring at the phone when it rang he prayed this was the call hed been waiting for as a gamble a long shot hed requested that jane tully his former livein lover and the sentinels parttime corporate counsel do him a small favor after he hacked the nih web site hed asked her to pass along just one question concerning gerex to winston bartletts corporate attorneys why had a patient been abruptly and mysteriously terminated without explanation from the clinical trials now under way by the gerex corporation if that wouldnt get a rise out of bartlett he didnt know what would it was the only part of the corporations encrypted nih file that seemed irregular but would bartlett take the bait he reached for the phone aimes here around him came the clatter of computer keys and muted laughter from the direction of the water cooler everybody had watched a tivo of the latest sunday night and they were still critiquing the shows mondays were everybodys day off so tuesdays were the first chance to catch up the staff was also starting to rev up again for the coming weeks edition everybody with the hope that their particular assignment would have legs and make its author a household name stone however felt like this was either the first day of the rest of his life or the last day of a career built on dealing to inside straights this cannot go on much longer he kept telling himself it was an unstable condition his soul was already over the fence keeping company with that wild free ox he liked to muse about stone came a husky female voice strained and yet strong just as hed hoped it was jane whose office was down on the third floor can you come down right now did you hear back from stone she admonished her voice growing urgent just come down do it now all right sure he paused a moment wondering why did she sound so upset had his plan somehow backfired im on my way he glanced up at the fluorescent light over his head like a pitiless hovering spaceship and wondered if this was going to be the break he had been praying for there was a nervousness in janes voice that indicated something major was afoot something was about to change he switched off his compaq laptop and reached for his brown corduroy jacket which was hanging from a hook on the side of the glasswalled cubicle he straightened his brown knit tie as he stepped on the elevator and for some reason he found himself thinking of his daughter amy he mimed a toast heres looking at you kid she was in the fifth grade and lived with her mother joyce in a small condominium nestled in the hills near el cerrito where his exwife grew up joyce was a television producer who had left him to go back out there where she got work as a garden designer when he got over the shock he finally concluded she loved california more than she loved him maybe not an unreasonable choice but then she got custody of amy based solely on the fact that his income was inadequate to send her to private school in new york and the public schools were out of the question but joyce had agreed that if he ever had the money she could live with him some of the time this book he hoped would make that happen he still didnt know why he and joyce couldnt have made a go of it it had occurred to him that there was the real possibility she had fallen in love with the idea of a dashing investigative reporter not the grueling reality these days she had amy all the time except for three weeks in july and he had so many things to regret he scarcely knew where to start he kept a yearold photograph of amy on his desk in a frame far too expensive for a snapshot of a young girl on a black horse named zena but it was zena that his a month in child support had helped to pay for and he felt it somehow bonded them hi dad from me and zena went the inscription why was he thinking about her now he wondered the answer was because he wanted her world to be different from the one he had known as a child he hadnt had a father around and that had left him with a lot of anger he didnt want the same fate for her amys world he knew was going to be very different no matter what he did to be young like her and starting out was a daunting prospect these days he wanted to make everything easier for her but the only thing he could give her now was a measly every month and his unshakable love even so that was more than his mother karen got for child supportfrom a natural father he had never actually seen in the flesh until he was eleven and that was a chance encounter so if this book got some traction and he got some recognition along with some economic security he might be able to have amy come back and live with him it was something shed said she wanted to do though he wasnt sure where he would keep zena but all in good time now everything depended on the book the elevator door opened and he stepped out on the third floor the receptionist rhonda a darkhaired resident of avenue a who usually tried to flirt looked at him as though hed just been convicted of a crime and nodded with her head toward the corridor leading to janes office stone youve really screwed up this time youll never guess whos in there and after your scalp what on earth did you do you mean this is a guy ive only seen in newspaper pictures though needless to say not in this upstanding rag in her dismay she unthinkingly reached for the pack of virginia slims lying next to the phone momentarily forgetting that smoking had longsince been forbidden in the building youd better get your ass in there jesus he came in with a bunch of lawyers but then he told them to split im going to handle the fucker myself quote unquote right here by my desk stone didnt know with absolute certainty who she was talking about but surely it had to be my god he thought with a thrill maybe it worked maybe ive smoked him out truth tellers have nothing to fear rhonda he winked at her im protected by the sword of the lord he is my rod and my staff he leadeth me beside still waters youre crazy you know that shed remembered where she was and began putting the cigarette back into the pack then she smoothed her short black hair he leadeth you into the shit handsome thats where he leadeth you youre adorable but youre also a sane persons nightmare thanks he said giving a thumbsup as he walked past her desk i appreciate your unstinting praise he headed on down the hall the plush gray carpet soft against his feet could this be the break he wondered feeling his hopes cautiously rising had the big man himself shown up could it be that there was something funny going on with that patient who got dropped but what he still didnt have a clue as he walked into the room he felt as though time just stopped he had fantasized about this moment more and more as the years went by now here it was what next he thought he had been emotionally prepared but now he realized he wasnt were they going to acknowledge the past or were they just going to act as though nothing existed between them that first chance meeting when stone was eleven had been when his mother threatened to sue bartlett for formal child support the threat of publicity caused the matter to be immediately settled as shed hoped it would be stone had been sitting in the law firms reception area when bartlett walked through each knew who the other was but bartlett just stopped and glared at him for a moment before moving cm stone had sized up the man who had abandoned his mother and only barely managed to suppress an urge to leap up and lash out at him if only to say look at me im here he had not been in the same room with his father since but this time around he was definitely noticed winston bartlett looked just as he did in news photos he was in his late sixties with thinning blond hair that was cut too long and shaggy in the back stones first thought was that the tightfisted old rou should spring for a better barber but it was bartletts eyes that really caught him they were strong and filled with anger but they also contained a hint of desperation they were very different eyes from the haughty dismissal he remembered from a lifetime ago good stone thought ive finally made you squirm daddy dearest nothing else ive done has ever gotten the slightest notice from you for a moment they stood sizing up each other stone jane said this is i know he said even though they had been practically married he had never told her that he was the unacknowledged son of winston bartlett he had never told anyone to him his father had died before he was born and that was the story he stuck to he naturally had a lot of complex feelings about that he had seen his mother struggling to give them a decent life hoofing in the chorus line of broadway shows long after she should have and a lot of his anger remained now though stone aimes wanted nothing from the old man except the truth miss tully bartlett barked glowering at her i think youd better leave us alone of course jane said with a wry look and in a tactful instant she had slipped past them and out gently closing the office door behind her i dont believe it bartlett said turning back after he watched her leave youre trying to blackmail me you little prick which tells me youre not half as smart as i thought you were wait a minute did that mean winston bartlett has been following my career stone felt a thrill in spite of himself i never knew you thought about me one way or the other he was experiencing a curious sensation although he was in the same room with his father for only the second time in his life it felt natural they were having one of those ageold arguments the younger generation had just challenged the older generation and because of that sparks were set to fly this was the kind of thing that was supposed to happen between fathers and sons all the time in fact it felt good it felt normal more than that he was finally being acknowledged my god he thought i share dna with this man and yet we have so little in common then he had a more scary thought maybe we have a lot in common i think its time you told me what the hell youre up to bartlett declared ignoring the jibe how did you im trying to do us both a favor but youre not cooperating if the gerex clinical trials are going half as well as i think they are then it seems to me youve got everything to gain by publicity im trying to write the first book that tells the gerex story so why the hell wont your legal flunkies let me interview karl van de vliet thats actually none of your business bartletts eyes abruptly turned cloudy i want you to stay the hell away from right now im the best friend youve got in this world believe me stone couldnt believe he was saying this for how many years had he loathed and despised this man but now for the first time he actually needed something from him i want to tell the real story of what van de vliet has accomplished what gerex has accomplished itll be the latest word on stem cell technology but your office keeps giving me the runaround we have a damned good reason to keep our work proprietary just now bartlett declared this is like the manhattan project his eyes bored in the results of the clinical trials are going to cause a press feeding frenzy and i want to be in a position to control that when the time comes this is incredible stone told himself we re talking as though we have no history you have a granddaughter by me whom youve never even seen dont you at least care about her ive got a pretty good idea of what gerex is doing and i think its going to be a milestone in medical history stone looked at him trying to figure him out after all these years for all his bluster winston bartlett seemed like a man with a lot of vulnerabilities and insecurities he hadnt expected it it so happens im a damned good medical reporter and all im asking is to be the boswell to van de vliets johnson i want to be the one to chronicle this historic moment theres no one who can do it better believe me ill even agree to embargo everything until i get a green light from gerex but i want to start now and get it right you cant ethically know any details of the work bartlett declared so the question im waiting to hear answered is how did you find out i cant reveal my source because he told himself i still dont have one all have is guesswork but i know that karl van de vliet is running the first successful clinical trials using stem cell procedures and im going to report on it whether you want me to or not so are you going to help make sure my facts are accurate im going to help make sure theres no reporting at all till i say so bartlett went on anything you print will be by definitionirresponsible speculation and you can expect enough legal action to the original schedule was that theyll be finished in less than a month im not going to publish anything before that i just want to have the manuscript ive been working on ready when the gerex story finally can be told itll be the final chapter the payoff im going to describe your clinical trials and it would be better for all concerned if it could be the authorized version if you force me to publish without your cooperation its not going to do either one of us as much good again he wondered why bartlett was so upset what was it about that one terminated patient that made him freak when he found out somebody knew so freaked he charged up here personally all the way from his fancy corporate building in tribeca to breathe fire and brimstone and yell threats do i have to get a court injunction to put a stop to this corporate espionage bartlett demanded everything i know is in the public domain somewhere actually stone thought thats a serious outandout lie nobody knows that a patient got mysteriously terminated from the trials i just want to work together with you even as he was saying it stone aimes realized that it was not in the cards now or ever he watched winston bartletts eyes narrow what kind of contract do you have with this paper quite frankly the terms of the contracts for employees of this paper are confidential i knew i should have kept those fucking lawyers here it takes a shark to deal with a shark then he seemed to catch himself so if youre planning on writing anything about this youd be well advised to get yourself an attorney because youre sure as hell going to need one thanks dad it just came out maybe hed been wanting to say it all his life bartletts look was shock for a moment and then it turned pensive you dont think i take an interest in you but i do yeah youve really been around through thick and thin he felt the old anger of abandonment welling up i took care of your mother whatever she did was beyond my control the eyes were switching to chagrin do you have the slightest idea what i could do for you ive im not getting any younger and ive been thinking about with your medical background you could easily have a place i mean if youve got a head for business then someday so why do you fucking want to do this now stone listened trying to internalize what he was hearing not only did winston bartlett know about him he was finally thinking about acknowledging him sort of or was this just a bribe to hush him up either way it was too little too late youve never given me anything and ive sure as hell never asked id just like for you to get out of my way so i can do my job bartlett stalked toward the door then he turned back youd better think long and hard about what youre getting into you can ask some of the twobit reporters ive dealt with in the past theyre fucking roadkill with that pronouncement he slammed the door and was gone stone stared after him feeling his heart pump it wasnt the threat it was the mixed emotions for a moment in spite of his better judgment hed felt like he had a father but then bartlett became the enemy again then the door cracked open and jane appeared dismay in her eyes what was that about what was what about ive gotta tell you that man doesnt know how to keep his voice down what was that about helping your mother karen you never talked about her much but i sure dont remember you ever saying anything about her and winston bartlett thats because i didnt jane there are parts of my past life that i try not to think about any more than i have to after the fact its nice to know that there were parts of your life that you didnt see fit to share with me she sniffed maybe someday its a little late for that she declared hurt lingering in her voice look stone i dont know what you know thats got bartlett so upset but hes not the best guy in the world to piss off he stormed in here fit to be tied personally demanding to know how the hell did you have proprietary information about the gerex corporations clinical trials he already seemed to know who you were now i realize theres more to the story somewhere back there in time and what did you tell him i was completely blindsided for which i thank you i told him i didnt know anything about your sources but i wouldnt reveal them even if i did hes our landlord but that doesnt give him subpoena power he doesnt have the right to barge in here and try to intimidate the sentinels staff were current on the rent stone felt a tinge of nostalgia sometimes her goldplated bitchiness was the very thing he admired most about her well thanks for sticking up for me maybe ive got him upset enough that hell come around eventually and decide its better to have me inside the tent where i can be monitored she snorted at the improbability of that no stone as usual youre an idiot idealist and dreamer ill tell you exactly whats going to happen bartlett is most likely on his cell phone right now as we speak threatening the family trying to get you fired hes saying youre stealing proprietary information somehow and hes going to sue the sentinel for our last dime if we print a syllable of anything you write about him thats his next move stone i expect my phone to ring in approximately fourteen and a half minutes their attorneys are going to tell me to tell jay to get you under control thats whats going to happen the family does not want winston bartlett pissed off especially by the likes of you somebody whos always writing muckraking articles that make them real nervous does anything ive said have the ring of logic to you or are you living in some nevernever land where the facts dont fucking penetrate hey he thought thats pretty good jane is in defcon mode today depends on what you look at the doughnut or the hole that is the stick approach or the carrot im betting hes going to split the difference and try a little of both hes going to cool off and then offer me a few crumbs as an inducement to go away god youre so naive she laughed in derision winston bartlett is not accustomed to having to ask anybody for anything so the fact he came up here this morning to try to get you to back off on whatever it is youre doing must mean youve really got him psyched she stared at him what is it stone tell me what do you have on him right now im more interested in what he thinks i might have and the truth is i dont really know but it must be something pretty big stone why is it so hard to hate you you can make a persons life miserable and that stupid person will still root for you god i dont know what it was about you she paused a moment as though thinking maybe youre just too honest or just too sincere maybe thats what it was dont try to butter me up i know my weaknesses but dammit jane im this close to the story of the century and the paranoid zillionaire who was in here just now yelling at me is trying to freeze me out well please dont involve me in this anymore stone youve just provided me with a weeks worth of unnecessary shit from now on any communicating you want to do with gerexs attorneys is going to have to be done by someone else trust me when i tell you i do not need this in my life sweetie wait till you see what im on the track of what the gerex corporation is doing at a small clinic out in new jersey is going to change everything we know about medicine and its going to blow wide open the second they finally let the press in on whats happening at the clinical trials theyre now winding up for the nih when they finally hold that big press briefing i want to have a manuscript already in copyediting i want to be first then why is he so worked up over your question she mused about somebody being dropped from the clinical trials she paused incidentally i can do without being called sweetie by a man im no longer screwing sorry about that he winced it did just sort of slip out in this orgy of intimacy but what i think bartlett desperately doesnt want me to find out is the reason that patient was dropped and hes afraid im getting close unfortunately im not and i just took my best shot at prying the information out of him andyoure probably rightblew it he was turning to leave but im by god going to find out somehow just see if you can keep me from getting fired for a little while longer if im still working for the sentinel three months from now you may get honorable mention in my pulitzer acceptance it was bluff talk but he believed it with every fiber of his body youve gotta believe right come on ally get lucky find out who that mystery patient was the way things look now you re the only shot ive got left chapter tuesday april pm what a day when ally finally settled onto her couch after giving knickers a long walk she was exhausted she leaned back and kicked off her shoes there had been a few moments of tightness in her chestmaybe it was psychological anxietyinducedbut that was gone now she thought about calling new jersey to ask how nina was doing but she doubted they would tell her anything shed spent the latter part of the afternoon getting yet another heart exam after driving to northern new jersey and back shed had a formal and exhausting stress test for her heart at the new york university faculty practice god she was sick of examining rooms and those blue paper shifts you put on backwards as though it was okay for doctors and nurses to see your bare ass then she put on shorts and sneakers and an israeli physician stuck wired suction cups all over her chest and put her on a treadmill for seventeen minutes boosting her pulse to over which was as high as he dared to go then he called van de vliet faxed him the charts and they reviewed the squiggly lines for another ten minutes finally she had a highspeed ct scan whose results were then sent directly to karl van de vliets lab computer the bottom line was the damaged valve in her aortic ventricle was deteriorating even more rapidly than her regular physician dr ekelman had thought but her heart was still strong enough for the procedure she wondered if she had gone this far because she was letting hope outweigh a sober evaluation of the risks was this the sign of complete desperation whatever she decided tomorrow was the day d day decision day she thought again about her mom who had been bubbling with hope when she looked in on her nina hadnt even been formally checked in but already she seemed transformed it was enough for her just to entertain the possibility that her mind could be renewed that in itself was sufficient to convince ally to sign the consent agreement for van de vliet to go forward with her procedure he even offered to provide a car service to take maria home to the bronx after nina was settled and resting in her own case the special injections for her heart she was far less sure what she thought the part that bothered her most was having to give herself entirely over to a person she scarcely knew it was the kind of ultimate surrender that she abhorred while knickers rummaged behind the couch for the remnants of her rawhide chew toy ally momentarily considered calling grant she couldnt think of a reason why except that he was the only coherent immediate family she had left and this felt like a moment for pulling together god she missed steve sometimes she felt so alone then she considered calling stone aimes but she decided that would seem pushy the truth was shed enjoyed talking to him and shed been surprised at how comfortable shed felt looking back over the elapsed years she couldnt remember exactly why they split up there must have been a good reason but now she could only recall the good times a picnic in central park or the time they took the staten island ferry at night just to see the inspiring downtown skyline with those jumbled thoughts cluttering her mind she finally got around to remembering she hadnt checked her phone machine she got up off the couch and went into the bedroom there were three calls and at first she thought she was too exhausted to check them but no that was irresponsible she was running a business hi ally its me the voice was jennifers no emergency but call when you get in and let me know how it went okay not tonight there was too much to explain and she was too tired she went to the second message hi its me again i need you to look over the jameson design that italianmarble bath theyre having trouble getting the ocher some kind of strike at the quarry what can they substitute but remember its got to be absurdly overpriced or theyll assume its crap if i dont hear back from you ill fax you some stuff in the morning okay she thought these rich clients love to show off ill get them what they should have ordered in the first place knowing them stone from the quarry near agra where they got the marble for the taj mahal that ought to be ostentatious enough itll take an extra couple of months but that will impress them even more as she considered going to the third message she had a feeling of misgiving though in truth there were several people she wouldnt mind hearing from or maybe the dorian institute had called about nina maybe shed freaked this whole thing was happening way too fast in any case she didnt really want to talk to anybody right now what she really wanted to do was sit and think maybe run the whole thing by stone and get his take she decided to check out the third message hi its your intrepid reporter just checking in to see how it went today its just after eight and im at home i may not be able to afford this place much longer given all the excitement ive had today so call me while i still have an apartment and a phone she felt a ripple of excitement and the feeling pleased her maybe she did have someone stable and rational in her corner someone who understood the risks and possible rewards of going forward with the procedure shed put his number in her palm which was in her bag and she went back to the living room poured herself a glass of wine and then retrieved it she heard him pick up on the second ring hi its ally thanks for checking on me im really not in the greatest shape at the moment oh yeah so howd it go well i met dr miracle she paused i dont know quite how to handle you stone are we having some kind of reunion the affair redux are we friends all over again two days ago all we had were memories then i start getting phone calls from you i still dont know what im supposed to think ill tell you what i think i think were playing this by ear i dont know what youve been doing for the years that i havent seen you i dont know what you know about me so this is kind of like a blind date with a lot of baggage i agree she said then hesitated her resolve was melting i might as well say this is it too late to come down and talk i thought i was tough enough to handle this on my own but i definitely could use psychological support give me the address i could use a little support myself i got tlhreatened today i think by somebody who would like to crush me like a bug and easily could ill spare you the ironies but you and i may have more in common than you think my interest in the gerex corporation has just gotten extremely personal after she hung up she felt energized and she decided to give jennifer a call after all in truth she wanted to tell her about stone and to get her take on whether seeing him was a good idea arent these secondtimearound things always doomed hi jen im home and im making all kinds of fateful decisions so what happened are you going to be a guinea pig for that clinic is that what you think it amounts to she couldnt tell how serious jennifer intended to be im still debating it mom loved the place well good good for her but youre still not sure about you im leaning she paused jen somebody i used to see in college is on his way down here right now hes a medical reporter but the truth is i dont know why i asked him i guess if i were your shrink id ask how do you feel about that if i knew the answer to that i wouldnt need you to be a onewoman support group she bit her lip hes doing a book about stem cell procedures so in a way its a lucky break that he appeared exactly when he did yeah ally if you ask me it sounds like it was a lucky break in more than one way an old flame reappearing can be a positive sign its high time something happened in your life you re tighter than you know she thought im ready for this whether i admit it to myself or not but is there going to be any chemistry when we actually see each other there used to be a lot the embarrassing thing was her first thought was to wonder if he was still terrific in bed she remembered thinking he was very adroit back then but back then she didnt have much experience to compare him with mainly thinking about him now made her painfully aware she was overdue for some closeness tuesday april pm whats she going to think of me stone wondered as he knocked gently on the door shed buzzed him up from the lobby without a word more to the point he thought what am i going to say if she wants an opinion about whether she should undergo the procedure or not so far the only evidence i have that the clinical trials are working is circumstantial the patients whove been through the sequence and discharged so how can i in good faith advise her one way or the other but he then concluded im getting way ahead of myself she may take one look at me and decide she was right to dump me the first time nice building though housing for grownups not like the onebedroom starter setup ive been reduced to he knockedhe always hated the idea of ringing a bell on an apartment doorand a second later it opened alexa hampton and stone aimes just stood awkwardly for a moment and stared taking each other in finally you look great they both said it simultaneously and that served to make the moment even more awkward well he said finally into the silence you do and he meant it there was however a lot of strain on her face in her eyes the mark the years had left seemed more psychic than physical you dont look so bad yourself god it seems like a lifetime ago when we went to our separate corners he said after another long contemplative pause then he stepped in and she closed the door he didnt try to peck her cheek for which she looked relieved tell me how youre doing really you really want to know okay this afternoon i had a heavyduty heart checkup nobody wants to put odds on this thing but my condition is getting worse she led him through to the living room then we should talk he said looking around i love your loft by the way you make me envy you you should see the makeshift quarters i live in im sort of waiting for my ship to come in the truth is stone that i no longer know the first thing about you or your life and i think id like to had we but world enough and time he smiled well get around to the catching up but i dont flatter myself that you asked me down at this hour to reminisce about our respective pasts youve already got me figured out she made a face i dont know whether i like that or not by the way would you care for something you used to like scotch right the operative part of that statement is used to these days i try to avoid anything harder than beer i was starting to have an ethanol dependency problem i think its a common occupational hazard for a reporter i dont keep beer around its fattening how about some diet cranberry juice maybe ill have that scotch after all he laughed i have a feeling it might be more suited to the occasion know what i think ill join you she walked into the kitchen and started making the drinks on the rocks right good memory stone i asked you down because ive got to make a big decision she was bringing the drinks into the living room tonight youre the closest thing ive got to a knowledgeable sounding board you have some idea of the risks and rewards here so do i check into the dorian institute and let them start injecting doctoredup stem cells into me or not turns out thats what van de vliet wants to do were in worse trouble than we thought he took a scotch youve at least seen the place i dont have a shred of actual physical evidence that those clinical trials are producing results i can make inferences from what i see on the web site but its nothing you can take to the bank he ventured a sip then looked up by the way did you get a chance to ask about the patient who got dropped oh shit i forgot she sighed there was so much going on with mom and all the rest that it completely slipped my dont worry about it he said with a sigh come on ally she thought this could be really important youve got to get focused ill try to remember tomorrow i do think its kind of vital but be careful not to mention my name ive ive just acquired some problems of my own with the gerex corporation what kind of problems let me take a rain check on answering that suffice to say theyre not thrilled about the idea that im doing a book in which theyre prominently featured he paused look ally theres a lot going on here including that patient who was dropped for some reason that nobody wants to disclose but if you do decide to do it you couldnt have a better physician karl van de vliet is quite possibly the worlds leading researcher in stem cell technology on the other hand this is the first time thereve been actual human trials if anybody tells you theres no risk then theyre not behaving ethically well the way things stand now im due out there at the institute at ten am tomorrow if i want to i can be formally entered into the clinical trials on the spot ive passed my qualifying exam you know the trials are almost over its like theyre taking you at the last minute thats what he said im going to be the last whatever my friend jennifer just called me a guinea pig van de vliet also said id have to stay out there for at least a couple of weeks probably longer thats going to be a bloody drag since things are really busy down at citispace now ally given what i know or dont know i dont have an entirely good feeling about this it could be theyre hiding something but i dont have a clue what it is its quite possibly connected to that patient who got terminated and when i tried to raise this with gerexs attorneys no less person than winston bartlett himself went ballistic what are you saying that i shouldnt do it hey i cant make that decision for you but one possibility would be to just play along for a day or two and see if you cant find out a little more about what went wrong with the patient who was dropped stone thats maybe a little paranoid couldnt a single patient have been dropped for a whole bunch of different reasons of course but its not that simple a patient was dropped from the gerex clinical trials and there was no official reason given in the data file it made me curious enough that i had our papers attorney pass along a question about it to their attorneys that motivated winston bartlett to come personally to threaten me so why is a guy who runs a huge conglomerate suddenly afraid of one tiny question is there some problem some reaction to the procedure that theyre terrified will come to light ultimately millions and millions of dollars are at stake i want the book im writing to tell the whole story not just the part theyll want to have told thats why god put reporters on earth shit stone im glad youre here i think i told you on the phone i had someone i loved very much disappear on me some years ago and im feeling very alone at the moment she looked him over okay ill ask were adults are you married divorced attached unattached seeing someone alone and suicidal what i mean where do things stand here where things stand is that im very happy that i stumbled into you after all the years and yeah ive got a little history at least id like to think so but nothing is going on at the moment then he told her about joyce the divorce amy and what was that you said about having somebody disappear on you he studied her reaching back for the feelings that were still buried seeing her was bringing it back what did you mean by that disappear like a missing person or disappear as in up and split or he was my husband steve and he was a political consultant he was in a singleengine cessna that went down in the rain forest in belize and i miss him terribly im so sorry ally nothing thats happened to me comes close to that tragedy it gets worse a few months before that my dad had an accident with a browning shotgun that was no accident jesus whats that line about how the troubles tread on one anothers heels was he depressed i guess thats a stupid question he thought he was going to lose his business after a lifetime of work what do you think ally im really sorry about all that well i suppose it could be worse as i recall you never knew your dad did you when am i going to tell her the truth he asked himself lets get off the history topic tonight what do you say well both get ourselves depressed agreed she sipped at her scotch so youre saying i should play along and see if i can find out something about this discharged patient the mere mention of whom causes grown millionaires to become unhinged its what would do he said finishing off his scotch and settling the glass on a coaster on a side table then he got up i have to tell you ally you look awfully tired id love to be responsible for keeping you up all night but i doubt that would be a humane act it might remind me of a time long ago and not so far away she said with a faint smile but youre right when i get this tired i can precipitate an episode id offer to drive you out there tomorrow but that would just get you in trouble they probably have orders to shoot me on sight im the number one persona non grata with the top management of the gerex corporation at the moment so im the last person you want to be seen with right now the only way youre going to find out what theyre hiding is if nobody suspects anything which means youve got to show up alone maybe thats true she thought but youre a person id like to be with tonight thanks for coming over she walked over and pecked him on the cheek you re vulnerable tonight she told herself wanting to ask him to stay dont start making any big life decisions chapter tuesday april pm winston bartlett looked at the white phone on the oak end table beside his chair and argued with himself about picking it up and calling the dutchman when van de vliet was at his office at the institute they communicated by encrypted videophone by this time though he was usually home but he still hadnt called to say what had happened with alexa hampton now they would have to talk over an open line damn him after his explosive runin with stone aimesdamn him toobartlett had gone up to the park avenue place to check on kristen firsthand and try to console her but he wasnt actually sure she recognized him at times she seemed to and then at other times she would just stare at him blankly her mind increasingly had an inandout relationship with reality and today was an out day the time had come to be deeply concerned about her she couldnt be kept under wraps forever he had checked her into the dorian institute under an assumed name kirby parker to try to avoid any publicity now that was the only name she could remember how had the syndrome done that to her kristen starr whose identity was known to several million watchers of cable tv could no longer remember her own name karl had worked with her every day but no medication he had tried had even minimally slowed the syndromes progress the beta had seemed so promising kristens body had been rejuvenatedher face was looking like shed had perfect plastic surgery and thered been no discernible side effects it was everything theyd all hoped for kristen was elated and even the normally cautious van de vliet was buoyed yes the beta was so close karl had to find a way to make it work in spite of all winston bartletts entrepreneurial derringdo he always knew he was at the mercy of time he was getting ever closer to that final dance with destiny but but what if the beta could be made to work the way van de vliet theorized it might was there the possibility the music would never stop nursing a second glenfiddich he looked around the room the thirdfloor studybedroom finding it pleased him as always this room of his fivestory mansion was a handmade gem from new yorks turnofthecentury gilded age with molded plasterwork ceilings and brass doorknobs and mahogany paneling favorites from his superlative japanese sword collection lined the walls giving him constant joy he wanted to live to enjoy it for another three score and ten the only galling thing about the place was that he had to share it with eileen who had the top two floors they had been living in marital purgatory for the past twentyeight years ever since she found out about the existence of his natural son because of that humiliation she had refused to give him the one thing he most wanted from her his freedom she let it be known that as long as he flaunted a string of mistresses in the cheap tabloid press she was determined to stay in his face he sighed and took a last sip of his scotch then set it down and clicked on the phone van de vliet had rented a small villa half a mile down the lakeshore south from the institute and he lived alone until recently hed been sleeping in the lab there was no encrypted phone where he lived so this had damned well better be brief karl its me how did it go today with the new beta prospect i contracted her to do some work here hoping to do my part to get her with the program i was expecting to hear from you by now ive met with her and she had a stress test this afternoon in the city other than the aortic stenosis she seems to be in superb shape which is important im assumingmake that hopingthat shell come back in the morning and formally enter the clinical trials ill let you know if she does till that happens i have no progress to report all right but how soon after that do you think you could get started with the beta matter there was a pregnant pause and then wb we truly need to talk and maybe not on this line just before i left the lab i ran another simulation on the mothership to try to figure out what dosage level of beta enzyme would be safe but its like trying to extrapolate backwards and i just dont have enough data im beginning to wonder if using her to try to create telomerase antibodies is actually such a good idea its just so risky his voice trailed off karl everything in life is a goddam risk i know im supposed to be the beneficiary here but if the antibody concept works out we might still be able to do something for beta one im already doing everything i know how for her thats a tragedy were all still in denial about and now were talking about risking yet another woman yes maybe its the answer but for now i dont know what a safe dosage of enzyme should be it has to be enough to generate the antibodies but not so great that you know what im talking about i sure as hell do bartlett thought im looking at the syndrome myself karl just think of what it could mean if you could get the beta to work the way the other procedures do what great medical discovery didnt have a few missteps at the beginning this is experimental medicine that could change the world so dammit weve got to take risks why are we having this conversation at this time of night over an unsecure phone because we dont have a lot of time bartlett growled weve got nineteen days left on the clinical trials thats certainly enough time to conclude the procedure on her heart but if we also try to karl bartlett said its the beta we should be focusing on im looking at the syndrome myself now though i think ive got the strength of will to handle it my mind is a lot stronger than kris beta ones but i dont want to have to find out youve got to get this fucking problem fixed if we do use her i cant begin to tell you how unethical this is about to become bartlett wanted to remind van de vliet that ethics were the least of their problems at the moment but that wasnt the kind of thing you aired over an unsecure phone connection karl just fucking do it he said finally if shes not under way with the beta before the end of this week ethics are not going to be your primary concern i may have to revisit some of our agreements cross me and you forfeit a lot all right he sighed i know what i can do to make sure shes in good do it whatever it is he now had to warn van de vliet about stone aimes but how much information should he provide he quickly decided to keep it simple oh and as though we didnt already have enough problems theres something else i need to alert you about theres a smartass reporter from the new york sentinel nosing around yesterday he got to my legal department and asked about beta one though he doesnt know her name yet he somehow found out she was terminated from the clinical trials please tell me you havent been talking to the press behind my back my god ive been waiting for this to happen van de vliet sounded like someone who had just had the wind knocked out of him you know grant once mentioned that a reporter had been pestering him about getting an interview with me when maybe two months ago possibly three first ive heard about it bartlett said i wish hed told me i could have taken steps it might be the same person now that i think about it i do remember he mentioned the sentinel how much do you think he knows im not sure the question in my mind is how did he find out about her in the first place hes supposedly doing a book about us karl a book about this project well thats the first ive heard about that christ a book i think hes just fishing at the moment but this should be a warning weve got to keep security tight what do you know about him is he good yes bartlett thought hes damned good the truth is im almost proud of him sometimes hes the medical columnist for the paper so happens i own the building where their editorial offices are i dont have time to read newspapers well hes good enough that we may have to handle him somehow what are you trying to say van de vliet asked though he sounded like he already knew what im saying is hes a pro and i get the strong impression hes hungry hungry for money or for fame if i knew that id know what to do next bartlett said probably some of both he thought if the kid is anything like his old man then why dont we give him an interview meet the whole matter headon ive always found it better to shape the news yourself rather than trying to stonewall which usually means a lot of speculation ends up getting published and then you have to correct it after the fact its also the best way to find out how much a reporter already knows idiot bartlett thought thats the worst possible thing we could do this kid would have your balls for a bow tie karl youve just provided a perfect illustration of why i have my own people handling the press some amateur like you starts talking to a guy like that and the next thing you know you might as well be on sodium pentathol again his name is stone aimes remember it and dont ever even think about exchanging a single word with him wb my experience is that you can only stonewall the press for so long if theyre any good at all sooner or later theyre going to find out more than you want them to the only way to forestall that is to parcel them carefully controlled information to work with trust me ive had a little experience with reporters too you cant treat them like theyre complete dolts you have to coopt them bring them into your confidence and then convince them that its in everybodys interest for them to help you rather than harm you so why dont you let me talk to this guy we could always start off with the carrot and then move on to the stick this conversation is making me very nervous karl i dont want you or any of your people within a mile of him i mean it goddamit with which winston bartlett slammed down the phone shit what are we going to do so far van de vliet hadnt helped kristen in the slightest okay she wanted to try the beta but still what happened was a tragedy and who are we kiddingstone wasnt going to back off seeing his natural and only son again after a lot of years had shaken him up more than he had expected at some level he wanted to feel proud of his own flesh and blood but now if anything got published about the syndrome the financial consequences could be devastating stone aimes had to be kept at bay long enough to complete the buyout unfortunately it might come to involve force he smiled to think that kenji noda would be ready for that challenge but overt violence really wasnt winston bartletts style at least it hadnt been his style up to now but he was staring at the horrific possibility of the syndrome starting very soon a lot of things might have to be handled differently chapter wednesday april o am ally was walking down the secondfloor marble hallway of the dorian institute feeling a mixture of hope and dread shed parked her blue toyota in the same slot shed done the day before and then shed gone through the security check at the front entrance which included verifying again a solid id and a check for any kind of camera or recording equipment maria did not come along she was using this as an occasion to have some welldeserved time off with her grandchild the caregiver was giving herself some care the downstairs foyer had been empty except for security and staff and shed paused just long enough to sign in and ask the receptionist at the central desk which room nina hampton was in was her mother going to be as enthusiastic about being here today as shed been yesterday truthfully just to see her spirits immediately improve yesterday was a high in itself but who knew maybe she could be helped i think shes let me check shed pulled up a computer screen right mrs hampton is in room twothirteen second floor shed looked up and smiled your mother i assume shes quite a card i hear shes doing very well you can use the elevator over there ill take the stairs ally had said they were wide and blue marble and had a kind of splendor as they seemed to literally flow down from the upstairs landing i didnt have my run this morning the marble hallway upstairs showed no signs of use the place felt more like a grandiose palace from another time than a hospital doing cuttingedge research there was a nurses station at the far end of the hall and two women were there in blue uniforms other than that however there was nothing to suggest the dorian institute was a medical facility it could easily have been an exclusive resort hotel it didnt feel medical or aseptic in any way stone should see this she thought hed definitely be impressed driving out this morning alone shed been thinking about him a lot there was something about him that was different from what shed remembered over all the years he was as serious as ever about his work but she suspected he might possibly be more fun now that he seemed to have lightened up some he used to be wound extremely tight in any case she was finding herself surprisingly happy to talk to him again whether or not it went any further but was his concern about the mysterious terminated patient justified and what if anything did that have to do with her she was still musing about that when she heard the spanish language tv going in room even before she touched the doorknob thats a good sign she thought she pushed open the door and strode in the room was decorated in earth tones including a lovely brown handwoven carpet which had indian symbols in it probably navajo the bed was a single but it was faux early american not a hospital bed again the place felt more like a resort than a research institute nina was sitting up leaning against the headboard and wearing blue silk pajamas underneath a white bed coat mom howre you feeling you look great it was true she was wearing a lull complement of makeup and her hair looked like itd been newly washed whatever else was going on the dorian institute was making sure patients looked their best do they have a beautician on staff she wondered also there was a sparkle in her mothers eyes that she hadnt seen since before her father died how does it look like im feeling nina reached for the remote and muted the sound from the tv yes that old twinkle is definitely there gee i have to say that you seem a lot better than you did yesterday it was true thank goodness she was having one of those supercogent days she laughed deep and resonant ally you have no idea he started in with the injections yesterday evening after you left when i woke up this morning i could remember everything that happened yesterday i even remembered why i was in this strange place try me ask me something and see if i can remember it go ahead ask me anything okay she thought a moment it should be something easy when was dads birthday march twelfth she didnt even hesitate youll have to do better than that how about my birthday you couldnt remember it last week nina paused and looked disoriented for a moment uhoh ally thought i pushed her too hard it was october third a smile abruptly took over her face as though she was experiencing a live breakthrough you were born at roosevelt hospital at threeforty in the afternoon mom this is incredible she was joyously stunned though it felt like something resembling shock its a miracle your mothers responsiveness is impressive karl van de vliet said as he strode through the open door startling her ellen will run the first battery of monitoring tests later this morning shortterm memory and the like but from all appearances theres been a lot of tissue regeneration under way overnight is is this permanent ally asked not wanting to let herself get her hopes up too soon and what is he doing no one can answer that question he looked at nina and smiled but this is not some drug regimen to trick the brains chemistry mrs hampton you have my word in alzheimers tissue responsible for the production of certain neurotransmitters dies what were doing here is enabling your brain to regrow healthy longlived tissue to replace what has become damaged and destroyed by an excess of the wrong lets just say were not trying to salvage damaged tissue were actually replacing the dysfunctional tissue in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain so were working with the body and youre responding wonderfully he turned back to ally ive got to get back to the lab now come on down when youre ready and well finish the paperwork she started to say she wanted to ask him to linger a moment and answer a few questions but before she could hed disappeared into the hallway ally i havent felt this alive in months nina bubbled on dr vee did a minor procedure late yesterday afternoon using local anesthesia then he did something in his laboratory and came back and gave me an injection then there was another one this morning its supposed to continue for a week or two ellen said shell be giving me one of those little memory tests every day to see if im improving but you know i already know i can tell a difference its just been overnight but i swear some of the haze is already gone im so happy for you ally felt a surge of joy already she was thinking about some new trips they could take together come over here and sit by me she said patting the bed i was thinking about arthur again this morning if doctor vee can do something for your heart it would be a miracle that would have meant so much to him its just so sad he cant be here to see this as ally settled next to her nina reached over and took her hand i want to ask you something darling just between us why do you think seth grant is doing this for me for us what do you mean ally was trying to read her thoughts wondering where the topic was headed nina had declared on sunday that she thought there was something evil about grant now this i hate to say it about my own son but caring is not his first nature mom we see him so seldom do you really think either one of us still understands him nina and grant had never been all that close in fact hed always been something of a secretive loner within the family even though he was very much an extrovert with his friends of which he had many or at least used to ally had left for college just as he reached high school which meant she wasnt around during his impressionable teen years and when she came back to take over citispace he was virtually a fugitive from the family i remember plenty about him you think i dont know my own son lord help me well mom im not really prepared to talk about him it was so upsetting just to see him i couldnt really take everything in she smiled and touched ninas brow which felt warm and flush but ill tell you something i am taking in youre really looking great i dont know what hes doing but hope darling its the greatest tonic in the world even if theres no good reason for it she squeezed allys hand and i do so wish arthur could be here now i miss him so much i know mom he was as much a friend to me as he was a dad she thought back fondly over her fathers many passions and how shed shared a lot of them with him one had been the nineteenthcentury romantic poets particularly wordsworth and shelley then hed had his astronomy period and theyd spent a lot of time together at the planetarium but he took an interest in her passions as well when at age eight she decided to collect coins he went to the bank and brought back rolls and rolls of dimes and nickels for her to go through and during the summertime hed take her and grant on the lirr to long beach every other sunday all summer long that was why the pain the personal loss of his horrible death had never fully subsided perhaps it never would but the difference between them was that he had finally lost his will to live whereas ally found her own will growing all the more with every new adversity she faced the weaker her heart got the more determined she was to exercise whatever it took to make it strong again he would be so proud of the way you pulled citispace back from the brink she let a tear slide down her left cheek smearing her makeup and ill tell you something else young lady you take after us both when it comes to guts my memory may be slipping but i remember you were always willing to take chances and i guess thats what were doing here now both of us were gambling on life in your case youve got a lot to lose ally looked at her nina was having one of her moments of incredible lucidity but how did she know so much about what was really going on mom did the doctor tell you what i the head nurse ellen told me that youre going to undergo a procedure for your heart that youre going to start today her eyes darkened she also admitted hed never used the procedure on a condition like yours its completely experimental you talked to her this morning she took me downstairs where they did my hair she said dr vee thinks its important for everyone here to have a positive attitude they ask you what youd like and then they try to do it now im ready for whatever comes next she stared directly into allys eyes but that doesnt mean i still cant be nervous about all this untried stuff mom dont worry about me im going to get through this if youll be strong for me i promise ill be strong for you she got up and walked to the window from this vantage she could just see the lake down through the trees they were starting to put out leaves but it was still early spring and nippy here so they mostly had just buds all the same there was a sense of renewal about them which made her think of her own body life is so bittersweet nina sighed but you still want to go on living even when its a daily struggle either im an optimist or im pigheaded youre just wonderful ally said thats what you are she glanced down at her watch she was scheduled to meet ellen ohara downstairs at ten fortyfive to fill out the paperwork that formally entered her into the clinical trials if she decided to go ahead and enroll this would be her last day of freedom tomorrow she would have to begin the intense phase of the therapy did she really want to do that she wanted to talk to van de vliet one last time look mom im going to be downstairs for a while now but ill come back up later all right ellen said theres a little library here somewhere so i may go down and look i might even get something in spanish to try and keep my mind alert she sighed oh ally i so want to be the way i was again pray for me ally knew prayer wasnt something her mother engaged in a lot in fact shed always been a fervent agnostic what had brought about the change was it that shed finally discovered that both her body and mind had limits and wouldnt do what she wanted forever ill pray for us both mom but were going to be okay i have faith good for you she looked away ill try to have it too ally walked over and kissed her then turned and headed out the door where was this all going to end she had absolutely no idea but with ninas miracle change overnight the concern shed heard in the voice of stone aimes seemed a million miles away as she walked down the marble stairs she tried to take the measure of the place the dorian institute did inspire you with its look of utter perfection it was an appropriate setting for miracles when she got to the lobby she saw ellen stepping off the elevator coming up from the basement all set to get going she asked walking over before we start any procedures anything at all weve got to fill out the forms for the nih technically what is going on here is a clinical trial a very detailed study in which we constantly monitor the patients and try to measure their progress objectively so well have to take some time and establish a very thorough baseline we began that yesterday when you went to the clinic in new york for a stress test among other things well be running an ekg on you here on a daily basis and all this goes into my nih files ally asked they were getting on the elevator to go down not the raw data its our job to structure our patients files in ways that will permit the nih monitor or other third parties to assess our results quickly they were getting off now entering the starkly lit hallway that connected the laboratory and dr van de vliets office with the examination rooms dr vee is working in the lab this morning so we can use his office to fill out all the forms ally could see dr van de vliet and three other people members of his research team all dressed in white clustered around a blackboard where he was drawing some kind of flowchart again she was struck by his youthful appearance he surely did not look a day older than forty or fortyfive tops this was the first time she had been in his office and she paused to look around as was usual he had a wall of framed diplomas and certificates from her cursory checkout they seemed to correspond to the educational history she remembered from his cv it was a spacious room with an executive feeling and he had an expensive fiatscreen nineteeninch monitor sitting on the lefthand side of his desk next to it was a wooden table and chairs a pile of nih forms was there along with a green raku mug filled with ballpoint pens he likes to let people use his office whenever possible ellen explained its a lot less institutional than the conference room ally settled at the table and picked up the form they want a lot of personal information ellen went on but your mother and i filled out her items yesterday and it wasnt too hard needless to say all personal information is completely confidential even your name after the first week we only identify you with a coding system as ally was reaching for a pen a petite blond woman with a smashing figure strode through the door she was wearing a lab coat not a nurses uniform but it still showed off her curves she was carrying a stainlesssteel tray containing a hypodermic needle and three glass vials hi she said with a smile im dr connolly welcome to the dorian institute were all very excited about having you here deb come in ellen said seeming slightly startled is there something we forgot to no i just need to take one hundred fifty milliliters of blood weve got to get started on the cultures well be using asap hang on a second ally said i was hoping to talk this over a bit more with dr van de vliet before i take the final leap youre free to dither as much as you like dr debra connolly said her smile vanishing but our programs are on a schedule id still ill just be taking a small amount of blood we can then get started on the cultures while you talk she was already swabbing allys arm and feeling for a vein now make a fist ally hated giving blood and to distract herself she glanced around the office trying to construct a life story for dr karl van de vliet then she noticed a photo of him and a woman standing together on a bridge next to a sign that said charles river which meant boston and they were holding hands and smiling the odd thing was the cars behind them were models at least fifteen years old yet he looked just the same as he did today whoa there it is again that odd age thing there is something very strange about this man she finally got up her courage to ask dr connolly do you know how old dr van de vliet is he looks so young there are some things its not polite to ask she was capping off the vial and reaching for a second her voice had grown genuinely frosty frankly i dont see why he knows everything there is to know about me he has all my files you could ask at the front desk for one of our brochures im sure it would clear up any questions you have she attached the second vial to the needle ive seen it i know when he went to school and all that but still if you really want to know personal things you might just ask him yourself you two seem to get along so well what is with her ally puzzled why is she being so hostile and negative and why that little jab about getting along the truth was debra connolly could have been a runway model but in a lab coat her blondness and figure just intensified her bitchiness okay maybe the question about his age wasnt overly relevant more a matter of idle curiosity but how did he do it every woman alive would like to know maybe the story grant had told about van de vliet and his experimental skin treatment was actually true she hadnt put much stock in it at the time but seeing him out here in the flesh theres actually something else i was curious about was a patient dropped from the trials a few months back i was wondering if you could tell me anything about that what have you heard that would make you ask such a question debra connollys face went blank but her blue eyes registered alarm no one here is allowed to discuss specific cases that would be a violation of nih rules and highly unethical what made you ask that question hey why so defensive could it be stone is on to something that needs more daylight i did a little research on the gerex corporation and then she had an inspired hunch you know the nih has a web site where they post all the clinical trials they have under way this was actually something she knew to be true she had used the site to look up information about possible clinical trials for alzheimers patients that might accept her mother but she never could find any in the new york area that seemed to offer any hope so naturally your study was there i like to know as much as i can about what im getting into ive been to that web site many times the public part doesnt include so has a patient ever been terminated ally cut her off hoping to avoid being caught in a lie if so id really like to know why no one is allowed to discuss any details of the clinical studies she was capping off the last vial of blood the three cylinders of red against the steel i think im going to have a talk with dr van de vliet before i go any further with this program ally said feeling her temper and her warning instincts both ratchet up i feel like im being stonewalled youre free to think what you like debra connolly had turned and was brusquely heading for the doorway when it was blocked by another blonde this one in her late fifties who was standing in the threshold and brandishing a black automatic pistol her eyes were wild the security guard from the entrance and the nurse from the front desk upstairs were both cowering behind her wheres kristen she demanded wheres my daughter i know shes alive goddam you ive come to take her home chapter wednesday april am who are you and how did you get in here debra connolly demanded backing away from the door and quickly settling her steel tray onto a table ally got the instant impression that deb knew exactly who she was the womans hair was an ash blond tint above dark roots and was clipped short in a curt style her troubled face had stress lines and her heavy makeup reminded ally of a younger sylvia miles or perhaps a particularly intense real estate agent except that real estate agents dont charge in on you brandishing a beretta its all been a lie the woman declared her cigarettefogged voice shrill if she recognized debra it wasnt apparent ellen hit a button on the desk and spoke into the intercom dr vee could you please come to your office immediately its an emergency theres someone here who youre damned right its an emergency the woman barked at her hadnt you better give me the gun debra asked holding out her hand and stepping toward her the woman turned and trained the pistol on her just back off sister and keep out of this i know you work for him but youre just a flunky then could you at least keep your voice down debra connolly said her composure hard as ice the jab had bounced right off underneath the beauty pageant exterior she was all steel and sinew there are patients upstairs the hapless security man whod been trailing behind the woman had gone over to the positivepressure door of the laboratory and was desperately banging on the glass and waving for dr van de vliet a moment later he strode out still wearing his white lab jacket you the woman hissed turning to meet him youre the one who has her you and that bastard bartlett madam i must ask you to leave he said warily as he came up to her immediately he glanced down at the pistol otherwise ill have to call the police although he was giving the impression that the woman was just an anonymous annoyance ally was sure she caught a glimmer of recognition and a patina of poorly disguised panic in his eyes i want to see kristen damn you i want to know what youve done with her to her you and that bastard winston bartlett who got her into kristen he seemed puzzled then he appeared to remember there was a patient here briefly a while back who i believe was named kristen starr thats right you fucker and you damned well do remember her and me shes my daughter where is she my god ally thought could she mean that kristen starr the one who had an interview show on cable the world around this institute just keeps getting smaller ally had actually done an interiordesign project for kristen starr back when she was first getting up to speed at citispace it was one of her first jobs at that time kristen had just signed a twoyear contract with e and she wanted to renovate her coop in chelsea but then just as the job was completed she sold the place and moved to a brownstone in the west village or so shed said ally didnt know why she had done it or where precisely she had moved to but she got the impression some very rich new sugar daddy was setting her up and he wanted the privacy of a town house could it be that kristen was the mysterious missing patient stone was trying to locate and interview ally hadnt seen her on tv for a while so maybe she had moved on to other things i really dont know where she is now van de vliet said she became emotionally unstable in the middle of her treatment its a rarity but it has happened she checked out after that i dont thats a damned lie the woman declared i know it now thats what your receptionists have been telling everybody it sounded a little like her at first but now i realize its preposterous she didnt just up and run off youre keeping her somewhere where is she wheres my only child wherever she is i can assure you shes most assuredly not here van de vliet intoned smoothly even as his eyes struggled to stay calm would that she were she wanted a procedure done and i think we were having some success but then she became traumatized for some reason best known to her and insisted on leaving no one is forced to complete the regimen here against their will as best i recall someone said she went to a spa in new mexico i know thats what your flunkies have been telling me over the phone that she went to new mexico to hide out but now i know everybody lied to me for the last three years shes been sleeping with that bastard winston bartlett but now his office wont even return my phone calls you all think youre so smart but i could smuggle a gun past your guards in my bra her eyes had acquired a further kind of wildness now as she awkwardly began opening her purse hanging from a shoulder strap with her left hand while still holding the pistol in her right and i got a letter from her just this morning the postmark is new york city so what van de vliets eyes began to blink rapidly shes not in new mexico now if she ever was the woman waved a small tan envelope at him there was large loopy writing on the outside could could i see that he started to reach for it but she waved the black beretta at him and shoved the letter back into her purse no you cant what you can do is tell me where the hell youre keeping her now before we proceed any further that gun really isnt necessary van de vliet said as he reached and deftly seized her wrist he was quick and his quickness seemed to spook her because just as he turned the pistol away it discharged the round went astray ricocheting off a metal lighting fixture at the end of the hallway and into the wall the hapless unarmed guard whod followed her downstairs yelled and dived behind a large potted corn plant near the office door both ellen ohara and debra connolly just stared momentarily too stunned to move ally stepped toward the woman wanting to help van de vliet disarm her she was feeling her heart race dangerously upward van de vliet was still struggling with the woman when the beretta discharged again this time it was aimed downward at the hard tile floor and the ricochet was not so harmless the round bounced back and caught the woman in the chest knocking her sideways van de vliet unsuccessfully grabbed for her as she crumpled ally reached for her too but by that time she was already on the floor ally pulled the hot pistol from her fingers then turned and handed it to ellen here for gods sake do something with this she realized she had never actually held a real pistol before blood was flowing across the floor as van de vliet and debra connolly began tearing open the womans blouse the bullet appeared to have entered her chest just below the rib cage a jagged wound caused by the projectiles tumble and splattered shape and then exited a few inches away at her side she had passed out get a gurney now he yelled to ellen weve got to get her into or one and try to do something about the bleeding my god ally marveled what desperation drove her to threaten him with a gun when she obviously didnt know the first thing about how to use it the womans open purse was lying no more than two feet from where she had fallen with the hallway rapidly filling as nurses from upstairs poured off the elevator no one was paying any attention to anything but the prostrate woman get the letter ally she gingerly moved over to where the purse was resting and peeked in there was a jumble of the usual things cosmetics a ballpoint a change purse an address book and a billfold there also was the tan envelope yes the scene in the hallway was increasingly chaotic two of the researchers from the laboratory had come out in their sterile whites with disinfectant and a roll of bandages as they began to bind her wound to stanch the bleeding her eyelids fluttered and she groaned shes just in shock van de vliet said with relief ellen page michael and tell him to bring the ambulance around front just in case but i think we can handle this here now two nurses were rolling a gurney off the elevator while van de vliet and the two lab researchers lifted her onto it ally realized that nobody seemed to think that calling the policeabout any of thiswould be a constructive step she pulled out the letter and examined it the oversize script on the front read katherine starr east st st there was no return address katherine starr she was repeating the name and address trying to lodge them in her memory while she was pulling the letter out of the tan envelope it was in the same rotund script as the address dear whoever you are i think you re my mother but im not sure please help me i dont know where i am or what my name is but i found a bracelet with starr on it and i looked in the phone book your name sounded kind of familiar i think im id better take that van de vliet said lifting the letter out of allys hands all her personal effects should be kept with her dr vee or one is open ellen was saying as she marched down the hall toward them debra has the iv and oxygen ready good he said glancing at her for a second as he did ally reached into katherine starrs purse and palmed the small black address book then van de vliet turned back to her let me see about her bleeding and then ill try to explain i now remember this woman all too well its all coming back like a bad dream id repressed i pegged her as schizophrenic the minute i saw her when she came here and tried to talk her daughter into leaving shes paranoid and what was kristen starr here for ally asked i actually did an interiordesign job for her a few years back and she never mentioned any health issues actually nothing he declared quickly she was having an early midlife crisis i gather shed had some kind of television program and her contract wasnt renewed shed decided it was because of her appearance he shrugged and gestured with empty palms iike how absurd but thats the way some women are it turned out we had a mutual acquaintance who told her about the stem cell procedure here at the institute when he brought her in i wasnt in a position to turn her away that wouldnt be winston bartlett by any chance he nodded as a matter of fact he writes the checks so he has a certain amount of influence around here as it happened i had experimented with a procedure some years ago involving stem cells and the epidermis there seemed to be a regenerative effect and i thought there was a reasonable chance she might respond to it since we had clinical trials for other stem cell procedures already under way it was easy to fit her in but i had a lot more important things going on at the time than her cosmetic work so i didnt pay much attention to her then she abruptly left and since then ive had so much else happening i just havent thought about her was it not working is that why she left some of the staff swore it was having results the truth is i wasnt following her very closely in my honest opinion stem cell technology shouldnt be used for cosmetic purposes it borders on the obscene whoa ally thought according to grant you experimented with a procedure for the skin on yourself and youve got the youthfullooking skin to prove it lets not have the pot calling the kettle black here but if it was working then why did she decide to stop this story sounds way too pat she thought youll have to ask someone closer to her maybe she didnt think it was how about winston bartlett i gather hes pretty close well shes a touchy subject with him good luck van de vliet hesitated and his face flushed but now i really have to get in there im responsible for whatever happens around here particularly whatever bad that happens he was heading down the hall one last thing if kristen is here in new york then how could i contact her i have absolutely no idea he said over his shoulder if her own mother couldnt find actually you might check with the front desk all clinical trial participants are here under a confidentiality agreement which means that giving out any information about her would be a liability issue but now see if they have a prior address they can give you after she left it never occurred to me to pursue her he was going through a door marked or but then he revolved back there was a darkness in his eyes she hadnt seen before i guess im wondering why exactly youre so interested in this deranged girl it has no bearing whatsoever on your own treatment its just something im curious about she stopped her emotions in a jumble what is going on you know im wondering if maybe we shouldnt start my procedure later in the week all this guns and shooting is a bit much for me to take in she looked at him i guess i cant remember ever seeing anyone pull a pistol on their doctor before i can understand your disquiet he said his eyes dimming even more but id really hoped we could get started today i should be free in an hour or so and we can ive given the blood sample you wanted but ive just had the fright of my life i want to go up and see mom again and then i want a day to recharge get hold of stone she was thinking and then try to find kristen something feels very nonkosher here just be aware he went on that this procedure cant wait forever i told you that we have less than three weeks left at the end of the month the clinical trials will be completed and this facility could be temporarily closed because of corporate restructuring what is he talking about corporate restructuring you re pressuring me again she thought i really dont like that it can wait for a day all right if you must but thats it we have to start tomorrow seriously he came back and reached and took her hand this means a lot to me alexa i really want to help you and i truly think we can with that he turned and walked into the or she stood watching for a moment and when he was definitely gone she took the small black leather volume out of her waistband on a hunch she opened it to the first page and sure enough there it was penciled in down one side kristy no last name and no address the rest of the book had only a dozen entries so few that ally wondered why katherine starr bothered carrying it compulsive maybe she couldnt wait to get to her car and get on the phone to stone kristen starr could well be the mystery patient he was looking for in any event she was missing freaked out unsure who she was and probably in a lot of trouble but now they had a phone number chapter wednesday april pm you think youve got what stone aimes sounded like hed just won the lottery for the patient who was terminated my god ally youre incredible possibly but what i know i am is very worried for one thing if this is the person youre looking for the one who got dropped from the trials its somebody youve probably heard of and for another ive just had a series of very disturbing experiences shed called him on her cell phone the minute she cranked up her toyota to return to the city she couldnt get away from the dorian institute fast enough after leaving karl van de vliet shed taken the elevator up to the second floor to check in on nina whats all the excitement her mother had asked one of the nurses just told me that a deranged woman with a gun barged into the lobby looking for dr vee then she shot herself its nothing mom everything is all right now she hadnt wanted to upset nina but she was convinced karl van de vliet had just done some major lying his uneasy body language told her he knew a lot more about kristen starr than he was admitting for that matter debra connolly probably did too well thank goodness nina had said are you going to start the procedure for your heart today not yet i want another day to think about it but tell me how youre doing really i mean are you comfortable with how everythings going here you can still stop if things dont feel right ally half wanted to get her out of the dorian institute immediately she didnt know what either of them had stumbled into she just knew now that along with the possibility of miracles the dorian institute had a lot of questions that needed straight answers she no longer trusted karl van de vliet she had seen his facade crack momentarily and what lay beneath it made her very uncomfortable furthermore she thought he realized she knew he was lying and it seemed to make him even more desperate to keep her there ally what a silly thing to say of course i want to stay shed fluffed up her pillow and reached for the tv remote some of the smoke has already been blown out of my mind im feeling clearer by the minute theres surely got to be some placebo effect at work here ally thought but still she does seem more aware okay mom im going back into the city now but ill be here tomorrow and every day to check on you just dont dont let them do anything to you that seems strange with that she had given nina a kiss on the forehead and taken the marble stairs down to the firstfloor reception it was now time to find kristen starr the nurse at the desk was a woman named may gooden the main floor had returned to normal after all the excitement with patients passing through as they came back from the cafeteria ally had decided to try a long shot and see if she could pry out any information about kristen from the patient files she asked pointblank i guess dr van de vliet was not aware of the legal strictures in our nih agreement may had said no personal information can be released without a patients signed authorization you do remember her being here though kristen starr my lord thats not something that goes unnoticed she had an assumed name but everybody knew who she was a nice girl nicer than youd expect from seeing her on television so when exactly did she leave surely you can tell me that harmless piece of information it was several months ago right may got a strange look in her eyes who told you that i i was downstairs when her mother showed up i just got the impression that it was may glanced furtively around i shouldnt be telling you this but the truth is i think she was still here until just a few days ago she was down in intensive care no nursing staff is allowed down there just those medicalresearch people he has working for him what some of the nurses call the gang of four but they brought her up in the elevator and then an ambulance took her away when precisely was ive said too much already she glanced around again and i can assure you that kristen didnt sign an authorization to give out her personal information she abruptly turned frosty and officious as though rethinking how open shed just been what was she afraid of now if youll excuse me ive got some things i need to do ally had nodded and thanked her and split thus the search had already produced an interesting factoid karl van de vliet was most assuredly engaged in the practice of a big lie about kristen maybe you should start by telling me about the disturbing experience stone was saying as the shadows of the trees that lined the leafy driveway glided past the toyotas windshield she told him about katherine starr and kristen starr she also told him the disparate versions of kristens departure as recounted by van de vliet and may gooden sounds like theyve got a situation stone declared theyre trying to hide somebody whos well known but youve got a number like i said i palmed katherines little black book and its got what could be the last known phone number for kristen since she probably left the institute in an ambulance a few days ago i doubt if shes at that number now but its someplace to start i assume the area code is twoonetwo therere reverse directories where you can find the address for a phone number right in fact i think theres a site on the web that leave that part to me if the numbers still good ill have it in five minutes then ill call you back and maybe you could meet me there assuming its somewhere in the city just give me your cell number she did and then clicked off the handset my god she thought thats the first time ive given my number to a mannot a business acquaintancesince steve died okay there were dinners with a couple of bachelor clients that turned out to be more than dinner but neither relationship had lasted past a month both the men nice guys had complained she wasnt there for themshe wasntand had broken it off she meditated on that as she went through the iron gates which opened automatically and headed down the leafy twisting roadway leading to the expressway she also found herself wondering what stone aimes was really like there was an openness now that made her feel comfortablethough maybe that was just his deceptive reporters manner his calculating way of getting below her radar hed definitely picked up a few social skills over the past years god knows he needed them whatever was going on it was good to have him around again there was something different about talking to him than talking to jennifer though ally wasnt quite sure what it wasand she was afraid to think too hard about it but whatever that difference it was one of the million reasons she so missed having steve around because if there ever was a time when she needed somebody to talk to why am i thinking all this she chided herself im trying to psychoanalyze him and put him in a category when i dont know the first thing about what hes actually turned into after all this time is all the warmth and sincerity for real back in the old days hed make nice whenever the stakes were low but then when he had something on the line hed push as hard as he needed to get what he wanted well she reminded herself im that way too that was part of our problem the phone beeped voila stones voice announced i got an address in the west village its twoseventeen west eleventh street the phone is unlisted but its billed to her name so you were right about the number and get this it hadnt been turned off so i thought idiot why dont you do the obvious and just try calling but her mother said shed disappeared well thats highly plausible theres an answering machine there with a very strange message it doesnt give a name but its a womans voice and its like a cri de coeur shes away but shequotecant say where you should listen to it greenwood lake road had now become skyline drive for no discernible reason and the traffic was picking up ally put on some speed and passed a truck ill do that but we dont actually know for sure if its the same kristen starr though it surely has to be did you recognize her voice ive never watched her cable show i just sort of know who she is but youd better listen to her announcement how could there be two screwedup young women named kristen starr in the same town even if it is new york ill listen its got to be her though give me the address she hesitated a moment after he did then would you like to meet me there i think i could probably make it in an hour or an hour and a quarter to be safe we could ask around see if anybody in her building or the neighborhood has any idea whats going on with her maybe somebodys seen her i was supposed to head into the office but nothing could keep me away he declared with enthusiasm a patrol car was speeding by in the opposite direction siren blaring she waited for the noise to subside great ill try for an hour unless the traffic really gets crazy you never know what to expect at the gw bridge even in the middle of the day she clicked off the phone then checked the number in the front of the black address book and punched it in the phone rang twice and then an answering machine started the voice making the announcement sounded thin tiny and fragile just hanging on it was the verbal equivalent of the loopy handwriting on the letter a transparent attempt to bolster nonexistent courage hi im away for nowi cant say whereand im not sure when ill be back but you can leave a message or whatever in case i get a chance to pick them up at some point or you dont have to thats okay too what an odd thing to say ally thought its like she s trying not to sound too needful but it was definitely the kristen starr the slightly ditzy tone was right there next came a long series of beeps as the machine proceeded to rewind this is surreal she thought im about to leave a message for a person whos godknowswhere while the machine beeped she tried to rehearse what she wanted to say to make it as nonthreatening as possible finally the machine stopped rewinding kristen hi my name is ally hampton you may remember i did an interiordesign job for you when you lived in chelsea citispace i just met your mother she got your letter should i tell her about the gun accident ally wondered no shes weirdedout enough already your real name is kristen starr you seemed a little confused about that in your letter to her which i read part of youd been at the dorian institute in new jersey listen its really important to me and to your mother that you get in touch id like to help you if i can because from what i saw of your letter anyway let me give you my cell phone number if you pick this up you can call me anytime night or day its how did you get this number a frightened voice burst through ally recognized it though it was nothing like the one she remembered from the confident brassy tv personality that kristen used to be i just got away and came here and right after i got here someone called my machine and then hung up are you tracking me who are you i ally was so startled she couldnt think of anything to say immediately kristen is that you i just saw your mother i i got this number from her she came out to the dorian institute looking for you shes very worried about youre lying to me youre trying to trick me and get me back she was breathing heavily as though shed just run a set of stairs this is a person just barely holding it together ally thought anyway kristen is not my name my name is kirby they wrote it down for me and im very confused i found a bracelet in my suitcase that had starr on it maybe thats my last name it sounds right but i cant remember you dont remember having a show on cable i i think i knew someone who had a tv show but i dont think it was me kirby or whatever your listen carefully i think you were undergoing an experimental procedure for your skin at a place in new jersey called the dorian institute the doctor was karl van de vliet you were in clinical trials for the national institutes of health then something happened and you left do you remember why you left or when no she stifled a sob i cant remember anything ally took a deep breath not liking the vibes she was getting do you want to talk about it no i dont want to talk to you or to anybody i got out of that place and that place ally asked she was being passed by a huge bus and she could barely hear you mean the institute you know where i mean and dont come looking for me down here either because im not going to be here jesus ally thought whats with her kriskirby im not connected with anybody at the dorian institute im supposed to become a patient there myself im just trying to find out what happened to you when you underwent your treatment there i can only remember little things she was moaning there was this man he said i could have anything i wanted i trusted him and now i see faces but i cant remember who kristenthats your real name by the waycan we meet i promise you wont be harmed i just you dont understand do you you dont know whats happening to me her voice had begun to break its the beta i dont know how long its going to be before before what what beta what are youkristen weve really got to meet i mean it i desperately need to talk to you maybe we could find another doctor if thats what you need could i come down i have no idea who you are you could be he says theyre trying to help me but im not getting any better ally was pulling onto the interstate heading south it was hard to concentrate on driving but at the same time she wanted to push the speed limit kristen sounded like she was getting ready to disintegrate or flee then she had another thought kristen its okay if you dont trust me but could you tell me more about your side effects are they i think thats why he moved me to that place but then he she was growing even more agitated and impatient look i really cant talk anymore im losing her ally thought try to make her hang on kristen would you please take my phone number you sound like you could use a friend oh christ im so scared i dont just take it no harm then if something happens and you want to all right she said finally tell me and ill write it down ally gave it to her then added i run an interiordesign firm i actually did some work for you once so weve met you can call my office so let me give you that number too no way am i connected to the institute where you were she said she was writing it down you know kristen went on i think this is gods way of punishing me for wanting something nobody should have then she began to sob again how exactly i found a door that wasnt locked and i just came here i dont know what guided me and when i got to this street i knew exactly which building it was there was no name on my bell or anything but i knew i even knew who had my emergency key its like i have a sense memory of this apartment but i cant remember ever actually living here your name is kristen starr ally said again try to remember that and will you please stay there till i can get there and talk to you then she made what she immediately realized was a fatal mistake theres a reporter a sweet guy whos doing a book about a medical procedure at the clinic where you were and hes dying to talk to anybody whos been part of the clinical trials there could he talk to you too it sounds like youve got quite a story to tell youve got to be kidding if they find me i dont know what theyll do and the connection was severed shit dont do this she quickly tried the cell phone number for stone aimes its me again listen shes actually there kristens in the apartment on west eleventh street i just got off the phone with her shes the one you want but shes like a frightened rabbit she said she was about to leave but if you get there soon you might be able to catch her damn were stuck in traffic at fiftyninth street there was a fender bender on lex but ill get there as soon as i can okay maybe get your driver to try fifth good idea she clicked off and stared at the road the george washington bridge was just ahead if she broke the speed limit once she hit the west side highway and caught the lights right she might even beat stone there chapter wednesday april pm wb weve got a problem karl van de vliet said into the microphone he was in his private office on the scrambled videophone kristens mother showed up just before noon with a pistol demanding to know where she was when i tried to take the gun away from her she accidentally shot herself through the side fortunately it was only a flesh wound but it took us almost an hour to stabilize her christ even kristy thinks shes crazy why did she kristen smuggled her a letter somehow and she came looking for her he thought about how they shouldnt be having this conversation on any kind of phone even one that was supposedly scrambled but there was no choice it gets worse i just called eighteighty park and they checked her room and kristens not there she was there when roxanne brought up her breakfast at nine but nobodys seen her since they assumed shed gone back to sleep nobody there has any idea where she went shit what am i paying them for the staff is there for the sole purpose of making sure something like this didnt happen well wb thats your part of the show im just trying to practice medicine in any case she slipped out somehow so the thing now is where did she go well she didnt come here or at least she hasnt yet depending on how much she can still remember she might have gone to her old place down in the village maybe she still has a homing instinct thats probably the first location we ought to check jesus if she gets recognized and starts acting crazy and then cambridge pharmaceuticals finds out wb the bigger problem now could be her mother katherine you know her shes unbalanced but she also still remembers how it all started she was actually here a couple of times if she sees kristen then god help us karl ive got everythingand i do mean everything riding on this what happened with that hampton woman youve got to get started with her is she on board yet or what she was here this morning but she got temporarily spooked by the gun and the craziness shell be back though when i took care of it trust me van de vliet declared in the meantime ill try to maintain kristens mother under sedation as long as possible but we cant keep her out of touch forever that would be flirting with kidnapping ill send ken over to west eleventh street to check out her place bartlett said if shes there hell get her and he signed off the image on the computer going dark van de vliet felt a wave of apprehension every day it got worse would any of the other patients develop the syndrome or was its development unique to the beta kristen had agreed of her own free will to undergo the beta and shed been warned that any experimental procedure involved significant risk shed signed release documents absolving gerex of any liability but when treatments go awry patients tend not to recall the releases they signed undoubtedly shed now conveniently forgotten that fact assuming she still remembered anything time to go back to the or and see how katherine was doing if she seemed completely stabilized and coherent she could be moved down to the intensivecare area in the floor below the subbasement that way absolutely nobody could get to her he clicked off the computer and walked back to the or karl shes awake david said as he walked in hed been monitoring her its probably okay to move her thank god van de vliet thought maybe theres some way to reason with her rationally he moved over and looked down her hair was soaked with sweat and she looked very very tired mrs starr can you understand me im dr van de vliet i need to talk to you about your daughter kristen who who are you she mumbled her eyes trying to focus im kristens physician she came to see me some months back do you recall about her skin problem i seem to remember you came here with her at one point she stared at him mutely for a moment then closed her eyes and nodded at that time mrs starr we discussed some radical treatment options things that hadnt been tried before do you have any recollection of that she opened her eyes again and stared at him trying to focus you said shed be all right she mumbled slurring the words then your receptionist told me shed gone to new mexico but i got a letter that story was to protect her professionally he lied she was afraid the press might find out she was here and start speculating about her health but now shes in the postprocedure phase of treatment it may be a while longer before shes able to return to the normal life shes used to shes okay isnt she came a plaintive slurred mumble in her letter it sounded like shed lost her memory or something she didnt sound right it was a question that cut him to the core mrs starr i think we should focus on you right now youve had a traumatic episode and youve injured yourself pretty seriously you may have to stay here at the institute for a few days so we can take care of you he took her hand which felt deathly cold tell me is there anyone we should notify of your whereabouts so they wont be alarmed theres an address book in my purse her eyelids flickered those are all people im close to i just want to sleep i cant think now good he thought the sedative is finally kicking in all right you need your rest well talk about this later he turned and picked up the purse at the foot of the bed but when he searched inside he didnt see an address book where was it he wondered alexa hampton had started reading kristens letter which probably was part of the reason she got uneasy did she make off with the address book but why it didnt matter she would be back if debra had done what she was supposed to do david have mrs starr taken downstairs i need to see deb youve got it van de vliet went down the hall and then through the heavy steel air lock and into the laboratory deb can i have a word with you he motioned for her to follow him to the computer cubicle in the back past the headhigh racks of solvent vials and the giant autoclave is she going to be okay debra asked i think so its in her interest that we keep her here and away from a hospital gunshot wounds raise a lot of questions i seriously doubt that that pistol was licensed in her name given how little she seemed to know about its operation he settled into a chair and began stroking his brow did you manage to take care of that matter with alexa hampton she nodded you know shes not yet entirely with the program yes but she will be putting her mother in the clinical trials was probably crucial he grimaced god what a nightmare a medical experiment that got away from us has turned into guns and virtual kidnapping and god knows what manner of felonies if this thing gets completely off the track we could all go to prison but the real tragedy is that all the successful research weve done here will be buried in infamy its not going to turn out that way the results here have been so spectacular she was gazing at him with eyes that seemed too worshipful more and more she made him selfconscious she needed a father but he did not need a daughter he still lived on the memory of camille this has all got to be resolved soon deb theres a reporter who found out that we had to drop a patient from the programwhich would be kristenand wb thinks hes a little too close for comfort now kristens mother shows up its all starting to unravel dont worry she said getting up this hampton woman is going to be back today so ive got to get started on her blood chapter wednesday april pm ally was very fond of kristens west village neighborhood since she herself had once had an apartment on west eleventh street just west of seventh avenue the street was treelined and many of its nineteenthcentury town houses were home to single families though sometimes the ground floor with the entry under the stoop ie beneath the stairs was rented out to provide a little side income she had rented one of those garden apartmentsthe upstairs owners were two gay bankersand had loved it however it also was entirely possible that kristen had the whole town house to herselfthat was the kind of thing that a lot of celebrities who lived or even just spent time in new york did there was privacy and there also was the sense of living in an actual house instead of in some cookiecutter apartment then again she could have a downstairs neighbor a solitary town house seemed somewhat at odds with the extroverted personality kristen displayed on tv but the privacy was probably intended more for her sugar daddy winston bartlett than for her ally had been pushing the pace ever since she got off the phone with stone at twentythird street she had peeled off the west side highway and gone over to seventh avenue where she had a straight shot downtown she passed st vincents hospital and the notorious sixway intersection that caused so many accidents and hung a right on west eleventh she was approaching the corner at bleecker street when a huge black lincoln navigator lumbered in front of her at an angle that cut her off and blocked the street then the vehicle abruptly slammed to a halt what she hit her own brakes and managed to slide to a stop just before she collided with the lincolns rear bumper at first she thought theyd deliberately cut her off but then she realized the move had nothing to do with her a man and a woman were piling out he was muscular and balding with dark hair and sunglasses and he was dressed in black she had red hair streaked with white and was dressed in a nurses whites they were in a major hurry that was when she recognized the man shed met at gramercy park the japanese sidekick bartlett had called ken oh shit then she realized that a thirtyish woman was running down west eleventh street toward them carrying a dark green backpack in her left hand they were gesturing for her to come to them and get into the vehicle though she didnt appear to see them yet halfway down the block behind her a man in a tan flight jacket was running calling out kristen wait i just want to talk the running woman glanced over her shoulder at him and at that moment collided with bartletts flunky as she recoiled from the impact the redhaired woman seized her left arm kirby come the woman said youre not well well take you back no she yelled and twisted free of the womans grasp but now the japanese guy had grabbed her other arm its going to be all right he said as he caught the top of her head and started shoving her through the open door of the navigator you shouldnt go out alone at that moment the man in the tan flight jacket reached the scene it was stone but hed been moments too late he stretched his arm into the lincoln and tried to take the girls hand kristen dont go with them i just need to talk you dont need to do anything pal the man called ken declared except get out of the way he chopped the side of stones neck with an open hand sending him sprawling backwards onto the pavement flight jacket askew now something odd was going on another girl was running down the sidewalk kristy wait dont but the redheaded woman had already gotten into the backseat of the suv beside the girl and the japanese man was heading around the front three seconds later he was behind the wheel and peeling out they were gone ally sat watching stunned but now a chevy sedan was departing a parking space three cars down from where she was and she quickly pulled in by then stone aimes had picked himself up off the sidewalk and was gazing wistfully in the direction of the vanishing lincoln the girl whod been behind him stopped and was talking to him ally quickly locked the toyota and went over but why did she run stone aimes was asking he was disheveled but then being slugged and knocked to the sidewalk takes a toll on anybodys poise she didnt know who you were the girl replied she looked like she would have been more at home in the east village than here late twenties tattoo on one bicep eyebrows pierced blue jeans hair needing a better day she had serious acne scars on her cheeks i think she thought you were them whoever they were ally looked stone over and felt a surge of admiration in spite of the fact he just got decked there was an athletic feeling about the way he carried his body as though he was ready to pounce on a news source only he just didnt pounce quite fast enough this time she walked up and gave him a hug for a lot of reasons hey we cant go on meeting like this my god how humiliating he winced what in heavens name just happened that was kristen all right but why was she running from you i saw this woman walking very fast up the street carrying a backpack and i just took a shot and called out kristen she glanced back at me then took off like a rabbit all i accomplished was to drive her directly into the grasp of those goons you scared her the girl with the pierced eyebrows shouted gazing angrily at stone who are you why did you im a newspaper reporter he said who are you i sublet the garden apartment from her i met her when i was doing her makeup at the e channel i mentioned i was looking for a place and she said she liked me and wanted somebody she liked to be her subtenant the rent is really low then they canceled her show and she had a mental meltdown and went to a spa somewhere to regroup or at least thats what everybody at e says so thats definitely kristen starr ally asked i hadnt seen her in over five months not even to pay the rent and i couldnt believe it was her when she rang my bell and asked if she could borrow my copy of her key at first i almost didnt recognize her she looked different somehow the odd part was i got the impression that she didnt recognize me either at least for a minute or two when i asked her if she wanted the rent she just looked at me funny a few minutes later she brought the key back and she had a halfopen backpack stuffed with clothes and papers she seemed nervous and disoriented i was going to try and help her get a cab but then you showed up hey look i had no idea i was going to freak her out like that stone said whats your name ally asked and then she introduced herself my named is cindy dobbs and you know something kristen didnt seem like the same person in a lot of ways she looked really different i dont know how to explain it but something was really really wrong with her and she kept saying her name wasnt kristen that its something elsei cant remember what now all i know is she was totally spooked talk about bad timing stone said she was so paranoid she kept babbling about how they knew she was here in her apartment and were coming to get her and she had to get away real quick i dont know who she was talking about some guy used to come by and his white stretch limo would be doubleparked for a couple of hours while he went in but other than him nobody ever came here cindy the truth is i was talking to her this very morning on the phone ally said im the one who called her i also met her mother today who just got a crazy letter from her and was walking around with a pistol because of it im getting to be deeply invested in kristen starr something bizarre seems to have happened to her and i need to find out what it is ally didnt want to confess that she felt indirectly responsible for what had just occurred if she hadnt phoned she stood thinking a minute then did you say you had a key to her place cindy shrugged ive had it since i moved in we had copies of each others keys just in case you know she reached into her ragged jeans and pulled it out and stared at it it was attached to a blue plastic tab greenwich locksmiths then could we borrow it long enough to go in and take a look around maybe we could find some clue to whats going on hey if you want the key and you think it can help you find her you can just have it she was holding it out i dont want to go in there ever with my luck those people would show up again and take me away but let me know if you find out anything okay i really thought of her as a friend even though we actually didnt know each other that well she didnt ever introduce me to that older guy who came around probably because he was married at least thats my guess i think she knows those people who grabbed her just now ally said taking the key cindy can we exchange phone numbers sure i meant it about letting me know if you find out whats going on with her everybody at work is going to be really bummed when they hear about this moments later ally and stone were alone on the street with stone still appearing dazed now taking measure of him in the daylight she noticed a bit more of the mileage in his face and body still it was good mileage and it had left him seasoned and lean also she sensed that he really cared about things this was more like the man she remembered a mensch in wolfs clothing are you sure youre okay she asked im going to be fine he said jesus i never dreamed id spook her the way i did by the way did you get the license number of that lincoln i sure as hell didnt i didnt need it that guy is winston bartletts personal bodyguard he called him ken i was at bartletts place on gramercy park a couple of days ago and i saw him there youre not kidding are you i wish she paused you know kristen and bartlett were being talked about as an item back when page six the sentinel would never touch it but that was more than a rumor over the years ive had occasion to take more than a passing interest in his affairs he grinned and for the past several days hes been taking a lot more interest in my affairs ever since he found out about the book incidentally she declared i didnt have a chance to tell you on the phone but kristen seems to have no memory of who she is somebody told her that her name is kirby and thats what she insists on being called all in all she sounded deeply screwed up she dangled the key so why dont we go up and see if we can learn anything did it seem odd to you that whats her name cindy didnt want to go in with us he mused as they headed up the steps well maybe shes already seen it god only knows what were going to find though the place she had in chelsea was pretty well maintained after i redid it it was a knockout of course but shed already moved down here by then the building dated from the middle of the nineteenth century and the entryway painted white was a slight nod to the fashion for the greek revival style that made its way into the new york town houses of that period she shoved the key into the new lock a medico and pushed open the door stone moved past her and switched on the light what awaited them was a minimally furnished but elegant living room with a small couch and table the downstairs parlor floor had been opened up a lot of walls had been taken out and a staircase was on one side of the front room it felt like a modern loft memorabilia from e was all over the logo on throw pillows and two empty mugs on the table the main decoration however consisted of publicity photos of kristen around the walls a smiling blonde with flowing tresses down over her shoulders in all of them she was wearing heavy makeup and the photos appeared to have been airbrushed they were both trying to absorb what they were actually seeing each photo and there were at least sixteen was pinned to the walls with a steak knife all with matching white bone handles jesus who do you think did this stone asked could it be that ditzy girl downstairs id say she did it herself supposedly the reason she went to the dorian institute was because she was having some kind of personal crisis over starting to look older she was consumed with terminal selfhate thats what this has to be about ive never caught her on tv stone said walking over to study one of the photos but from what little i saw of her on the street just now she sure seemed different from these head shots well this is exactly how she looked on the tube she told him the alleged story of how kristen had ended up at the dorian institute then she gazed around the room still having trouble taking it in jesus this is really sick ally im absolutely convinced that whatever happened or didnt happenkeep that possibility in mindto kristen is connected somehow to the reason gerexs clinical trials have been put under ironclad security which is why no matter what theyve got to get her back on the reservation ally thought a moment van de vliet told me shed left the clinic of her own accord which clearly was bs winston bartlett has her stashed somewhere probably in an apartment in one of the buildings he owns she looked over what do you think it all means hows this for a guess kristen is experiencing some kind of side effect thats truly horrendous losing your memory is bad enough but theres probably something more too i cant imagine what it is but if the truth about it ever gets out their entire program of stem cell research would be jeopardized well i dont see much here to help us find her she declared looking around the knives in the walls dont speak well for her grip on sanity who knows maybe nothings physically wrong with her maybe its just all in her crazy head look at this place for goodness sake except for the knives it looks pretty normal maybe shes just a nutcase and imagining that her memory is going as she gazed around the room one last time she noticed an answering machine on the floor next to the couch the message light on it was blinking and she walked over and pushed the play button she remembered that stone had said he hadnt left a message and kristen had picked up when she called her shortcircuiting the voice mail the phone machine announced in an electronic voice you have one message at twoeleven pm then an unctuous male voice came on kirby we know youre there youre still in treatment you shouldnt be wandering around unsupervised its a lot better a lot safer for you to stay with us now this is ken im coming with delores to pick you up i know youre upset but you shouldnt be were going to take care of you and help you then the phone machine clicked off my god stone said glancing at his watch thats almost exactly when i got here thats why she thought i was with them thats the guy who slugged you i recognize his voice guess they suspected she was here and that phone call was intended to flush her out it worked and i ended up right in the middle of it damn she walked around the empty room checking it out except for the head shots stabbed to the wall there was not a scrap of paper to be seen so how do we find kristen without a clue she wondered should the kidnapping if thats what it was be reported to the police but what proof do we have that any of it actually happened theyre not going to thirddegree winston bartlett you know stone said staring closely at one of the photos i didnt actually get a really good look at the woman running down the street she glanced back at me when i called out her name but the truth is im not a hundred percent sure this is her come on ally said that had to be kristen the girl downstairs recognized her though she did say she looked different somehow youre going to think im crazy he went on still staring around at the walls but it seems to me the girl on the street was a lot younger than this one he bit a fingernail contemplatively christ this is some sick material stone im going down to my office to take care of some things and think about this come along if you like maybe weve overlooked something obvious something that that was when the beeper on his belt went off he looked down at the number whoops its my managing editor where you work right only ive got a feeling this call could be about how i used to work there chapter wednesday april pm ellen ohara rn who was in charge of the nursing staff at the dorian institute and chair of the union committee for the gerex corporation looked around the room which was a conference space just off the laboratory in the first level of the basement each of the three other nurses present reported directly to her and they had filed in casually one by one in order not to draw the attention of the research staff as they passed the laboratory they all sensed the imminence of crisis and this was a clandestine emergency meeting the appearance of katherine starr and the shooting that transpired had left the entire nursing staff in dismay of course they all remembered kristen starr the outgoing and scatterbrained tv personality who had arrived in the throes of a mental meltdown some also remembered her mother katherine who had made a nuisance of herself till she was refused further admittance on the orders everyone suspected of the owner winston bartlett who was widely reported to have a romantic relationship with the girl they also suspected that something had started going terribly wrong with kristens cosmetic procedure after seeming okay her behavior had suddenly become erratic and she had been immediately whisked into intensive care in the subbasement and quarantined before anybody on the regular nursing staff could learn what the problem was she was attended by the research team he had brought from california and the information officer at the registration desk in the lobby may gooden was instructed to say she had voluntarily left the program well maybe she had but she hadnt left the institute then less than a week ago she was rolled out on a gurney and loaded into the ambulance which was driven by winston bartletts japanese thug and taken god knows where ellen had checked and was dismayed though not entirely surprised to discover that none of this had been included in the weekly clinicaltrial reports being forwarded to the national institutes of health which in itself was a flagrant violation of procedural requirements and now this kristens own mother showed up deranged and carrying a pistol looking for her how much longer would it be before the nih or the police found out that something funny had gone on right now the first thing to do was to get the three senior nurses in the room to put a lid on the rumors they were her lieutenants it was their job elise baker single and sharp and acerbic was in charge of the second floor mary hinds a kindly mother of two had responsibility for the third floor and may gooden the queen of communication skills handled the reception and oversaw the staff responsible for the dining room all three were in their forties and they reported to ellen ohara who reported to karl van de vliet elise could you please close the door sure she was getting up is this the quorum you dont want anybody else here we have to decide what to do about katherine starr ellen began in my opinion the absolute first thing we have to do is make sure the story of what just happened never leaves this building well i think dr vee should call the police and have her arrested elise said as she quietly shut the door the very idea barging in here with a loaded gun i dont feel safe in the lobby anymore may gooden declared her face was lined and she had streaks of premature gray were all exposed out here in the middle of nowhere i think charles should have a pistol what good is it having a security guard if youre still not secure mary what do you think ellen asked she knew mary would always try to split the difference and reconcile differing opinions i dont know maybe it was just the case of one crazy person its probably not going to happen again okay ellen thought thats three different votes call the cops beef up security or put our collective heads in the sand she worried about the others but she was also worried about her own situation her husband harold left her eight years ago for a younger woman and after reclaiming her maiden name shed raised their two young sons on her own now the oldest eric was ready to start college and she had no idea how she was going to pay for it if she lost this job the gerex corporation paid her almost twice what she would be earning as an rn at an ordinary hospital with her current salary she had a shot at providing the boys with an education without itif gerex got embroiled in some horrible scandal and was put out of businessshe had no hope whatsoever even worse she might be named as being complicit in some unethical shenanigans knowingly putting a patient at risk in a human trial that would certainly drive a stake into the heart of her nursing career elise wed better think long and hard about bringing in the police they would talk to katherine and shed tell them kristen was missing and we simply have no idea where it would end she paused im about to say something i shouldnt but i guess this is the moment you all deserve to know an important fact the nih has not been told the reason kristen starr was terminated from the stem cell program how do you know that elise asked i just checked the reporting records call it a hunch we all know that for a formal clinical trial thats a flagrant violation of nih rules what are you saying mary asked her voice filling with alarm im saying we have no choice but to keep this whole matter of kristen and her mother under cover if the dorian institute gets caught tampering with the data from a clinical trial it could be the end of everybodys career dr van de vliets certainly but most probably ours as well my god elise blurted out did we have to wait till some crazy person with a gun barged in here before you got around to telling us that clinicaltrial data had been fiddled with maybe dr vee still intends to provide a full report to the nih whatever he intends if this whole matter blows up the less any of us knows about what may have gone on the better well elise declared i think they all should be confronted the clinical trials arent over yet therell be a final report so he can still give the nih whatever data had been left out we should confront him and demand that he give a full accounting in the final report otherwise we all could end up being part of some conspiracy maybe we ought to think this over for a few days before we do anything drastic mary said we dont know what he intends to do and theres still time if we start giving dr vee ultimatums its just going to upset him even more he could have been killed taking the gun away from her hes got enough to worry about just now maybe hes going to handle her special case some other way that we dont know about my concern right now ellen said is the people who work under us i dont think pulling an ostrich number is going to protect anybody weve got to get out of denial and face up to how serious this might get and ill tell you our number one priority right now if katherine starr walks out of here before the kristen problem is cleared up and gets the ear of someone in the media then everybody who works here lets just say we mustnt allow that to happen thats why were having this meeting are you suggesting we should keep her sedated mary asked all her medications have to be approved by no sedative should be listed on her chart and im not telling you what to do but use your imagination there was a moment of silence as the implications of the unspoken order settled in and starting immediately we need to hold a meeting of the staff on each floor and impress on them that the story of katherine starr must never leave this building ever remind everybody that that would be a serious violation of a staffers original security agreement and would subject them to legal action the likes of which they cant even begin to imagine and if somebody comes around asking questions about kristen starr nobody here knows anything we can say she was here because thats part of the record and she is no longer here end of statement beyond that nobody knows zip this problem is far from over ellen told herself god only knows how its going to end chapter wednesday april pm as stone aimes stepped off the elevator on the sixth floor his mind was running through his options this phone call had to be about winston bartlett he was going to step up the pressure first there was the hellfire meeting in janes office and now hed seen a kidnapping maybe this was about that was jane going to pass along a threat of legal action if that crime got reported the managing editor jay had left a message with the thirdfloor receptionist rhonda to be forwarded to stone gist he was urgently required in the office of their corporate counsel what does this tell me he wondered that theyre going to try to do something to me that could have legal ramifications no more likely it means that im going to be given an ultimatum maybe an injunction and jane gets to deliver it with all the legal trimmings still he was determined to go on you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you jive right well not necessarily but at the least the truth could make a hell of a book and with that came financial freedom at least for a while the hallway felt desolate and ominous as he walked through the doorway that opened onto the cubicles jane tully was down on the third floor but he wanted to stop by his desk first and see if thered been any further communications from winston bartlett possibly there still could be a deal in the making the room itself was silent no one meeting his eye maybe he thought its the middle of the afternoon and everybodys dozing off from a late lunch but when he got to his cubicle he realized why he had suddenly become invisible the top of his desk was bare and there were three large cardboard boxes sitting on the gray carpet next to it i think i get the picture he said to the empty space it looked like winston bartlett had just provided him with a career decision for a moment he felt his life passing before his eyes but then all he could think about was the future this was not just the end of a wageslave era it was the beginning of the next phase of his life he saw everyone still avoiding his eyes as he turned around and walked back to the elevator how much did jane know about this she had to know everything which was why jay sent him to see her she would have no qualms about giving someone the ax including a former lover when he stepped off the elevator on the third floor rhonda looked at him as though he were a corpse shes i know shes here dont bother buzzing her he strode purposefully down the hallway realizing it was probably the last time hed ever walk it and pushed open janes door she was on the phone and looked up startled putting her hand over the mouthpiece what just came to say farewell jay told me to come see you i guess he was sure youd want to be part of this important life moment stone for gods sakeshe turned back to the phonelet me ill call you tomorrow she slammed down the receiver you have to know i had nothing to do with this bartlett got to the family i think it was one of those noblesse oblige kind of things old money meets new money and needs to placate it the sentinel is only marginally a profitmaking enterprise and the last thing they need is a lot of shit from their landlord he wanted you gone and since your job was a small price for them to pay to ensure domestic tranquility do the math sorry but thats how it had to be for gods sake stone why did you drive him to this the ironic thing was she was managing to look vaguely contritetugging at a lock of short hair he wasnt sure how she had the brass apologies from the executioner are traditionally a tough sell let me tell you something jane i already know more about winston bartlett than he wants he had somebody kidnapped today before my very eyes i even got slugged trying to stop it so you can tell his lawyers to tell him hed better back off the people who did it were recognized and they work for him if he wants to play tough i could have a heartfelt exchange with somebody i know very well at the sixth precinct and also with the tabloids where i know a shitload of hungry columnists winston bartlett could get real famous real fast stone you brought this on yourself i tried to warn you but youre hellbent on your own destruction youre your own worst enemy she picked up her blackberry and switched it off and sighed you never listened to me before and i dont expect you to do it now but take some free advice anyway try not to piss off important people it is frequently a negative career move jane you know john kennedy once said sometimes party loyalty asks too much and i think that moment for me is now from here on im going to be doing what i need to do not what bartlett or jay or whoever tells me to do i guess that includes you too there comes a time when i have to do whats in my heart she was finally focusing looking at him strangely stone what did you just say bartlett had somebody kidnapped today what on earth are you talking about did i secure your vagrant attention good actually it was less than an hour ago theres no point in going into details but im pretty sure she was the patient terminated from the clinical trials at the dorian institute that i had you ask bartletts lawyers about i think theres the possibility that something really weird began happening to her out there in new jersey but i didnt get a chance to talk to her because they grabbed her and took off well what do you think happened to her out there the only thing ive heard and thats secondhand is that she lost some part of her memory shes even having trouble remembering her name how do you know all this she asked staring at him were you i know somebody who talked with her this morning just a few short exchanges on the phone thats all i can tell you theyre doing something very powerful there at the institute but in her case it seems to have gone horribly wrong thats my best guess so they dropped her from the clinical trials and gave her a new identity and stashed her someplace incommunicado but she got away for a couple of hours somehow and managed to go back to her old apartment in her case its a village town house but bartlett nabbed her back if you really believe all that stone shouldnt you be worried for your own safety it was clear she was finally taking him seriously bartlett got me fired thats probably enough for now i dont know enough to be a threat to him yet but what if you find out whatever it is youre looking for then then ill know if medical miracles sometimes come with a strange price she was looking at him pity entering her dark eyes what are you going to do for money the child support you send to amy she hesitated im so sorry about this stone if you need a little help for the short term i could dont go there i can take cash out on a couple of credit cards and when i turn in the manuscript for the book ill get the other twothirds of the advance after that im hoping i might get an actual career oh stone im really sorry about this she said with feeling truly i am i i guess i still enjoy seeing you having you around youre a mensch you know that whatever your other failings and god knows theyre plenty you were always kind youre even kind to people who dont necessarily wish you well well tell that to amy if you ever get the chance sometimes she thinks her dad is the meanest guy alive particularly when i dont honor her every whim youre a good father too she sighed for stone this was always the moment that he wanted her backwhen she let her guard down dammit stone why couldnt we make a go of it we stopped having fun jane thats all that happened i started to bore you back then i didnt provide enough excitement enough sturm und drang in your life you werent dull stone but sometimes you could be maddeningly smug that may be about to change now that im an unemployed freelancer and i just ran into a blast from the past who knows what my life is about to be like he turned to leave by the way give my best to jay hopefully hell be the last managing editor ill ever have to suck up to take care stone she was getting up you can fight this you know they had me write up some kind of bullshit breachofcontract brief in case you wouldnt go quietly but its full of holes i know since i deliberately wrote it that way hey thanks anyway its not worth it im not going to fight to keep a job i never liked all that much in the first place every time i wanted to do some serious journalismlike that piece about using the internet to store everybodys medical recordsjay always found a reason not to run it ive only got so much dignity to lose he turned and strode out of the office deciding to forego any more farewells besides he had better things to do get somebody from the mailroom to carry the boxesthe shards of his erstwhile socalled careerto the lobby where he could get a cab take the files home stash them and then get going chapter wednesday april pm hi he said walking through the door of allys downtown studio citispace jennifer had the desk at the front and she served as a makeshift receptionist she looked up as he continued i dont have an appointment but id love to see ally hampton any chance and youre just as he started to tell her ally emerged from her officecubicle in the back and spotted him stone what bet you didnt think youd see me again quite so soon she felt her pulse jump no she hadnt shed told him she was going down to the office but shed certainly had no idea or hope hed just show up a couple of hours later since she got back to the office shed been in a struggle with her conscience over what to do about kristen was there any good to be served by bringing in the police at the time it had seemed pointless and it still felt that way the whole matter was awfully anecdotal worse she didnt really feel she should talk it over with jennifer which she would have loved to do they supported each other in a lot of things but this crazy story would just freak her out why do that the more troubling thing was shed started feeling tired and slightly dizzy now she was just hoping to stay focused long enough to last out the day what she wondered was happening to her it wasnt like a chesttightening spell of anginawhich thankfully she hadnt had for a couple of days now no this just felt like something was sapping her energy she couldnt help the suspicion that this queasy condition was somehow related to her encounter with dr van de vliets testy blond colleague debra while she was supposedly taking that blood sample was she also doing something else welcome to my home away from home youre right i didnt expect citispace he interjected seeming to try out the word as he looked around she noticed that jennifer and the others automatically assumed he was a new client of hers and were trying to look preoccupied jen however was giving him a furtive appraisal running the numbers he was a decent looker actually kind of cute and he seemed pleasant and outgoing not a bad start that was what she would say the moment he was out of earshot you like the name not bad sort of a takeoff on citibank my dad came up with it back before they copyrighted that name maybe they stole the idea from us she was feeling cheered by the sight of him yes it was good to have him back for a while maybe longer but come on let me introduce you around which she did jennifer gave her a telepathic glance that said this guy looks like he might be worth the effort whats the deal then they went to allys office a highwalled cubicle in the back with a computer and a drafting table she had a cad program running sorry to just invite myself down like this he said but i got off work early matter of fact i just became a freelancer my office now consists of three cardboard boxes in my walkup apartment what do you mean that phone page did winston bartlett owns the building where the sentinels offices are seems he convinced the management that it would be in their interest if i were no longer employed there i gather he thinks i know more than i actually do about whats going on out at the dorian institute and i guess he thought getting me fired would slow me down what it has done however is to give me even more incentive to surpass his most paranoid assumptions now im going to take him on fulltime i want to know everything oh stone im so sorry she wasnt buying his bravado he didnt look like a guy who could last very long without a paycheck i have to say he gave me fair warning that meeting where he yelled at me this little turn of the screw is not a total shock but that whole thing with kristen ill bet thats what sent him over the edge i shouldnt have gotten you involved in that this had nothing to do with you believe me he shrugged besides it gives me even more motivation to finish the book fast and im also looking forward to spending some of my newfound quality time with you again if youll let me in your favor youve actually been inside the dorian institute which is more than i can say she wasnt a big believer in the magic of a second time aroundthat would have to await further evidencebut having stone back in her life was definitely helping on the psychologicalsupport front im thinking he went on that maybe we should go back to kristens apartment and turn the place inside out do it right we both let ourselves get distracted by the little matter of our other lives stone im not sureshe lowered her voice and sat down at her deskbut i may be having a reaction to something one of van de vliets research assistants did to me out at the institute this morning i dont know im just feeling sort of weak and funny im thinking maybe i should call out there and talk to him she took a deep breath and seemed to be mounting her courage or if he needs to see me could you possibly drive for me im not sure im up to it hey id love a chance to get inside that place then his eyes grew uncertain but are you sure you want to go back after what seems to have happened to kristen you might consider waiting till we find her and ally are you all right jennifer was walking in carrying a manila folder you look kind of queasy can i make you some tea or something thanks but not now she said im feeling weird but maybe i should call out to the institute and see what van de vliet says just dont agree to do anything until we talk stone said dont worry she said reaching for the phone the number for the dorian institute was now newly entered on her palm pilot and she called it when the receptionist answered she gave her name and asked for dr van de vliet i was there this morning and gave a blood sample to dr debra connolly i dont know if theres any connection but im really feeling strange right now what do you mean by strange the woman asked can you describe how you feel exactly hes in the lab downstairs thats just it im not sure i need to actually see him id just like to talk to him he doesnt like to be disturbed unless its something very important its important enough for me to try to call him she declared feeling herself abruptly seething im weak and dizzy and my stomach is not in such great shape either what did you have for lunch my god she realized she hadnt actually had any after the disaster with kristen shed been in such turmoil that she hadnt even thought about food on the other hand she knew what food deprivation felt like this was something else i didnt have all that much lunch but thats not the problem now will you please put me through let me see what i can do she said ill call down and ask him he might be able to see you ally listened as the line went blank that was when she remembered she had some smoked turkey in the office fridge maybe a quick sandwich was called for while she waited stone was looking around the offices taking everything in carrying the phone she walked out and followed him what she wondered was the place telling him about her the meager furniture was lowslung and utilitarian with lots of beige and dark brown and there were several huge storage files for blueprints and designs there also was a comfortable easy chair and lamp near a bookcase in the corner on the table next to the chair were two british mysteries and a thick recently written history of new york city he walked over and picked it up it was pages long this your idea of reading for relaxation he asked waving it at her i tried to get through it but i only got up to the s and then i started having a bout of acute sleeping sickness every time i picked it up hey the history of this city is a mental hobby of mine its always renewing itself she smiled think about it when developers convert industrial space to residential we end up getting a lot of work then she heard the phone crackle alive it was van de vliet alexa what seems to be the problem she told him then i think its important that you come back out here as soon as you can i cant say anything until ive seen you this could be something that could affect your procedure but what do you think i dont diagnose over the phone i was about to go home but ill wait for you she listened as he clicked off shit what did he say stone asked he said ive got to come out do you really want to do that i dont know but whats the point of going to a doctor here they wouldnt know then at least let me drive you stone declared and ill make damned sure they dont pull something funny ally jennifer saidyou look absolutely wiped out before you do anything at least let me fix you a sandwich i think theres some turkey in the fridge i was thinking about that she glanced at stone you want something sure ill have whatever youre having dont be so sure jen can tell you i take mayo and mustard both i know its weird but thats the way i am then ill give it a try i want to get to know you all over again also i hate to say it but i think maybe i ought to swing by the apartment and get some things just in case she listened to her own voice and wondered would whatever happened to kristen happen to me too maybe she thought what i really ought to take with me is a gun maybe katherine starr had the right idea jennifer finished the sandwiches and was wrapping them ally ill go with you to your place and pick up knickers she can stay with me till you know whats going on thanks jen i was hoping youd volunteer she knew she could have dropped a hint and made it happen anyway but this was nicer she then went around and had a few last words it felt like a goodbye and she didnt want it to but it did ten minutes later while stone waited in her doubleparked car she and jennifer took the elevator up to her barrow street apartment where did you find that man jennifer asked as soon as they got on he seems nice interesting hes not a client is he and pardon me for noticing no wedding ring he actually found me ally declared punching her floor its a long story but he was a guy i was deeply in love with for about fifteen minutes back around college the old flame i told you about remember then we started getting on each others nerves were both going easy on the personal details right now but ive got a hunch hes got nobody else percolating which incidentally goes for me too or hadnt you noticed they stepped off the elevator and she unlocked the door to her apartment knickers exploded with delight hi baby she reached down and ruffled the sheepdogs ears i really love her jennifer said as she reached down to pet her too knickers began a dance of joy then ran to search for her rubber ball behind the couch hoping for a game of fetch with jennifer by the way i cant tell you how i appreciate your taking her shes going to love being at your place awhile im sure she gets bored crazy being here all the time i probably should get a puppy or something to keep her company but then shed be jealous and im not about to get a stupid cat she loves me because she knows i love her jennifer said i always play with her when you bring her into the office at least i think she loves me this may turn out to be the test ally headed into the bedroom opened a drawer and took out some black sweatshirts those and black jeans were her favorite things to wear around the house she slept in a tshirt and panties so it wasnt hard to put together her evening ensemble besides if something went wrong with the experimental stem cell procedure it wouldnt matter a damn what she was wearing she threw the clothes into a blue gym bag and headed for the bathroom to fetch some toiletries by the time she got back to the living room jennifer had a measuring cup and was shoveling science diet into a large plastic bag they delivered jen and knickers back to the office after she gave them both a farewell hug she came around and slipped into the toyotas drivers seat moving stone across im actually feeling better now so ill drive as long as i can and by the way im famished how about that turkey sandwich thought youd never remember five minutes later they were headed up the west side with ally at the wheel she checked the gas and was relieved to see that she still had twothirds of a tank stone was leaning back in the seat looking at her you know its easy for me to say but trying the stem cell procedure on your heart is probably the right thing for you to do still though it makes me nervous if theres a medical glitch of some kind then i mean what the hell is going on with kristen im going to confront him about that she said i damned well want some answers before i just turn myself over to him after they crossed the george washington bridge she began feeling slightly better maybe she thought whatever it is is going to pass as they headed north up the treeshrouded highway she decided to ask him a question that had been nagging at her mind stone i know you hate to have these talks but something about you doesnt quite compute for me right now theres a kind of unnatural intensity about your pursuit of winston bartlett and his stem cell work and the same goes for his reaction to you way back when i never really thought i knew you and its still true i mean is this all just about a book on stem cell technology or is it something more the question was followed by a long moment of silence as he looked away into the forest and appeared to wrestle with his thoughts youre very intuitive ally he said at last maybe i didnt consciously set out to write about stem cells just because i knew bartletts gerex corporation was a leader in the field but writing about stem cells automatically meant that id have to get close to him at some point so was it an unconscious choice if it was then i wouldnt be aware of it would i but why would you want to get close to winston bartlett i guess that was your original question right pretty much there are things about my past that i never told you i could never decide exactly how to go about it and truthfully right now doesnt seem exactly the right moment either youve got enough on your mind want to give me a hint what could he mean she wondered it was clear that stone aimes and winston bartlett had some kind of holy war going on between them ill tell you someday soon but i want us both sitting down in a safe place when i do its going to be hard he looked away again someday soon ive got to tell my daughter amy too maybe telling you would be a practice drill so what im learning is that im not crazy this is about more than its about she sighed nobodys leveling with me with van de vliet i have to worry whether hes telling me the truth every time he opens his mouth and now youre holding out its like that joke about feeling like a mushroom everybody keeps me in the dark and feeds me bullshit she was slowing down pulling into an open space by the roadside stone im feeling a little dizzy maybe its this conversation but i think its time you took the wheel for a while hey dont pass out on me now he said snapping into the moment im not sure i could actually find this place without your help dont worry she said bringing the car to a stop im all right im just a little worried about my reflexes he got out and walked around while she hoisted herself over into the other side the evening commute had begun in earnest so there was a lot more traffic than there had been that morning but stone turned out to be an aggressive driver right on the edge as though he were racing the clock she gave him directions and then closed her eyes hoping to rest but all she could think about was stones refusal to tell her about something that loomed very large in his life tell me if im bothering you and ill shut up he interjected after a few minutes butnot to change the subjectdid you actually give anybody permission to stick a needle in you this morning i mean are you sure you understood what was going on at the time she shifted and opened her eyes looking straight ahead truthfully i assumed i was just giving a blood sample thats what his assistant said and i took her at her word i hate needles and i never actually watch when i give blood this morning i just sort of went along with what was happening and nothing seemed particularly ominous till katherine starr showed up and started blasting away well he said do your best to get some rest and ill try to get you there as soon as legally possible she stared out the window a moment before closing her eyes again around them the encroaching greenery of northern new jersey felt like an ancient forest where magical things could happen out here in the forest was there a magician who had the power literally to save her life and what about stone setting aside the troubling fact that he was harboring some mysterious connection to winston bartlettand that was hard to set asideshe was feeling a sense of togetherness with him that brought back a lot of positive memories which was bizarre because she knew so little about what kind of man hed become if people are worth their salt they change a lot in their late twenties and early thirties so what was he really like now what did he love what did he hate what were his priorities did he believe in the golden rule mulling over all this she slowly drifted away dusk was approaching by the time he pulled to a stop at the gated entrance of the dorian institute along the way hed begun getting a sense that they were being followed by a darkcolored lincoln town car but it could have been his imagination and he hadnt seen it for the past fifteen minutes after he pulled onto the leafy lakeside drive leading to the institute hey were here ally rise and shine howre you feeling there was no response when he touched her chapter wednesday april pm jesus ally are you all right he leaned over and shook her finally she jumped and then her eyelids fluttered open where she looked around the sign says this is it the institute oh shit stone im feeling really strange she said after a moment of getting her bearings everything around me seems like its moving its as though the space im in has an extra dimension i dont know maybe it was totally stupid to come back out here maybe i should have just gone to my doctor in the city hey youve got a seriously deficient sense of timing were here now ive been breaking the speed limit for the last half hour i know shit i really dont know what to do i dont trust anybody well you could start by trusting me im along to try to make sure nothing bad happens he paused so what do we do a brass plaque on a redbrick pillar beside the gate bore a twoinchhigh inscription the dorian institute and just below it was an intercom she stared at it for a moment then said there give it a buzz i think theres a video camera around here somewhere last time i was here they knew id arrived he reached out and touched a black button yes came back a quick voice she recognized it as belonging to the woman shed spoken to on the phone its alexa hampton she leaned over we talked yes i know ms hampton hes been waiting for you a buzzer sounded and the two wroughtiron gates slid back welcoming them as they drove down the treelined road an elegant threestory redbrick structure with white doric columns across the front slowly came into view from here its pretty classylooking stone declared sizing it up i know his big manufacturingandresearch campus is right down the road but still it sure feels godforsaken and lost out here in the middle of these pines its like the place is hiding from the world where better to do secret medical research she said if you want to keep everything proprietary then the isolation gives you a big jump on security she directed him to the side parking lot where shed left her car that morning stone heres what well tell them youre next of kin a cousin on my mothers side works for me he declared im beginning to feel part of the family anyway he pocketed the car keys and helped her out of the toyota as they headed up the wide steps past the white columns ally felt a wave of nausea sweep through her she reached out and took stones arm and sank against him im im not feeling at all well please let me hold no sooner had she said it than the front door opened and two nurses appeared their hair backlit from the glow of the reception area she recognized one as ellen ohara here dear let us help you she said as she strode toward them she was dressed in white and her eyes were flooded with concern ally looked through the doorway to see a waiting wheelchair thats fast stone said looks like they were ready for you my god she thought did they already know what kind of shape id be in what else do they know surely van de vliet has heard by now that im aware of kristen then she saw him standing behind the nurses alexa we need to get you downstairs as soon as possible he was coming forward to help her settle into the wheelchair he appeared to take no notice of stone aimes im just feeling a little dizzy he smiled reassuringly theres always a small percentage chance that there may be side effects from the initial inoculation huh what initial inoculation she bolted upright in the wheelchair i was just supposed to be giving blood i thought debra explained he said appearing confused theres always an initial antibiotic dosage just as a prophylactic he shook his head in selfblame i should have insisted you stay here but after that incident this morning i was so disoriented i let you talk me out of it you may be having a reaction to the antibiotic but it cant be all that serious i didnt see anything about side effects in your file we just have to get you horizontal for a while everythings going to be all right in fact this might be a positive development with you here now we can begin finetuning your procedure immediately dr van de vliet this is my cousin stone he drove me here and id id really like to stay stone said reaching to shake van de vliets hand it would mean a lot to both of us to the whole family family van de vliet declared ally noticed that he was examining stone with narrowed eyes and seemed to be debating something with himself well well see then he turned back to her the first thing is to make sure your situation is stabilized i actually think a good nights rest might do the trick but i need to run a quick blood test downstairs she felt her dizziness coming and going but she was determined to stay awake and in control of what was being done to her by the way i was wondering how is katherine starr doing his eyes grew somber shes a very lucky woman considering weve given her some coagulants and stitched her up are you going to press charges he looked at her strangely do you think we should i guess its none of my business of course you wont she told herself the kristen matter will not stand the ordinary light of day let alone a police investigation maybe its time to let her daughter come and see her i looked at that letter he said with a matteroffact tone i suspect its a hoax and a very cruel one at that i dont think so i talked to her today the woman formerly known as kristen on the phone she stared at him i really think its time i learned more about what happened to her here at the institute all i could really find out was that she thinks shes experienced some pretty dramatic memory loss he looked as though this information was new to him he also looked startled you spoke to her what did she say is she all right no shes not all right dont mention the kidnapping she told herself play dumb and see how he behaves i want to know what happened to her when she was here he paused then took a deep breath i told you everything i know this morning she was a very troubled young person her treatment seemed to be going well but she couldnt accept that she began to believe there was some kind of conspiracy against her in a word she became completely paranoid well ally thought theres paranoid and then there are times when somebody really is out to get you so which was it in kristens case she glanced over at stone who appeared to be trying to act as though he didnt know what on earth she was talking about but she could see him efficiently taking mental notes when you cant remember who you are she said turning back to van de vliet and then someone who does know who you are gives you a new fake identity i think its enough to justify paranoia he was rolling the wheelchair toward the elevator but abruptly paused is that what shes claiming good god i told you she was paranoid and that should demonstrate it better than anything letting her discharge herself and leave the program to go off unsupervised was a truly bad idea but nothing short of physical restraint could have stopped her and do you have any idea where she is now ally asked i told you look if i knew her whereabouts dont you think id do everything i could to contact her find out how she is right she reached out and took stones hand as they all moved onto the elevator she could sense his excitement at finally being inside the dorian institute but at that moment her concentration was drifting and she felt as though she were slowly beginning to drown in a sea of white stone please dont leave me dont let me out of your sight something funny is happening and i dont know what it is van de vliet bent over alexa look at me i want to see your eyes i think they may be dilating he waved a hand across her face can you see me its the fluorescent lights she mumbled theres too much glare could someone please turn them down i think thats whats wrong theyre giving me a headache ally stone said the lights are not very bright in here were going down in an elevator there arent any fluorescents then the elevator chimed and the door opened they were in the basement now where the research lab and the office and the examination rooms were debra wearing a white lab coat was standing there silently looking at her now there really were fluorescent lights and she turned away and tried to shield her eyes god turn them off its so painful its like theyre shining into the back of my skull shes started hallucinating van de vliet whispered to debra ive got to draw blood for a test and give her an injection we need a gurney now weve got to take her down to the ic her condition is progressing much more rapidly than i expected ally is this what you want stone demanded you dont have to do this her breath was coming in rapid pulses now and she was cringing from the light even as she struggled to rise out of the wheelchair i want to get she managed to pull herself onto her feet but then she sagged and collapsed against stone as he pulled her to him as one of the nurses grabbed the newly arrived gurney and pulled it over van de vliet and ellen ohara seized her out of stones arms and lifted her onto it youll have to leave now van de vliet said to stone im sorry im not going anywhere i promised her id stay by her side and by god i intend to do just that ill determine whats best for her he replied please go up to the reception area ill let you know how she is im not leaving then ill call our security and have you removed from the premises stone ally said her eyelids flickering its okay i want you to tell my mother im here shes in room twothirteen upstairs the last time i saw her youve got it dont worry ill take care of everything she heard him saying that but then she thought she heard another voice inside her head begging him not to leave it was the last thought she had before the world went entirely white wednesday april pm ellen ohara watched the scene with mounting dismay shed overheard dr van de vliet talking to debbie about the procedure scheduled for alexa hampton then shed checked the schedule that had been put into the database it turned out that alexa hampton had two procedures scheduled the troubling part was one was identical to the procedure that had been performed on kristen starr several months back or at least so it seemed and that had resulted in what shed just overheard debra call the syndrome by whatever name it had produced some horrible side effects why on earth were they now repeating that with this new patient hadnt they learned anything karl van de vlietor whoever ordered this idiotic travestywas about to put the job of every person at the dorian institute at risk if whatever happened to kristen was replicated and the word got out it was going to be the end for everyone who worked here most troubling of all what about ms hampton who seemed like such a nice person did she agree to that experimental procedure if she knew what had happened to kristen starr surely she wouldnt have ellen ohara didnt know how she could stop dr vee from doing what he appeared to be planning to do the procedure was going to be performed in the laboratory the only way she could think of to stop it was to try to warn ms hampton that what they were about to do was extremely dangerous but how her chart in the database said they were going to keep her quarantined down in the sub basement that was specified on top of all this kenji noda had brought in some unidentified patient this afternoon wheeled in while strapped to a gurney and they had taken that patient to the subbasement noda was still down there and winston bartlett had come in and gone down also the unholy pair and now theyd be holding alexa hampton down there too was it possible to get past them and warn her she was determined to find a way chapter wednesday april pm stone was deeply troubled as he entered the elevator to return to the lobby he had promised ally hed stay by her side and now hed let her down was this the best he could do he felt like he had to earn the right to be back in her life but he seemed to be making a slow start but he wasnt about to leave the premises until he knew she was okay hoping for the best he reminded himself that although van de vliet was wound pretty tight he clearly was more than competent the problem was hed just offered a transparent song and dance when ally asked him about kristen now it was easy to understand why shed said she didnt know whether to believe a word he said but that didnt necessarily preclude him being a nobel prizequality medical genius in any case to finally be inside the dorian institute was a major coup in his own quest up until now bartletts press heavies at bmd had turned back his every attempt to get a firsthand look at the institute or an interview with karl van de vliet now at last hed actually seen the man so after he visited with allys mother upstairswhich ought to be interesting an actual patient interviewhe was going to try to keep a low profile and scout the place maybe he could finally talk his way into an interview with the celebrated van de vliet himself or at least with some of his research staff this was definitely the break hed been waiting for finally hed have some actual reporting to put in the book when he stepped off the elevator he noticed that the uniformed security guard looked him over suspiciously he and alexa had been waved through the metal detector when they came in owing to the urgency of her condition now he felt as though the guard a tall middleaged black guy with thinning hair was trying to frisk him with his penetrating eyes stone smiled and nodded toward him and headed for the desk in the middle of the reception area around him a number of patients were ambling through the lobby returning from a room in the back that was identified as dining hall some were wearing blue gowns and most appeared to be in their sixties and seventies but they all were sprightly and animated as they walked along chatting somehow the place felt more like a vacation spa than a clinic hed like nothing better than to sit them all down right this minute for an interview how has the gerex stem cell procedure affected your condition have you had any side effects but to do that without official permission would undoubtedly get him evicted on the spot he took a deep breath and walked over to the reception desk hi the woman looked up she was the same middleaged hispanic nurse with bold eye makeup who was there when they came in hi hows your friend feeling actually shes my cousin and i dont know how shes doing because they kicked sent me up here but she gave me a mission to keep me occupied well the woman declared with a smile im sure shell be fine dr van de vliet is a miracle worker so everyone says he smiled back my cousin asked me to look in on her mother nina hampton she is or was in twothirteen mrs hampton is your aunt uh yeah right whoops get this act together funny but i always just think of her as my cousin allys mother my own weird way to look at it i guess i dont really know her all that well things are not getting off to a great start he told himself i dont even believe me visits to patients except by those on a preestablished list require a photo id well lets get started he reached for his wallet and withdrew a drivers license he made sure his press card was well out of sight keep this dumb and innocent as long as possible he told himself she glanced at the drivers license then pointed to the signin sheet just sign your name and print it and then also print your relationship to the patient i have to say this is unusual there are regular visiting hours and guests are normally approved in advance by mrs young whos in charge of security but you came in under extraordinary circumstances with ms hampton and youre already here so i dont see the harm he signed himself in as quickly as possible mrs hampton is still in room twothirteen ill show myself up please keep it under fifteen minutes we dont want to tire her out you understand thanks i really appreciate this my cousin ally likes to get an update onhe realized he had momentarily blocked her mothers nameher mom as often as possible he headed for the elevator trying to contain his excitement the idea was to keep this as below the radar as possible was he about to crack the wall of secrecy that winston bartlett had erected around karl van de vliet and the gerex corporation just as the elevator door was closing he saw a figure emerge through the security entryway the man clicked a memorymoment from somewhere in the fardistant past but he couldnt place him as best he could tell the guy didnt see him just keep moving dont look back as he stepped off the elevator onto the second floor the pale marble floors were lit by small bulbs along the walls this was a place where medical miracles were supposedly being made to happen and yet it was lit only with a ghostly halflight the sounds of televisions emanated from several of the rooms the nurses station at the end of the hall was empty which added to the sense of a surreptitious undertaking he walked quickly to room and tapped lightly on the door when he heard a bold yes from inside he opened it and entered he hadnt seen nina hampton in almost two decades but she looked pretty much the way he remembered her her hair was surely dyed now but her face was as square and strong as ever she was reading a paperback book with a tide that appeared to be spanish she looked up and stared at him for a moment adjusting her glasses hello stone that is you isnt it youre older but youre still a hell of a looker how did you get in here is ally here too i havent seen her since this morning mrs hampton dont tell me you recognize me of course i do when you and ally were going out i confess i didnt hold out much hope that youd ever amount to anything but ive been a fan of your columns for a long time though it took me a while to put it together that that newspaper writer i liked so much was you the man i didnt think was ambitious enough for my daughter she appraised him a moment does this mean you two are together again good question he thought and i dont have a clue about the answer i wish i knew why dont you ask her the next time you see her he smiled and walked over she wanted me to come up and see how youre doing come up is she here now when she came to say goodbye this morning i got the impression that she wanted both of us just to get out of here but i told her that was silly im already feeling so much better really well shes downstairs now and shell be happy to hear that he walked over and smiled mrs hampton i came along with her this time to keep an eye on her hope you dont mind of course not and theres another reason im here i want to warn you im writing a book about stem cell procedures and anything you say to me about your treatment could well end up in it so dont tell me anything you dont want everybody to hear about are you really writing a book about dr vee she beamed thats wonderful hes a saint everyone here says so he deserves a special place in heaven this is great stone thought ive got my own deep throat then could i ask you what you know about what he did and how you think youve improved i dont really understand what hes doing but i do know what is happening to me its as though my mind was full of fog a lot of the time but now theres a wind thats blowing it away and how a shaft of light from the hallway pierced across the room as the door opened stone turned to see the man hed first noticed in the lobby the man walked past him and marched over to the bed hi howre you feeling im touched her visage immediately hardened its thoughtful of you to finally come by and favor your mother with a visit thats who he is stone finally realized allys kid brother in his few dealings with the wiseass brat that ally used to rant aboutwhat was the kids name right granthed found him devious and pompous he was particularly deft at cutting ethical corners and using other people any way he could stone nina hampton said gesturing toward grant this is i know exactly who he is grant said turning around to face stone wb has put out an allpoints alert for you pal youve got a hell of a nerve weaseling your way in here but not to worry you wont be here long i wont have you talking that way in my presence young man nina declared whatever else you may be i thought id raised you to have a civil tongue in your head grant replied without taking his eyes off stone he lied to the front desk nina he signed in as allys cousin and that twitbrain down there let him get away with it he got up here by using a lie now what does that tell you about him it tells me hes creative this man came with your sister hes helping take care of her which is more than can be said about her own brother this creep is a newspaper reporter nina hes here to spy hes planning to do a hatchet job on the gerex corporation and mr bartlett has expressly forbidden anyone to speak to him im not in your corporation son so i guess its all right for me then you signed a secrecy agreement with gerex when you entered the clinical trials now maybe you dont remember it but you did he turned to stone nice try amigo now come on lets go you know grant i remember you stone said not very nice recollections and i remember you too pal you were that screwedup journalism student ally dated for a while thank god she got rid of you sounds like we were awash in mutual admiration stone said tell you what are we gonna continue this touching reunion outside or do i have to call for security and take your trespassing ass out of here in handcuffs its entirely up to you grant i see no reason why i cant talk to him if i want nina interjected who i talk to or what i say is nobodys business but mine you wouldnt be here if it werent for me grant declared so i have a little sayso too he turned back come on pal were gone im screwed stone told himself but what about ally if i get kicked out ill really be leaving her completely defenseless mrs hampton thank you for letting me check up on you he said quietly alexa is downstairs i think her procedure is starting whether shes ready for it or not you seem very alert and if i were you id try to monitor her progress as closely as you can dont worry grant said ill be keeping close tabs on her and now lets go with no option short of killing him on the spot stone followed along seething this little creep obviously works for winston bartletthe wished ally had warned him about that grant was bound to have shown up at some point they went down the marble staircase and grant signaled the security man who leaped up and opened the front door for them he probably got a tonguelashing from grant stone told himself as they stepped onto the wide porch dusk all around them grant turned and headed toward the south end and a long wooden bench want to tell me what the hells going on he said gesturing toward the bench and then sitting down wb said you claimed to be writing a book about this project if thats true then its a seriously bad idea you have no idea what hes capable of if he gets pissed oh i think im getting a rough idea but im a little pissed too stone said remaining standing for example theres the matter of kristen starr you see she was terminated from the clinical trials approximately three months back so i was wondering when is van de vliet planning to report her current condition to the nih i dont know what youre talking about his startled voice said otherwise oh i think you do i saw her today then he decided to bluff she had an interesting tale to tell she shit you interviewed kristy aw man dont believe anything she he hesitated what did she say about wb tell you what well play twenty questions you tell me what you think she said and ill tell you if youre right or not hey grant declared his eyes intense she wanted to do it man nobody put a gun to her head or anything she was freaking out after she got sacked she thought dr vee could fix her skin and she couldnt wait to try it you mean the beta take a look at van de vliet hes a walking testimonial no side effects for him so why not the worst thing that could happen would be nothing right so she figured what did she have to lose well now we all know the beta thats you fucker grant bounded to his feet you dont know the first thing about what im talking about do you how the fuck did you find out about kristen anyway i told you i spoke to her well it was almost true hed yelled at her shes very unsettled just now but i guess you know that hey she was always fuckedup but wb liked all the energy behind that he looked right past the eating disorders and the coke and the latenight clubs she went to all the time but man if you think shes spaced try her mother that crazy grant why not level with me theres something very wrong going on here im in the business of telling the truth and ive got a keen nose for medical horsepucky so how about coming clean if its good why not and if its bad its going to come out eventually anyway hasnt winston bartlett learned anything from all the screwups in washington its not the situationits the coverup well i dont know what kristy did or didnt tell you so were not going in that direction i heard about her little trip downtown this morning i assume thats probably when you saw her if in fact you actually did right now shes being taken care of for her own good being taken care of so happens i had a close encounter with a couple of her caregivers today theyre taking care of her all right look she used to be wbs girlfriend okay hes still very concerned about her everybodys really sorry about her situation but nobody saw it coming and now hes got some problems of his own you seem to be pretty heavily involved with winston bartletts personal problems yeah well the mans been like a father to me and i think he feels that way too since he doesnt have a son of his own stone let the taunt just hang in the air for a moment he mainly just wanted to slug the smug little bastard you dont know how little you know about him or about anything someday i may take the trouble to straighten you out but right now youre not worth the effort all i care about at the moment is whats going to happen to ally everybody cares what happens to her a lot depends on it dr vee thinks shes our best shot what what the hell are you talking about stone stared at him through the twilight what depends on it guess youre not as smart as you think you are he was up and heading for the parking lot come on pal time to hit the road im gonna tuck you in this conversation is terminated and it never happened anyway ill have them unlock the gates for you chapter wednesday april pm alexa watches as the prow of their fortyonefoot morgan twomasted cuts silently through a placid sea she vaguely remembers the vessel it was teak and magnificent steve had chartered it bareboat for two weeks and taken them cruising through the bahamas by the end of that time she felt they could have sailed it around the world but that was six years ago when he was still very much alive now the boat feels like a magical carpet taking them someplace together effortlessly the genoa the mainsail and the mizzen are all full and blossoming outward even though theres no wind shes at the helm holding a course toward something white on the horizon and steve is with her hes alive again and hes with her she feels her body suffused with joy then she looks at the reflection of herself in his sunglasses and realizes shes a little girl still a child this is all a dream she realizes a cruel dream then she looks again at the horizon the blazing white light and senses that it represents the future their destiny now the sea around them which had been placid starts to roil the wheel is becoming harder to control and the sun is starting to burn her in its pitiless glare she feels herself beginning to age rapidly she glances at steve and she can see his skin starting to shrivel she senses he is dying right there before her eyes but her hands feel glued to the wheel and she cant let go to try to help him now the sea is growing ever more choppy and the white symbol on the horizon has begun to bob in and out of view sometimes she can see the future and sometimes she cant waves are crashing over the sides inundating the deck and she feels anxious about what lies up ahead will they ever get there and if they do will she want what she finds even more important now will steve still be with her as the waves pound against them both oddly she doesnt feel wet instead what she feels is a stab of muted pain in her upper chest pain she knows would be searing if she were to experience its full impact she looks down to see that the wheel she thought she was holding is gone and her chest is pierced by the steel mechanism to which it was attached it has gone all the way through her next a huge wave comes straight over the bow and slams against her and steve her body convulses with pain and she senses that he is being swept overboard directly off the stern she screams at him to hold on but then he is gone lost in the dark sea now the boat itself is starting to disintegrate as both masts tip backwards then come crashing down up ahead the white light that is the future is growing ever more flamelike it is part of a shoreline she is trying to reach but now she doesnt think shes going to get there around her the boats lines and cleats are being swept into the pounding sea in moments the boat has disappeared but she continues on propelled by some force she cannot see until she finally crashes onto the rocky shore it is a chiaroscuro landscape of blacks and whites oddly stone aimes has appeared and is holding her hand as they make their way along the barren seascape where everything is hazy and trapped in fog she thinks she sees figures lurking in the mist around them but cant make out who they are everything is static and frozen in place like the images of motion on the grecian urn caught for eternity she reaches out to touch stone and her hand passes right through thats when she realizes the white light and this rocky shoreline represent the other side is this what death feels like she wonders like the white tunnel drawing you in but then she has another thought maybe she isnt dead at all maybe she is in a third place somewhere suspended between life and death she looks again at stone and tells herself theyre not dead theyre in some kind of time machine this voyage is about time now time has begun to flow around her like a river days weeks months years they all course by but she knows it is a chimera nothing can make time go faster or slower then the bright lights are gone and she feels alone very alone but she isnt she hears voices around her drifting echoing and she tries to understand what they are saying shes stabilized were past the critical phase do you want to bring her up now not yet we still dont know how its going to go there was a pause and then a male voice this was the beta too wasnt it karl another pause well wasnt it the injections thats the first time since again the voices drift off she listens not sure what she is hearing she tries to process the word beta but makes no headway in computer slang beta means a program that is still being tested then she remembers hearing the word just hours earlier she had been talking to some woman but she cant remember who i changed the procedure this time comes a voice i injected the special beta enzyme separately from the activated stem cells whatever happens will happen at the enzymes own pace now and i kept the dosage as low as i could well be monitoring her telomerase levels throughout the day if theres no rejection we will be past the first phase is the dosage the only difference from before comes the other accusing voice at this point david manipulating the beta is an art not a science im just attempting to create antigens the way a smallpox vaccination does then well try to harvest them this is not really a fullscale beta procedure i dont plan to do that ever again there was another long silence that man who was here with her her cousin did he say i saw no family resemblance but he seemed very upset thats why i had him sent upstairs i think hes the reporter wb was so concerned about anyway hes gone stone she realizes thats who theyre talking about and now hes gone shes on her own next the voices drift away for a time into some echo space that mutes them finally though they come back this should be adequate for another four hours after that youll need a glucose iv to keep her hydrated ive already put it on her chart by then we should have some idea of which way this is going im thinking im praying that this time is going to be the charm that ive learned how to modulate the enzyme is she ready for transfer to ic anytime the voices start drifting away a fuzziness is enveloping her senses leaving everything soft and muted the pain is gone from her body now and the bright lights around her seem to be dimming the figures in the white haze on the perimeter are now disappearing one by one as though filing out of a room and now she feels like shes floating with things moving past her then finally one lone voice is talking to her is really talking to her in a private and unmistakable way and as she drifts back into the gulf of anesthesia she listens to words that do not make a lot of sense the fountain through all the ages weve been looking in the wrong place its within us together alexa we have this chance she listens as the voice begins to drift away yet she feels a genuine sense of closeness to it she realizes she no longer has control of her destiny but still she wants to be where she is now the sea is coming back flowing around her and she tries to remember where she is and why but all she is aware of is the sea rising until she is engulfed chapter thursday april am stone awoke in his yorkville apartment nursing a hangover and a lot of regrets hed inhaled a triple scotch after driving allys toyota back and parking it on the street the night before hed needed it yesterday had been a day where in sequential order hed seen a woman whod lost her memory get kidnapped probably hed been fired from his day job hed finally gotten inside the dorian institute only to blow the opportunity completely but the most important thing that happened was hed rediscovered a woman hed once been in love with and he currently didnt have the slightest idea what was happening to her thinking back over their last few moments together when she was being checked in by van de vliet and his research team and he was being hastily sent up to the lobby stone suspected that ally was about to be subjected to something they didnt want anybody to know about now he was determined to get back inside the institute and look out for her as he pulled himself out of bed and shakily made his way into the kitchen to start the coffee he was trying to decide where to begin as it happened he now had all the time in the world he didnt mind all that much losing his position at the sentinelcome on that was writ across the skybut he particularly regretted being denied the pleasure of quitting on his own terms complete with a flamboyant fuckyou verymuch farewell speech to the managing editor jay hed actually been rehearsing it for weeks the dream of just showing up at the dorian institute and walking in was no longer even a fantasy there was a special not welcome mat out for him even more than the first time hed need a calling card that had to be kristen starr she clearly held the key to whatever it was winston bartlett and karl van de vliet were trying to cover up but how to find her the only real lead he had was the apartment shed come back to apparently returning like a genetically programmed salmon going back upstream but not really knowing why okay why not go back down there and look around again only do it thoroughly he and ally hadnt had time to do much more than a cursory lookaround the specter of the knives in the walls still haunted him but how to get in then he remembered that ally had been given the key by kristens spacey subtenant cindy the one who was renting the groundfloor apartment did she leave that key at her citispace office or did she put it on her key ring her car keys were lying on the table by the door where hed tossed them last night he walked over and checked them out there were several house keys on the ring in addition to her toyota keys could she have put kristens key on the ring too or did she stash it in her desk at citispace swing by the apartment and try these he decided maybe ill get lucky as he headed for the shower a cup of black jamaican coffee in hand he thought again about the last thing alexas goodfornothing brother grant had said something about how alexa was their best shot whatever that meant it couldnt be good by nine oclock he had showered shaved and was in allys toyota headed for west eleventh street as he turned right on fourteenth he had a fresh idea kristens phone was still working at least as of yesterday so did she have speed dial a memory bank of numbers that could be a gold mine of the people closest to her but if not there were other tricks ways of getting phone information there might even be information in the phone itself who do you get on redial and who do you get with the last number that dialed in the last number that dialed in would probably be the japanese guy who left a message and then kidnapped her but the last call out could be interesting he had a nagging feeling that this wasnt the best way to be spending his morning but he couldnt immediately think of anything else west eleventh street was comparatively empty so he had no trouble securing a parking space after hed turned off the engine he looked at allys key set again well there were four other keys on it besides the toyota keys give it a shot he got out and locked the car and walked up the steps it was a perfect spring morning cool and crisp and this part of the village was quiet and residential he found himself envying the owners of these beautiful nineteenthcentury town houses there was something so dignified and secure about them then he saw a man emerge from the apartment below the stoop just a few feet from where he was standing hi hows cindy he called down hoping the social gesture would let the guy know he wasnt about to do a second story number on kristens town house the man who looked to be in his late twenties was dressed in a black suit with long blond hair tied back in a ponytail and carried a shoulder bag that appeared to be serving as a briefcase he stared at stone with a puzzled look who i was here yesterday and a woman named cindy friend of kristens said she was leasing the garden apartment i was just wondering im sorry maybe you have the wrong address ive had this place for almost a year and a half now he was moving on down the street as he called back over his shoulder good luck what the hell is going on he looked up and checked the number yep its cindy had definitely gone into that apartment yesterday and talked convincingly about living there and working at the e station she even had keys to kristens place so who the hell was that guy he looked back but now he had disappeared did i just imagine that he puzzled he moved up the steps to the heavy white wood door and started trying keys the first one wouldnt enter the lock nor would the second the third key entered but would not turn okay last chance he inserted the fourth and it seemed to stick but he gave it a wiggle and voila he was in thanks ally but when he stepped through the door and switched on the light he could only stare in disbelief the apartment had been completely cleared out the white walls which had been covered with knifed photos of kristen only yesterday were now blank even the few pieces of furniture were gone jesus i dont believe this his voice echoed off the empty marble mantelpiece and bounced across the room he looked around since late yesterday somebody had come in and cleaned out the place thoroughly any hopes of finding old letters an address book anything personal were gone he knew immediately that he had been outsmarted kristen starr and now her friend cindy had officially ceased to exist cindy might still be at e but she was going to be terrified and subject to massive memory loss on the subject of kristen but wait a second they left the phone the answering machine is gone but maybe they didnt realize that phones can have memories and can sometimes tell tales that might be worth a try but check out the place first he walked into the kitchen alcove and gazed around not entirely sure what he was looking for the main thing would be some phone numbers and addresses he opened the refrigerator and peered in it was still running and contained two unopened jars of british marmalade and an empty quart jar with traces of orange juice bordered by mold the freezer compartment was entirely bare the two kitchen cabinets above the stove had been similarly emptied he gave them a cursory look then came back and followed a hallway to a bathroom in the back when he opened the medicine chest above the sink and peered in he initially thought it was empty with a pile of waddedup kleenex on the bottom shelf he was pulling that out when he realized that the tissue had been wadded around an empty prescription drug vial kristen starr had prescription number it was for libinolwhatever that was probably some kind of screwedup diet pilland it had been filled five months ago it had been delivered from grove pharmacy on seventh avenue to here west eleventh street the address was pasted on a sticker on the back hmmm he thought after she left rather than transferring the prescription what if they just had subsequent refills delivered to some other address theres a long shot that grove pharmacy might have a new address for the prescription number okay it would be a very long shot but still unless of course her new address had been the dorian institute in that case the prescription would undoubtedly have been discontinued once she became a patient he reached for his cell phone to call the drugstore shit i forgot it damn hangover he walked back into the living room and stared at kristens phone if it was still working he could call grove pharmacy and no idiot that would wipe out any number stored in the redial function without a cell the best thing to do is just go over there and check with the pharmacist in person he settled yogastyle onto the hardwood floor next to the phone and stared at it what if the line is already disconnected why did whoever cleaned this place out leave it here the phone of all things its it rang he jumped a foot off the floor and then stared at it a series of reasons flashed through his mind they know im here and theyre going to warn me again to back off they know im here and the last incoming call here was from a number they dont want me to know about i pick this up and i wipe out any chance of ever finding out what it was dont answer it this phone call is not intended to be helpful not picking up the phone was the hardest thing hed ever done but he was determined to be disciplined he counted eleven rings and then he couldnt take it anymore and reached for the receiver it stopped thank god his hand froze in midair the timing had been a splitsecond salvation all right he thought time to find out if i just totally screwed up time to dial he got his pen and notebook poised and then lifted the black receiver he knew from the message on her machine yesterday that somebody had called her just before he got there or maybe whoever came and cleaned out her apartment had received a phone call while they were here possibly from whoever sent them a checkup call who knew but give it a shot he hit the code a mechanical voice came on immediately your last call was from area code number if you would like for me to connect you please push go for it he said aloud scribbling down the number and then following the instruction at that moment somebodys cell phone began to ring just outside the front door oh shit it was just too big a coincidence after two rings it stopped and he heard the voice of winston bartlett both outside the front door and in his ear yes he was too startled to respond but he didnt need to because an instant later he also heard the sound of a key and then the front door opened a shaft of daylight shot across the room as bartlett took one look and exploded damn so its true how the hell did hey come on in stone said trying to recover some poise and take marginal control of the situation im here by permission the downstairs tenant who you just evicted or kidnapped too gave me her key you dont get it do you i told you to keep but we have signs of progress i know all about kristen well that was hardly the case but it never hurt to start off with a bluff to see how far you could get thats why im here the question is when are we going to start talking to each other because im putting together a hell of a story i dont fucking believe this bartlett slammed the door by the way a special thanks for getting me sacked at the sentinel now ill have the leisure to concentrate fulltime on the stem cell book and gerex i warned you but you wouldnt fucking listen he was peering around the living room as though searching for clues to explain why nothing was going right like i said i talked to kristen yesterday stone stood his ground shes not a happy person if you bring her into this bartlett glared at him i cant imagine what makes you think you can just run roughshod through my business and my life heres how it is you can abuse me or you can use me keep in mind im accustomed to working for people who buy ink by the barrel as i tried to explain before if you wont let me get at the whole truth i may end up spreading halftruths bartlett walked across the room and ran his fingers along the marble mantelpiece above the fireplace you know he said turning back up until now youve never asked me for anything i have to say ive always admired that but im curious why maybe i thought it was your place to come to me stone said puzzled by the left turn the conversation had suddenly taken you know i have a life of my own i have an eleven yearold daughter youve never seen orapparentlycare to see im wondering what that says about you your granddaughters name by the way is i know her name i know quite a bit about our blood ties or lack of well id bet shed be just thrilled by that incidentally she doesnt know a goddam thing about you and id just as soon keep it that way i knew having this conversation was a fucking mistake this is why i never had it any real son of mine has got to have some of my character my stature youre a bean counter if you had any character you wouldnt be hiding behind all this secrecy i try to tell the truth as much and as often as i can thats my take on character what were doing at gerex is going to change the history of the world were at the brink of things mankind has only dreamed about and ive taken all the risks in fact i took the biggest risk of all personally theres a lot going on that you dont know a damned thing about were on the edge of all the more reason you should want the whole story told stone interjected yes stem cell technology is going to change everything but you cant just tell half the story i want it to work but im a truth seeker i want to find out what if anything can go wrong too youve been using people first kristen and nowim beginning to fearally to take your risks for you i mean whats going on why did you send somebody down to obliterate all evidence of kristen and now cindy that girl downstairs my god shes somehow vanished too whatever happened to kristen to make it come to this what may or may not have gone wrong is nothing that cant be made right no great medical advance ever succeeded in a direct line i dont need the sales pitch stone said i agree its going to revolutionize medicine but you cant thats why youll never be a son of mine you always think small this is about more than mere medicine its about doing the one thing mankind has never been able to do i am this close nothing is going to be allowed to destroy this chance not even you my own flesh and blood am i that stone asked feeling an unexpected satisfaction your own flesh and blood that is something bartlett said we are about to discover whether we are made of the same thing the best way for you to understand whats going on here is to do what ive done have the beta procedure show me youve got the balls the beta procedure it might help if i knew what it is why dont i just show you bartlett said you want to be on the inside see everything up close fine i think the time has come you seem determined to stick your nose into what im doing you weaseled your way into the institute and now you show up here so i guess its time you were an insider all the way good maybe then i can start getting some answers for example was changing kristens name part of the nih study stone turned to face him or is it your way to hide one of your mistakes quite frankly thats none of your goddam business well let me tell you what is my business ally hampton is a particular friend of mine i damned well want to know whether shes scheduled to undergo the same procedure as kristen i dont know what you and van de vliet did to kristen but if you turn ally into a zombie too ill personally i think well continue this discussion later he pulled his cell phone out of a jacket pocket flipped it open and punched a memory number ken could you and jake please come in we have the problem i was afraid we had he flipped the phone shut and turned back to stone karl entered ms hampton and her mother into the clinical trials at the last minute as a special favor shes in no danger now stone saw two men come through the front door one was the tall japanese man who had slugged him the day before shit i need this is he going to work me over again the other guy was dressed in white as though he were an orderly or nurse stone noticed he had a plastic syringe in his right hand ken could you and jake please take care of this hell be going with us stone examined the three of them well he thought guess im going to be back inside the dorian institute after all look theres no need for excessive violence here we could just set some ground rules for this situation the japanese man named ken walked over and seized him around the neck while at the same time pulling his right arm around behind him a decisive hammerlock you fucker stone choked out let the man bartlett had called jake the one in white shoved a needle into his arm this could be the experience youve been looking for bartlett said youve been pursuing me like a dog chasing a car now were about to see if youre man enough to handle the consequences when youve caught it youre damned right ill handle it he tried to say but he wasnt sure if he actually got it said the void was closing in so fast chapter thursday april pm grant is that you ally squinted in the semidark of the room finally making out the silhouette he was sitting in a chair beside her bed and his face was troubled reminding her of when hed had a bad day in high school am i dreaming again she puzzled the clock on the wall told her that this was a late hour for whatever he was up to now its me he said his voice low just above a whisper the door behind him she noticed was shut welcome back to the world they moved you upstairs just for tonight this is the first chance ive had to get near you she was still wondering where she was what day it was the walls were an icy blue illuminated only by the silver andgreen glow of the bank of crt screens that now monitored her heart and her respiration she lifted her head off the pillow and for a moment looked past grant examining the screen of the heart monitor it was a phonocardiogram she knew what to look for over the years shed learned to interpret every irregular pulse every errant amplitude but now the sonic abnormalities that typically characterized her stenosis the struggle of her hearts scarred valve to maintain adequate coronary output were significantly damped thered always been murmurs abnormal heart sounds as long as she could remember so what did this mean had the damaged valve already begun restoring and strengthening itself while she slept or was this just more of some dream why was she in this hospital anyway hooked up to monitors she still couldnt remember exactly what she tried to rise up out of the bed again she wondered was grant real or some chimera then she realized she was strapped in though the straps were held only with black velcro as she started to pull them open she noticed she had an iv needle in her arm with a plastic tube that led to a bag of liquid suspended from a hook above her head more annoying however was the checkerboard of tapedon sensors on her upper body for the ongoing phonocardiogram she looked at all the tubes and connected wires and felt like a laboratory animal in the middle of an experiment ally youre at the dorian institute remember dr van de vliets stem cell clinical trials ninas here too oh that rang a bell sort of what what day is it he told her youve been under sedation since late yesterday ally but dr vee says your test data show youre responding moms here right now things were starting to come back hows she doing is she hes talking about discharging her by the end of next week even before the nih clinical trials are officially over grant tried a smile by then he thinks the procedure will have replaced enough tissue in her brain that she might not even need a caregiver shes doing crosswords again need i say more my god now she remembered how onagain offagain ninas mind had been when she brought her out to the institute had she really been given a second chance and so quickly if so it was truly astonishing but now she found herself staring at grant mesmerized something about him seemed oddly off grant what whats going on with you ive he was hesitating ive been thinking about everything now i really wish i hadnt done what i did what are you talking about this kind of revisionist remorse didnt sound like the grant she knew have you seen kristen they said you know about her were asking about her then he stepped back do you know about her kristen she tried to remember is that the woman everybody her mother had come to the institute with a pistol trying to find her then she was kidnapped its the syndrome grant went on she wanted the beta procedure and dr vee finally agreed but nobody expected anything to happen like what eventually did thats why wb went ahead and had it too beta now she remembered that kristen had mumbled something about that word ally i got you into when i told w b that i thought you and he had the same rare blood type ab he wanted to bring you into the program you mean for my heart he looked away and his eyes grew pained well thats part of it theres another part they havent told you about whats that antibodies they think theres a chance you could be made to develop them and then they could use them to help wb he doesnt have the syndrome yet but its probably just a matter of time what she puzzled is he talking about what antibodies what syndrome she was weak and she wasnt sure her mind was fully functional but after what appeared to be the miracle of her heart she was willing to forsake a certain amount of momentary rationality then more memory started returning kristen what about her i saw ally the syndrome started with her over four months ago at first they didnt fully realize how serious but now its getting worse every day he paused and turned away look ive been thinking im really sorry that i brought you into this what if something goes wrong what do you mean if you could see kristen now youd understand where is she is she still wherever theyre hiding her no he turned back kristen after what happened yesterday she had to be brought back out here theres a ward downstairs on the floor below the offices and lab thats kind of like an intensivecare unit thats where you were until tonight but you cant go back down there on your own not even the nurses can go without a special authorization which is never given but if kristen is ally you re the one im worried about i thought what they were going to do to you was safe but last night i i heard them all talking and i think you could be in serious danger they dont actually know what the consequences of what theyre doing will be you need to get out of here and at least get the real story i dont want this on my hands truthfully there could be some deep legal shit coming out of all this i can think of at least three felonies i dont want any part of that liability and i want you to testify that i got you out of here if it ever comes to that finally the straight story she thought hes afraid hes about to be an accomplice in a criminal conspiracy hes getting cold feet grant do something for me get me unplugged all these sensors i want to go see her for myself ally forget it to begin with i cant unplug you only a nurse can do that and i dont want to youve got catheters in places i then ill get a nurse to come and do it ill say i need to go to the bathroom that should get me unhooked annoyed she looked around wheres the buzzer there has to be one somewhere then she spotted a set of controls attached to the bed and sure enough there was a red button what else could it be she pushed it and a light came on above her door moments later a short bluehaired woman with the name marion sewn into her white uniform opened the door and came striding in flicking on the fluorescent overheads my my were looking well she declared ignoring grant im glad youre finally awake he told us to call him the minute theyre all saying you and your mother must have special genes youve both been such terrific patients hed been keeping you sedated but he discontinued that medication this afternoon he wanted you to wake up with your mind clear well id really like to get up and go to the bathroom and get something to eat ally said mainly i just want to get out of this bed for a stretch before i start developing bedsores im feeling strong for now at least can you unhook some of these wires and suction cups and i certainly dont need that iv im so hungry i could inhale a quart of ice cream in one gulp yes of course marion said and began dismantling the intravenous tubes we only monitor you and hydrate you when youre not conscious the standard procedure is to let you get up and start getting some exercise as soon as possible you should be careful though because at this point youre not as strong as you think changes are taking place in your body that require a lot of your energy if you feel up to it you could walk around for a couple of minutes but you shouldnt let yourself get tired as marion continued now removing the tapedon sensors ally looked up and saw another uniformed nurse standing in the doorway she also was middleaged with prematurely gray hair and she was holding a syringe may i come in she asked at this stage he needs a blood sample every three hours just twenty ccs ally watched as the new nurse quickly and deftly took a small sample of blood then she capped it off and turned to leave i need to centrifuge this immediately and she was gone then marion finished removing the iv tube and catheter and all the tapedon electrodes if you want to get up and use the bathroom and walk around a little im sure it would be all right ill come back in a few minutes and bring you a tray with a nice healthy bowl of broth the moment she was out the door ally turned to grant i want to see kristen now i thought the first thing you wanted was to go to the bathroom ill get to that you said she was downstairs somewhere how do i get there its in the security zone he said youre not authorized youre a big shot around here winston bartletts righthand flunky so why dont you authorize me yourself ally you know i cant do that then take me there i dont want to see kristen anymore he declared biting his lip shes completely lost everything i could deal with it until i saw her this morning its just too much has he let her mother see her are you kidding letting that psycho anywhere near her is the last thing anybodys going to do then get me in dammit ally forget about it why he hesitated as though marshaling his thoughts sis he said finally therere only so many risks i can take for you and they have to be about something that matters forget about kristen nothing can save her now but im offering to help you get out of here before they go any further i cant be seen helping you but theyve started you down a road that you dont want to go believe me i got you into this but if theres still time i want to try to help get you out she didnt know what was going on but if grant of all people was freaked about what karl van de vliet had in store for her then maybe shed better take it seriously but she was through relying on him for anything okay but i want to call somebody to come and get me are you referring to that reporter by any chance he asked the guy who drove you here wb hates him yes she was puzzled that he would know about stone how do you bartlett has him what do you mean hes radioactive now i actually kicked him out of here myself yesterday this is not a moment for press freedom he could screw up everything wb said hes doing a book no way is that guy going to be allowed human contact with anybody till the sale of gerex is in the bank he had a runin with bartlett in the city and they took him somewhere i dont know the location and i dont want to know oh my god hes most likely okay its just temporary safekeeping all the more reason im not leaving till i see kristen theres no way youre going to get into where theyre keeping her ally all right there was no arguing with him when he was this freaked what do you want me to do he pulled a plastic card out of his jacket pocket it was white with the gerex corporation embossed on one side and a magnetic strip on the other this is a master key to this place because of security you cant just go out the front through the lobby but if you take the elevator down to the first floor of the basement where the lab is theres a fire exit there in the back that opens onto a path down to the lake if youll go out that door and wait right there ill come around and get you to the parking lot i know a way that will miss their surveillance cameras im scheduled to go back to the city now and ill take you with me but if i wanted to see kristen youd have to go into the laboratory and then take the elevator thats inside there dont even think about it its way too risky she looked at him trying to gauge his sincerity had he become a new man finally caring about somebody other than himself or had a glimpse of whatever had happened to kristen scared the hell out him and awakened the specter of being part of a felonious enterprise why are you doing this to make up for a few things he said turning to leave with that he walked out and quietly closed the door that remains to be seen she told herself she went to the bathroom then put on a bathrobe and headed out into the hallway the nurses station was not occupied marion was still in the kitchen on the first floor presumably good she was feeling shaky not nearly as strong as shed initially thought she was but she pressed on taking the elevator her first use of grants gerex master key she bypassed the first floor and an instant later she was stepping into the basements laboratory area at the moment it appeared to be entirely deserted though the fluorescent lights bathed the space in a stark pitiless light down the hall was dr van de vliets office and the examining room where she and her mother had gone when they were being admitted at this time of night everything was closed and probably locked she turned and looked at the forbidding entryway to the glassenclosed laboratory through the transparent walls she could see the dim glow of crt screens and incubators filled with petri dishes and there at the back wascould her eyes be trustedthe outline of an elevator door she hadnt noticed it until this minute it seemed to be built with a nod toward camouflage it could lead to kristen she told herself find out what grant is so freaked about he can wait a couple of minutes she was starting to feel even weaker but she pressed on next to the heavy steel highsecurity air lock leading into the laboratory was a card reader and she swiped the white card through the slot the air lock opened silent and perfunctory when she went through the door behind her automatically closed and then the hermetically sealed door in front of her opened she was in next a bright fluorescent light clicked on all by itself jesus maybe it was connected to a motion sensor or on a timer then she looked around this she thought is the place where the gerex corporation has supposedly changed medical history what was created in this very room had if grant was telling the truth saved her mothers sanity and if she could believe the monitors she had looked at in her room her own heart condition had begun to be reversed after a lifetime of progressive decline yet something about it had been pushed too far somewhere in the midst of this miracle the gerex corporation had done something so obscene no one could even talk about it she looked around the laboratory wishing she could understand what she was seeing it smelled like solvent acetone with a mingling of more pungent fumes the black slate laboratory workbenches were spotlessly hygienic and equipped with several large microscopes that featured flatpanel screens she noticed a heavy server computer at the back presumably networked to all the terminals in the building and then she remembered that van de vliet had once spoken of computer simulations someday soon she told herself she was going to understand what really was going on here but for now she headed for the elevator another zip of grants white card and the door opened there was indeed a floor below the laboratory and she pushed the button the dorian institute was all about security but this subbasement area was doubly secure after a quick trip down the elevator door opened onto another air lock chamber this an exit from the pressurized environment of the laboratory why she wondered had no one spotted her yet perhaps this part of the clinic was such a lockdown that nurses and guards werent necessary as she stepped from the air lock she was in a hallway she walked down and tried the first unmarked door it was locked but then she saw the slot for her card she slipped it in and the door opened automatically the room she entered had a row of beds each shrouded in a curtain as she walked down the center aisle she realized that only one of the beds was occupied and yes it was kristen she was lying there and when ally slid back the curtain her eyes clicked open startled hi dont be afraid im a friend she quietly finished drawing the curtain aside now the oncebreezy kristen starr was staring at her with angry eyes the false bravado of a frightened child and she looked much younger than she had in the head shot shed attached to the walls of her town house with steak knives she said nothing for a moment then she mouthed who are you i talked to you on the phone a couple of days ago ally said not sure herself exactly when it was when you went down to your place on west eleventh street i dont know you she mouthed again this time with a slight whisper my name is ally hampton she moved next to her so she could keep her voice down im an interior designer i once did an apartment for you in chelsea im about to go on a journey she whispered i dont remember you but maybe youre the one whos going with me there was something otherworldly and chilling about her voice what journey do you we were going to go away thats what he promised just us two well im ready i want to go out and play but he doesnt care anymore he just wants me to disappear so thats what ill do only well do it together you and me she reached up from her bed and ran a finger across allys face will you take me out of here he promised me everything that i could get it all back but now i know he didnt care he was just using me she stopped then gave a cruel laugh from the back of her throat but now its going to happen to him too i can tell thats why he doesnt want to see me anymore he doesnt want to see whats in store for him what has happened ally wondered it sounds like some kind of bizarre experiment gone wrong wont you come with me kristen went on well go to a place nobody has ever been to before itll be just us her seductive eyes at once plaintive and demanding would have lured anyone toward wherever she wanted to go for a careless moment ally found herself wanting to follow them no this is madness or ally thought with horror is she seeing something in me that i cant see kristen listen to me please i think its very possible ive just had a stem cell procedure for my heart i dont know if its like what you had but i want to know what happened to you dont do it she mumbled seeming to come back to a kind of reality just get out of here now after it starts he gives you shots and things but nothing works ally felt her consciousness start to wobble she reached out and seized the edge of the bed for support kristen talk to me her eyes went blank again and ally could just barely make out what she mumbled next in fact all she could catch were random words words that only drifted through her consciousness and failed to stick or make any sense it was as though kristen were in a stance and sleepwalking among the words of some alien language young kristen seemed to say you want to be to stay old is so horrible time youre young and then suddenly youre old and it turns out you cant ally heard the words but they didnt make any sense im sorry kristen im feeling a little dizzy its started she said abruptly coherent again and focusing in on ally thats how it began with me at first they said everything was okay and then it wasnt what are you talking about its happening throughout my body she sobbed ive stopped having periods and im getting acne everything is changing the words drifted through space and ally felt like she was hallucinating in a place where time was sliding sideways the images were all retro things from her past that floated through her vision in reverse chronological order that was it in her mind time was going backwards but was it just in her mind she looked again at kristen and gasped finally finally she understood the horror of what was really happening oh my god i got here as soon as i could after they called me came a voice from the doorway she turned and saw karl van de vliet together with the nurse marion you really shouldnt be down here i dont know who gave you a card but weve brought a wheelchair you really should be resting marion rolled the chair through the door and expertly plucked the card from the reader now please sit down she said we all just want to be on the safe side dont we ill need to give you a sedative ally looked at van de vliet wanting to strangle him no youre not giving me a damned sedative i dont want to be on the safe side i want the truth and i want it now chapter thursday april pm lets go into the lab to talk van de vliet said im very sorry i wasnt here when you came out of sedation but marion called me at home as id told her to do and i came in as quickly as i could ive got a place on the lake just down the road so im never far away he was rolling her through the air lock door marion behind them then they took the elevator up she was furious that kristen was being left behind like an abandoned casualty of war ally also was reminding herself about her appointment with grant to get the hell out but her mind was having trouble holding a lot of thoughts at once he pushed her wheelchair into the section of the laboratory where a line of computer terminals was stationed after hed fluffed a pillow behind her head and turned off some of the glaring fluorescents he began alexa this is a delicate time for you we need to get you upstairs as quickly as possible and feed you some broth and put you back to bed however i want very much to give you an update on the status of your treatment the headline is its going very well we fused some of the telomerase enzyme with your existing stem cells and your response was immediate in fact it appears the new heart tissue has reached critical mass and has already begun replicating itself weve learned to expect the unexpected around here but your response has significantly exceeded our simulations he turned to marion and asked her to go up and make sure alexas bedding had been changed well be up in a second and please make sure that bowl of broth is ready and waiting after she departed through the air lock he walked over to a lab bench and checked the numbers that were scrolling on a crt screen all right ally said talk to me i just saw kristen im still not sure if i believe what i think is happening but i want the real story and i want it now thats part of what i need to discuss with you he glanced away for a long moment a pained expression on his face seeming to collect his thoughts finally he turned back you see the clinical trials have demonstrated that we can use the telomerase enzyme to immortalize a patients own stem cells and then rejuvenate their brain or liver or even their heart so the next question thats hanging out there in space is obvious what would happen if we could find a way to generalize the enzyme and disperse it throughout someones entire body not restricting it to just one organ and not just rejuvenateregenerate this question had actually passed fleetingly through her consciousness though not fully articulated it had taken the form of wondering where the use of these immortal cells could eventually lead the trick would be to have just enough enzyme in your bloodstream to replace senescent cells as they are about to the but not so much that healthy cells are replaced he paused searching for a metaphor if we thought of the process of cell senescence as something inexorable and steady like a treadmill then what we want to do is run just fast enough to stay in one place this whole thing does sound like alice in wonderland yes well if we could do that then its possible just possible that ones entire body would simply begin regenerating itself instead of aging not just your skin all of you thats the theory behind what weve called the beta procedure but is that something you ethically ought to be doing she said feeling a sense of dismay of playing god isnt that going too far frankly im beginning to agree with you but there are others who ask how far is too far half the medicines we now have are intended to trick the bodys responses somehowor to meddle in some other way turning off stopand go signals at the cellular level for example some birth control pills make your body think youre already pregnant they trick our natural mechanisms that kind of thing is commonplace in medicine today but our research is poised for the next level to answer the question of how long we can actually live so heres the argument theres no reason the human life span has to be what it is in some unhealthy nations the average citizen doesnt even reach sixty whereas in others like the united states and japan the mean is already well past three score and ten so what is right what is reasonable a hundred two hundred its entirely possible to believe we could live productive lives at least twice as long as we do now and you think we should do this the world would be thrown into chaos but look at the incredible cure rate weve already effected here using the telomerase enzyme when our clinical trials for the nih are announced it will be the medical equivalent of the shot heard round the world nothing we know will ever be the same again thats where you should leave it to go further is obscene i fear recent events may have proved you right against my better judgment i went ahead and experimented with the beta procedure and the results thus far have turned out to be disastrous i guess youre referring to kristen one day i casually mentioned the beta to winston bartlett and without telling me he brought it up with kristen she insisted on trying it his expression grew increasingly pained i want you to know i was against it i warned her that it was highly experimental that i could not guarantee what the side effects might be but she begged me to do it anyway then bartlett essentially ordered me to do it so what happened he grimaced i got the dosage wrong thats my best guess after i performed the beta on kristen the enzyme was stable in her for over two months and appeared to be having an effect all signs of aging abruptly stopped it gave me a false sense of confidence also there were no side effects that was when bartlett wanted to try it too so i went ahead with him but then to my horror she started evincing side effects i now believe the dosage i gave her was badly calibrated it was too highby how much i think ive finally determinedand the enzyme eventually began replicating too rapidly it got away from me he paused what happened to kristen we now call the syndrome for lack of a better name and its about to happen to bartlett but what does all this have to do with me why was i brought out here with all kinds of bribes and pressure and do you want a simple answer of excruciating honesty it would be helpful the simple answer is winston bartlett has an extremely rare blood type its ab you have the same how did you know your brother you see i need to try to develop antibodies to the telomerase enzyme that wont be rejected by his immune system i think theres an outside chance that i could culture antibodies taken from someone with the same blood type and use them to arrest the rampant multiplying of telomerase enzyme about to begin in bartletts blood im here because youre using me she couldnt believe her ears and grant had set it up no wonder he was finally feeling guilty i just need to borrow your immune system for a few days its very safe i dont think so im out of here actually the procedure is already under way while debra was taking your last blood sample she also injected a minuscule amount of the telomerase enzyme in active form the proprietary version used in the beta into your bloodstream dont worry its perfectly safe the dosage was so minute that theres no way it could have any effect on you you have got to be kidding my god she thought i could sue the hell out of dont worry think of it like a smallpox vaccination he paused now though i have to tell you that i just learned the initial dosage probably didnt do the trick the amount of antibodies created was unfortunately minuscule which means we need to go to a slightly higher infusion but again dont worry its still safe i cant believe im hearing this she said finally gasping for air in her fury you didnt ask alexa he cut in right now i have something like two weeks left to try to head off the syndrome in winston bartlett if we achieve that then im hopeful the antibodies he creates can be successfully used to start reversing the syndrome in kristen we will know how to manage the beta who knows where that could lead but it all begins with you youre the clean slate we need to start before we go one step further i want to know what exactly happens with the syndrome i think i know but id like to hear something thats too bizarre to believe it literally defies every natural law weve ever known he couldnt bring himself to put it in words she thought but she knew shed guessed right the first time the syndrome kristen starr was growing younger that was the horrible development and nobody could deal with it and they couldnt stop it karl van de vliet had created a monstrosity i am so out of here she said struggling to rise from the wheelchair if you try to keep me here thats kidnapping were talking a capital crime alexa i understand youre upset but youre in no condition to be discharged im very sorry he pushed a red button on a radio device on his belt there was genuine agony in his eyes ive never in my life coerced a patient in any way but you have to understand that so much is dependent on you now there are no easy choices left hes lost control of the situation here now she told herself hes truly terrified of winston bartlett thats whos really got control of my fate moments later the security guard from the lobby accompanied by marion came through the door of the laboratory no im not going to let you do this ally declared im not letting you do any more medical experiments on me as she struggled again to get out of the wheelchair she felt a prick in her arm and saw the glint of a needle in the dim light im sorry alexa it should all be over in just a couple of days and i swear no harm will come to you she was feeling her consciousness swirl as marion began rolling her through the steel air lock the last thing she heard was van de vliet saying dont worry a week from now all this will seem like a dream chapter friday april am stone felt his consciousness returning as the blast of an engine cut through his sedativeinduced reverie where was he there were vibrations all around him and a deafening roar that was slowly spiraling upward in frequency and volume as the haze that engulfed his mind slowly began to dissipate he wondered if this wasnt more of the fantasy hed been having of flying through some kind of multicolored spacetime continuum or was he waking up to something spectacularly real as he opened his eyes and looked around he realized it was no dream he was in a cramped airline seat strapped in with a black seat belt his head was gently secured to a headrest by a soft cotton scarf but his hands were free lying in his lap somebody had lifted him into the seat and strapped him down on his left was a plexiglas window and when he looked out he saw the earth beneath him begin falling away my god then he realized he was in a whiteandgray helicopter that had just lifted off from a rooftop helo pad he watched spellbound quickly coming awake as the craft quickly began a flight path that circled around and past the lower end of manhattan then he heard the pilot speaking curtly to an air controller somewhere and he looked up and realized it was the same samurai bastard whod slugged him on the street and then aided in his kidnapping but that had to be yesterday or god knows how many days ago he was realizing hed just lost a chunk of his life and now he was being taken somewhere in a very big hurry being up here always seems like being closer to god came a voice from behind him he recognized it with a jolt it was the man who thought he was god shakily he removed the scarf that had been holding his head and turned around winston bartlett was gazing down through his own plastic window seemingly talking to himself what what the hell is going on he could barely get the words out oh bartlett said turning to look at him good i particularly wanted you to see this it should help make my point stone struggled to comprehend what was happening he was with the man he had wanted to call father for nearly four decades whether he could admit that to himself or not it could be the beginning of the kind of bonding he had always hungered for but he didnt want it like this they finally had a relationship and it was completely antagonistic he had just been drugged and kidnapped by his own father this after being threatened and fired again daddy dearest so what was this evolving chapter about winston bartlett he knew could be ruthless but he also was a visionary in his own way then he remembered what had happened hed been trying to track down kristen where where are we going were going to the place you seem to find so interesting bartlett declared over the din of the engine but i was hoping that we could have a rational discourse along the way whats been happening thus far doesnt serve either of us im hoping things have cooled down a bit and we can call a truce stone was still trying to clear his head get the cobwebs away it was difficult hed lost consciousness in a town house in the village on solid ground and regained it here where the earth itself seemed in motion and now bartlett was trying out another bargaining style so even the rules appeared to be in flux look down there bartlett was projecting through the din around them and pointing toward the wide expanse of new york harbor this mcdonnell douglas is my zendo my monastery and the world below is my contemplative garden i come up here to find peace this is an intersection of the great forces of nature one of a finite number on earth where a mighty river returns to the salt sea from which it came these waters have flowed in the same cycle for millions billions of years mingling evaporating separating againjust as life on this planet continually replicates itself growing and aging and dying but not before producing the seeds of its replacement how can something be at once both timeless and constantly changing i ponder that a lot and i always end up thinking of this river meeting the sea down there nature is a force unto itself oblivious to good or evil to human desires or human laws bartlett was doing a riff on some obsession of his own stone decided or maybe it was some of the zen philosophy that went along with acquiring a worldclass collection of samurai swords if you believed the published profiles all the same looking down at the sprawling city and the harbor full of ships it was hard not to feel omnipotent and humble at the same time the thing bartlett seemed to be getting at though was that nature could not be told what to do and he seemed to be on the verge of declaring himself a part of that unbridled natural force also powerful enough to do whatever he pleased now they were heading up the hudson teeming with early bird tourist cruises and small singlemasted sailboats bartlett paused to take in the view with satisfaction finally he continued his monologue i know weve had our differences but im prepared to try to get past that i want to talk to you about something i always think of when i fly across this river time i call my obsession time and the river physicists will tell you that time should be thought of as a kind of fourth dimension things are always at a certain place in three dimensions but when you describe the location of a subatomic particle for example you also have to say when it was there to locate it accurately you need four dimensions we think of them all as rigid but what if one of them could be made fluid what if you could alter the character of time in spite of himself stone took the bait i dont know what this has to do with anything nobody can alter the pace of time he found himself recalling a snippet of verse by john donne o how feeble is mans power that if good fortune fall cannot add another hour nor a lost hour recall strictly speaking thats true bartlett said gravely turning away again to stare out the plexiglas window down into the morning space below them the hudson was now a giant ribbon of blue heading north into the mist but what if we could alter the clocks in our body to make them run slower he smiled then pointed off to his left all this below us has happened in a couple of hundred years what will it look like down there in another hundred years will we still need these puny machines to fly or will there be teleportation whatever it is what would you give to be around to see that to have your own time slow down while the world around you went on stone was looking out into space wondering not whether winston bartlett was an egomaniacal madman but rather how truly mad he really was flying in the helicopter he felt like faust being shown the world by mephistopheles except here satan was his own father offering him a teasing prospect of what it would be like to live on and on it would make a hell of a story the problem was miracles always came with some kind of terrible price what was the price this time then he had another thought was that what had happened to kristen was she paying the price for some kind of hubris that pushed nature too far nobody had claimed she had any kind of medical condition that necessitated a stem cell intervention so had she been experimenting with some other procedure had mephistopheles now called in his marker he wanted to ask but the vibration and the noise made his brain feel like it was in a blender do you understand what im saying bartlett went on do you want to be part of the most exciting development in the history of medicine well this is your chance there is a majestic experiment under way but now we know its not for the fainthearted the question is do you want to live life or just write about it i think its time i heard the whole story stone said finally forcing out the words whats your part in this experiment ive put everything at risk but now im this close to controlling the clock so are you my son my flesh and blood do you have the balls to try it too stone suspected the question was rhetorical he was already up to his neck in whatever was going on he just didnt yet know how big a part of it he was while hed been sedated overnight had they started experiments on him he knew that some of the buzz about stem cells involved the fantasy that someday they might be used to forestall the aging process responsible researchers all said that they werent trying to extend life they were only hoping to make a normal lifetime more livable rejuvenative medicine winston bartlett however had just taken stem cell potential to its obvious conclusion he was talking about doing what others did not dare regenerative medicine what would we give to be able to look forward to thousands of mornings like this ending it all only when we chose he declared his hands sweeping over the dense green beneath them time would become something that merely flows endlessly through us ever renewing socalled old age would cease to exist at least for those with the courage to take the necessary risks now they were moving above the pine forests that comprised the outer ring of the greater new york suburbs as below them the green wilds of new jersey north of the gw bridge were sweeping by hmmm stone pondered if a man somehow stopped growing older and nobody else did at some point hed end up being the same age as his grandchildren that caused him to think again about amy and wonder if bartlett would ever reconcile himself to her existence a few minutes later he looked down and saw a wide clearing in the trees and a redtile roof they had arrived but from the air the dorian institute gave no clue to the momentous research going on inside bartlett said nothing as they began their descent and in moments they were settling onto the rooftop landing pad the downdraft from the rotor cleared away a few soggy leaves which had somehow blown there and then the japanese pilot cut the power and the sound died away when bartlett opened the side door the first thing stone noticed was the fresh forestscented morning air against his face he found himself wondering whether the roar of the engine had disturbed the patients but that was almost beside the point the dorian institute was not he now realized merely about using stem cell technology to heal the sick bartlett had been letting him know that it was also about an experiment that was much much more profound in the silence that followed bartlett stepped onto the pad and lit a thin filtered cigar for somebody whod just been talking about how long it was possible to live the act confounded credulity he took a deep drag then tossed it onto the paving and peered back through the opening are you able to walk yet i think i can manage stone said he actually wasnt sure at all the vibrations of the chopper had done serious damage to his sense of equilibrium but he did find he could take small steps as they moved to the stairwell leading down to the thirdfloor elevator bartlett said i know youve been here once before you tried to sneak in grant saw you and sent you packing well this time youre here for real the full experience were going to start by taking you down to the lab and checking you in the man stone suspected was trying to hide everything that was going on in his mind he wanted to talk about grandiose themes but his mind was really somewhere else beneath all the braggadocio there was the smell of deep abiding fear winston bartlett was in some kind of major denial you know life has been good to me bartlett declared as though thinking out loud ive done and seen things most mortals can only dream of im sixtyseven but i feel as though ive only just begun to live and thats what i intend to happen he turned back to stone whether i have a son to share this with remains to be seen a son stone glanced back at the man bartlett had called ken who was now shutting down the mcdonnell douglas maybe he was a surrogate son for bartlett he was clearly a lot more than a bodyguard hed been the one who nabbed kristen and returned her to the reservation so what did he think of whatever was going on or what about allys brother grant hed claimed he was the son bartlett longed for and had never had winston bartlett already had a surfeit of sons when they walked through the door and into the hallway of the third floor it was milling with the breakfast crowd nurses and patients but no one took any special notice of winston bartlett the man who had made it all possible did they even know who he was stone wondered were going downstairs bartlett directed him toward the elevator im still offering you a choice you can be part of the biggest medical advance in human history or you can be just another impediment stone glanced at his watch the hour was just shy of nine where is ally what kind of procedure has she undergone is she okay he had to find her as they headed down he felt like it was a descent into some pit of no return winston bartlett had not elaborated on what awaited down there it was as though he couldnt bring himself to face whatever it really was what was the worstcase scenario at this point what he had to do was figure that out and then plan a countermove chapter friday april pm there are sounds of doors opening and closing with whispered words that are like alien hisses she senses she is in motion on a bed that is gliding past powerful overhead lights she doesnt know where she is but that doesnt matter because wherever it was she knows it surely is a dream all she remembers is that karl van de vliet had told her he wants her to undergo a second procedure with the telomerase enzyme which possibly might create sufficient antibodies to reverse its all a jumble now in her mind or had she just dreamed all that now her life seems a flowing river that has no beginning and no end her mind is drifting a cork bobbing helplessly in the current then her brother grant drifts alongside her at least she thinks its grant she recognizes his voice ally can you hear me he seems to be asking is there anything you want to tell me do you still want to go through with this its the kind of dream where she can hear things around her but when she tries to speak no sounds will come instead shes talking inside her head im afraid im just afraid i can still try to get you out but you have to help i waited for you last night but you never came she wants to say yes get me out but she can only speak in the dream now the lighting changes and she feels like she is falling no she realizes shes just on an elevator talk to me ally whispers the voice one last time i can try to stop them but i have to know what you want then a door opens and she floats through it and out then comes the clanking of a door that reminds her of the steel air lock shed gone through last night looking for kristen the smells shes in the laboratory we can take her from here comes a voice drifting through her reverie she fantasizes its karl van de vliet or maybe he really is there in her dream state its hard to know but he isnt alone you said youd make one more attempt to create the antibodies is its winston bartlett or at least it sounds like him i said i would do all i could wb the first attempt you know what happened i got almost no results but i gave you an injection of all i managed to garner today i spent the day doing simulations were working closer to the edge than i thought thats why i needed her down at the lab tonight i want to run some more tests and then try to make a decision tonight theres just a hell of a lot more risk than i first thought the voice trails off and ally finds herself trying to comprehend risk she hears beta again and it floats through her mind but now its meaning is unclear its something shed heard but can no longer place ally comes a ghostly voice surely this is a dream and she recognizes it as her father arthur now she can see him hes wearing a white cap and theyre boating in central park he shows up in her dreams a lot and she feels hes the messenger of her unconscious telling her truths that she sometimes doesnt want to hear ally he says hes going to perform the full beta procedure on you he didnt tell you but you know its true he thinks hes finally calculated everything right cant you see is that what you want she isnt sure what she wants and right now she isnt entirely clear where she fits on the scale of sleepingwaking it is so bizarre the two parts of her mind the conscious and the unconscious are talking to each other her unconscious is warning her about fears she didnt even know she had or at least she hadnt admitted to yet then she hears winston bartletts voice again karl we cant save kristen now ive finally realized that shes gone too far its just a tragedy well have to figure out how to live with the body is a complex chemical laboratory that sometimes gets out of balance theres always hope i think know what i fucking think bartlett cuts him off i think im in line for the syndrome if you dont get this right what ally wants to do more than anything else is to make sense of what her options are the most obvious one in fact maybe the only oneis to flow along with that infinite river she feels around her just to lie where she is in this sedativeinduced reverie and let her body be taken over by karl van de vliet perhaps he has marvelous things in store for her except she has no idea whats real and what is imaginary the simulations are giving me some idea of what went wrong with the beta before the voice is van de vliets i have one more test to run but if i handled this the way the simulation now suggests i think i could actually generate the telomerase antibodies we need and get the beta to finally work avoiding the syndrome but to prove it would require a fullscale experiment im reluctant to do that without alexas permission christ karl are you getting cold feet this is a hell of a time for that call it a pang of rationality but everything is at stake i dont know whats eventually going to happen with the syndrome but its criminal to jeopardize any more lives van de vliet sighs look you had the procedure of your own free will and you knew the risks alexa hampton didnt volunteer for the beta shes not a lab rat at the very least we ought to get her to sign a release the liability is in any case im not doing anything till i run this last test then maybe ill have some idea exactly how much risk is involved and then by god were going to do it tonight this is it she feels a cold metal object insinuate itself against her chest time rushes around her sending her forward on a journey that seems increasingly inevitable where its taking her she has no idea but she senses she no longer has an option of whether she wants to go or not now her dreamscape has become crowded as grant drifts in once more he seems to be wearing a white lab coat like the others he settles beside her and takes her hand ally its going to be okay im going to be here for you grant why are you here do you really give a damn about me she wants to talk to him but the words arent working why is this happening dont let them give you more medications she tells herself get your mind back and get out of here chapter friday april pm ellen ohara had not left after the day shift ended at six pm instead she had told dr van de vliet that she wanted to reorganize some of the nih paper files she kept in her office on the first floor the truth was she had become convinced that the culmination of something deeply evil was scheduled for later that night the evil had begun when kristen starrs mother arrived looking for her and declaring that shed been kidnapped then after dr vee categorically denied he knew anything about her a blatant lie kristen was brought back to the institute from wherever shed been moved to and she was visibly changed she was whisked down to the subbasement the moment she arrived and immediately sealed off in intensive care but it was clear she had no idea who she was or where she was something horrible had happened to her and maybe it was imagination but she no longer even looked like a grown woman then this morning bartlett and his japanese bodyguard brought in the young man who had accompanied alexa hampton but he wasnt put through the admissions formalities instead he was taken directly downstairs may at the front desk said she thought he was a newspaper reporter shed met once when they were on a publichealth panel together that was when ellen realized he was stone aimes that feisty medical columnist for the new york sentinel now stone aimes might be able to save alexa hampton dr van de vliet and debra had carried out a special stem cell procedure for her aortic stenosis the first that they had attempted for that particular condition the results as shown by her file were nothing short of astonishing shed begun responding in a matter of hours she should be in a room upstairs so why was she still down in the subbasement now ellen ohara knew the reason she had seen in the file that they were going to perform the beta procedure on alexa hampton when theyd performed it on kristen starr the result was a horrific side effect and now they were going to do it again tonight the criminality that started with kristen starr and katherine starr was going to be compounded she was about to become part of a criminal conspiracy she had to put a stop to it she was nervous about confronting van de vliet but she didnt know what she could say that wouldnt sound like an indictment still she was damned well determined to do it if nothing else it would provide a diversion she put away the files and walked out into the dim hallway then made her way into the reception area everything all right grace she asked the nurse at the desk my youre working late came the pleasant reply quiet as a mouse around here i guess itll be even quieter when the clinical trials are finished i mean after the celebrating is over right but theyre not over ellen thought and there may not be a celebration im going down to sublevel one is dr vee down there now i think hes in his office everybody else went out for a bite probably that diner down the road i think somethings scheduled for later on i dont know everybody looks kind of worried well nobody has said anything to me they dont need to she thought i saw the file she swiped her card through the security slot and got onto the elevator when she stepped off the laboratory was dark and a light was showing under dr van de vliets office door good she swiped her card in the reader next to the laboratory air lock and went in another swipe and she was on the elevator down to the subbasement where she was not authorized to be she went to the second door and slipped her card through the slot wondering what she would see the room was dark and smelled of alcohol and disinfectant she quickly closed the door behind her before turning on the overhead fluorescents alexa hampton was secured to the bed with restraints and she appeared to be sedated though she did slowly open her eyes as the light flickered and then stabilized there was a wheelchair in the corner ms hampton can you hear me she whispered hoping not to alarm her do you remember me i was the one who helped you when you were first admitted she watched as alexa stared at her for a moment and then quietly nodded i i want to get out of here her eyelids fluttered and then she closed her eyes again but im too weak i cant move youre strapped down love let me help you she reached for the velcro straps and then paused was this a decision she wanted to make if i do this its the end of my career here have i lost my mind what will i do after this but if i dont try to stop them god knows what we could all end up convicted of criminal conspiracy and in prison that reporter friend of yours is here she pulled open the straps then helped alexa sit up in the bed and swing her legs around im going to take you to him its so horrible ally went on she was settling into the wheelchair as though she expected it then she looked up her eyes dazed where are you taking me reporter do you mean like i said im moving you into your friends room she rolled her to the door then stopped and cracked it and peeked out dont say a word dear she whispered as she began pushing alexa down the hall there was a pale flickering light under the door at the end debra and david and the others have all gone out to the diner down the road and dr vee is in his office probably running some lastminute computer simulations but we need to be quiet the fluorescent lights seemed to swirl overhead this all feels so familiar ally thought this is where i saw kristen does ellen know what happened to her you two have to decide what you want to do stone youre sure hes here yes she said and hes in some kind of battle of wills with mr bartlett when they reached the door at the end she tried it and it was locked she pulled out her magnetic card and zipped it through the slot as they went through ally realized the room was lit only by the glow of a laptop computer screen stay here ellen said turning to leave im going to try to talk to dr vee as the door closed stone finally looked up he was wearing a sweater and jeans and had been typing furiously on a gerex laptop hey howre you feeling he paused to glance down and save what hed been writing then clicked off the computer i have no idea something about him didnt seem quite right it was like he was on happy pills or something how about you the last time i saw you i was passing out i dont actually remember all that much of what happened after that i think i went back to the city but i feel great now like i went through a dark tunnel and came out the other side i feel very different i dont know whats next but right now im just happy to be in the middle of the biggest story in the history of medical science whats going on with him she wondered hes spacey he has to be on some kind of drug what have they done to him he closed the laptop then reached and clicked on a light by the bed come on want to see something incredible its a marvel of medical science never before happened what come with me i guarantee youve never seen anything like it he tossed the laptop onto the bed then swung his feet around and settled them onto the floor she noticed that the room was a pale blue with white linoleum there was a pair of white slippers next to the bed he slipped them on and then opened the door and grabbed her wheelchair the hallway felt colder now yet it was also stifling as though someone had drawn the air out of it theres nothing we can do stone said there was a hint of madness in his voice it was as if he were trying to convince himself that he was still sane and it wasnt working he was just barely holding it together then she realized he was about to go into intensive care where kristen had been so kristens still here oh youd better believe it he said she is most definitely still here when they got to the door he revolved back ally you really dont have to see this you know not if youd rather nothing remotely like this is going to happen to you they assured me what the hell is he talking about on the other hand he went on maybe you should see it maybe everybody in the world should see it its so astonishing he pushed open the door and rolled her in then he reached down and lifted her to her feet standing wasnt that hard and somehow he had known that the room seemed to be captured in mist though surely that was her imagination everything must be her imagination kristen was in the corner of the room in a wheelchair but now her body was shriveled no shriveled was not the right word in fact there might not be a word to describe the change her skin was smooth and flawless she didnt look like this the last time ally saw her and now she wondered how long ago that actually was how many hours or days the bones were the same as always in her cheeks the underlying structure was sharp and severe and elegant but there wasnt enough flesh on them they were reminiscent of what happens at puberty when the body starts changing in ways that arent well coordinated that was it kristen had become a childit was in her innocent eyesexcept that her body was now the flesh of a child over the bone structure of an adult it scarcely seemed like the same person from the last time she had crossed some mystical divide she was holding a large rag dollwhere did she get that ally wonderedand humming the tune of the ditty that ended with now i know my abcs tell me what you think of me she cant talk stone was saying i mean actually communicate or at least she doesnt seem to want to ive already tried but isnt whats happened incredible theres never been anything like this in history the replacement cells are making her body newer and newer so shes getting younger and younger ally walked over slowly and tried to take her hand she was grasping the doll and she violently pulled back hey she said trying to muster a matteroffact air hows it going do you remember me i dont think she recognizes you stone said in a stage whisper i wish i knew more about the biology of the brain but i think theres some kind of aggressive replacement of memory synapses under way i think its one of those lifo things last infirst out shes regressing chronologically but in reverse maybe shes lost use of language the way alzheimers patients do i dont know ally felt herself near to tears van de vliet was going to use antibodies from me to try to something that was always a long shot he said but now the preliminary tests hes just done on you indicate that the level of enzyme in you can be controlled very accurately hes very excited she turned back to him how do you know all this ive become part of the story ally thats not supposed to happen but this is the only way to get it all firsthand i have to live it and guess what i now know enough to write the book ive been waiting all my life to write i have the punch line which is stem cell technology goes to the very origin of life and it may turn out that for once mother nature can be fooled dr vees venturing into areas now where even he doesnt know whats going on ally whats happening in this room is the biggest medical story since nothing begins to compare stone had lost it there was true madness about him now she walked back over to kristen and leaned over and kissed her kristen stared at her in unfocused confusion but then she smiled im alone in here will you take me outside i want to find my mother the voice was that of a fiveyearold and it sent a chill through alexa the grownup memory cells in her brain had been replaced by blanks it was last infirst out and thirtyplus years of life experience were being replaced with brandnew nothingness the syndrome time had to move in one direction or the other the body either went forward or in reverse there was no equilibrium then she had a further thought winston bartlett was not going to let this beta disaster run to its natural conclusion a horrifying exposure to the world he was going to intervene kristen was not about to leave this room in her current condition either she left curedwhich seemed wholly implausible at this pointor she departed in a manner that left no trace then yet another thought crossed her befuddled mind she and stone knew about kristen what does that mean for us stone we cant leave her here what are you proposing we do he queried take her to an er somewhere frankly i dont know how you would describe her problem to an emergency room admissions staffer ill think of something by the way ally so you should know shes wearing diapers this is the real deal and how do you figure in all this i told you im going to be the james boswell of stem cell technology im going to report on this miracle from the inside but now ally if the beta procedure is going to succeed you have to be the one to make it happen she looked at him still stunned by the wildness in his eyes and she had a feeling like her heart was being wrenched out youre working with them arent you she was fuming with anger she no longer knew who could be trusted hed taken leave of his senses or had his senses been taken from him which was it im thinking about you and hopefully about us youre being offered something youd be a fool to turn down thats all i have to say he took her hand and helped her back into the wheelchair then he whispered lets get out of here he quickly opened the door and rolled her out into the empty hall when he closed the door behind them he whispered again didnt you see the surveillance camera and microphone in there theres one in the room where they had me locked up they just put them in to watch kristen and me i heard bartlett and van de vliet talking if any of this beta screwup with her gets out of this building bartletts conglomerate is toast he bent over near to her and continued whispering listen we dont have much time theyve got your procedure scheduled for later on tonight im still somewhat of a zombie from something they gave me but maybe i can help get you out of here let me tell you what ive found out so far van de vliet gave you a lowdosage version of the beta procedure in hopes he could harvest telomerase antibodies and use them on bartlett but there was only a trace he did inject those into bartlett but he doesnt think its enough to have any effect so now bartlett is demanding he give you a massive dose of telomerase van de vliet is freaked about the risks but bartlett thinks its his only chance to head off having what happened to kristen happen to him too however what bartlett doesnt know is that van de vliet has just finished a new computer simulation and he thinks hes finally figured out how to do a successful beta procedure for him thats the holy grail how do you know all this i heard him talking to his assistant debra i was supposed to be sedated the reason he wants to perform it on you is because he now has so much data on you as a result of the first procedure he thinks hes got a real shot at redemption ally if hes calculated wrong you could end up like kristen what about you she asked you should get out too i should but look ive been trying to get in here for a long time now im finally in you could say im under duress but im here and this is where its happening if i get out alive i have a hell of a story is he thinking clearly she wondered he seems to be drifting in and out of a mental cloud what is wrong with him stone theres an emergency door on the first level of the basement if we can get up there we might be able to escape and while were doing it you might want to seriously reconsider staying in this place weve both seen kristen what makes you think theyre planning on either of us ever living to tell that tale im having some trouble thinking just now he was helping her out of the wheelchair but i do know youve got to disappear whatever plans they have for me remain to be seen but i know exactly whats in store for you so come on and try to walk we cant use the elevator but theres a fire door at the other end of the hall which leads up to the lab floor its probably alarmed she thought then what do we do walking was easier than shed expected the strength was rapidly coming back in her legs but more than that there was no sense of tightness in her chest as she might have expected she was always aware of traces of stenosis but now she felt nothing maybe there were miracles the hallway was dimly lit and she wondered is a surveillance camera tracking our every move shit stone announced when they reached the fire door its alarmed thats exactly what i was afraid of she thought any chance theyre bluffing dont think so he pointed that little red diode says its hot god she thought weve got to get out of here maybe we could just make a dash for it he looked at her and shook his head like youre in shape to dash no whats called for is stealth he was pulling out his wallet the thing about these card readers some of them like those that get you into bank atms sometimes will open for other cards ive got four kinds of plastic might as well give them a try well just hurry she leaned against the wall im starting to get weak he slipped his visa through and nothing happened he immediately tried mastercard again nothing maybe i should try my allpurpose bankcard he slipped a chase plastic through but once more nothing happened this isnt working stone she sighed feeling her legs weaken as she clasped the wall i think were going to have to chance the elevator dont give up yet he took out his american express kissed it and swiped it through one last shot the red diode blinked off never leave home without it she whispered we will now proceed very very quietly he carefully pushed open the door inches at a time the stair had metal steps and was lit by a single fluorescent bulb as he helped her up ally was wondering if there was any way to extract her mother too she couldnt imagine how she could do it and besides nina might well refuse to go no just get out and make stone understand that no way was winston bartlett going to let him go free to tell the story of kristen he clearly wasnt thinking with all cylinders stone aimes was about to disappear just like kristen had the entry to the laboratory level was also alarmed but american express once again saved the day when they pushed open the door however the lights were on in the office at the far end of the hallway wheres that door that grant was going to use to get me out she wondered then she saw a door marked exit next to van de vliets office shit its all the way at the opposite end of the hall stone we have to get to that door before anybody sees us i dont know if its alarmed or not but thats the ball game she reached for his hand if we can get there and get out please come with me we can make it to the highway you cant stay here lets get you out then well talk ill drag you if i have to as they moved quietly along the wall they could hear an argument under way she recognized the voices as ellen haras and karl van de vliets i wont allow my staff to be part of this ellen was declaring ive seen kristen any form of the beta is dangerous if you do anything involving that procedure again youll put everybody here at risk dont you think ive thought about that agonized about it we have one chance to turn all this around this is it i dont want to be involved and i dont want any of my people involved do you hear me then keep them upstairs he was striding out of his office flipping on the lights in the hallway oh shit ally whispered she opened a door and pulled stone into the examining room where her mother had first been admitted just as she did she heard the ding of the elevator and caught a glimpse of debra and david van de vliets senior researchers getting off when she closed the door the room should have been pitch black but it wasnt a candle was burning on a counter and there was a figure at the far end of the room he was sitting on the examining table in the lotus position his eyes closed are you ready kenji noda asked i think just about everyone is here now oh my god ally thought what are we going to do she watched helplessly as he reached over and touched a button on the desk a red light popped on above the door a moment later it opened what are you doing here debra asked staring at them getting some exercise stone said then winston bartlett appeared in the doorway behind her how did they get up here ally im not going to let them do this to you stone declared seizing her hand were going to ken please get him out of here bartlett said take him back downstairs anywhere you shouldnt be out of your wheelchair debra was saying she turned to ellen would you get im not getting you anything ellen ohara declared ive just submitted my resignation effective three minutes ago i dont know a thing about whats going on here and from now on i dont want to know she got on the elevator and the door closed ken bartlett said first things first go after that woman dont let her leave the building now debra was rolling in a wheelchair david had appeared also deep disquiet in his eyes and he helped her in theres very little risk to this he said believe me she felt him giving her an injection in her left arm no dont as the room started to spin she reached out and grabbed stones arm and pulled him down to her downstairs she whispered look around theres she didnt get to finish because debra was whisking her out the door and toward the laboratory stone had just grinned confusedly seemingly not paying any attention to what she was saying instead he ambled toward the open stair door and disappeared at this point however no one appeared to notice or to care they were rolling her through the steel air lock on the other side winston bartlett was already waiting standing next to a gurney with straps no chapter friday april pm she was still conscious as david and debra lifted her onto the gurney there was no operating table in the laboratory but this procedure did not require one it consisted of a series of small subcutaneous injections along both sides of the spine followed by a larger injection at the base of the skull as the injections began she drifted into a mindset where she was never entirely sure how much was real how much was fantasy how much deliberate how much accidental she remembered that she felt her grasp of reality slipping away but there was no sense of pain instead images and sensations in a sequence that corresponded to the passage of time drifted through her mind it was couched in terms of the people she knew the first image was her mother nina and they were together struggling through a dense forest initially she thought they were looking for her fathers grave but then it became clear they were searching for some kind of magic potion that would save her mothers life as they clawed their way through tangled tendrils and dark arbors she became increasingly convinced their quest was doomed that she was destined to watch nina pass into oblivion but then something happened the forest opened out onto a vast meadow bathed in sunshine in the center was a cluster of snowwhite mushrooms and she knew instinctively that these would bring eternal life to anyone who ate them come she said to nina these can save you ally im too old now i dont want to be saved there comes a moment in your life when youve done everything you feel you needed to do youve had the good times and now all thats left is the slow deterioration of whats left of your body it robs the joy out of living no mom this is different she said plucking one of the white mushrooms and holding it out this prevents you from growing any older youll stay just the way you are you can have a miracle to never escape this vale of tears to watch everyone you love grow old and wither and die is that the miracle you want me to have then she looked up at the flawless blue sky and held out her arms as though to embrace the sun my mind ally youve given me back my mind now i can live out whatever more life god will see fit to give me and actually know who i am and where i am thats miracle enough for me as she said it a beam of white light came directly from the sun and enveloped her then the meadow around them faded away and all she could see was karl van de vliet who was bending over her and lifting back her eyelids alexa i cant tell you what youre about to feel because no one has ever been where youre about to be god help us but were on the high wire without a net here but any new cell configurations should immediately form tissue thats a facsimile of whats already there thats what the simulations show she was listening to him not sure if he was real or a dream then she heard bartletts voice why are you talking to her karl she cant hear you we dont actually know whether she can or not at some level i think shes aware of her surroundings in a way we should hope that she is if there are going to be impacts on her consciousness id rather she be alert and able to remember what it was like then the voices drifted away but she was sure she had no control over anything the white mushrooms she was thinking about them again only now they were above her and growing toward the sky and then she realized she was underground buried and looking up from her own grave what happened next was a journey through timesomewhere in the fardistant future she seemed to be watching it through a large window unable to interact with what was happening on the other side time she felt a sensation at the back of her neck and the images faded away this damned well better be right came a voice theres not going to be another chance i did an activity simulation for a range of antibodies just to make sure she wouldnt automatically reject the enzyme because of the earlier injection the voice belonged to karl van de vliet her mind was clearing and she recognized it but all the results indicate that the effect of the antibodies is essentially washed out at this concentration of active enzyme have the good grace to let me try to get this right she was listening and trying to understand what was going on her mind had been drifting through time and space but now she was aware that something new was happening the hallucinations the conversations around her all were beginning to focus in to build in intensity but that was not what was really happening it was merely a mask over something that had entered the laboratory some kind of force then her vision began to work in a strange way that felt more like a sixth sense she was seeing what was going on in the room even though her eyes were shut or perhaps they werent she didnt know and she was still strapped to the gurney so she had no way to check kristy winston bartlett said dismay in his voice you shouldnt be in here you should be resting what the hell are you doing down here van de vliet demanded the pitch of his voice had noticeably gone up who ally wondered whos he talking to there are definitely new people in the room come on ally said a voice in her ear urgent this time she knew who it was it was stone damn them all im getting you out of here now chapter friday april pm she felt the straps on the gurney loosening and then she started prying her eyes open she thought hoped it was stone but she couldnt see well enough to be absolutely sure her mind and her vision were still overflowing with horrifying nightmares of time gone awry what did all those bizarre dreams mean she was groggy but was coming alert perhaps it was the sense of electricity in the room but something very unscheduled was going on when she finally got her eyes open and focused what greeted her was a blinding row of white lights directly overhead that seemed to isolate her but there was tumult all around her in the lab a cacophony of alarmed voices echoing off the hard surfaces of glass and steel she squinted into the light as she felt stone slip his arm around her shoulders and raise her up thank god hes here she thought come on he was saying shes not interested in you she just wants kristen out of here this is the only way who she was startled by the sound of her own voice mildly surprised to discover she was even capable of speech she gazed around trying to find her when jesus katherine starr was standing next to kristen she was moving in a surreal way gripping kristens hand and pulling her along stone had found her he had understood katherine starr appeared to be wearing a blue bathrobe under a gray mackintosh but the part that got allys attention was the knife she was holding glistening like a scalpel no it was a scalpel shiny and sharp as a razor tough luck guys no pistol this time but she still managed to come up with a convincing substitute she didnt look any saner than she did the last time now though she finally had what shed come for she had her daughter could it be that kristen was about to be liberated had the world come full circle no the voice belonged to winston bartlett i want her with me you re the prick responsible for this katherine whirled on him brandishing the scalpel mrs starr van de vliet interjected eyeing the sharp metal you cant take kristen away now shes at a very delicate stage of her procedure i seem to be doing a lot of things i cant she declared turning back im not supposed to be out of my room but i am and now im getting us both out of here were going through that air lock and onto the elevator so whose throat do i need to cut to do it winston bartlett was edging away and his eyes betrayed he was more concerned than he wished to appear look at her katherine starr continued shoving kristen who was completely disoriented her eyes blinking in confusionin front of van de vliet she doesnt know me she doesnt know anything shes acting like a baby what in hell have you done to her she had the procedure she wanted at the time i warned there might be side effects we couldnt anticipate shes lost her mind thats what you call a side effect all this time kristen was just standing and staring blankly into space but there were growing storm clouds welling in her eyes it caused ally to wonder what was really going on with her had this troubled girl been made permanently childlike or was there a split personality at work did she have a new mind now or a parallel mind were still trying to stabilize her condition van de vliet said in a soothing tone we just need a little more time that was when kristen wrenched free of her mothers grasp her eyes had just gone critical traveling into pure madness she strode over and seized a glass jar containing a clear solvent i want them all to die she said in a little girls voice theyre going to kill me if i dont kill them first now katherine starr had turned and was staring at her kristy honey put the bottle down im going to take you home i dont know what hes done to you but im not going to let you stay here anymore youre coming with me this is not going to end well ally thought she began struggling to her feet trying to clear her mind enough for an exit strategy nina was upstairs or at least that was where she had been okay the first order of business is to get her out stone could probably manage on his own now kristen was walking over to an electric heater positioned on a lab workbench she switched it on and the tungsten elements immediately began to glow then still holding the bottle she turned back to van de vliet i see things that i never saw before my mind has powers it never had till now he nodded knowingly i always suspected that im able to think just like i did when i was little she continued cutting him off sometimes im there in that world then sometimes i flip back but i can always tell when grownups are lying to me what did you do to my mind kristen van de vliet said the brain has many functions that we still only barely understand with the beta procedure we dont really know what activates general cell replacement or what the nature of the replacement tissue actually is were just at the beginning of a marvelous im seeing a future in which nothing exists she muttered despairingly still holding the glass bottle of solvent i dont want to be a part of it van de vliet was staring at her his eyes flooded with alarm what what are you seeing kristen im seeing you dead she glared around all of you then with an animal scream she whirled and flung the glass liter bottle at the electric heater on the laboratory workbench it crashed into the shiny steel case with a splintering sound followed by an explosion that sent a ball of fire and a shock wave through the room in an instant the entire end of the lab was engulfed in a sea of flame ally sensed herself being knocked to the floor but she also felt a surge of adrenaline this was endgame the moment when everybody found out who they were a hand was gripping her like a vise it was stones but the blast had knocked him to the floor too and he was now motionless slumped against the side of a laboratory bench it was like she was being held in a death grip was she going to have to carry him out she wasnt even sure she had the strength in her legs to get herself out now something even more horrible was slowly beginning to happen the central part of the lab had several sets of steel shelving arranged in rows and each supported a carefully organized arrangement of sample vials filled with some kind of organic solvent she saw with horror that the first towering set of shelves easily seven feet high was slowly tipping from the force of the blast it teetered for an instant and then fell into the set of shelves next to it with all the ponderous majesty of a giant sequoia what happened next sounded like the end of the world as the first set of shelves crashed against the second like a row of massive steelandglass dominoes each subsequent tower tipped and fell against the next and on and on all the while as the tumbling racks were spewing flammable solvents across the smoky lab space they were ripping out electrical wiring and sending sparks flying the whole dangerdynamic of the room had been turned upside down katherine starr and debra and david now lay pinned beneath a tangled mass of angleiron supports that had collapsed in the wake of the falling shelves all three appeared to be unconscious winston bartlett was at the far end of the room hed been slammed against the wall by the force of the explosion but was pulling himself up he seemed to be unhurt though it was hard to see through the billowing smoke karl van de vliet was standing in the middle of the laboratory his eyes glazed flames and smoke swirling about him what does this mean to him ally wondered years of research data being obliterated in an instant but the horror wasnt over the fire was depleting the hermetically sealed rooms oxygen ally sensed that anybody who didnt get out of the lab in the next five minutes wasnt going to be going anywhere standing up but what was happening with kristen she was walking through the flames as though on a country stroll it was like the fires of hell were all around her and she was ambling through them unscathed she must be experiencing thirddegree burns ally thought yet theres a sense that nothing can harm her how could it be and then an astonishing possibility began to dawn on her with the stem cell enzymes working at full blast was it possible her body was immediately replacing its damaged cells could it be that the telomerase enzyme didnt know the difference between a cell that had aged and one that had been damaged by its environment jesus stone said finally stirring whats at that moment the overhead lights flickered and died and the emergency lights clicked on sending batterypowered beams through the smoke christ ally he declared gazing around still dazed as his consciousness seemed to be slowly returning weve got to get people out of here there didnt appear to be a sprinkler system probably she thought because an onslaught of water would wipe out all the computers now she was thinking about the automatic air locks how did those steelandglass doors work without electricity did they have a battery backup or some kind of failsafe mechanism which provided a manual override in case of a power outage now winston bartlett was striding toward the center of the room from the dazed look in his eyes it wasnt clear whether he knew where he was or not kristen was walking toward him on a collision course you let this happen she said you wanted to ruin my life kristy nobody made you do anything he said choking from the smoke but now weve got to its too late she declared lashing out with the side of her hand against his neck he staggered back flailing and seized an iron girder there was a blast of voltage a shower of sparks and he screamed as he crumpled sideways then the force of his fall broke his hand loose from the electrical short he lay prostrate on the smoky floor of the lab twitching my god ally thought she really is determined to kill us all before shes through kristen van de vliet was saying please theres still time im going to do everything i can for you he was gasping for air and now more vials of flammable liquid were exploding from the heat and igniting he turned and stumbled toward the air lock there were sounds of yelling on the other side the people outside cant get through ally realized the security lock has no override we re going to die van de vliet pounded on the button controls of the air lock but there was no response smoke was billowing around him and he choked coughing and dropping to one knee then kristen walked up behind him she appeared not to notice the flames and smoke swirling around her this is where you get whats coming you bastard i warned you youd better do something for me but you never really intended to help me i was just an experiment thats all i ever was for both of you you fuckers and she lashed out with a powerful fist sending him to the floor outside there was now the wail of a siren the sound faintly filtering through and the pounding on the other side of the air lock continued though now it had the force of authority at last ally thought somebody finally got serious and called the fire department now kristen had bent over the prostrate van de vliet and was doing something though ally couldnt tell what keep your face close to the floor stone was yelling its where the last of the air is hang on well be okay she had a premonition they were not going to be okay they all were going to suffocate all that was except kristen she seemed to possess some magic immunity from the horrors around her she had risen and was standing over van de vliet like a statue while everybody else was on the floor as ally watched hera serene figure in the middle of chaos and deathshe began to have an odd sensation the burning in her lungs from the smoke started to dissipate and strength felt like it was pouring into her limbs the tongues of flame around her had become dancing white figures that invited her to rise and join them she did slowly not quite knowing what she was doing then she walked to the jammed air lock she stepped over karl van de vliets collapsed frame and placed her hands on the steel it was already scalding but she only took fleeting notice of that while a firefighters ax futilely pounded on the outside she seized the wide bar of the door and ripped it open to the sound of wrenching metal it was a superhuman effort she didnt realize she was capable of and it was the last thing she remembered the space around her had become a blazing white cloud and she didnt feel the hands of the two firefighters who seized her as she fell through the open air lock chapter friday june pm days later alexa hampton was still considering herself one of the luckiest people alive when shed regained consciousness the next week in lenox hill hospital hooked up to oxygen and being fed by an iv she noticed that the nurses were looking at her strangely and whispering to each other finally she couldnt stand it anymore and asked why it was what you did a young puerto rican woman declared gazing at her in awe through her rimless glasses no one can believe it then she explained what they couldnt believeas reported by the new jersey firefighterswas that she had singlehandedly wrenched open the steeldoor air lock of the laboratory at the dorian institute at the time firefighters were on the other side vainly trying to dismantle the door with their axes yet shed just yanked it aside like paper it was reminiscent of those urban legends of superhuman strength in times of crisis like the story of a panicked woman who hoisted an overturned chevy van to free a pinned child later though some of the new jersey fire crew went back and looked again the steel hinges had literally been sheared off how did she do that more important though symptoms of her stenosis had entirely disappeared and she felt better than ever in her life the stem cell technology pioneered by karl van de vliet had indeed produced a miracle she even had a new kind of energy periodically it was unlike anything shed ever felt other things were new as well shed been seeing a lot of stone aimes and helping him finish his book on the gerex corporations successful clinical trials with stem cell technology after all the publicity following the fire at the dorian institute the manuscript was generating a lot of buzz a paperback auction was already in the works with a halfmillion floor and time had abruptly taken a second look at the first serial excerpt his agent had been trying to place with them and come up with six figures the only part stone hadnt reported was the ghastly side effect of the early beta experiment the syndrome because kristen starr had disappeared he had no proof and his publisher refused to print potentially libelous speculation in the meantime winston bartlett hadnt been seen in public since that tragic day the business press speculated he had become a howard hugheslike recluse in his gramercy park mansion ally had tried several times to reach him through his office to find out what he wanted to do about the design job and each time she was told he would get back to her he never did maybe he was still recuperating when the firefighters pulled him out of the flaming wreckage his clothes were singed from the electricity that had coursed through his body his heart was stopped and he appeared to be dead in fact he was dead the paramedics immediately began intensive cpr moments later his heart was beating again then he declared he was well enough that he didnt need to go to a hospital he had his japanese henchman kenji noda help him to his mcdonnell douglas and he disappeared into the night oxygen had not been to his brain for no one knew how long the paramedics said he awoke in what seemed another reality was he still alive there had been no reports otherwise but he most certainly had withdrawn from the world karl van de vliet for his part had been hospitalized for severe burns he remained in the trauma unit at st vincents hospital but when alexa tried to go visit him she was told he wasnt accepting visitors but was doing well katherine starr was dead from a massive concussion along with the two researchers debra connolly and david hopkins who had been in the wrong place when the steel racks collapsed and alexa never been able to find out what happened to kristen starr officially nobody by that name was there but business was business with the clinical trials over the pending sale of the gerex corporation to cambridge pharmaceuticals was proceeding on autopilot handled by grant hampton who stood to make a bundle or so he bragged to alexa the dorian institute had been closed and all the remaining records moved to a converted facility near liverpool after six days in lenox hill ally went home and three days after that she had returned to her desk at citispace now inevitably she was back to her workaholic habits and grueling hours today though she had knocked off early since nina had taken a cab down to join her for supper she marveled just thinking about it her mom taking a cab by herself it truly was a miracle their light repast had consisted of cold roast beef and roomtemperature stout two of ninas favorites she had never been much for cucumber sandwiches with the crust cut off afterward she elected to have a brandy the trouble with having your mind back she said as she settled onto the couch snifter in hand is that sometimes you remember things youd just as soon forget outside thunder boomed from an early evening rainstorm which had blown in from the northwest well mom at least now you can pick and choose what you want to remember and what you want to forget she didnt really mind the storm having her mother back was such a blessing it still felt odd though having her rescued from what had to be an inevitable ignominious fate it was as though time had gone in reverse a miracle was very much in progress she was experiencing a miracle too though of a slightly different sort she felt pretty much normal if occasionally shaky and uncertain on her feet but at unexpected times she would have bursts of energy that defied reality they were in fact scary like that thing with the steel door something weird would sometimes take control of her body and she didnt really know what it was truthfully she was feeling some of that tonight she had joined her mother with a brandy and was thinking about taking knickers for an early walk downpour or not she wanted to see the river through the mists of a storm that was when the phone rang she got up and made her way to the kitchen and took the receiver off the wall hello she was hoping it was stone hed usually call early in the evening to see what she was doing and ask if she wanted some company alexa i need to see you came a voice the other end of the line was noisy as though a loud motor was running who i think you know who this is if you would come down to the river right now i will make it very much worth your while for some reason maybe it was telepathy knickers had begun bouncing about the kitchen angling for a walk even though she normally was mortally fearful of thunder now ally did know who it was what was he doing calling her here at home in a rainstorm after all these weeks well she thought i have nothing left to fear from him or any of them why not its raining she said this had better be fast and she hung up the phone who was that honey nina asked i hope it wasnt anybody i know you were somewhat abrupt mom they deserved whatever they got and its no big deal but i think im going to take knickers out shes making me nuts ally couldnt focus on what had just happened he had a lot of nerve on the other hand she loved to be down by the river when it was this way shrouded in pastel mist honey its raining cats and dogs nina declared youre apt to catch your death no mom its letting up now ill be all right really she was digging out her tan raincoat and rubber galoshes from the closet by the door knickers immediately realized what was up and began a dance of joy barking as she raced to find her leash come on honey ally said taking the braided leather i want you close to me the ride down in the elevator felt ominous though knickers failed to share any of her apprehension as she bounced around the glass dome and nuzzled allys legs the thunder she was sometimes fearful of had lessened and that ally thought had doubtless improved her courage the condominium no longer had a doorman in hopes of trimming costs the condo board had sent out a secret ballot on the subject by a narrow margin the owners had voted to dispense with that particular frill although she missed alan and his early morning optimism about his offbroadway hopes she realized the economy was probably timely all those weeks when she hadnt been pulling her weight at citispace the nut on that operation hadnt diminished any as she stepped onto barrow street the latespring air was unseasonably brisk and the rain had blanked visibility down to almost nothing on other days this would had been that magical moment just after the sun went down when gorgeous fiery orange clouds hung over the hudson but now there was a hint of brooding in the bleak rain it fit the dark mood she felt growing around her he wanted to meet her down by the river gripping knickers leash she checked the traffic lights then marched across the west side highway the new esplanade along the river was awash in the rain and was uncharacteristically empty that was lucky for knickers offtheleash time ally drew her close and clicked open the catch that attached it to her collar with a woof of joy she dashed off toward the vacant pier then headed out baby slow down ally yelled but it was to no avail a second later her fluffy sheepdog was lost in the rain but she couldnt go far the refurbished pier extended out into the river for maybe the length of a football field and change beyond that there was at least half a mile of river before the shores of new jersey for all her enthusiasm knickers wasnt about to dive into the chilly hudson and swim for the horizon so where was he hed said down by the river what to do now she decided she might as well walk out after knickers now she was noticing something odd the air was chilly actually raw was a better description a last blast of unusual arctic air had accompanied the rain she could feel the temperature on her face she had stupidly gone out with just a light shirt under the raincoat yet she didnt feel the slightest bit cold it was as though her metabolism had sped up the way it did during a run though she wasnt breathing heavy or anything it felt like one of those strange moments shed been having when she felt superalive now knickers was returning but she was slinking back as though fearful of something the rain running off her face come here baby ally said reaching out what is it the darkness of the river flowed over her now and for the first time ever she wished shed brought along a flashlight that was when out of the rain she finally heard the sound it was an engine lowering from the sky which knickers must have already heard then a helicopter a mcdonnell douglas materialized lowering onto the empty sports space on the pier the downdraft of the rotor threw spray against the fieldturf and into her eyes but she gazed through it unblinking feeling an unexpected sense of power entering her limbs the rain should have felt cold but she didnt really notice maybe she thought they had to meet they were bonded as the pilot cut the power the engine began to wind downwhoom whoom whoomuntil it came to a dead stop and there followed an unnatural silence finally the door on the side opened and a metal step dropped down after a moments pause that seemed to last forever he appeared at first a vague figure in the rain but then he stepped down and came toward her he was wearing a white hat with a wide brim and a tan raincoat that seemed more like a cloak than a coat alexa i so appreciate your making time for me it was hard to tell in the rain but he appeared to be strong and there was actually a kind of radiance about him as though he carried his own special luminosity he seemed completely transformed the question was transformed how he looked years younger than the last time she saw him i thought we should talk ive been meaning to call you i wanted to see how youre doing thats not it at all she told herself what do you really want actually ive been wanting to thank you winston bartlett went on it turns out that you saved me after all your telomerase antibodies finally kicked in the initial ones karl injected in me it just took a few weeks and what about kristen she asked his look saddened you didnt hear he shook his head she died in the fire that doesnt sound right ally thought she looked like she was the only one who was going to survive it oh yeah how did that happen you might as well know she was burned beyond recognition the body still hasnt been officially identified when the firemen found her she had a shard of glass through her throat they thought she must have fallen on something but i fear its entirely possible she could have done it to herself was that story true or a baldfaced lie ally wondered were they still hiding her someplace but why was he here he certainly hadnt come to discuss the kitchen design job for his gramercy park mansion that was now long ago and far away alexa he said moving toward her please dont be frightened but theres something i have to find out he reached out with his left hand and seized her wrist she only saw the glint of the penknife in his right hand for an instant before he slashed it across her palm what she screamed and yanked her hand away knickers gave a loud yelp and then howled mournfully only then did she notice that thered been just a momentary flash of pain its okay bartlett said reaching to soothe knickers just a superficial scratch now watch it i want to know if karl had time to finish the procedure my god she didnt have to watch she could already feel it beginning to heal whats whats going on is this he had hopefully completed the beta on you just before kristys mother showed up but did it work the way it was supposed to we didnt know until now my god i knew i was feeling you received just the right amount of telomerase injections bartlett interjected to induce the beta without any side effects it was the goldilocks dosage karl had been trying to calculate just enough that only aged or damaged cells are replaced while healthy tissue is not altered she now realized that was why shed been having bouts of incredible energy were the only ones he went on just us you and me weve been given this gift alexa and now we have the responsibility that goes along with it he glanced down at her hand by the way hows that cut doing what are you getting at it was definitely healing a wave of thunder boomed over the river sending knickers scurrying to allys side what im getting at is that you and i are now two very special people we both are living proof of what the beta can achieve the question is what are we going to do about it she was still stunned this is a lot to absorb ill have to think ive already thought about this and i believe it must be kept secret at all cost at least for now but why its a miracle that that must be handled prudently i need your cooperation with that she was having extreme difficulty getting her mind around what he was talking about i dont really know whats going on i think id better see some doctors and stone is finishing his book about ive got to tell him those things cannot happen alexa he looked out at the river for a moment then turned back a brandnew world has dawned finally all things are possible he moved closer to her then reached out and took her wrist again she looked down and realized the cut on her hand was all but healed for now this has to be our secret yours and mine just us she thought about all that had happened in the weeks since her wayward brother had accosted her running along this very river it felt like an eternity im asking you not to talk about this he continued to anyone you must give me your solemn word she felt the grip on her wrist get stronger now that we know the beta can work he went on his voice piercing through the rain i am forming an elite association the methuselah society membership buys a guarantee that you can stop aging in fact you can pick the age you want to remain karl is sure he can do that assuming the beta worked with you and now we see it has the first memberships will naturally be somewhat expensive but as time goes by the cost will be gradually scaled down to respond to market forces one may only join with a companion but for obvious reasons all those who undergo the beta must be sworn to secrecy on pain of death since theres bound to be a hue and cry and government intervention if word leaks out that only individuals with significant resources can have this miracle i think thats obscene she said i suspected you might feel that way which is why were having this talk as ive explained the methuselah society will be contingent on the utmost secrecy at least initially so the question is are you on board with this the answer is ill do what i please she was thinking what a bombshell this would be to have in stones book stem cellsthe fountain of youth was no longer a dream winston bartlett had won his dice game with god and now he was planning to sweep the table but he also was smart enough to realize he had to cash in quickly and discreetly dont you realize how irresponsible that is he insisted we stand on the threshold of a new era for humankind but if we let smallminded politicians get involved with this they might decide to forbid keep in mind that using stem cell technology to regenerate organs is already controversial just imagine what the selfappointed zealots would do with this the good of humanity is less important to them than their narrowminded bigoted constituencies that was when it finally dawned on her why he had lured her down here by the river on a rainy night what better place for a convenient accident if it came to that she watched as he turned and raised a finger toward the open door of the mcdonnell douglas the motor started and then another figure emerged and came down the steps she squinted through the rain and recognized kenji noda bartletts everpresent bodyguard he was carrying a plastic bottle along with a small white towel hes going to chloroform me and then god knows what im about to disappear the same way kristen did she stared at them both wondering what to do alexa i regret to say that you are either with me or you are a problem i cannot afford to have bartlett said and then he nodded to noda shit she backed to the edge of the pier as noda advanced on her menacingly dousing the cloth he was a foot taller than she was and he weighed over two hundred pounds her first instinct was to run but then she sensed an impulse to stand her ground something told her to try to use her strength against him he wouldnt expect it out of the corner of her eye she noticed that a white car had pulled onto the pier and was cruising down the side slowly inching their way it looked like a police vehicle probably a couple of cops curious about the presence of a helicopter on the field turf they were approximately half a minute too late to make any difference kenji noda was five feet away and they were fifty yards away and they probably couldnt see what was going on anyway the rain had chosen that moment to begin to gush shrouding everything in sheets of water knickers was nudging at her leg as though urging her to flee and again she thought about running but an instinct told her to stand her ground she was feeling a sensation of power growing in her limbs she found herself oddly calm as kenji noda reached her then wrapped his left arm around her neck and with his right hand clamped the cloth over her nostrils it was infused with chloroformshe knew the smellbut she held her breath then it happened she casually reached up and took his left arm and pulled it away from her neck it was so easy there was the same feeling of strength shed had when she wrenched open the air lock yet it was something that came and went she had no inkling how long it would last this time i dont think you should do that she said continuing to pull his arm around behind him then she twisted it to the side and there was a sickening snap as it came out of its shoulder socket he groaned lightly but did not speak instead he reached with his right hand and pulled an automatic out of a holster at the back of his belt dropping the chloroformed cloth in the process while his left arm dangled uselessly he brought around the pistol and tried to aim it at her torso her senses though were coming fully alive now and she seized his wrist and pushed it away just as he fired the round caught her at the outer edge of her shoulder she felt it enter and exit but there was no pain merely a mild itch still holding his wrist she picked up the white cloth and buried his face in it she held it against his nostrils until his body twitched and went limp that was when the spotlight hit them drop your weapons and show your hands came a basso voice over a megaphone who had a weapon she wondered the one pistol around was lying on the ground next to the crumpled frame of kenji noda the police must have heard the shot and assumed they were being fired on she turned around to search for winston bartlett and saw him retreating to the mcdonnell douglas running actually he saw what happened she told herself hes afraid of me stop and identify yourself came the police megaphone the spotlight was now squarely on bartlett who was bounding up the retractable steps without looking back he pulled up the steps and slammed the door the rotor had already begun revving higher and in moments the chopper had begun its ascent out over the dark river you have been warned to identify yourself came the futile megaphone the chopper had all but disappeared into the dark and rain when she heard a shot fired from the direction of the police car it must have been an accident she told herself theres no way but the smooth hum of the engine dying away in the fog abruptly changed tone then started to sputter ten seconds later there was silence she was so engaged she didnt notice the stirring at her feet a moment thereafter she saw the towering bulk of kenji noda rise up beside her then she felt his grip on her wrist and realized he was dragging and pulling her to the edge of the pier then she felt a shove and a swirl of dark air around her followed by the splash of cold water surprisingly it didnt really feel freezingit just felt refreshingly brisk with one hand she grabbed one of the square concrete pillars that was supporting the pier the mysterious strength shed had from time to time was coming back once more that was when she heard a vicious howl wolflike that transmuted into a growl and the next thing she saw was a hazy form hurtle past her and splash into the water actually it was two forms and the darker one was flailing while the lighter one bore down on him her teeth on his throat no she screamed dont as the pair drifted past her in the current still linked she reached out and seized knickers collar yanking her back then she watched helplessly as kenji noda disappeared into the dark could he swim with one arm the cops were futilely searching the wide river with their searchlight looking for the helicopter for anything but there was nothing left to see she quietly made for shore even as she and knickers were being swept downstream by the current when they finally reached the bank it was somewhere around morton street oddly enough she wasnt cold and she wasnt tired when she drew herself up onto the rocks knickers at her side she just lay panting for a moment come here baby she said drawing knickers to her the dog was shivering and she knew she had to get her home soon thank god you cant talk i think something very evil just passed from the world epilogue thursday june pm youre really something stone declared falling back onto the rumpled sheets whats come over you lately dont you ever get tired maybe im just happy to be alive ally said smiling as she ran a finger down his chest im catching up on all the living ive been missing out on her heart was definitely on the mend in several ways she was beginning to think she was in love after steve went missing she thought that love would never happen again but maybe it had know what he said rising up ive really worked up an appetite how about you think ill make an omelet got any eggs left in the fridge should be some she said but ill pass anything i eat after ten goes straight to places on my body that dont need further reinforcement it was so nice just to have someone to be near again her nervous system was still recovering from the harrowing experience down on the pier in fact she wasnt really sure what actually had happened the crashed mcdonnell douglas was retrieved from the water the next day but there were no bodies aboard had winston bartlett drowned and his body been swept out to sea by the tide also there must have been a third person a pilot and what about kenji noda who also was missing did he make it to shore in any case they all had disappeared the case was closed and since nobody had found a will new york state was currently the executor of his fortune eileen bartlett was sole heir her waiting game had paid off superbly the price of her gerex shares was doubling every two weeks she was about to become a very rich woman indeed but had winston bartlett really gone to a watery grave ally somehow doubted it he had too much invested in life to cash in so easily as she watched stone get up and swathe himself in a huge white towel before heading for the kitchen she found herself replaying that harrowing scene at the pier she kept trying to remember something bartlett had said about forming some kind of society was she fantasizing or had he said he was going to do that and then offer the beta procedure to its members what was he going to call it try as she might she couldnt remember she had developed a mental block that her mind was using to shield her psyche from the horror of that evening that night shed first considered going to st vincents hospital emergency room for the gunshot wound but then shed thought it over and decided there were too many things to explain that couldnt be explained instead she just went home and washed the wound and filled it up with neosporin she didnt even tell nina the next morning scar tissue was already forming now it was completely healed and even the scar had all but disappeared had the beta really worked she wanted to tell stone about that possibility but she wasnt sure how he would take it and she absolutely did not want to end up in the book she pulled on a terry cloth robe and slippers and padded her way into the kitchen she wasnt hungry but she felt like a glass of wine she poked around in the wine rack in the kitchen closet and came up with a bottle of bordeaux stone was cracking large white eggs into a stoneware bowl sure i cant make some for you he asked leaning over to buss her hair as she searched in the drawer for a corkscrew im gonna throw in some cheddar but ill leave it out if that doesnt work for you i just want a glass of red wine she said retrieving the corkscrew and i need a memory jogging whats a word that makes you think of living a long time i i want to look up something on the internet and i dont know how to start what kind of word is it he queried im a wordsmith twenty questions is it a noun a verb an adjective if i could remember that i might be able to come up with it he was tossing a quarter stick of butter into the pan hey i once learned hypnosis why dont you let me take you under does that really work its how i come up with interview stuff sometimes from years ago we really do have a complicated memory system i think everything you ever knew is buried somewhere maybe in a tiny little wrinkle she suspected he might be right in this case the repressed info was still there it just had been deliberately covered over and hidden so do you want to hypnotize me youre sure you know how im not boasting but i could make methuselah remember the day he first got out of diapers she stared at him my god i think thats it methuselah i think thats the word i couldnt remember she kissed him on the mouth enthusiastically ive got to check something she popped the cork and poured herself a glass want some im not sure what goes with eggs at this time of night probably tequila good luck you know where to find it therere some limes in the fridge right now im going to fire up the dell and do a little search now his face dropped how about a little romantic whatever come and join me bring your plate well go exploring in cyberspace itll be a romantic voyage ive got a hunch about something she walked back into the bedroom and clicked on the computer she sipped at her wine deep but still fruity and delicious as it booted up whats going on he asked as he wandered in he was carrying a shot glass of tequila and a white plate with the cheese omelette the aroma was seductive i want to check out something i have to be honest and confess ive been holding out on you a little when i saw winston bartlett that night on the pier something he said ally i need to do some confessing too the time never seemed quite right i need to tell you something about him well dont tell me now i dont think i can handle anything else to worry about tonight please save it she was logging on to aol then she went to the search engine google which she had found to be the best i want to check out that name you came up with it rang a bell she typed in methuselah supposedly the guy who lived for nearly a thousand years there were pages and pages of references relating to that word it started with a fivethousandyearold pine tree then an article from modern maturity on how to extend life then caltech research on a longevity gene then a rock band in texas undoubtedly very retro a short story by isaac bashevis singer and so it went what exactly are you looking for he asked holding out a folk here want a bite she reached and tore off a fluffy corner he did eggs perfectly thanks she said chewing now she was moving to the third page i think im looking for an organization and methuselah was in the name at least thats what i seem to remember im definitely repressing a lot well what about that one he asked pointing the line read the methuselah society thats it she declared now i remember thats the name he used i swear so its real im not crazy what are you talking about its him thats what he said he was going to do she clicked on the name the web page came up and it was strictly in black and white with small print and there it was again the methuselah society there was no information beyond a request for a secure email address looks like they want to check you out stone said to make sure youre not connected to politics or law enforcement then why not give it a shot stone said youre on aol youd have to be a civilian she typed in her address and entered it immediately a little yellow padlock appeared in the lower righthand corner indicating their communication was secure then a notice materialized a small square flickering to life it contained her phone number and then her name next a complete financial record began to scroll down it had been elicited from banks mortgage companies credit services there was value of real estate owned mortgages outstanding bank accounts outstanding obligations estimated net worth it had all appeared in a time span of seconds wow stone said there are no secrets left from these guys whoever they are they are wired then a message appeared the minimum net worth required to be a member is million dollars the fee for membership is million dollars a milliondollar retainer is required while your application is being processed please be prepared to designate the ages you and your companion wish to remain my god she said thats him hes done it winston bartlett is alive and well and selling immortality real or not then another message came up welcome alexa please be advised you are already a member but you have not yet selected a companion afterword how much of the foregoing is true or even plausible in late medical researchers in dusseldorf announced they had successfully treated heartattack victims using stem cells harvested from the patients own bone marrow the stem cells were delivered to damaged heart muscle via angioplasty catheters a minimally invasive procedure subsequent monitoring indicated that the stem cells had reduced the damage to heartmuscle tissue and had improved their heart function when compared to similar patients in a control group who had declined the procedure its already happening the miraculous stem cell cures in this story are essentially an extrapolation of research well underway that has been the subject of magazine covers and is possibly the most promising and yes problematic field of medical research the clocks at the dorian institute ran faster than ordinary timepieces and research areas and cures that currently are only speculation were made real there but thats why its called fiction as with the example cited above many stem cell miracles conjured here may be just over the horizon as for kristen and the methuselah society they are a fictional embodiment of misgivings given voice by many including no less an authority than professor leonard hayflick whose hayflick limit defining the process of how cells grow old could be said to be the underpinning of modern stem cell research he is now a leading bioethicist who is sufficiently convinced of our potential to use stem cells to arrest the actual aging process that he has worried about its ramifications in print he makes no claim that such a thing is imminent but he doesnt dismiss its possibility either he has farreaching societal concerns about this and he also raises biological issues such as if youve treated your brain malady by using stem cells to grow new neural tissue have you altered your mind are you still you its called regenerative medicine watch for it
