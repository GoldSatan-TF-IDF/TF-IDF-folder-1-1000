black cross greg iles copyright by greg iles for betty thornhill iles and every man and woman who sacrificed their lives in the allied cause there is a mysterious cycle in human events to some generations much is given of other generations much is expected this generation has a rendezvous with destiny franklin delano roosevelt its odd how death often marks a beginning rather than an end we know someone for ten years twenty years longer we see them in the course of daily life we speak laugh exchange harsh words we think we have some notion of who they are and then they die in death the fluid impressions formed over a lifetime begin to assume definite shape the picture comes into focus new facts emerge safes are opened wills read with finality and with distance we often discover that the people we thought we knew were actually quite different than we imagined and the closer we were to them the more shocking this surprise is so it was with my grandfather he died violently and quite publicly in circumstances so extraordinary that they got thirty seconds of airtime on the national evening news it happened last tuesday in a medstar helicopter ambulance en route from fairplay georgia the small town in which i was born and raised to emory university hospital in atlanta where i work as an emergency physician while making his rounds at fairplays local hospital my grandfather collapsed at a nurses station fighting to ignore the terrible pain in his lower back he had a nurse take his blood pressure when he heard the figures he correctly diagnosed a leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm and realized that without immediate emergency surgery he would die with two nurses supporting him he spoke on a telephone just long enough to summon the medstar from atlanta forty miles away my grandmother insisted on remaining by his side in the chopper and the pilot reluctantly agreed they dont usually allow that but damn near everybody in the georgia medical community knew or knew of my grandfather a quiet but eminently respected lung specialist besides my grandmother wasnt the kind of woman that men talked back to ever the medstar crashed twenty minutes later on a quiet street in the suburbs of atlanta that was four days ago and as yet no one has determined the cause of the crash just one of those freak things i guess pilot error they like to call it i dont really care whose fault it was im not looking to sue were not or werent that kind of family my grandparents deaths hit me especially hard because they raised me from the age of five my parents died in a car crash in ive seen more than my share of tragedy i suppose i still do it sweeps through my emergency room every day and night trailing blood and cocaine and whiskeybreath and burnt skin and dead kids such is life the reason im writing this down is because of what happened at the burial or rather who i met at the burial because it was there in a place of death that my grandfathers secret life revealed itself at last the cemetery crowd a large one for our town and predominantly protestant had already drifted back toward the long line of sedate lincolns and brighter japanese imports i was standing at the green edge of the graves two sidebyside holes smelling of freshly turned earth a pair of gravediggers waited to cover the gleaming silver caskets they seemed in no particular hurry both had been patients of my grandfather at one time or another one a wiry fellow named crenshaw had even been brought into the world by him or so he said they dont make docs like your grandpa anymore mark he declared or doctor i should say he added smiling i cant quite get used to that title no offense but i still remember catching you out here at midnight with that clark girl i smiled back that was a good memory i cant quite get used to the title either as a matter of fact doctor mcconnell i know i am a doctor a damn good one but when i stand or stood beside my grandfather i always felt more like an apprentice a bright but inexperienced student in the shadow of a master that was what i was thinking when someone tugged at my jacket sleeve from behind afternoon rabbi said the gravedigger nodding past me shalom mr crenshaw said a deep muchtraveled voice i turned behind me stooped an avuncular old man with snowwhite hair and a yarmulke his twinkling eyes settled on me and gave me a thorough goingover the spitting image he said quietly though youre a little heavierboned than mac was my grandmothers genes i said a little embarrassed to be at a disadvantage quite right said the old man quite right and a beautiful woman she was too suddenly i placed him rabbi leibovitz isnt it the old man smiled you have a good memory doctor its been a long time since youve seen me up close the old mans voice had a low musical quality to it as if all its edges had been worn away by years of soothing reasonable speech i nodded again the gravediggers shuffled their feet well i said i guess its about time ill take that shovel rabbi leibovitz told crenshaw but rabbi you shouldnt be doing heavy work the rabbi took the shovel from the amazed gravedigger and spaded it into the soft pile of dirt this is work for a mans friends and family he said doctor he looked up at me i took the other shovel from the second man and followed his example afternoon mark muttered crenshaw a little put out he and his partner shambled off toward a battered pickup that waited at a discreet distance i shoveled earth steadily into my grandmothers grave while rabbi leibovitz worked on the other it was hot georgia summer hot and soon i was pouring sweat as the backfill rose toward my feet i was a little surprised to find that the shoveling felt better than anything i had done since i first heard the news of my grandparents deaths and far better than anything anyone had said to console me when i checked the old mans progress i was surprised to find him only a little behind me in his work i went back to mine with a will when i finished filling my grandmothers grave i walked around to help rabbi leibovitz together we finished filling my grandfathers in a couple of minutes the rabbi laid his shovel on the ground behind him then turned back to the grave and began praying quietly i stood holding my shovel in silence until he had finished then as if by mutual consent we started walking to the narrow asphalt lane where i had parked my black saab i saw no other cars nearby the cemetery was a good mile and a half from the center of town did you walk all the way out here rabbi i asked i caught a ride from a good christian he said i was hoping to ride back with you the request caught me off guard but i said sure glad to do it i opened the passenger door for him then went around and got behind the wheel the swedishbuilt engine revved smoothly where to i asked you still live across from the synagogue yes but i thought we might visit your grandparents house are you staying there while youre in town yes i admitted yes i am i looked at him curiously then i felt a familiar sense of recognition i had seen these situations before some people dont feel comfortable confronting serious medical symptoms in a physicians office is there something you need to tell me rabbi i asked slowly are you in need of medical attention no no im quite well for my age thank god but there is something id like to talk to you about mark something i think your grandfather meant to discuss with you eventually but somehow i dont think he ever made the time what are you talking about about what your grandfather did in the war mark did he ever talk to you about that i felt myself flush a little no he never got past i did my duty when it was required that sounds like mac he never talked to my grandmother about it either i confided surprising myself she told me that and it hurt her it was kind of like a hole in our lives small maybe but there all the same a dark place you know rabbi leibovitz nodded a very dark place mark and i think its about time someone shed a little light on it for you fifteen minutes later we were standing in the study of my grandparents house three generations of doctors had grown up in this rambling country clapboard we were looking down at the steel firesafe where my grandfather had always kept his personal papers do you know the combination the rabbi asked i shook my head he reached into his back pocket withdrew his wallet and dug around inside until he found what he was looking for a small white card of introduction one of my grandfathers he read some numbers off the back then looked at me expectantly listen rabbi i said beginning to grow uncomfortable im not exactly sure why were here i mean i know you and my grandfather were acquaintances but i never knew you were close frankly i dont see how anything in that safe could be any business of yours i paused unless he left the synagogue a bequest in his will is that it leibovitz chuckled youre a suspicious man mark just like your grandfather no this has nothing to do with money i doubt if mac had much left to tell you the truth except for the insurance which was only around fifty thousand i think he gave most of his money away i shot him a sidelong glance how do you know all that your grandfather and i were more than acquaintances mark we were fast friends i know about his money because he gave a lot of it to the synagogue once you made it through medical school he figured you could take care of yourself and your grandmother too if he happened to die first he owned this house of course youll get that as far as the money he gave me i was to use it to help persecuted jews who were trying to reach israel leibovitz turned his callused palms upward this all goes back to the war mark what mac did during the war if you open that safe for me everything will become much clearer that reasonable forthright voice was hard to refuse all right i agreed knowing i was being manipulated but strangely unable to resist read the combination again as leibovitz read i worked the dial on the safe until i heard a click then pulled open the heavy door the first thing i saw was a stack of papers just what i had expected they looked like legal documents titles to the two family cars the house an ancient mortgage do you see a box the rabbi asked it would be nearly flat and not too large carefully i dug through the papers sure enough near the bottom of the stack my fingers touched a flat wooden box i removed it from the safe it was made of plain pine about six inches square i had never seen it before open it leibovitz commanded i looked over my shoulder at him then turned back and lifted the lid off the box the glint of polished metal flickered in the light what is that i asked the victoria cross the most coveted decoration in the british empire have you heard of it the victoria cross isnt that what michael caine won in zulu leibovitz shook his head sadly television he muttered yes the victoria cross was awarded to a handful of englishmen who repulsed an overwhelming zulu army at rorkes drift in south africa i lifted the cross gingerly and examined it in the light it was bronze and hung from a crimson ribbon the center of the cross bore a lion standing upon a crown engraved on a scroll beneath the crown were the words for valour rabbi leibovitz spoke as if addressing a small congregation the list of recipients of the vc constitutes the most revered roll in english military history mark as far as the public knows only thirteen hundred and fifty have been awarded since the decoration was instituted by queen victoria in but there is another list a much smaller list that is known to no one but the monarch and the prime minister it is the secret list and upon it are inscribed the names of those who have performed unparalleled acts of valor and devotion in the face of the enemy but of such a sensitive nature that they can never be revealed he took a deep breath then said your grandfathers name is on that list mark my head snapped up in astonishment you must be joking he never mentioned anything like that to me the old rabbi smiled patiently that was the charge that came with the award the decoration can never be worn in public i suppose the secret cross was given so that in the dark of night long after glory had passed men like your grandfather would have something to remind them that their sacrifices were appreciated leibovitz looked thoughtful still it takes a special kind of man to hide that kind of glory granddad was no egomaniac i conceded but he wasnt especially modest either he didnt hide honors he deserved leibovitz sighed sadly mac deserved this honor but he wasnt proud of what he had done to deserve it he began the war as a conscientious objector you know i didnt know that mark long ago your grandfather sought me out to discuss something that troubled him deeply hed spoken to his christian pastor about it but said the fellow hadnt really understood what he was talking about the pastor told mac he was a hero that he had no reason to be ashamed of what hed done mac struggled along on his own for a while then finally came to me why you because im a jew he thought perhaps i could give him special insight into his problem that i might be able to help him to unburden his soul i swallowed did you i tried my best i truly did over a period of years in fact and he was grateful for the effort but i never really succeeded your grandfather carried his burden with him to the grave well damn it youve got to tell me now what did he do that was so terrible and when did he do it he told me that he spent the war in england leibovitzs eyes settled on some neutral point in space he spent most of the war in england thats true doing research at oxford but for two short weeks your grandfather traveled quite a bit and his travels ultimately led him to a place that must have been very close to hell on earth where was that leibovitzs face hardened a place called totenhausen on the recknitz river in northern germany as to when mac was there if you turn over the cross it will tell you i turned the cross over engraved on its back were the words mark cameron mcconnell md february thats the date that the act of valor took place leibovitz murmured fifty years ago your grandfather did something so strategically important so singularly heroic that he was awarded an honor only one other nonbritish subject has ever received that other recipient was also an american who was it the rabbi straightened up with difficulty his spine stiff as a ramrod the unknown soldier i felt a lump in my throat i cant believe this i said hoarsely this is the most extraordinary thing ive ever heard or seen i added holding up the ribbon and cross it seemed somehow heavier in my hands youre about to see something still more extraordinary leibovitz said something unique i swallowed in anticipation look under the padding in the box it should still be there i handed the cross to rabbi leibovitz then gingerly lifted the linen cloth that lined the bottom of the pine box beneath it i found a frayed swatch of woolen cloth a scottish tartan pattern i looked up questioningly keep going leibovitz said beneath the tartan i found a photograph it was blackandwhite with contrasts so stark it looked like one of the old dust bowl photographs from life magazine it showed a young woman from the waist up she wore a simple cotton dress her slender body posed rather formally against a background of dark wooden planks her shoulderlength hair was blond and straight and seemed to glow against the unfinished wood her face though worn by care lines around the mouth was set off by eyes as dark as the wood behind her i guessed her age at thirty who is this i asked shes i dont know not beautiful exactly but alive is it my grandmother when she was younger i mean rabbi leibovitz waved his hand impatiently all in good time look beneath the photograph i did a meticulously folded piece of notepaper lay there wrinkled and yellowed with age i lifted it out and started to unfold it careful he warned is this the citation for the award i asked working delicately at the paper something else altogether i had it open now the handwritten blue letters had almost completely faded as if the note had been put through a washing machine by mistake but the few words were still legible i read them with a strange sense of puzzlement on my head be these deaths w i can barely read it what does it mean who is w you can barely read the writing mark because it was nearly washed away by the freezing waters of the recknitz river in what the note means can only be explained by telling you a rather involved and shocking story and w as the author of that note so cryptically described himself was winston churchill churchill yes the old rabbi smiled mischievously and thereby hangs a tale my god i said would you have any brandy about asked leibovitz i went to fetch a bottle i lay it all at churchills door the old rabbi had ensconced himself in a leather wing chair with a crocheted comforter around his knees and the brandy glass in his hand you know of course that mac first went to england as a rhodes scholar that was the year after the crash he stayed two years then was asked to stay a third and matriculate quite an honor when he graduated and returned to the us im sure he thought his english period was finished but it wasnt he graduated medical school in thirtyeight somehow squeezing in a masters in chemical engineering during his internship by then it was he entered general practice with a friend of his fathers but hed hardly settled in when a phone call came from oxford his old tutor told him that one of churchills scientific advisors had been impressed by some monographs hed done on chemical warfare in world war one they wanted him to join a british team working on poison gases america wasnt in the war yet but mac understood what was at stake england was hanging by a thread i do remember that much i said he agreed to go on the condition that he would only work in a defensive capacity right yes rather naively if i may say so anyway he took your grandmother with him to england just in time for the battle of britain it took some doing but he talked susan into going back to the states hitler never did invade england but by then it was too late they were separated for the duration fifty years leibovitz said softly he paused as though he had lost his train of thought i suppose that seems an age to you but try to picture the time dead of winter january the whole world including the germans knew the allies would invade europe in the spring the only question was where the blow would fall eisenhower had just been named supreme commander of overlord churchill excuse me rabbi i interrupted no disrespect intended but i get the feeling youre giving me the long version of this story he smiled with a forbearance learned at the sides of impatient children you have somewhere to go no but im curious about my grandfather not churchill and eisenhower mark if i simply told you the end of this story you would not believe me i mean that you cannot absorb what i am going to say unless you know what led to it do you understand i nodded trying to mask my impatience no leibovitz said forcefully you dont the worst thing you have ever seen in your life all the worst things put together child abuse rape even murder these are as nothing compared to what i am about to tell you it is a tale of cruelty beyond imagining of men and women whose heroism has never been equaled he raised a crooked finger and his voice went very low after hearing this story your life will never be the same thats a lot of buildup rabbi he took a gulp of brandy i have no children doctor do you know why well i assume you never wanted any or that you or your wife were sterile i am sterile leibovitz confirmed when i was sixteen i was invited by some german doctors to sit in a booth and fill out a form that would take fifteen minutes to complete during those fifteen minutes highintensity xrays were passed through my testicles from three sides two weeks later a jewish surgeon and his wife saved my life by castrating me in their kitchen my hands felt suddenly cold were you in the camps no i escaped to sweden along with the surgeon and his wife but you see i left my unborn children behind i didnt know what to say thats the first time ive ever told that to a christian leibovitz said im not a christian rabbi his eyes narrowed do you know something i dont youre not jewish im not anything an agnostic i guess a professional doubter leibovitz studied me for a long time his face lined by emotions i could not interpret you say that so easily for one who has lived through so little ive seen my share of suffering and alleviated some too he waved his hand in a european gesture that seemed to say many things at once doctor you have not even peered over the edge of the abyss laying his hand across his eyes leibovitz sat motionless for nearly a minute he seemed to be deciding if he had the strength to tell his story after all just as i was about to speak he removed his hand and said now are you ready to listen mark or would you prefer to leave things as they are i looked down at the victoria cross the faded note the scottish tartan and the photograph of the woman youve hooked me i said but wait here a minute i went back to my grandfathers bedroom and got the small tape recorder he had used for dictating medical charts and a thin box of sony microcassettes do you mind if i tape this i asked setting up the recorder if the story is that important perhaps it should be documented it should have been told years ago leibovitz said but mac would have none of it he said knowing or not knowing about it wouldnt change human history by one whit i disagreed with him its long past time to bring this story into the light i glanced at the window the lights almost gone rabbi he sighed indifferently then well make a night of it can i give you a bit of advice editorially speaking ah youre an editor now i shrugged ive written a few journal articles actually ive been toying with writing a novel on my off weekends a medical thriller but perhaps ive found a new story to tell anyway heres my advice you can take it or leave it that picture the scene and i suppose business drop all that just tell the story like you think it happened like you were a fly on the wall after a few moments leibovitz nodded i think i can do that he said he poured himself another brandy then settled back into the leather wing chair and held up his glass in a toast to the bravest man i ever knew oxford university england mark mcconnell quietly lifted the long steering pole out of the cherwell river and slapped it back down a spray of water and ice drenched the leatherjacketed back of his brother who perched on the forward seat of the narrow wooden punt you goddamn shitbird david whirled around almost upsetting the boat in the process he dug his gloved right hand into the river and shot back a volley of water and ice hold it mark cried youll sink us you surrendering david dipped his hand into the water again declaring a temporary ceasefire for medical reasons chickenshit mark wiggled the pole ive got the firepower okay truce david lifted his hand and turned back to the prow of the flatbottomed punt as it crunched slowly around the next bend in the icy river he was the shorter of the two brothers and built like a halfback with sprinters legs a narrow waist and thickly muscled shoulders his sandy blond hair strong jaw and clear blue eyes completed the picture of norman rockwell charm while mark watched warily he slid down onto the cross slats of the punt leaned back cradled his head in his hands and shut his eyes mark scanned the river ahead the bare trees on both banks hung so heavily with icicles that some branches nearly touched the snow carpeting the meadows beneath them this is insane he said flicking a final salvo of drops onto davids face but he didnt mean it if his younger brother hadnt driven down from the th air force base at deenethorpe this winter day would have been like any other at oxford a bleak fourteenhour newsreel watched through foggy laboratory windows rain changing into sleet and then back into rain falling in great gray sheets that spattered the cobbled quads of the colleges shrouded the bodelian library and swelled the lazy cherwell and thames into torrents this is the life david murmured this is exactly how we picture you eggheads when were on the flight line living the life of riley canoeing around a goddamn college campus we risk our asses every day while you bums sit up here supposedly winning the war with your little gray cells you mean punting around a goddamn college campus david opened one eye looked back and snorted jeez you sound more like a limey every year if you called mom on a telephone she wouldnt even know you mark studied his younger brothers face it was good to see him again and not merely because it provided an excuse to get out of the lab for an afternoon mark needed the human contact in this place that offered so much comradeship he had become a virtual outcast lately hed had to fight a wild impulse to simply turn to a sympathetic face on a bus and begin talking yet looking at his brother now an air force captain who spent most days on whiteknuckle bombing runs over germany he wondered if he had the right to add his own pressures to those already on davids shoulders i think my hands are frostbitten mark grumbled as the punt pushed on through the black water id give a hundred pounds for an outboard motor once already he had resolved to talk to david about his problem three weeks ago on christmas day but a lastminute bombing assignment had scotched their plans to get together now another month had almost slipped by it had been that way for the last four years time rushing past like a river in flood now another christmas was gone and another new year mark could scarcely believe it four years in this sandstone haven of cloisters and spires while the world outside tore itself to pieces with unrelenting fury hey david called his eyes still closed how are the girls down here what do you mean david opened both eyes and craned his neck to stare back at his brother what do i mean has four years away from susan pickled your pecker as well as your brain im talking about english dames weve got to live up to our billing you know our billing overpaid oversexed and over here remember hell i know you love susan i know plenty of guys who are crazy about their wives but four years you cant spend every waking moment holed up in that frankenstein lab of yours mark shrugged i have though christ id tell you about some of my adventures only you wouldnt be able to sleep tonight mark jabbed the pole into the river bottom it had been a mistake to send susan home but any sane man would have done the same at the time considering the danger of german invasion he was getting tired of paying for that particular misjudgment though hed been on the wrong side of the atlantic longer than any american he knew to hell with this he said as they rounded the bend at st hildas college he levered the punt into a sharp embankment near christ church meadow the impact of the bow against the shore practically catapulted david out of the boat but he landed with an athletes natural grace lets get a beer david said dont you eggheads ever drink around here whose dumbass idea was this anyway mark found himself laughing as he climbed out of the punt as a matter of fact i know a few chaps whod be glad to take you on in the drinking contest of your choice chaps david gaped at his brother did i hear you say chaps mac we gotta get you back to the states old sport back to georgia you sound like the great gatsby im only playing to your tom buchanan david groaned wed better go straight to whiskey a little kentucky bourbonll wash that limey accent right out of your throat im afraid they dont stock kentuckys finest here in oxford slick david grinned thats why i brought a fifth in my muzette bag cost me thirty bucks on the black market but i wouldnt drink that hightoned limey swill if i was dying of thirst they crossed christ church meadow mostly in silence david took several long pulls from the bottle stowed in his flight bag mark declined repeated offers to share the whiskey he wanted his mind clear when he spoke about his dilemma he would have preferred to have davids mind clear as well but there was nothing he could do about that walking side by side the differences between the brothers were more marked where david was compact and almost brawny mark was tall and lean with the body of a distance runner he moved with long easy strides and a surefootedness acquired through years of running crosscountry races his hands were large his fingers long and narrow surgeons hands his father had boasted when he was only a boy david had inherited their mothers flashing blue eyes but marks were deep brown another legacy from his father and where david was quick to smile or throw a punch mark wore the contemplative gaze of a man who carefully weighed all sides of any issue before acting he chose the welsh pony in george street the pub did a brisk evening trade but privacy could be had if desired mark went up to one of the two central bars and ordered a beer to justify the use of the table then led david to the rear of the pub by the time he was halfway to the bottom of his mug he realized that david had drunk quite a lot of bourbon with english stout to chase it down yet david remained surprisingly lucid he was like their father in that way if in no other the analogy was not comforting what the hells eating you mac david asked sharply all day ive had the feeling you wanted to say something but you keep backing off youre like an old possum circling a garbage can youre driving me nuts get it out in the open mark leaned back against the oak chair and took his first long swallow of the night david what does it feel like to bomb a german city what do you mean david straightened up looking puzzled you mean am i scared no i mean actually dropping the bombs how does it feel to drop stick after stick of fivehundredpound bombs on a city you know is full of women and children hell i dont drop em the bombardier does that i just fly the plane so thats how you do it you distance yourself from the act mentally i mean david squinted at his brother jesus lets dont start okay its not enough i had to listen to all that crap from dad when i enlisted now that hes gone youre going to take over he swung a heavy forearm to take in the pub and the snowy alley visible through a frosted window you sit up here in your little land of oz playing paper games with the other eggheads you lose touch real quick you start forgetting why we got into this war in the first place mark held up his hand i know we have to stop the nazis david but were destroying so much more than that wake up mac its were talking hitler here the fucking führer i realize that but do you notice how hitler is used to justify any allied act any allied sacrifice area bombing suicide missions the politicians act as if hitler sprang fully formed from the brow of jupiter men of conscience could have stopped that madman ten years ago coulda woulda shoulda david muttered welcome to the real world hitler asked for it and now hes gonna get it yes he did and he is but must we destroy an entire culture to destroy one man do we wipe out a whole country to cure one epidemic david suddenly looked very angry indeed the germans you mean let me tell you about those people of yours i had a buddy name of chuckie wilson okay his b went down near würzburg after the second schweinfurt raid the pilot was killed in flight but chuckie and two other guys got out of the plane one guy was captured another was smuggled out of france by the resistance but chuckie was captured by some german civilians david downed a double shot of whiskey then lapsed into a sullen silence and and they lynched him mark felt the hairs on his neck rise they what strung him up to the nearest tree goddamn it i thought the germans treated captured flyers well at least on the western front regular kraut soldiers do but the ss aint regular and the german civilians hate our guts how do you know about the lynching the guy who made it out saw the whole thing you want to know the worst part while these civilians were stringing chuckie up a company of waffen ss drove up in a truck they sat there laughing and smoking while the bastards killed him then drove away made me think of that colored guy that got lynched on the bascombe farm back home the lynchers claimed he raped a white girl remember but there wasnt any evidence and there damn sure wasnt any trial remember what uncle marty said the sheriff and his deputies stood there and watched the whole thing david slowly opened and closed his left fist while he knocked back a swig of bourbon with his right the guy who saw chuckie lynched said there were just as many women there as men he said one woman jumped up and hung on his feet while he swung i see your point mark leaned back and took a deep breath down here we lose sight of how personal war can be we dont see the hatred damn right you dont buddy you oughta fly a raid with us sometime just once freezing your balls off trying to remember to breathe from your mask knowing ten seconds of exposed flesh could mean frostbite surgery the whole ride youre cursing yourself for every time you ever skipped sunday school mark was thinking of an offer he had recently made to a scottish brigadier general in a fit of anger hed threatened to leave his laboratory and volunteer to carry a rifle at the front maybe i should get closer to the real war he said quietly what are my convictions worth if i dont know what war really is i could request a transfer to a forward surgical unit in italy david slammed his whiskey glass down reached across the table and pinned his brothers arm to the scarred wood several patrons looked in their direction but one glare from david was enough to blunt their curiosity you try that and ill break your friggin legs he said and if you try to do it without me knowing ill find out mark was stunned by his brothers vehemence im dead serious mac you dont want to go anywhere near a real battlefield even from five miles up i can tell you those places are hell on earth you read me loud and clear ace mark said but he was troubled by a feeling that for the first time he was seeing his brother as he really was the david he remembered as a brash irrepressible young athlete had been transformed by the war into a haggard boyman with the eyes of a neurosurgeon david mark whispered with sudden urgency feeling his face grow hot with the prospect of confession ive got to talk to you he couldnt stop himself the words that became illegal the moment he uttered them came tumbling out in a flood the british are after me to work on a special project for them they want me to spearhead it its a type of weapon that hasnt been used before well thats not strictly true it has been used before but not in this way and not with this much potential for wholesale slaughter david caught hold of his arm whoa slow down what are you babbling about mark looked furtively around the pub the background hum of voices seemed sufficient to cover quiet conversation he leaned across the table a secret weapon david im not kidding its just like the movies its a goddamn nightmare a secret weapon thats what i said its something that would have little to guide it it would kill indiscriminately men women children animals no distinction theyd die by the thousands and the british want you to spearhead this project right davids mouth split into an amazed smile boy did they ever pick the wrong guy mark nodded well they think im the right guy what kind of weapon is this i dont see how it could be much more destructive or less discriminating than a thousandbomber air raid mark looked slowly around the pub it is though its not a bomb its not even one of the superbombs youve probably heard rumors about its something something like what wounded dad david recoiled the cynicism instantly gone from his face you mean gas poison gas mark nodded shit neither side has used gas yet in this war even the nazis still remember the trenches from the last one there are treaties prohibiting it right the geneva protocol but nobody cares about that the us didnt even sign it jesus what kind of gas is it mustard marks laugh had an almost hysterical undertone david nobody knows the horrific effects of mustard gas better than you or i but this gas im talking about is a thousand times worse a thousand times worse you cant see it you dont even have to breathe it but brother it will kill you its the equivalent of a cobra strike to the brain david had gone still i assume youre not supposed to be telling me any of this absolutely not well i guess youd better start at the beginning mark let his eyes wander over the thinning crowd of those who remained he knew half by sight two were professors working on weapons programs he kept his voice very low one month ago he said a small sample of colorless liquid labeled sarin was delivered to my lab for testing i usually get my samples from anonymous civilians but this was different sarin was delivered by a scottish brigadier general named duff smith hes a onearmed old warhorse whos been pressuring me on and off for years to work on offensive chemical weapons brigadier smith said he wanted an immediate opinion on the lethality of sarin as soon as i had that i was to start trying to develop an effective mask filter against it only in the case of sarin a mask wont do it you need protection over your entire body david looked thoughtful is this a german gas or allied stuff smith wouldnt tell me but he did warn me to take extra precautions christ was he ever right sarin was like nothing id ever seen it kills by shortcircuiting the central nervous system according to my experiments it exceeds the lethality of phosgene by a factor of thirty david seemed unimpressed do you understand what im saying david phosgene was the most lethal gas used in world war one but compared to sarin its like nothing onetenth of one milligram of sarin one speck the size of a grain of sand will kill you in less than a minute its invisible in lethal concentration and it will pass through human skin right through your skin davids mouth was working silently ive got the picture go on last week brigadier smith paid me another visit this time he asked how i would feel if he told me sarin was a german gas and had no counterpart in the allied arsenal he wanted to know what i would do to protect allied cities and my honest answer was nothing to protect the inhabitants of a city from sarin would be impossible its not like a heavybomber raid as bad as those are people can come out from the shelters when theyre over depending on weather conditions sarin could lie in the streets for days coating sidewalks windows grass food anything okay david said what happened next smith tells me sarin is a german gas stolen from the heart of the reich he says then he tells me im wrong there is something i can do to protect our cities whats that develop an equally lethal gas so that hitler wont dare use sarin himself david nodded slowly if hes telling the truth about sarin that sounds like the only thing to do i dont see the problem marks face fell you dont christ you of all people should understand look i dont want to get into this pacifist thing again i thought youd come to terms with that hell youve been working for the british since but only in a defensive capacity you know that david expelled air from his cheeks to tell you the truth i never really saw the difference youre either working in the war effort or youre not theres a big difference david believe me even in liberal oxford im an official leper be glad youre in oxford theyd beat the crap out of you at my air base mark rubbed his forehead with his palms look i understand the logic of deterrence but there has never been a weapon like this before never he watched with relief as the two professors left the pub david im going to tell you something that most people dont know and weve never discussed until one month ago poison gas was the most humane weapon in the world what its the truth despite the agony of burns and the horror of chemical weapons ninetyfour percent of the men gassed in world war one were fit for duty again in nine weeks nine weeks david the mortality figure for poison gas is somewhere around two percent mortality from guns and shells is twentyfive percent ten times higher the painful fact is that our father was an exception davids confusion was evident in his bunched eyebrows what are you telling me mark im trying to explain that until sarin was invented my aversion to gas warfare was based primarily on the paralyzing terror it held for soldiers and the psychological aftermath of being wounded by gas figures dont tell the whole truth especially about human pain but with sarin chemical warfare has entered an entirely new phase were talking about a weapon that has four times the mortality rate of shot and shell sarin is one hundred percent lethal it will kill every living thing it touches i would rather carry a rifle at the front than be responsible for developing something that destructive davids whole posture conveyed the reluctance he felt to stray onto this territory listen i swore id never argue with you about this again its the same argument i always had with dad the sermon on the mount versus machine guns gandhi versus hitler passive resistance cant work against germany mark the nazis just dont give a damn you turn the other cheek those bastardsll slice it off for you hell it was the germans who gassed dad in the first place keep your voice down yeah yeah jeez i dont like where this conversations ended up the young pilot scratched his stubbled chin deep in thought okay okay just listen to me for a minute everybody back home calls you mac right they always have what does that have to do with anything just listen everybody calls me david right or dave or slick why do you think everybody calls you mac mark shrugged i was the oldest wrong it was because you acted just like dad did when he was a kid mark shifted in his seat maybe maybe hell you know im right but what you dont know or dont want to know is that you still act just like him mark stiffened our father the great physician spent most of his life inside our house hiding he was blind for gods sake no he wasnt david said forcefully his eyes were damaged but he could see when he wanted to mark looked away but didnt argue god knows his face looked bad but he didnt have to hide it when i was a kid i thought he did but he didnt people couldve gotten used to him to the scars mark closed his eyes but the image in his mind only grew clearer he saw a broken man lying on a sofa much of his face and neck mutilated by blistering poisons that had splashed over half his body and entered his lungs as a young boy mark had watched his mother press cotton pads against that mans eyes to soak up the tears that ran uncontrollably from the damaged membranes she would retreat to the kitchen to weep softly when she was sure his father slept mom never got used to them he said quietly youre right said david but it wasnt his face it was the scars inside she couldnt handle do you hear what im saying dad was a certified war hero he couldve walked tall anywhere in america but he didnt and do you know why doctor mcconnell because he brooded too goddamn much just like you he tried to carry the weight of the fucking world on his shoulders when i enlisted in the air corps he threatened to disown me and that was from his deathbed but long before that hed made you so scared and disgusted with the idea of war that he charted your whole life for you david wiped his brow look im not telling you what to do youre the genius in this family come on david goddamn it drop the phony bullshit i was eight years behind you in school and all the teachers still called me by your name okay im a flyer not a philosopher but i can tell you this when ikes invasion finally jumps off and our guys hit those french beaches its gonna be bad real bad guys younger than me are gonna be charging fortified machinegun nests concrete bunkers theyre gonna be dying like flies over there now youre telling me they might have to face this sarin stuff if youre the guy who can stop hitler from using it or invent a defense against it or at least give us the ability to hit back just as hard well youd have to do a lot of talking to convince those guys its right to do nothing at all theyd call you a traitor for that mark winced i know that but what you dont understand is that there is no defense the clothing required to protect a man from sarin is airtight and its heavy a soldier could fight in it for maybe an hour two at the most gis wont even wear their standard gas masks in combat now just because of a little discomfort they could never take a defended beach in full body suits so what are you saying were whipped lets lie down and wait until were all eating wiener schnitzel no look if sarin is a german gas hitler has yet to use it maybe he wont im saying i wont be the man that makes armageddon possible someone else can have that job david blinked his eyes several times trying to focus on his watch look he said i think im going to drive back up to deenethorpe tonight mark reached across the table and squeezed his brothers arm dont do that david i should never have brought this up its not that its just im so tired of the whole goddamn thing all the guys i knew that never came back from raids i stopped making friends two months ago mac it isnt worth it mark saw then that the bourbon had finally taken effect i think about you a lot you know david said softly when i feel those bombs drop out of shady ladys belly when the flaks hammering the walls i think at least my brother doesnt have to see this at least hes gonna make it back home he deserves it always trying to do the right thing to be the good son faithful to the wife now i find out youre dealing with this stuff david looked down as if trying to perceive something very small at the center of the table i try not to think about dad too much but you really are just like him in the good ways too i mean maybe youre right maybe he was right too i just dont want to think about it anymore tonight and if im here theres no way not to think about it i understand mark tipped the bartender as they left the pub an act that always brought a wry smile from a man unused to the custom david carefully tucked his nearlyempty bourbon bottle inside his leather jacket then paused on the corner of george street youll do the right thing in the end he said you always do but i dont want to hear another word about any forward surgical unit youre a real asshole sometimes you must be the only guy in this war trying to think of ways to get closer to the fighting instead of away from it except for officers mark said right david looked up the blacked out street then down at his captains bars hey im an officer you know mark punched him on the shoulder i wont tell anybody good now where did i park that goddamn jeep mark grinned and took the lead follow me captain twenty miles from the dreaming spires of oxford winston spencer churchill stood stiffly at a window smoking a cigar and peeking through a crack in his blackout curtains the three men seated behind him waited tensely watching the cigars blue smoke curl up toward the red cornice headlights churchill said a note of triumph in his voice he turned from the window his face wore its customary scowl of pugnacious concentration but these men knew him well they saw the excitement in his eyes brendan he said gruffly meet the car outside show the general directly to me brendan bracken churchills former private secretary man friday and now minister of information hurried to the main entrance of chequers one of the country estates that the prime minister used as a wartime hideaway churchill quietly regarded the two men left in the room sitting rigid by the low fire was brigadier general duff smith the fiftyyearold scotsmans empty left coat sleeve was pinned to his shoulder the arm that should have filled it was buried somewhere in belgium a personal friend of churchill smith now directed special operations executive the paramilitary espionage organization whose primary directive penned by churchill in was to set europe ablaze to brigadier smiths right stood f w lindemann now lord cherwell an oxford don and longtime confidante lindemann advised the prime minister on all scientific matters and monitored the work of a gaggle of geniuses gleaned mostly from oxford and cambridge who labored twenty hours a day to increase the allies technological advantages over the germans are we quite ready gentlemen churchill asked pointedly brigadier smith nodded as far as im concerned winston its an open and shut case of course theres no guarantee eisenhower will see it our way professor lindemann started to speak but churchill had already straightened at the sound of boots in the hallway brendan bracken opened the door to the study and general dwight d eisenhower strode in followed by commander harry c butcher his naval aide and friend of long standing sergeant mickey mckeogh eisenhowers driver and valet took up a post outside the door the last american to enter was a major of army intelligence he was not introduced greetings my dear general churchill said he moved forward and pumped eisenhowers hand with allamerican enthusiasm his red black and gold dressing gown contrasted strangely with the american generals simple olive drab uniform mr prime minister eisenhower replied its good to see you again though unexpected the two mens eyes met with unspoken communication last months conferences at cairo and teheran had not gone off without tensions between the two men with the invasion less than five months away churchill still had reservations about a crosschannel thrust into france preferring to attack germany through what he called the soft underbelly of europe eisenhower though he had just been named supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force was still adjusting to the mantle of power and had yet to assert his primacy in matters of strategy an uneventful trip up from london i hope churchill said eisenhower smiled the fog was so thick on chesterfield hill that butcher had to get out and walk ahead of the car with a flashlight but we made it as you can see he crossed the room and respectfully shook hands with brigadier smith whom hed known since everyone else was introduced excepting the american major of intelligence who remained silent and stiff as a suit of decorative armor beside the closed study door churchill rescued his dying cigar from an ashtray and walked over to his desk he did not sit this was the atmosphere he liked his parliamentary milieu him on his feet speaking to a captive audience sitting on its collective ass he picked up something small off the desk and rolled it in his palm it appeared to be a bit of ornamental glass gentlemen he began time is short and the matter at hand grave so ill be brief the nazis he pronounced the word narzis with a slur that managed to simultaneously convey both contempt and menace are up to their old tricks again and some new ones as well at the very moment when the tide seems to be turning irrevocably in our favor i daresay on the very cusp of invasion the hun has sunk to new depths of frightfulness he has apparently decided that no scientific abomination is too ghastly to use in his quest to stave off disaster though wellaccustomed by now to churchills flamboyant rhetoric eisenhower listened intently he had only just arrived from north africa via washington and any hint of new information about the european theater tantalized him churchill rolled the piece of glass in his hand before i proceed i feel i must restate that this meeting for official purposes never occurred no entries should be made in private diaries to record it i am even breaking my own inviolate rule no one will be asked to sign the guest book when they leave eisenhower could stand no more buildup what the devil are you talking about mr prime minister churchill held up the piece of glass hed been fidgeting with it was a tiny ampule gentlemen if i were to shatter this vial every manjack of us would be dead within a minute this was vintage churchill the dramatic prop the verbal bombshell what the hell is it eisenhower asked the prime minister bit down on his cigar and lowered his round head in a posture of challenge gas he said eisenhower squinted his eyes poison gas the prime minister nodded slowly deliberately then pulled the cigar from his mouth and not the kitchen stuff we choked on during the last war though god knows that was bad enough this is something entirely new something absolutely monstrous eisenhower noted that churchill had used the word we in reference to suffering poison gas attacks he wondered if this was a veiled allusion to the fact that he had not seen combat in the first world war having served those years training tank troops in pennsylvania if churchill was probing for a sore spot he had found it well he said curtly what kind of gas is it they call it sarin and its a bloody miracle weve even found out about it we can all thank duff smith for that churchill looked at the onearmed soe chief willing him to his feet brigadier duff smith a seasoned veteran of the cameron highlanders regiment stood with quiet confidence thirty days ago he said with a vestigial highland lilt we learned that our worst suspicions about the german chemical effort were accurate not only have they been pursuing weapons research at breakneck speed since before the war but theyve also been producing new gases and stockpiling them all over the country just a minute eisenhower broke in weve been doing the same thing havent we yes and no general our programs didnt really get cracking until we realized how much germany had accomplished between the wars and quite frankly weve never managed to catch up are we talking about nerve agents asked the american major of intelligence speaking for the first time weve known about tabun for some time something of quite another magnitude smith said a bit testily the clearest indication of danger is that the nazis have resumed testing these gases on human victims mostly at ssrun concentration camps in germany and poland these experiments have resulted in death for the exposed inmates in one hundred percent of the cases we believe the germans are setting up to deploy nerve gas against our invasion troops eisenhower cut his eyes at commander butcher did you say a hundred percent fatalities asked the army major due strictly to the gas one hundred percent smith confirmed thirty days ago the polish resistance managed to smuggle a sample of sarin out of a camp in northern germany two days later we delivered that sample to one of lindemanns chemical weapons specialists at oxford this time it was eisenhower who interrupted i thought the british chemical warfare complex was at porton down on salisbury plain in the main smith responded that is correct but we also have scientists working independently in other locations helps to keep everyone honest churchill broke in i think professor lindemann is better equipped to fill us in on the technical details prof the famous british scientist had been fussing with a battered pipe which stubbornly refused to light he made one last attempt and was surprised by success he puffed seriously for a few moments then looked at the americans and began to speak yes well in the great war youll remember chemical agents were classified by the germans under the crosssystem that is each gas cylinder or artillery shell was painted with a cross of a particular color depending on what type of gas it contained there were four colors green denoted the suffocating gases mainly chlorine and phosgene white for irritants or tear gases yellow cross indicated the blister gases primarily mustard blue was for the gases that blocked molecular respiration cyanide arsine carbon monoxide general eisenhower lit a second cigarette off his first and inhaled with great concentration eleven months ago lindemann continued just after the german surrender at stalingrad we learned of the existence of tabun tabun was interesting because it worked in an entirely different way than any previous gas by crippling the central nervous system yet because it was not significantly more lethal than phosgene we didnt overreact but we did realize that our own chemical weapons werent much further along than in and we moved to correct the imbalance sarin while it shares some characteristics of tabun is a completely different animal im a little fuzzy on my chemistry eisenhower said with disarming frankness what makes sarin so different lindemann knitted his eyebrows unlike most poison gases general sarin is absolutely lethal in the deadliest battlefield gas in the world was phosgene he paused to give his next statement the necessary emphasis sarin is thirty times as deadly as phosgene in sufficient concentration it can kill within seconds and it need not even enter the lungs it can pass directly through human skin jesus christ eisenhower had blanched how does this stuff work lindemann considered the american commander for some moments general every function of the human body both conscious and unconscious is controlled by the brain much as a general controls his troops the brain passes its orders down to the organs and the limbs by means of nerve branches the nerves are the couriers of the brain you might say when the brain sends a message down a nerve a compound called acetylcholine is produced now at this point the nerve has temporarily lost its conductivity the courier having delivered his message can no longer run the nerve can only be restored to its conductive state by an enzyme called cholinesterase without this enzyme the nerves of the body are nothing but dead tissue the couriers die where they lie and this gas said eisenhower sarin it destroys this enzyme this cholinesterase supplied the major of intelligence precisely said lindemann eisenhower pursed his lips exactly how much of this stuff would it take to kill a soldier lindemann answered with his pipe clenched between his teeth one thousandth of a raindrop a droplet so small most of us couldnt see it with the naked eye churchill noted the stricken look on eisenhowers face the meeting was going just as hed planned our people at porton have been working round the clock to copy sarin lindemann went on but im afraid they havent had much luck its devilish difficult to reproduce im afraid the germans are having all the luck just now churchill said dryly and theres worse to come prof yes general brigadier smith brings word of a still deadlier gas than sarin it is called soman we dont have a sample but ive seen a detailed report remember your lethality ratios phosgene was the deadliest gas in sarin is thirty times as deadly as phosgene and according to the reports soman is to sarin as sarin is to phosgene worse its persistent persistent eisenhower echoed the american major chose this moment to reassert himself general persistence was one of the primary gauges of gas effectiveness during world war one how long the gas stayed at ground level after it was released lindemann nodded we have reports that soman can remain stable for many hours even days clinging to whatever it comes into contact with a soldier exposed even several hours after a battle would still likely die and it would be a horrible death general i can assure you do we have any idea how much of this stuff the germans have stockpiled brigadier smith cleared his throat general our best estimate is upwards of five thousand tons ready for use the intelligence major was stunned enough to preempt his general did you say tons churchill nodded crisply conventional cylinders aircraft bombs artillery shells the lot eisenhower held out his right hand to churchill let me see that damned thing churchill tossed the sealed vial toward the sofa commander butcher and brendan bracken jumped but eisenhower caught the vial and held it up to a lamp i cant see anything he said just some condensation at the bottom thats because its invisible churchill said prof eh lindemann was fussing with his pipe again the delivery system aerosols vecteurs right general when the nazis overran belgium in they scoured the universities for technology that might further their weapons research im sorry to say that they came across the work of a rather talented chemist named dautrebande dautrebande had been experimenting with a new concept he called aerosols vecteurs in plain language hed found a way to reduce almost any substance refined to its smallest stable state charged particles in suspension refined to ninetyseven percent purity he intended to use this technology to disperse healing agents in sealed hospital rooms obviously the nazis have other uses in mind remember said churchill the paramount consideration in gas warfare is the element of surprise with dautrebandes system the nazis could saturate an entire battle area with soman before anyone even knew they were under attack and we have no idea how aerosols might affect current protective equipment it could render it totally obsolete eisenhower stood and began pacing the room all right you didnt invite me here to describe the problem what do you want to do about this churchill didnt hesitate i want the eighth air force and bomber command to begin hitting the german stockpiles immediately all known nerve gas factories should be added to the master target lists and given top priority good god murmured commander butcher whose former job had been a vice presidency at the columbia broadcasting system a direct hit could send clouds of lethal gas rolling across germany thousands of women and children might be killed from a propaganda standpoint alone if churchill interrupted our air forces in the course of bombing germanys industrial base happen to set free something we had no way of knowing was there i dont see how we could be blamed the ruthlessness of churchills suggestion silenced the americans eisenhower stopped pacing correct me if im wrong but up to this point the germans have not deployed poison gas on the battlefield not even against the russians true thats true churchill admitted though they are murdering captive jews with cyanide gas eisenhower ignored this therefore we must assume that hitler is restraining himself even in the face of terrible losses for the same reason that he has not used biological weapons because our intentional intelligence leaks to the germans let them know in no uncertain terms that we have the means to retaliate in kind churchill gave a conciliatory nod general in the case of biological weapons our leaks were quite truthful however in the area of chemical weapons youll find that we exaggerated a bit all in a good cause to be sure to buy ourselves time but with the invasion imminent our time has run out eisenhower turned to his intelligence major just what do we have in our chemical arsenal loads of phosgene the major said defensively were stockpiling sixty days worth of retaliatory gas for d day and new shipments of mustard are arriving all the time eisenhower frowned but nothing like sarin no sir nor soman the major shook his head not even close sir jesus h christ eisenhower looked around the room gentlemen i think it might be better if the prime minister and i continue this conversation alone brendan churchill said barely controlling the excitement in his voice you and duff give our american friends some tea and biscuits clemmie will show you where everything is and i believe the prof has a late appointment lindemann glanced suddenly at his watch good lord winston youre right the tall don gathered up his hat and coat and started for the door only at the last moment remembering that he was leaving the presence of the supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force he turned and tipped his hat to eisenhower godspeed general he said and was gone dwight d eisenhower furiously smoked a cigarette at the very window where churchill had awaited his arrival during the past forty minutes he had sat mostly in silence chainsmoking lucky strikes while the prime minister painted nightmare scenarios of the eleventhhour appearance of sarin and soman on the dday beaches finally eisenhower turned from the window frankly mr prime minister i dont know why you came to me with this you know i dont have direct control over the strategic bombing forces ive been fighting for that control for weeks and youve been resisting me are you changing your position seated in a wing chair several feet away churchill stuck out his lower lip as if pondering an unfamiliar question im sure we can come to some reasonable compromise general well until we do i couldnt make the decision to bomb those stockpiles even if i wanted to besides this is a political matter its a question for president roosevelt churchill sighed heavily general i spoke to franklin about this matter in cairo i had an early report about sarin but i dont believe he fully grasped the threat he seems to think the tide has turned sufficiently in our favor that no single german secret weapon could stop it the air marshals are making similar noises and they resent my meddling thats why i came to you as the man in charge of overlord i thought you couldnt fail to see the danger oh i see the danger all right thank god churchill spoke quickly the mind recoils rommel could bury canisters of soman weeks before our troops arrive then detonate them from a safe distance half a dozen planes spraying aerosolborne soman could stop your entire force on the sand d day would be a disaster eisenhower raised his hand why do you think hitler will deploy nerve gas on the invasion beaches if he didnt use it at stalingrad churchill answered with confidence because stalingrad however terrible a defeat was not the end he could still take the long view but hitler now faces the lodgement of an allied army on the continent if we breach his atlantic wall it means the end for him and he knows it also there is some question as to whether the germans had effective protective gear for their own troops at that time remember sarin and soman can pass through human skin one gust of wind blowing the wrong way could decimate a german battalion as easily as one of ours it happened often enough in the great war but given the stakes of the invasion will hitler hesitate to sacrifice his own men not for a moment i tell you that devil will stop at nothing eisenhower found churchills eyes in the gloom mr prime minister at this stage of the game weve got to see hitler straight we cant afford not to whatever do you mean i mean i know for a fact that in you planned to use poison gas on the germans if they reached the beaches of england churchill did not deny it so eisenhower plowed on lets stop pretending we have some special moral obligation to stop hitler from using gas under circumstances where we would probably do the same but that is precisely my point hitler will soon be in the very circumstances in which we would resort to gas ourselves can we afford to hope he will not eisenhower violently stubbed out his cigarette how the hell did we get into this mess i hate to say it general but it goes back to the noncompetition agreements signed by standard oil and i g farben in the s the arrangement was that standard would stay out of chemicals if farben stayed out of the oil business both companies held to that deal up to and even after the outbreak of war its the germans whove revolutionized commercial chemistry we have nothing to compare with the farben conglomerate what about french scientists churchill shook his head sadly hitler alone holds this card he picked up a pen and began doodling on a notepad may i speak with absolute frankness general i wish to god you would duff smith and i have a theory we think hitler hasnt used sarin yet for one simple reason he is afraid of gas he was temporarily blinded by mustard gas in the great war you know made quite a thing of it in mein kampf he may well have an exaggerated fear of our chemical abilities we believe the real danger isnt hitler at all but heinrich himmler sarin and soman are being tested at camps run by himmlers ss the sample of sarin came from a remote ss camp built solely for the purpose of manufacturing and testing nerve gases himmler also controls much of the nazi intelligence apparatus therefore he is the man most likely to know we possess no nerve gases of our own duff and i think himmlers plan is to perfect his nerve gases and protective clothing then present the whole show to hitler at the moment he most needs it to stave off our invasion at a single stroke himmler could save the reich and raise himself to an unassailable position as successor to the nazi throne eisenhower pointed a fresh cigarette at churchill now that mr prime minister is a motive that makes sense do you have proof of this duffs polish friends have a contact very close to the commandant of one of these camps this agent believes a tactical demonstration of soman a demonstration for the führer may be scheduled in a matter of weeks possibly even days i see mr prime minister let me digress a moment professor lindemann said your people are working around the clock to copy sarin i assume that is strictly for retaliatory purposes churchill took a deep breath not if you agree with me general i believe there is an option more desirable than bombing the german stockpiles im speaking of a demonstration raid if our scientists succeed in copying sarin i believe we should launch a limited attack with our gas as soon as possible only by doing this will we leave no doubt whatever in himmlers mind that he is wrong in his estimation of our capabilities and our resolve eisenhower looked at churchill with unveiled amazement the coldbloodedness of the british continually stunned him he cleared his throat but so far your scientists efforts to copy sarin have been unsuccessful correct churchill turned up his palms theyre dabbling with something called fluorophosphates but progress is slow eisenhower turned to the window and stared out over the snowswept english landscape in the dark it looked as quiet as a cemetery mr prime minister he said at length im afraid i cant support you on this neither the bombing nor the the demonstration raid hearing churchills soft groan eisenhower turned wait please hear me out i deeply respect your judgment you have been right many times when everyone else was wrong but things arent so clear cut as youre trying to make them seem if we bomb the german stockpiles and nerve gas plants we tip our hand to hitler we show him what we fear most also by bombing the stockpiles we indirectly use nerve gas on the german people thats practically the same as first use what would then stop hitler from using soman against our troops churchill hung on every word searching for a chink in the americans logic no eisenhower said firmly its absolutely out of the question president roosevelt would never authorize a gas attack and the american people wouldnt stand for it there are still thousands of veterans walking american streets who were terrorized by gas in the first war some scarred horribly we will retaliate if attacked ourselves the president has made that clear but first use never eisenhower steeled himself for the familiar roar of the british lion but rather than rise to his feet for a spirited argument churchill seemed to withdraw into himself what i will do eisenhower said quickly is push for full american cooperation in developing our own version of sarin that way if hitler does cross the line we can show our people that were giving as good as we get ill press eaker and harris for aerial surveys of the gas plants and stockpiles if hitler uses sarin well be ready to start bombing immediately how does that sound like were planning to shut the stable door after the horse has run away churchill mumbled eisenhower felt his notorious temper reaching the flashpoint but he managed to check it he would have to endure countless hours of negotiations very much like this one in the coming months and he had to keep relations civil mr prime minister ive heard tales of doomsday weapons on both sides since in the end this war will be won or lost with planes tanks and men sitting there in the great wing chair in his dragon dressing gown hands folded across his round belly winston churchill resembled nothing so much as a pale buddha resting on a velvet pillow his watery eyes peered out from beneath heavy lids general he said gravely you and i hold the fate of christendom in our hands i beg you to reconsider in that moment eisenhower felt the full weight of churchills indomitable will projected against him but his resolve held firm ill keep all this in mind he said but for now i must stand by what i said tonight the supreme commander rose and moved toward the study door as he reached for the knob something stopped him a brief intimation that perhaps he had won too easily he turned and fixed churchill in his gaze as im sure you will mr prime minister churchill smiled in resignation of course general of course when eisenhowers party had gone brigadier duff smith joined churchill in his private study a single lamp burned at the prime ministers desk the onearmed soe chief leaned forward the air seemed a bit chilly when ike collected his men he observed churchill laid both pudgy hands on his desk and sighed he refused duff no bombing of the stockpiles no demonstration raid if we develop our own gas bloody hell doesnt he realize what soman would do to his sodding invasion i dont think he does its the same old american song the same schoolboy naivete that naivete could still cost us the war eisenhower has never seen combat duff remember that i dont hold it against him but a man whos never been shot at much less gassed lacks a certain perspective bloody yanks smith fumed they either want to fight this war from six miles up in the air or by the marquess of queensbury rules steady old man theyve acquitted themselves quite handily in italy aye smith conceded but youve said it yourself a hundred times winston action this day churchill stuck out his lower lip and fixed the brigadier with a penetrating stare you never thought eisenhower would agree to the bombing did you the soe chiefs poker face slipped ever so slightly thats a fact winston i never did and of course you have a plan ive had thoughts no matter how desperate a pass weve come to ive never gone against the wishes of the americans the risks are enormous the threat is greater winston i believe that churchill paused you couldnt use any british personnel give me some credit old man churchill tapped his thick fingers on the desk what if it failed could you cover your tracks smith smiled bombers go off course all the time drop their loads in the strangest of places what would you need to start a submarine that can hold station in the baltic for four days thats easily enough done the admiralty is the one place where my word is law a squadron of mosquito bombers made available for one night thats quite another matter duff bomber command is the sharpest thorn in my side its an absolute necessity only way to cover up if we fail churchill raised both hands in a gesture of futility i hate going to harris hat in hand but i suppose i can suffer through it once smith drew in a breath he was about to ask for the nearimpossible id also need access to an airfield on the southern swedish coast for at least four days preferably longer churchill drew back in his chair his face impassive dealing with putatively neutral countries was a tricky business for sweden the price of aiding the allies could be fifty thousand uninvited guests from germany all wearing parachutes he aimed a stubby forefinger at smith can you pull this off duffy someone had better old man churchill studied his old friend for several moments weighing his past successes against his failures all right youll get your airfield in fact lets just save some time he took a fountain pen from his desk scrawled on a sheet of notepaper then handed the page across to smith the brigadiers eyes widened as he read to all soldiers of the allied expeditionary force brigadier duff smith chief of special operations executive is hereby authorized to requisition any and all aid he deems necessary to prosecute military operations inside occupied europe from january to february this applies to both regular and irregular forces all inquiries to no annexe winston s churchill good god smith exclaimed that wont buy as much as you think churchill said with a trace of irony see how far it gets you with sir arthur bloody harris of the air force smith deftly folded the note with his one hand and slipped it into his tunic you underestimate your influence winston give me one of these good for three months and ill bring you hitlers head in a basket churchill laughed heartily godspeed then youve got thirty days dont put your foot in it he extended his hand across the desk smith squeezed the plump hand then saluted smartly god save the king god bless america churchill said and keep her ignorant two days after dwight eisenhower politely warned churchill to leave the german gas stockpiles alone brigadier duff smith sat alone in the back row of a meeting room in one of the sandbagged defense buildings in whitehall at a long raised table in the front of the room waited two majors and a general of the british army smith cared nothing about them for the past fortyeight hours he had been trolling through the soe files at baker street searching for the man he needed to lead his mission into germany his luck had not been good the exclusion of british agents was the most frustrating restraint but he knew it was justified if british agents were captured on a strategic mission expressly forbidden by eisenhower the fragile angloamerican alliance could be shattered overnight soe had hundreds of foreign agents on file but few had the skills necessary to lead this mission the typical soe job inserting agents into occupied france had become so routine that some officers called it the french shuttle but sending men into germany itself was another matter the leader of this mission would have to be physically fit fluent in german unknown to the abwehr and the gestapo yet experienced enough to move undetected inside the tightly controlled reich on false papers most of all he needed to be coldblooded enough to kill innocent people in the accomplishment of his mission this last requirement had disqualified several likely candidates brigadier smith had stumbled upon todays lead quite by accident while lunching at his club hed overheard a discussion at a nearby table that tweaked his mental radar a staff officer was telling a story about a young german jew whod fled to palestine before the war and become a zionist guerrilla fighter apparently this young fellow had just blackmailed his way into a passage from haifa to london by promising to reveal guerilla techniques used by the haganah to terrorize the british occupation forces in palestine due to arrive today his solitary demand had been that he be granted an audience with the cinc of bomber command he supposedly had a plan for singlehandedly saving the jews of europe the terrorist would get an audience the officer joked but not quite the one he expected smith had listened long enough to learn the young jews name and the address of the meeting then driven to baker street and wired an old friend in jerusalem to see if there was a file on a mr jonas stern there was and the more smith learned the more intrigued hed become at twentyfive jonas stern had been twice decorated by the british army for his exploits guiding their forces in north africa yet he was wanted by the british military police for crimes against his majestys forces in palestine as a terrorist of the feared haganah he had less than five pounds to his name but carried a bounty of one thousand arab dinars on his head the responding officer added a postscript informing smith that jonas stern was the prime suspect in three separate murders though as yet no one had gathered sufficient evidence to try him smith turned at the sound of voices in the corridor behind him an armed guard entered first followed by a tall suntanned young man wearing shackles on his hands smith registered a lean angular face and piercing black eyes then jonas stern was past him and moving toward the officers who waited at the front of the room stern carried what appeared to be an oilclothwrapped package under one arm last through the door was a shorter man wearing the light khaki uniform and crimson sunburn of a british officer serving in the middle east smith followed the group up the aisle and took a seat at the side of the room where he could see more clearly the senior officer general john little addressed the sunburned englishman captain owen yes sir im terribly sorry were late wed have been here yesterday if it werent for the uboats general little looked down his nose at owen well youre here now lets begin is this the notorious mr stern yes sir er i wonder if it might be possible for me to remove his handcuffs now a floridfaced major seated to the generals right said not just yet captain he is a wanted fugitive after all duff smith focused on the man who had spoken a staff intelligence major of rather modest achievements i am major dickson the man went on youve got a lot of cheek coming into this building in case you dont know youre the leading suspect in a rash of arab housebombings around jerusalem thefts of british lendlease arms not to mention the murder of a british military policeman in jerusalem in the only reason we agreed to see you is that you saved captain owens life at tobruk you probably dont know but captain owens father had quite a distinguished career in the welsh guards jonas stern said nothing captain owen tells us youve got some daring plan for singlehandedly winning the war in europe is that right no its a bloody good thing dickson snapped i should think monty can handle the invasion without any help from the likes of you hear hear chimed the other major who was seated on general littles left stern took a deep breath id like to state for the record that the officers that i requested be here are not present major dicksons face went completely scarlet if you think air chief marshal sir arthur harris has nothing better to do than listen to the ranting of a bloody zionist terrorist clive general little interrupted mr stern we have gathered here at some considerable inconvenience to hear what you have to say you would do well to get on with it brigadier smith watched the young jew try awkwardly to slide the package that was under his arm into his cuffed hands bloody waste of time muttered major dickson mr stern general little said with seemingly paternal concern do you mind my asking if moshe shertok or chaim weizmann know you are in london they dont i thought not you see mr stern there are proper channels for pursuing matters relating to european jews his majestys government generously maintains excellent relations with the jewish agency here in london messrs weizmann and shertok are the men you should be seeing about this matter and i think you will find having done so that they are doing all in their power to help the european jewry general little waited what he considered to be a suitable time for his wisdom to be assimilated then said have i put your mind at rest mr stern youve done nothing of the kind stern replied he took a step closer to the table im well aware of the efforts of shertok weizmann and the jewish agency they have the best of intentions im sure but i have not come here to plead for palestinian entry certificates for trapped jews or to ask you to declare them protected british persons or to beg you to buy their freedom with war materiel i dont believe any of that will be done general i have come here to speak to you to military men about a purely military solution duff smith pricked up his ears as the tall young man gathered himself to deliver his appeal smith noted a certain selfpossession a centeredness that was remarkable in one so young it was the mark of the natural soldier or agent stern gestured with the package in his shackled hands the depositions in this file contain eyewitness accounts of a program of mass extermination being carried out by the nazis at four concentration camps in germany and occupied poland i have precise tallies of the dead and detailed descriptions of the killing methods employed by the nazis from mass shootings and electrocutions to the most widely practiced method death by poison gas and subsequent cremation of the corpses general little glanced uncomfortably at major dickson may i see those reports mr stern stern took a step forward but little raised his hand please do not approach the table he said coolly sergeant gilchrist a military policeman took the folder and carried it to the general little opened it and briefly scanned the papers inside mr stern he said do you have any evidence that this information is accurate other than the testimony of other jews i mean general reports of jewish deaths in the hundreds of thousands have appeared in the london times and manchester guardian sometimes quoting the exact names and locations of death camps i believe one such story even appeared in the new york times what i do not understand is why the allies still refuse to do anything about them general little brushed the edge of his neat gray mustache with his left forefinger i believe he said with cold precision that you have accomplished what you set out to do here i can assure you that these reports will be given all the attention they deserve jonas stern snorted in contempt general i have not begun to accomplish what i came here to do ive given you those reports merely to justify the desperate action i am about to ask you to undertake on behalf of the jewish people ive had about all i can stand from this whelp major dickson said lets stop this charade just a moment clive said the officer on general littles left a guards major lets hear him out i suspect hes a member of the bomb the railways school thats it isnt it mr stern you want the raf to bomb the railways leading to the concentration camps no major ah then you must be one of the advocates for forming a jewish brigade to take part in the invasion i should have known you saw some action in north africa didnt you that is not why ive come general little slapped his palm down on sterns file then why the devil have you come put an end to the bloody suspense will you general little stern said i understand politics i know that a jewish brigade would contain the seeds of a jewish army which could return to palestine after the war and fight the british and the arabs i do not ask for that i know its been suggested that the polish resistance try to destroy the nazi gas chambers but the poles are too weak to do this and even if they werent they would not risk their lives to save jews too bloody right major dickson muttered stern ignored him i do have a certain amount of military experience and i realize that bombing the railways leading to the camps is impractical rail tracks are relatively easy to repair and the nazis could always substitute trucks for rolling stock brigadier smith could see that the young mans realistic assessments had gotten the attention of general little and the guards officer if not major dickson general stern concluded my request is simple i am asking you for four heavybomber sorties over germany and poland i have the names and exact locations of four concentration camps at which jews are being gassed and shot to death at a conservatively estimated rate of over five thousand per day thats five thousand per day in each camp in the name of humanity in the name of god i ask that those four charnel houses be wiped from the face of the earth the silence in the room was total major dickson sat up and stared wideeyed at stern after the initial shock dissipated general little cleared his throat do you mean mr stern that you want these camps bombed with the jewish prisoners inside them that is exactly what i mean general duff smith felt a thrill of satisfaction hes mad said major dickson absolutely barking im quite sane major stern said and quite serious and i am quite sure general little said that messrs shertok and weizmann in all their desperate pleadings have suggested nothing so drastic as this you claim to speak for the jewish people in asking for this madness stern spoke calmly and clearly general weizmann and shertok are political men distant from the truth of what is happening in europe the idea of bombing the camps was first suggested by members of the jewish underground in poland and germany i have talked to some who escaped general i have looked into the eyes of women who had their infants snatched away by the heels and crushed against walls by ss officers i have listened to fathers who watched their sons bayoneted as they stood weeping not a meter away thats enough little said sharply i dont need a lecture on the horrors of war from you but these people are not at war general they are civilian noncombatants innocent women and children general little gazed down at the papers stern had brought then looked up and began speaking in a soft voice lad i cant help but admire the courage it takes to make a request like that but your request simply cannot be considered seriously not even from a purely military standpoint our bombers dont have the range to reach these camps their fighter escorts cant fly that far thats no longer true general stern interrupted the new american p mustangs have a range of miles that puts the camps within striking distance from italy youre surprisingly well informed little rejoined but even so theres the question of diverting military resources for nonmilitary missions but those jews are being used as slave labor for the war industries little raised his hand the sole objective of the allied air forces is to wipe out the warmaking capacity of the reich that means oil production ballbearing plants synthetic rubber not civilian detention camps if we were to bomb these camps our raids would give hitler the perfect opportunity to claim that we killed all the jews who have died in captivity and there remains the issue of our acting specifically for jewish civilians if we redress the grievances of the jews by reprisal bombings every other wronged group will line up for the same service and dont forget major dickson added these jews are legally german citizens hitler has said from the beginning that the jewish question is an internal german problem and he is technically right general little frowned at dickson what we cannot ignore is the fact that the nazis have close to a million allied prisoners in their hands forty thousand british taken at dunkirk alone we have relatively few german prisoners we cant afford to start playing the reprisal game especially with prison camps hitler could resort to even more unpleasantness than he has already unpleasantness look here stern little went on captain owen wrote to me about your father being trapped in germany thats a hard thing i know weve all lost loved ones in this war but thats the nature of the game i lost a brother in france in bloody senseless a british girls school could have put up more of a fight than the frogs did but in times like these duff smith nearly groaned aloud here was the fatuous patronizing englishman at his worst i lost a relative so why should you raise a wind about yours much less a million of them eh so hard to get ones mind round numbers of that size what it seems to me little said examining a page from sterns file that these numbers are exaggerated in all honesty ive found that to be a jewish trait dont blame you at all really best way to get attention in a crowd two million jews murdered why in the bloodiest battle of the great war only six hundred thousand lives were lost lets be rational stern lets face facts its my guess someones fiddled these figures with the best of intentions perhaps but fiddled them just the same someone with political motives as you said before brigadier smith saw the young mans shoulders sag as he began to absorb the futility of his mission i dont know why i expected you to believe what is happening he said most jews in palestine dont even believe it general little motioned for a sergeant to escort stern out but let me say this stern cried as the british soldier took his arm my father is somewhere inside germany at this very moment alive or dead i dont know but if he is alive he would beg you to do exactly as i have asked general to refuse to bomb these death camps on the grounds that it would kill innocent prisoners is merely misplaced sentiment destroying the gas chambers and crematoria is the only way to slow down hitlers extermination program by killing a few thousand innocents you could save millions isnt that the most fundamental idea of warfare sacrificing the few for the many duff smith clenched his hands sterns words had electrified him general little looked hard at the young zionist youve made an eloquent case mr stern this board will take your comments under advisement sergeant gilchrist stern stared at the general with alarm could i have one more moment general major dickson groaned in exasperation be quick little said if you wont bomb the camps will you allow me to take a small commando force into poland and attempt to liberate one concentration camp i know the british army is training a few jews to parachute into hungary to try to warn the jews there to resist general im not asking you to risk a single british life if i fail what would you have lost a dozen jews im an experienced guerrilla fighter ill bloody bet you are major dickson bellowed with sudden savagery experienced at murdering british soldiers the redfaced major was on his feet stern made no move toward or away from him instead he raised his cuffed hands to the zipper of his jacket and pulled it down from the left breast of his khaki shirt flashed the glint of silver and blue it was the george medal the secondhighest british decoration that could be awarded to a civilian major dickson said stern this medal was pinned on me by general bernard law montgomery for reconnaissance actions at el alamein the second award i received for aiding the british army at tobruk auchinleck pinned that one on both those officers are better men than you and if you had any brains or heart whatever you might have understood at least part of what ive said here today ive stood here as a soldier asking only for the chance to fight to show hitler something he has never seen something he needs to see a jew who can fight who will fight myself and twenty haganah guerrillas properly equipped could destroy a concentration camp i am sure of it now weve got to it dickson roared the bloody haganah duff smith felt like boxing dicksons ears for him thankfully general little waved the major down such a raid is out of the question mr stern for more reasons than i can name take a bit of advice the best thing you can do is go back to palestine and help your own people my people are dying in germany stern said yes well there are a lot of people dying all over the world just now duff smith watched the shackled hands rise up and point accusingly at little general stern said in a voice booming with prophetic power one day soon the world is going to ask england a very embarrassing question why did you refuse to grant sanctuary to the jews who were being slaughtered by the millions in europe why did you throw the lucky handful who managed to reach palestine into british concentration camps and most of all enough shouted little his cultivated british reserve had finally cracked you dare march in here and preach to us you insubordinate upstart youre not a soldier youre a bloody terrorist it takes a lot more than a gun to make a soldier stern why if it werent for us standing alone against hitler in your people would have been wiped out years ago major dickson pointed at stern the only reason you were allowed to come to england was to answer our questions about terrorism in palestine dicksons eyes glowed with a cruel light and im happy to say that as a major of intelligence your interrogation will fall to me stern flexed his fists in rage and frustration duff smith saw captain owen edging closer in case his friends selfrestraint snapped general little gathered up the papers from sterns file and dropped them into a satchel at his feet place him under arrest sergeant gilchrist he said calmly captain owen shouted wait but he was too late as the sergeant approached stern swung his cuffed hands straight up from his waist with animal quickness gilchrist was grabbing for his truncheon when the steel cuffs caught him on the point of the chin he hit the floor with the deadened thud of an unconscious boxer major dickson groped for his sidearm then remembered he had left it with an aide for cleaning stop this nonsense cried general little jonas peter owen yelled for gods sake but it was all for naught as the second guard charged stern swept up gilchrists truncheon from the floor and jabbed him in the belly then spun to the wall beside the door as the man went down almost on cue a sentry burst into the room with his revolver drawn sterns stolen truncheon crashed down snapping the mans wrist and sending the pistol clattering to the floor stern lunged for the door but the sentry caught him by the collar with his good hand and jerked backward there was a sound of ripping cloth sterns jacket came off and his khaki shirt fell around his waist he whirled bloody hell gasped the guard look at that the sight of sterns exposed torso stunned even brigadier smith the young zionists back shoulders and abdomen were transected by a netting of livid purple scars some made by blades others obviously by fire the scars on the abdomen ran straight down past the waistband of his trousers the moment of stillness lasted several seconds then stern knocked down the sentry snatched up his shirt and bolted through the door after him major dickson screamed as footsteps pounded down the stairwell captain owen threw himself in front of the door general little please let me talk to him out of the way major dickson growled or ill order my men to shoot you down for gods sake general attention general little roared the guards froze where they stood duff smith had remained motionless throughout the confusion as if watching a staged musical steady dickson general little said im going to let captain owen bring him back theres no sense in unnecessary bloodshed you can question stern at your leisure after youve calmed down sounds like a good plan johnny duff smith said speaking for the first time major dickson stood whitefaced and shaking im going to throw that bastard in irons and sweat him until he diagrams the haganahs whole batting order hes one of the ringleaders you can just tell hes only twentythree sir owen said but youre probably right about him being a leader id hate to see that chap chained to a wall said general little hes got guts even if he is a yid interrogating him would be useless anyway owen said in a monotone whys that asked dickson major jonas stern could probably tell you every key man in the haganahs ranks probably in the irgun too but he wouldnt tell you hed die first a lot of men say that dickson said in the beginning that attitude doesnt last long owen shook his head sterns different dickson smirked hows that didnt you see the scars hes been there before tortured i mean and nothing like our methods believe me he was running from a raid near al sabah one night when his horse broke its leg he was only seventeen the arabs were hot behind the raiding party they ran him down almost immediately what the hell did they do to him asked general little im not sure sir he doesnt talk about it they only had him for a night and a day but they were real tribesmen the ones that got him murderous brutes stern somehow managed to escape on the second night he never told them a thing i heard some of his mates whispering about it during the north african campaign hes a legend to the zionists i never saw him with his shirt off before today good god little muttered i saw the results of some arab interrogations in the great war near gallipoli its a miracle the fellow survived like i said sir not much use in questioning him to my mind he wont talk unless he wants to i see what you mean little agreed well sort out this mess tomorrow youve got four hours to bring him in of his own volition owen after that major dicksons men will have a free hand ill find him sir little nodded thats all captain thank you sir the welshman darted through the door brigadier duff smith rose slowly nodded to little and followed owen outside jonas stern stood alone in a coaldark doorway his shivering body pressed against cold stone and watched the broad avenue of whitehall he had nowhere to run he had come so far to get here all the way from germany at age fourteen with his mother in tow and his father left behind thousands of miles overland in a refugee caravan where smugglers robbed them of all they had before taking them farther down the illegal route to palestine weeks in a battered freighter that bled salt water through its rusting hull while people belowdecks died of thirst years of struggle in palestine fighting the arabs and the british then in north africa fighting the nazis then finally from palestine to london to the room with the british staff officers with their trimmed mustaches and haughty blue eyes major dickson had at least told the truth the only reason theyd let him come at all was to interrogate him about the haganah stern tensed at the sound of running feet peering around the brickwork he breathed a sigh of relief the feet belonged to peter owen and the welshman was alone stern reached out and caught him by the jacket jonas cried owen stern let go of the jacket the young welshman rolled his shoulders angrily what the hell was that back there you tell me peter are major dicksons men after me they will be if you dont turn yourself in within four hours owen struggled to light a cigarette in the frigid wind stern finally did it for him thanks old man he said christ ill take the desert over this any time those smug bastards stern muttered i told you you were being unrealistic its a matter of scale as much as anything compared to the amphibious landing of a million men in occupied europe a few thousand civilians particularly jews dont garner much attention in military circles stern held up his cuffed hands get these off peter a pained look crossed owens face dickson will have me up on charges peter oh hell owen fumbled in his pocket and brought out a key stern snatched it away and began walking toward trafalgar square the opened handcuffs tinkled on the cement like change thrown to a street urchin he put the key in his pocket and kept walking with blackout regulations still in force the stars over london shone like distant spotlights illuminating a sign advertising bombshelter space in the charing cross tube station youve got to turn yourself in jonas owen said struggling to stay abreast of him youve no alternative stern noticed that he had begun leaning into the wind with his head turned slightly away as he walked he hadnt walked with that gait since his childhood in northern germany some habits never died owen grabbed his sleeve and stopped him in the road jonas i wont blame you for anything you do at this point but i cant be responsible for you either no matter what happens now i consider the tobruk debt paid stern stared at the young welshman with eyes that said many things but he did not speak i said tobruk is wiped clean owen repeated but the tone of his voice was uncertain sure peter stern started to add something but his words were drowned by the sudden growl of an engine a long silver bentley floated over to the curb and stopped beside the two men engine running stern shoved owen against the passenger door and began to run he heard the welshmans voice calling him back he turned owen had snapped to attention beside the bentley focusing on the cars interior stern saw only a driver and a single passenger he walked cautiously back someone had rolled down the rear window framed in its dark square stern saw a weathered face lit by bright eyes and the shoulder boards of a brigadier general recognize me asked a deep voice with a scottish accent stern stared at the face you were at the meeting im brigadier duff smith mr stern id like to have a word with you stern looked at peter owen silently asking if this could be a trap the welshman shrugged brigadier smith held up a silver flask have a dram beastly cold out stern did not accept the flask as he stared at brigadier duff smith he felt a sudden certainty that he should run like hell get clear of this man and all his works almost before he knew what he was doing he was walking away from the bentley the car kept pace coasting along beside him come on lad smith called wheres the harm in a little chat what kind of chat a chat about killing germans im german stern said still marching into the wind he glanced up at the dark face of admiralty house according to major dickson anyway nazis i should have said i killed plenty of nazis in north africa thats not what im after smiths reply was barely audible above the rumble of the bentleys motor but it stopped stern in his tracks im talking about killing nazis inside germany the bentley rolled to a standstill beside stern the brigadiers eyes glinted with black humor that sound like your line of country lad the bentleys driver got out and opened the rear door opposite smith but stern still hesitated you speak good english smith said to fill the silence dont take it as flattery know your enemy thats my motto stern pointed at the brigadier can you get major dickson off my back my dear fellow smith said expansively i can make you disappear off the face of the earth if i so choose stern was vaguely aware of peter owen shouting something as he climbed into the bentley but all he remembered was brigadier smiths final exchange with the welshman before he rolled up the rear window owen was protesting that general little wanted stern in custody and that major dickson would be hunting him with a vengeance if he was not smith did not seem at all perturbed he said something to owen in a language stern would later learn was welsh the gist of the translation was you dont have a problem laddie you never found him you never saw me and thats the end of the story find yourself a pub and stop worrying nobody ever found anything duff smith hid and nobody ever will during the next two hours as the bentley rolled through the bleak winter streets of the blackedout city stern learned more about the reality of the coming european war than he had dreamed in his most cynical fits of depression in the beginning he pressed the brigadier about the mission hed hinted at but the scotsman had his own way of coming to the meat of things the first thing he did was deflate any hopes stern had of the allies saving the jews still trapped in europe several phrases would come back to stern much later and he would marvel at how frankly smith had laid it all out dont you see man smith had said if we offer sanctuary to the jews still alive in europe hitler might say yes and the truth is we dont want them neither do the americans you jews are a highly educated race consequently you take away jobs faster than any other immigrant group there are military reasons as well little wasnt joking in there the nazis already laid down the law to the red cross touch the concentration camps and we will no longer keep the geneva convention regarding military pows thats no empty threat the bentley rolled past the royal hospital youre ahead of your time stern though not by much ill wager it wont be long before chaim weizmann goes to churchill with the same request you made this afternoon bomb the camps but it wont make any difference bomber command is practically a law unto itself there are a hundred ways to bury a request like that in committees and feasibility studies youd lost the battle before you even went in there today to men like little youre nothing but a meddling civilian thats enough reason to deny your request no matter how much sense it might make smith chuckled i dont know what you thought you were playing at the bloody archbishop of canterbury lobbied for sanctuary in england for european jews and he failed and you a wanted terrorist i had to try stern said if you knew the sheer numbers of innocent people dying you would numbers arent the half of it duff smith shook his head ive seen eyewitness transcripts myself polish girls raped and tortured and thrown into the street with blood streaming from their bodies entire families stripped naked and made to stand on metal plates to be electrocuted jewish women being sterilized and sent to military brothels children wrenched from their mothers teats the whole hellish circus what you dont understand is that none of that matters war is supposed to be hell stern that kind of thing has lost its shock value especially to soldiers like little who watched their friends slaughtered by the thousands in the great war to men like that civilian deaths are regrettable but irrelevant they have no direct relation to the prosecution or outcome of the war you cant all be like little stern said i cant conceive of that youre right there are a lot more like major dickson the brigadier paused to pack and light a handcarved pipe there must be some decent men in england of course there are lad said smith puffing gently churchill is one of your strongest advocates hes all for establishing a jewish national home in palestine after the war not that that means anything those bastards in parliament will drop winston like a hot brick just as soon as hes won the war for them after convincing stern of the utter futility of his journey to england duff smith finally got around to his proposition what i said back there he drawled about killing germans inside germany i wasnt joking what do you have in mind stern asked suspiciously smiths face grew very hard very quickly im not going to lie to you lad im not trying to save the pathetic remnants of european jewry frankly its not my bailiwick what are you trying to do smiths eyes flickered not much except alter the course of the war stern sat back against the plush seat brigadier who are you who do you work for ah officially were known as soe special operations executive we raise mischief in the occupied countries france mostly sabotage and the like but with the invasion round the corner thats rather tapered off were mostly dropping supplies now how can you alter the course of the war smith gave him an enigmatic grin know anything about chemical warfare hold your breath and put on your gas mask thats all well your former countrymen know quite a bit the nazis i mean i know theyre using poison gas to murder jews brigadier smith waved his pipe in scorn zyklon b is a common insecticide oh its deadly enough in a closed room but its nothing compared to what im talking about in two minutes smith gave stern a thumbnail sketch of the nazi nerve gas program including heinrich himmlers private patronage he leaned heavily on two points allied helplessness in the face of sarin and the nazis predilection for testing their war gases on jewish prisoners weve pinpointed parts of their testing program to three prison camps smith concluded natzweiler in alsace sachsenhausen near berlin and totenhausen near rostock rostock stern exclaimed i was born in rostock smith raised his eyebrows were you now what is it you want to do disable one of these plants a commando raid no ive something a little more complex in mind something with a little flair the brigadier cracked his knuckles beginning with his left little finger what i want to do is frighten the nazis so badly that they wont dare to use their nerve gas not even when the reich is falling down around their ears how can you do that i neglected to tell you one fact about the allied gas program stern after intensive analysis of the stolen sample of sarin a team of british chemists has managed to produce a facsimile nerve agent stern breathed faster how much do you have onepointsix metric tons is that a lot smith sighed frankly no how much do the nazis have our best estimate is five thousand tons stern went pale five thousand my god how much would it take to seriously damage a city two hundred fifty tons of sarin could wipe out the city of paris stern turned away from brigadier smith and pressed his cheek to the cold car window his head was starting to throb and you have one metric ton onepointsix how wonderful for you what do you plan to do with it brigadier smiths voice cut the air like a rusty saber i plan to kill every man woman child and dog inside one of those three camps ss men prisoners the lot and im going to let heinrich himmler know exactly who did it stern wasnt sure he had heard correctly he took a moment to try and digest the enormity of what he thought the brigadier had suggested why in gods name are you going to do that its a bluff a gamble perhaps the biggest gamble of the war im going to use our thimbleful of gas to try to convince heinrich himmler that we not only have our own nerve gas but the will to use it when he finds one of his precious camps wiped out to the last man yet with every piece of german equipment in pristine condition he will have no choice but to reach the conclusion i want him to reach that if the nazis were to deploy nerve gas against our invasion force their cities would be annihilated by the same weapon but how do you know hitler wont retaliate with his superior stockpiles i dont but if im right about himmler running the nerve gas program on his own hitler will never even find out about our raid himmler will sweep the whole thing under the rug even if hitler were to find out he wouldnt have any evidence to hold up to the world as an excuse for a retaliatory strike not the way ive planned this show youre mad said stern hitler doesnt need to justify his actions to anyone youre wrong smith said confidently hitler doesnt hesitate to massacre jews but he does try his best to cover up the fact that hes doing it he cares about public opinion always has stern felt a sudden apprehension brigadier this is a strategic mission why have you come to me because my hands are tied by some regrettable political considerations such as the yanks are against it smith grunted bloody schoolboys theyre content to fight with sticks and pebbles and hope no one gets angry enough to go home for his fathers shotgun american opposition rules out my using british or american commandos for the operation what about your soe operatives the americans have elbowed their way in there as well theyve demanded that we set up twoman parachute teams one yank one of ours to go into france and prepare the resistance for d day its pathetic i havent met one yank who can speak enough french to order boeuf bourguignonne much less fool a german so youre scraping the bottom of the barrel refugees smith grinned bloody terrorists at that do you have the authority to undertake this operation brigadier general isnt exactly supreme commander duff smith reached into the pocket of his beribboned tunic and pulled out an envelope from it he withdrew churchills note which he handed to stern stern didnt blink once while he read it satisfied smith asked mein gott stern whispered i want you to lead this mission are you my man or not stern nodded in the darkness yes smith reached into his jacket and pulled out a map of europe swastikas covered the paper from poland to the french coast stern felt his pulse speeding at the prospect of action doesnt look like weve accomplished much in five years does it smith said look here there is one thing you can help me with tonight you may already have done it what picked the target i mentioned three camps to be honest ive already narrowed my list to two sachsenhausen is simply too large for the type of operation i have in mind its natzweiler or totenhausen stern looked greedily at the map he knew which camp he wanted to attack still he didnt want to seem too eager natzweiler is the larger by far smith said the ss are almost certainly killing more jews there a larger camp would be easier for me to slip into unnoticed stern pointed out you wont be infiltrating the camp not the way ive designed this show well stern said in a neutral tone since you have only a limited amount of gas you could increase your chances of success by targeting the smallest camp quite smith agreed how far is totenhausen from rostock twenty miles due east its on the recknitz river stern could not keep the excitement out of his voice brigadier i know that area my father and i used to hike the wilderness all around rostock i used to follow the wandervögel around when i was a boy smith studied the map totenhausen is practically on the baltic coast much closer to sweden than natzweiler is that would simplify both infiltration and escape brigadier its got to be totenhausen im afraid i cant make the final decision tonight the scotsman rolled up the map but i can tell you this totenhausen was designed solely to test and manufacture sarin and soman from a political standpoint its the perfect target stern tried to control his impatience what do i do now where do i go some of my people will look after you smith leaned forward and opened a window in the partition separating them from the bentleys driver norgeby house he said then closed the window and turned to stern there is more to this mission than killing people there are other objectives which are extremely important after the ss garrison is destroyed just a minute stern interrupted you said we had to kill the prisoners yes im afraid theres no way around it we cant jeopardize the mission by trying to warn them even if we did warn them theres no way to get them out of the camp much less out of germany stern nodded slowly are they all jews god man its an odd time to get squeamish didnt you just propose bombing four concentration camps with no warning at all stern felt a strange hesitancy he had just proposed that but somehow this was different bombing the death camps would have been an unmistakable assertion of allied support for jews and a potentially crippling blow to the nazi extermination system brigadier smiths plan also meant sacrificing jews but without any direct benefit to the jewish people or was there if eisenhowers invasion stalled on the beaches of france hitler would almost certainly have time to complete the genocide he had begun eleven years ago stern cleared his throat you mentioned other objectives brigadier smith was watching him carefully right after the garrison is neutralized youll move into the gas factory first and foremost we need a sample of soman their newest and most toxic gas second we need photographs of the production apparatus nerve agents are extremely difficult to mass produce a lot could be learned by studying photos of the german equipment brigadier im no scientist stern objected i can operate a camera but i wouldnt know a poison gas factory from a herring cannery dont worry about that your job is neutralizing the camp someone else will give you technical directions regarding the gas who an american hes the foremost expert on poison gases outside nazi germany not only that he speaks fluent german i thought you said the americans were against this mission they are but this mans a civilian perfect for the job sterns eyes narrowed you sound like youre trying to sell him to me im afraid hes the one well have to sell on this operation he happens to be a pacifist a pacifist i dont want him youll take him though smith said harshly youll do whatever i bloody tell you to do and the first thing youre going to do is help me sell him on this mission lay on the sob stuff about the plight of the jews moral duty all that rot sterns voice communicated his disgust you want me to help you convince a pacifist to murder defenseless prisoners a wicked smile touched the corners of brigadier smiths mouth nobody needs to say anything about killing anybody this is a sales job and the first rule of sales is know your mark in this case that advice can be taken quite literally what do you mean who is this person brigadier smith leaned back against the seat and closed his eyes mark mcconnell md and i can tell you right now stern youre going to hate him two hours later in a forest deep in northern germany a black volkswagen skidded to a stop beneath a thick stand of fir trees two figures one male one female climbed out and hurried into the wood the woman wore a heavy wool coat over a white nurses uniform and a fur hat over her blond hair the man wore a ragged buttonless jacket to cover his gray shirt which was lined with prison stripes the man stopped at the edge of a clearing and stood guard the woman moved forward and called out a few words in polish two men materialized out of the trees and stepped into the moonlight one was huge almost a giant with a thick black beard he carried a sten submachine gun in one hand and wore a meat cleaver on his belt the young man beside him weighed only half what his comrade did and carried only a suitcase with his long thin arms and delicate fingers he looked like a refugee from a paupers symphony youre late anna said the giant we already took down the antenna then put it back up she said we almost didnt get here at all the giant grinned then said something to his comrade in polish the thin man opened up the suitcase and pulled out a coil of wire the giant tied one end to his belt and scrambled up the nearest fir tree the woman called anna took a small notebook from her coat and knelt on the ground beside the suitcase the simplicity of the concept fascinated her transmitter receiver battery antenna all in one battered leather suitcase this wireless set had been handbuilt by polish partisans but it worked almost as well as the factorymade german set where she worked she patted the young man on the arm while he dialed in a frequency do you think were too late miklos she asked he looked up at her with hollow eyes and smiled my brother likes to tease you anna london is always waiting he took a codebook from his pocket opened it then looked up toward the dark branches ready stan fire away called the giant just keep it short miklos rubbed his hands together for warmth then did a musical dexterity exercise to limber his fingers the blond woman opened her notebook to a marked page and handed it to him this is it miklos asked scanning the nearly blank sheet can it be worth all this trouble anna shrugged thats what they asked for sixty miles from london on the site of a former roman encampment stood a horrid victorian pile known as bletchley park since the beginning of the war the mansion had served as the nerve center of britains covert battle against the nazis radio aerials sheltered in the trees gathered hurried transmissions from across occupied europe then routed them to former ships radio operators on duty inside the mansion who finally passed the decoded signals to the synod of dons and scholars responsible for piecing together a picture of what was happening in the darkness that lay across the continent tonight brigadier duff smith had driven his bentley at alarming speeds to reach bletchley he could have phoned but he wanted to be there when or if the message he awaited came in smith had stood at the shoulder of a young rating from newcastle for an hour watching a silent radio receiver until nervous tension got the better of him he was about to give up and drive back to london when a staccato of morse dots and dashes filled the tiny room thats him sir said the rating with controlled excitement plato i dont even need to hear his identifying group i know his fist like ellingtons piano brigadier smith watched the young man copy down the groups as they came through they came in three short sets when the radio fell silent the rating looked up with a puzzled expression thats it sir i wont know until you decode it how long were they on the air clapham id say about fiftyfive seconds sir plays that morse key like a musician plato does a bloody artist smith looked at his watch i make it fiftyeight seconds good show the poles are the best at this game bar none decode that lot right now right sir one minute later the rating tore off a sheet of notepaper and handed it to the soe chief smith read what he had written wrapped steel winch cable due to copper shortage diameter cm ten pylons meters slope degrees wires live dead brigadier smith laid the notepaper on a table and pulled a different sheet from his pocket he consulted some figures that had been scrawled there earlier in the week by a brilliant british engineer the rating saw the brigadiers hand stiffen then crumple the sheet of paper in his hand by god it could work smith said softly that woman is gold in the bank it could work he carefully placed both pieces of paper in the inside pocket of his jacket then took his cap from the table good work clapham smith laid a hand on the ratings shoulder and said from now on all transmissions from source plato will be passed under the name scarlett scarlett with two ts as in gone with the wind sir right noted the young rating grinned nice to know the jerries are short of a few things too eh duff smith paused at the door and looked back thoughtfully theyll never know what that missing copper cost them clapham it was late afternoon in london when brigadier smiths silver bentley rolled onto the a and headed for oxford smith was driving himself today making use of an ingenious shift mechanism designed for him by soe engineers jonas stern sat beside him studying a topographic map of mecklenburg the northernmost province of germany i remember it all he said excitedly every road every brook brigadier the target has to be totenhausen be patient lad i dont see the concentration camp marked here i told you totenhausen isnt like any camp youve ever heard of its strictly a laboratory and testing facility compared to a place like buchenwald its minuscule the ss let the trees grow right up to the electric fence you need a larger scale map himmler is serious about hiding that camp brigadier smith had not worn his uniform today he looked professorial in a tweed jacket and stalkers cap listen he said ive changed my mind about this meeting what do you mean i mean i dont want you to say anything unless i ask you to why not smith looked away from the road long enough to let stern know he meant what he was about to say dr mcconnell is not like most men hes too smart to be manipulated by you anyway and hes too principled to be shamed or bribed into doing anything he doesnt believe in hes also too bloody pigheaded to listen to reason stern gazed out of the car window what kind of man calls himself a pacifist in is he a religious fanatic not at all a philosopher head in the clouds in the sand more like hes a different sort of chap brilliant but down to earth probably a genius the pacifism comes from his father he was a doctor too gassed in the great war one of the worst cases badly scarred blinded thats why the son chose the field he did wanted to prevent that kind of thing from ever happening again didnt muck about either his uncle owned a dye factory in atlanta georgia when mcconnell was sixteen he used the chemicals in that plant to brew his own mustard gas phosgene too tested it on rats he trapped in the basement building bloody gas masks at sixteen he sounds like a dangerous sort of pacifist oh he could be if he chose hes a riddle he was a rhodes scholar in took a first at university college went back to america for medical school graduated top of his class there then decided to go into general practice masters degree in chemical engineering holds five or six patents in the us for various industrial compounds hes rich he didnt grow up rich if thats what you mean im sure hes comfortable enough now my point is this he may say things that seem truly outlandish to you or to anyone who really understands war but dont lose your temper no matter what and dont mention his father in fact dont say anything at all stern tossed the map of northern germany onto the floor of the bentley why did you bring me along then i want you to get a look at him if he agrees to go on the mission hell be your only partner what youre saying this is a twoman job as far as youre concerned yes brigadier smith revved the bentley past a us army truck stern shook his head slowly this sounds more like a suicide mission every day it may well be but keep one thing clear in your mind the mission you hear me propose to mcconnell will be somewhat different than the mission i discussed with you for obvious reasons certain aspects of the offensive side of things will be minimized no matter what i say you will show no surprise clear no matter what anybody says i keep my mouth shut brigadier smith glanced at the young zionist one last time so far you havent shown much of a talent for that stern showed his right palm to the brigadier and wiggled his middle finger up and down the most obscene arab gesture he knew in oxford it was raining mcconnell stood inside a bewildering maze of metal pipes pressurized storage tanks rubber hosing and racks of gas masks a maze of his own construction there were enough skullandcrossbones poison signs tacked around the lab to scare off a german regiment two elderly whitecoated assistants worked quietly at the far end of the lab preparing for the afternoons experiment mcconnell leaned against a window and looked down into the sandstone courtyard three floors below cold rain pooled in the cracks between the stones running through channels carved over the past six centuries he wondered if his brother was flying today did weather like this ground bs or was david navigating the sunny ether above the clouds humming a swing tune while he pressed on toward germany with death stowed under him hardly a day had passed since their last meeting that mark had not gone over his brothers words again his determination not to participate in the race for a doomsday gas remained as strong as it had been that night yet something within him would not let the issue rest how many scientists had faced similar dilemmas during the war certainly those on the tube alloys project men who labored in the shadowy faustian field of atomic physics they had much in common with the men working in the sealed chemical laboratories at porton down good men living in bad times good men making compromises or being compromised how could he explain why he couldnt help them he watched the raindrops spatter on the window glass wiggle like bacteria on a slide then coalesce and run down seemingly without direction to join the water collecting in the gutter pipe a liquid momentum with force enough to wear away the stone below he thought of what david had said in the welsh pony about the american boys gathering for the invasion a rain of young men falling on england out of airplanes spilling out of the holds of ships coalescing into groups that formed the cells of a colossal human wave an incipient wave that grew each day leaning eastward that would soon be poised for a great leap across the channel it would leap as a whole but it would break on the opposite shore and shatter into its component parts individuals young men who would water the ground with their blood that cataclysmic event though still in the future was already as unstoppable as the setting of the sun the men behind it had come together in england and around themselves were drawing young lives by the millions they breathed the scent of history and across the channel perceived nothing less than the armies of darkness festung europa the fortress of the antichrist waiting to receive their mighty thrust but something else awaited them there mcconnell had seen it for himself and heard it he had traveled across the channel to belgium and to france and walked the fields that had once been crisscrossed with trenches and mud he had stood awhile above the intermingled regiments of bones resting fitfully in shallow graves beneath the soil and there in whispers just beneath the wind that howled across the stark terrain he had heard the puzzled voices of boys who had never known the inside of a woman who never had children who had never grown old seven million voices asking in unison the unanswered question that was an answer in itself why very soon those boys would have company you okay doctor mac startled mark turned from the window and saw his assistants holding four small white rats beside the hermetically sealed glass chamber he called the bubble fine bill he said lets get to it the bubble stood nearly five feet high not tall enough for a man to stand in but plenty of room for a small primate rubber hoses of various gauges snaked across the floor from storage cylinders to fittings in the bubbles base inside the chamber lay four round variously colored objects about the size of english footballs one by one the assistants picked up the containers opened small hatches in their sides and stuffed the rats inside one rat per football when the containers were sealed the assistants rolled them back into the bubble and secured its main hatch mcconnell was reaching for the valve on a gas cylinder when someone knocked on the lab door come he said brigadier duff smith strode into the lab an enthusiastic smile on his face he carried a few extra pounds around his middle the inevitable toll of middleage but the muscle beneath was fit and hard the second man through the door stood over six feet tall and his skin had the burnished tan of a desert dweller his dark eyes focused on mcconnell and stayed there the brigadier surveyed the array of equipment how goes it doctor what are we up to today bringing the dead back to life quite probably the reverse mcconnell said sourly he reached down and opened the valve the muffled hiss of gas released under pressure sounded in the room smith glanced at the glass chamber whats in the bubble today rhesus monkeys he craned his neck i dont see anything look closer those four footballs thats exactly what we call them inside each of those footballs is a rat the surfaces are made of mask filter material for what class of gases blue cross thats hydrocyanic acid going in now if you feel the slightest irritation in your nasal passages hold your breath and run like hell the gas is odorless and nonirritant so ive added a small amount of cyanogen chloride to let us know were about to die how long do we have to get clear after we smell it about six seconds brigadier smiths dark companion stiffened smith grinned and said plenty of time eh stern mcconnell shut off the valve that should be enough to tell go ahead and clear it an assistant started a noisy vacuum pump your friends at porton down think the germans have given up on this gas brigadier mcconnell said over the rattle i dont its difficult to build up a lethal concentration on the battlefield but thats just the kind of challenge the germans love hydrocyanic acid can kill you in fifteen seconds if it saturates your mask filter we call that breaking the filter our current filters are easily broken by hydrocyanic acid and i think the germans know that im trying to develop virtually unbreakable filter inserts for the m through m series canisters any success so far lets take a look mcconnell signaled an assistant to shut off the pump then donned a heavy black gas mask and motioned for smith and his companion to move back against the wall the bubble gave off a sucking sound as he opened its door he lifted one of the footballs held it at arms length opened its hatch and stuck two fingers through the aperture brigadier smith watched fascinated as mcconnell drew the white rat from the football by its pink tail the rodent hung motionless in space damn mcconnell said pulling off his mask he turned and watched his assistants pull dead rats from the other three footballs he shook his head in frustration dead rats thats my life for the last three months i dont see any obvious signs of suffocation brigadier smith observed mcconnell took a scalpel from a soapstone table and neatly sliced the rats throat then he squeezed its body to express arterial blood see that the blood is cherry red as if it were fully oxygenated cyanide attaches to the hemoglobin molecule in place of oxygen a soldier will look like hes in the bloom of health while hes suffocating while the assistants disposed of the rodents smith leaned closer id like to speak to you in private doctor how about the mitre inn we could take a room id prefer to talk here mcconnell glanced over smiths shoulder at the silent stranger then called to his assistants well start back up after dinner when the assistants had gone smith pulled up a chair and straddled it resting his right arm on its back the gesture emphasized his missing limb weve had some more disturbing news he said out of germany im all ears first if you dont mind id like you to bring mr stern here up to speed on the chemical warfare situation hes a jew originally from germany fresh in from palestine if you can believe it gas isnt his line just a brief overview german nomenclature if you please youve read the classification manual but you helped write it smith said patiently i like my information from the horses mouth mcconnell directed his answer to stern four classes designated by colored crosses you just saw blue cross in action white cross is tear gas green cross denotes chlorine phosgene diphosgene et cetera theyre the oldest chemical weapons but still firstrank battlefield choices they kill by causing pulmonary edema internal drowning the last is yellow cross which also dates back to world war one mcconnell wiped his brow and spoke in a mechanical voice yellow cross denotes the blister gases or vesicants mustard lewisite highly persistent gases wherever they touch the body they produce burns blisters and deep ulcers of the most painful kind the bodys ability to heal is impaired making the effects of yellow cross especially long lasting thank you smith said but you left out a class i believe mcconnells eyes narrowed the last class has no cross classification he said carefully as of yesterday it does black cross schwarzes kreuz mcconnell said softly a fitting name for a tool of the devil come now doctor if i didnt know you were a scientist id swear you were superstitious get to the point brigadier you didnt drive up here from london to chat about gas classifications smith smiled gamely quite right doctor i drove up here to enlist you body and soul in the war effort what are you talking about as of last week sarin took second place in the nazi arsenal an even deadlier nerve agent is now being tested on human subjects inside germany it is called soman according to reports soman is exponentially more toxic than sarin and far more persistent i can hardly imagine anything more lethal than sarin oh it exists the porton lads are going over the report now to be frank the threat posed by soman has been deemed so dire that ive been authorized to send a team into germany to disable the production plant and bring back a large sample stern cut his eyes at the brigadier into germany said mcconnell but why tell me the scotsman wove his lie into the cloth of the truth because i want you to go in with them doctor ive finally found the ideal job for you a mission that is entirely defensive in nature its the equivalent of preventive medicine theres nothing defensive about sabotaging a nerve gas factory you could send a cloud of death rolling right through the heart of germany you might as well call your mission a nerve gas attack thats all the more reason for you to take part in the mission doctor having your expertise on the ground might prevent just such a disaster frankly brigadier i dont believe you would perceive such an event as a disaster smith started to reply but mcconnell held up his hand this discussion is pointless he said ill do everything in my power to develop a defense against this new gas but thats all im sorry mr stern the brigadier could have saved you the drive from london he knows my position on this and a damned infuriating one it is too smith said with surprising force you call yourself a bloody pacifist yet youve been in this war longer than practically any other american i refuse to have this argument again mcconnell said evenly there must be other scientists who could take this on none who is fluent in german mcconnells eyes widened you consider me a fluent german speaker three years of german in high school three more in college that hardly qualifies me as a spy ive seen men with half your linguistic skills go into situations twice as dangerous as the one im asking you to take on did they come back some did mcconnell shook his head in amazement ten words of german could get you past a border post doctor and youre better than that theres no degree in espionage you know every moment in the field is part of your final examination besides stern here is a native german he can polish your delivery while the preparatory work is being done mcconnell took a step toward smith im not going brigadier and you cant order me to im an american civilian and a registered conscientious objector you think i dont know that have you forgotten who ensured that you were granted that classification its bloody odd when you think about it you call yourself a conscientious objector but youre not hiding back in the states with the quakers and mennonites youre nothing like the other pacifists ive seen no doctor to me smith hesitated to me you look more like a man whos afraid of getting killed mcconnell laughed outright i am afraid of getting killed i assume every soldier is if hes not mad you wont shame me into helping you brigadier this isnt a grammar school playground youre damn right it isnt laddie if jerry hits us with soman weve got to be ready to hit back twice as hard mcconnell smiled icily why dont you spray the countryside with anthrax that would render the whole of germany uninhabitable for fifty years maybe even a hundred we cant risk that and you know it they could do the same to us its titfortat and the enemy always has the prerogative to strike first thats the hell of being a democracy our unwillingness to use such weapons is what separates us from the nazis brigadier bring out the bloody violins smith growled jonas stern was the first to hear the footsteps in the corridor he touched smith who moved quickly to the door and opened it a crack mcconnell watched him step outside heard the hum of low voices then smith walked slowly back into the room followed by a young captain wearing the dark blouse and pinks of an th air force officer the captain had an envelope in his hand doctor the brigadier said in a soft voice this chap needs a word with you mark felt a strange tingling in his fingertips what is it has something happened to david the captain glanced at brigadier smith im not supposed to say anything until youve opened the letter but doctor your brother was shot down last night im sorry sir the captain extended the envelope mcconnell took it and tore open the seal inside was a sheet of paper the words on it typewritten in the manner of a telegram regret to inform captain david mcconnell killed in action january stop captain mcconnells actions always reflected the highest honor upon himself the usaaf and the united states of america stop i extend my personal condolences stop colonel william t harrigill st bomb group th combat wing us th air force deenethorpe england doctor brigadier smith said softly mac mcconnell held up his hand please dont say anything brigadier he had imagined this moment many times daylight bomber crews suffered horrifying rates of attrition and yet something about this seemed wrong it was the timing he realized two minutes after refusing brigadier smiths biggest sales pitch ever a messenger shows up to tell him his brother has been killed by the germans mcconnell looked up from the paper and into the scotsmans pale blue eyes brigadier his voice was barely a whisper is this your doing smith looked at mcconnell in astonishment i beg your pardon doctor mcconnell took a step toward him it is isnt it this is some damned soe trick youre trying to push me into your mission arent you the end justifies the means in your business right if the pacifist wont go well make him go mcconnells face was white right brigadier the scotsman straightened his back and raised his chin it was the british equivalent of a cobra puffing out its hood doctor as much as i resent your insinuation i am going to ignore it i realize that in moments like this the mind grasps for any straw however thin but you are absolutely wrong mcconnell felt his face growing hot the captain was staring at him as if he were a dangerous mental patient he looked down at the telegram killed in action so goddamn vague he cleared his throat can you tell me any more than this captain the young officer pulled at the tails of his dress jacket the colonel said you had a top secret clearance and that i could tell you what we knew davids plane sustained catastrophic damage returning from a raid over regensburg it was hit by flak probably fighter cannon as well nobody saw the aircraft hit the ground but no chutes were sighted mcconnells eyes and throat were stinging did did you know my brother captain yes sir hell of a pilot always a joke for the ground crew he even made the colonel crack a smile a few times the colonel would have come himself but we had well he was busy mark blinked away tears does our mother know yet no sir thats a draft of her telegram there jesus ask the colonel not to send this please id like to be the one to tell her no problem sir itll eventually have to be sent but i think the colonel can hold off a few days mcconnell looked from the brigadiers ruddy face to jonas sterns dark one then at the captain the messenger shifted uncertainly sorry again doc he said he saluted brigadier smith and backed out of the lab mark put his hand over his mouth and tried to swallow all he could see was david not as he had seen him four days ago but as a little boy in a muddy georgia pond trying to learn to hold his breath im sorry brigadier he said softly i apologize the scotsman held up his hand theres no need man i know this is difficult i lost a brother myself at lofoten in fortyone but by god doctor if this isnt the final reason to come on board with us nothing is the bastards killed your brother mcconnell shook his head hopelessly youve never understood me at all have you you have no idea why i am the way i am smith bristled i understand you all right i know about your father but what would he say now eh im asking you to go on a mission of mercy christ doctor the nazis are testing the nerve agents on human beings why do you think stern here is going most of those human guinea pigs are jews the germans are slaughtering his people while the world stands by and does nothing mcconnell studied sterns face he saw no sadness or pleading in the young mans features all he saw or thought he saw was disgust im truly sorry he said but im afraid i must ask you to leave i need to be alone to mcconnells surprise brigadier smith turned on his heel and walked out of the room without further argument the young jew however remained behind he had stood silent throughout the meeting but now he walked slowly forward until he stood only inches from mcconnell mark had six or seven years on the stranger but he sensed a fearsome intensity in the young man smith doesnt understand you doctor stern said softly but i do youre not a coward you are a fool youre like my father was youre like a million jews across europe you believe in reason in the essential goodness of man you believe that if you refuse to commit evil yourself someday you will conquer it his voice dripped contempt all the fools who believed that are dead now fed into poison gas and flames by men who know the true nature of humanity the only difference between you and those fools is that youre american stern switched suddenly from english to german but mcconnell caught most of it you have yet to taste even a sip of the pain so many have drunk to the bitter dregs in the last ten years mcconnell opened his mouth to reply but no sound came the weight of sterns words seemed incongruous when paired with the young face speaking them but not with the eyes the young jews eyes were like davids had been when he spoke of losing his friends ageless emotionless stern brigadier smith stood in the open doorway leave him be the dark young man nodded slowly at mcconnell im sorry about your brother but he was only a drop in an ocean beyond counting you should think about that he turned and followed the brigadier into the corridor alone at last mcconnell reread the telegram in a daze regret to inform killed in action mcconnells actions always reflected the highest honor my personal condolences condolences mark put his left hand behind him and found the edge of a desk he couldnt breathe he stumbled to the nearest window and tried to open it but the latch was stuck he raised his right foot and kicked furiously at the ironwork in his anger at mcconnells refusal smith was pushing the bentley beyond the limit of sanity much less legality the fact that he was doing it in the dark with only one arm would have terrified jonas stern at any other time but just now his fury burned as hot as the brigadiers just find another damned chemist he shouted above the roar of the bentleys engine its not as easy as it sounds smith snapped back i cant use enlisted personnel american or british besides mcconnells the best man for the job under the age of sixty anyway stern slammed his hand against the door then what the hell are we going to do you cant let one idealistic fool stop us brigadier smith glanced over at the young zionist i havent given up on the good doctor yet no youre mad then hell never do it you might as well ask albert schweitzer to start carrying a bazooka i think he will smith insisted i think he almost agreed today that telegram nearly pushed him over the edge stern laughed harshly youre crazy mark my words brigadier smith said his eyes focused on the dark road hell come around tragedy has a way of changing peoples minds stern turned suddenly to the scotsman and stared brigadier you didnt set up that scene did you i mean his brother was really killed smith glanced at stern a look of genuine shock on his face christ how devious do you think i am id better hire more jews while i can get them youre born conspirators stern searched the brigadiers face for a sign of deceit but the scotsman gave away nothing stern saw no point in questioning him further but as he withdrew into his own thoughts he could not help but wonder how far would brigadier smith go to get what he wanted the answer to that question would be of great importance after the war in palestine if he lived that long of course mcconnell was kicking at the ironwork of the window when the first doubt struck him why had he taken brigadier smith at his word if the soe chief had faked davids death would he admit it when confronted that bastard is cold enough to do it he said aloud mark knew how improbable the idea was but a fierce hope overrode every rational objection his mind could conjure with shaking hands he called the university operator and asked to be connected to the th air force base at deenethorpe he drummed his feet on the floor at the operators infuriatingly polite im trying to connect you then at last he was through id like to speak to someone about casualties please one moment sir said a young male voice mcconnell heard several clicks then a male voice with a southern drawl came on the line colonel harrigill here harrigill mcconnell remembered the name from the telegram doesnt mean anything he thought brigadier smith could easily get the right names colonel he said surprised by the quaver in his voice this is dr mark mcconnell im calling from oxford university was there a raid over regensburg last night im afraid i cant give out information like that over the phone doctor part of mcconnells brain placed harrigills accent the mississippi delta while another made his face flush the timbre of colonel harrigills voice held more than official courtesy the undertone sounded almost like sympathy what information can you give me colonel well have you received a telegram today doctor mcconnell shut his eyes yes i can confirm that your brothers aircraft was lost in the line of duty over france visual reports from other aircrew led us to classify the entire crew as killed in action mark found himself unable to say anything further is there anything i can do for you son i was about to send a telegram to your family stateside dont i mean not yet at least theres only our mother and shes seen enough just ill tell her colonel thats fine with the army air corps doctor ill try to slow down western union a little bit and again let me express my sorrow captain mcconnell was a fine officer a credit to his squadron his country and to the south mark felt a strange chill at this archaic expression of respect from a fellow southerner yet somehow it touched him it seemed to fit david thank you colonel good night doctor god bless mcconnell hung up the phone colonel harrigill had dashed his last hope david was gone and to think brigadier smith had believed his death would finally wipe away marks hatred for war this time the grief washed over him without warning his brother was dead his father was dead in his entire family he was the last male mcconnell left alive for the first time since returning to england he felt an almost irresistible urge to go home back to georgia to his mother his wife the thought of his mother brought a wave of heat to his scalp how was he going to tell her what could he possibly say when he kicked the window latch this time the ironbound panes crashed open and a cutting wind stung his face slowly his throat began to relax he could breathe he gazed out over a snowy scene that appeared much as it had four hundred years before oxford university his island of tranquility in a world gone mad what a pathetic joke he felt the telegram slip from his hand watched it brush the window casement and then flutter down to the cobblestones three stories below the first sound that escaped his throat was a great racking wail that burst from the depths of his soul several windows opened across the quad revealing white faces alive with curiosity somewhere a gramophone was playing bing crosbys ill be seeing you by the time the second verse wafted across the quad the tears were freezing on mcconnells cheeks he was alone your tape machine stopped said rabbi leibovitz what the old man pointed a long finger at the sony microcassette recorder lying on the end table beside his chair i blinked twice unable to break the vision of my grandfather at that oxford window or my thoughts of my great uncle whom i had never known you need another tape leibovitz said and i need another brandy pass the bottle please i did the rabbi glanced up at me while carefully pouring the amber liquid into the glass so doctor what do you think i shrugged i dont know what to think does that sound like your grandfather to you does it ring true i pondered the question while i changed cassettes in the sony i guess it does i said finally i cant see him compromising his principles simply for revenge are you so sure mark i studied the rabbis wizened face i guess ill have to wait until you tell me wont i its some story all right but the detail how could you know all this leibovitz smiled fleetingly some very long afternoons with mac in my office letters from other persons involved once i learned about this story it possessed me for a while what about the girl i asked reaching down to the floor the woman in this photograph who is she in the story is she the woman who sent that coded message to brigadier smith what the hell was that about anyway rabbi leibovitz took a sip of his brandy be patient im getting to the girl you want everything wrapped up in an hour like a nice television movie the old man cocked his head and listened to the relentless cheeeep of the crickets in the humid darkness outside the house its time to shift focus for a little while all this wasnt happening in a vacuum you know other people were pursuing their own ends quite oblivious to brigadier smith in london some very evil people monsters i would say if you dont object to the word i watched the old rabbis eyes flick restlessly around my grandfathers study it seemed to me that we had come to a part of the story he did not like where are we shifting our focus to i asked trying to prompt him what he asked his eyes fixing on mine where i said again i guess you mean germany right leibovitz sat up straighter in the chair i do yes he said in a hoarse but resolute voice nazi germany every prisoner in totenhausen camp had been standing on the hardpacked snow in rollcall formation for forty minutes in a freezing arctic wind wearing only wooden shoes and graystriped burlap prison clothes they stood in a line seven deep and forty persons long nearly three hundred souls all told withered old men mothers and fathers in their prime stronglimbed youths small children one colicky infant screamed ceaselessly in the wretched ranks this appell had been a surprise the two scheduled roll calls seven in the morning and seven at night had already taken place the camp veterans knew no good could come of the change in routine in camp all change was change for the worse after only five minutes standing in the appellplatz they had caught the faint sound of the polish prisoners whispering the feared word seleckja selection somehow the poles were always the first to know the newest prisoners in the line were jews yesterday they had been clubbed out of an unheated rail car that carried them here from the concentration camp at auschwitz where they had been pulled from lines leaving trains newly arrived from the far corners of western europe france and holland mostly they were the last of the lucky who had avoided the early deportations their luck had run out one of the jews standing in the first rank was no newcomer he had been in totenhausen so long that the ss called him not by his number or name but by his occupation schuhmacher shoemaker a lean and wiry man of fiftyfive with a hawklike nose and gray mustache the shoemaker did not shiver like the other prisoners nor did he try to whisper to those on either side of him he simply stood motionless burning as few calories as he could and watched he watched ss sergeant major gunther sturm strut before the ragged assembly his face cleanshaven for once his lank blond hair combed across his bulletshaped head the shoemaker saw that the screeching of the infant annoyed the sergeant to no end he had studied gunther sturm for two years and could easily imagine the thoughts churning behind the slate eyes how did that brats whore of a mother slip it through the selection net under her skirts no doubt the auschwitz ss stay drunk and the prisoner kommandos are lazy how the hell do those laggards expect to win a war when they cant outsmart one crafty jewess sturms growing frustration was of great interest to the shoemaker on any other night the sergeant would have walked over and strangled the infant on the spot but tonight he did not this fact told the shoemaker something tonight was special he studied the impressive display of force assembled to insure that tonights activities whatever they might be proceeded in an orderly fashion eighty storm troopers of the ss totenkopfverbände deaths head battalions stood stiffly at attention in their earthbrown uniforms rifles at the ready in case some witless newcomer should make a dash for the wire they were backed up by sturms beloved german shepherds canines carefully bred with wolves to enhance their killing instinct and also by the two machine gun towers at the forward corners of the camp a slamming door heralded the arrival of sturms immediate superior major wolfgang schörner the senior security officer of totenhausen marched smartly across the snow and stopped two meters from the shoemaker unlike the deaths head guards he wore the field gray uniform of the waffen ss he also wore a black patch over his left eye socket a souvenir from his participation in the bloody retreat from kursk the turning point of the war in russia and a knights cross at his throat though only thirty years old schörner understood instinctively the dynamics of intimidation prisoners were forbidden to move during appell but the entire mass of bodies had drawn back slightly at his approach with his good eye major schörner inspected the front line from end to end looking for something or someone the prisoners could only guess at few had the courage to return his probing stare one who did was the shoemaker another was a young woman of about twentyfive a dutch jewess by the name of jansen unlike the shoemaker she had her entire family with her husband two small children her fatherinlaw the shoemaker had seen them arrive on yesterdays train the womans head had been shaved but her large brown eyes flickered with a quick intelligence that had long since faded from the eyes of most of the other camp women the shoemaker admired her bravery in returning schörners gaze but he knew that it was hollow she had no idea what lay in store for her family the shoemaker did he didnt need to hear the whispers of the poles during the afternoon he had seen ss men taking great pains to avoid the area of the gas storage tanks behind their barracks obviously some new and potent poison had been pumped into the tanks from the laboratory yes tonight there would be a selection and selections were the exclusive province of the herr doktor excuse me sir the young dutchwoman whispered in yiddish i am rachel jansen how long must we stand here in the cold dont talk said the shoemaker keeping his face forward and keep your children quiet for their sakes no talking sergeant sturm shouted at the sound of his voice the german shepherds burst out barking the shoemaker looked up at the sound of another slamming door ss lieutenantgeneral herr doktor klaus brandt commandant of totenhausen camp stood before the rear door of his quarters wearing his elegant pale gray dress uniform the tunic was immaculate with a slow purposeful tread he walked toward the appellplatz and his assembled prisoners it always intrigued the shoemaker to watch this man not only was klaus brandt exactly his own age fiftyfive but to his knowledge was the only concentration camp commandant who was also a medical doctor this had been tried once before at a different camp but the chosen physician had made a muddle of the administration not brandt though the balding slightly podgy prussian was an obsessive perfectionist some believed he was a genius the shoemaker knew he was insane the commandants ss uniform also signaled that tonight was a special occasion klaus brandt considered himself a doctor first and a soldier second and on most days wore his white lab coat over a business suit he also insisted that he be addressed by his subordinates as herr doktor rather than herr kommandant of course he might be wearing the uniform simply to keep out the cold the shoemaker could not remember a wind like this for many weeks earlier he had seen ss men building fires beneath their vehicles to keep the motor oil from freezing in the crankcases when brandt came within ten paces of the line sergeant sturm snapped to attention and yelled all prisoners present herr doktor brandt acknowledged this report with a curt nod he examined his watch then leaned over and spoke quietly to major schörner schörner checked his own watch then looked toward the main camp gate forty meters away one of the gate guards shook his head in reply schörner looked questioningly at brandt let us begin sturmbannführer brandt said major schörner signaled sergeant sturm with a flick of his head sturm marched toward the far end of the line and began pulling men from the ranks the shoemaker saw immediately that this selection was different from all others he had seen the criteria for selections were usually selfevident sometimes certain adult men were selected those of a certain approximate weight for example other times women having their menstrual cycle never had the shoemaker seen more than ten adults selected at one time and for a simple reason brandts testing chamber had not been designed to handle more also the usual procedure was for brandt to walk along just behind the sergeant approving the selections or in rare cases granting an onthespot dispensation the lord of life and death at totenhausen savored his divine authority but tonight sturm was snatching men from the ranks with hardly a glance already thirteen stood under guard apart from the main group with a chill of foreboding the shoemaker realized that all thirteen were jews had his turn finally arrived his hands trembled none of the jews looked over fifty but who knew he saw the jansen woman lean out of the line to try and see what was happening an ss private stepped forward and shoved her back five storm troopers converged as sergeant sturm waded into the ranks to collar a reluctant prisoner a hysterical wail echoed up the line forcing the dog handlers to restrain the german shepherds the shoemaker began to pray nothing else would do any good he had made his mistake years before when he refused to flee from germany with his wife and son at least they were safe now he thought he hoped safe in the promised land palestine he was certainly luckier than the jansen family on his right tonight the old grandfather would lose his son the young wife her husband and the children their father he saw panic in the womans eyes as she sought some means of protecting her husband there was nothing this was nazi germany and sergeant sturm was getting closer you sturm snapped pointing his finger out of the line the shoemaker watched a fortyyearold clerk from warsaw shuffle out of the line and join the doomed men huddling in the center of the frozen camp yard rosen was his name but no stone would ever mark his remains you sturm bellowed out of the line from the corner of his eye the shoemaker saw the young dutch father turn and look into his wifes face his eyes showed no fear for himself only a withering guilt at leaving his family to suffer without his protection however meager it might be their two children a tiny boy and girl clung to the hem of their mothers gray shift and stared up in mute terror austreten sergeant sturm barked reaching for the dutchman the young man raised one hand and tenderly touched his wifes cheek ik heb er geen woorden meer voor rachel he said take care of jan and hannah the shoemaker was german but he knew enough dutch to translate i have no more words rachel as sergeant sturms hand closed on the young dutchmans sleeve a whitehaired man bolted from the ranks and threw himself at sturms feet the shoemaker cut his eyes up the line forty meters away major schörner was engaged in conversation with dr brandt neither had seen the movement spare my son the old man begged in a whisper spare my son benjamin jansen begs you on his knees for mercy sergeant sturm waved away a storm trooper who was hurrying over with a dog he drew his pistol a welloiled luger get back in line he growled or well take you instead yes said the old man that is what i want he rose to his feet and capered like a madman i will serve just as well sturm shoved him back a step youre not what we need he pointed his pistol at the son move the elder jansens right hand burrowed inside his coat pocket sergeant sturm pressed his luger to the dutchmans forehead but the wrinkled hand emerged from the pocket holding something that flashed like stars under the arclights the shoemaker heard sturm catch his breath the dutchmans palm was full of diamonds take them ben jansen whispered for my sons life the shoemaker watched sergeant sturms face go through several changes of expression he could hear the thoughts turning in the sergeants brain who else had seen the diamonds what were they worth a small fortune by the look of them how long would he have to carry them before he could hide them in his quarters theyre yours the old man whispered pressing the gems toward sturms pocket the sergeants left hand closed over the diamonds the shoemaker cringed he knew what would happen now he saw sturms finger tighten on the lugers trigger what is the delay here asked a sharp voice sergeant sturm froze as major schörner leaned over his shoulder yes said doctor brandt who had walked up beside schörner what is the problem hauptschärführer sturm cleared his throat this old jew wants to take his sons place impossible brandt said in a bored voice he turned and stared impatiently at the front gate i beg you herr doktor jansen implored the old man had been astute enough to pick up on brandts preferred title my son has young children who need him herr doktor marcus is a lawyer i am but a tired old tailor useless take me instead klaus brandt pivoted on his heel and regarded the old man with a sardonic smile but a good tailor is infinitely more valuable here than a lawyer he said he pointed to a nearby prisoners tattered shift the skin beneath it looked blue what need has he of a lawyer with that brandt turned and moved a few steps up the line benjamin jansen stared after him with wild eyes but herr doktor quiet sturm roared reaching for marcus jansen who had knelt beside his children the old man shook as if from palsy he reached out and caught the back of major schörners gray tunic sturmbannführer take half the diamonds take all of them schörner turned back with narrowed eyes diamonds im ready said marcus jansen the young dutchman stepped resolutely from the line his wife crouched and hugged her children hiding their eyes sergeant sturm grabbed the lawyer and jerked him away with a wild shriek ben jansen clenched both hands into fists took an uncertain step toward major schörner then lunged to his right in the direction of dr brandt the shoemaker felt something inside him snap despite the risk to himself he threw his right fist and caught ben jansen on the side of the jaw the old dutchman dropped flat on his back in the snow in the same moment that the shoemaker whipped back into line and stood rigidly at attention it happened so fast that no one knew quite what to do sergeant sturm had been a fraction of a second from shooting the old man now he looked uncertainly from the shoemaker to schörner then to brandt who had turned to see what was happening marcus jansen stared in horror as sturms pistol hovered above his fathers head the sudden blast of a car horn saved benjamin jansens life its blaring echo reverberated over the snow like a royal clarion its the reichsführer shouted sergeant sturm hoping to turn all attention toward the front gate for the most part he succeeded but while klaus brandt hurried toward the gate with an honor guard of ss troops and the shoemaker wondered if he had actually heard the word reichsführer major wolfgang schörner said in a soft voice open your left hand hauptscharführer but the selection sturm protested i must finish schörners hand closed around sturms thick wrist hauptscharführer i order you to open your hand zu befehl sturmbannführer sturms voice was tight with fear and anger as the roar of engines drew nearer he opened his hand it was empty major schörner stared into the hand for a moment then said remain at attention hauptscharführer without hesitation schörner reached into sturms trouser pocket a pained expression came over his face he dug in the pocket then removed his hand and opened it inches from the sergeants face the diamonds glittered like blue fire i thought we had settled this issue schörner said quietly sturm lowered his eyes we did sturmbannführer then would you like to explain these diamonds to the reichsführer sturm paled himmlers edict against looting jews for personal gain was quite explicit the penalty was death nein sturmbannführer he said schörner grabbed sturms left hand and forced the diamonds into it then get rid of them get rid of them how schnell the shoemaker watched in amazement as sergeant sturm flung the diamonds across the snow like a man feeding chickens now schörner said in an even voice finish the selection he turned and marched off toward the front gate his knee boots gleaming under the lights sturm stared down at ben jansen in silent rage then he holstered his luger and kicked marcus jansen toward the condemned men all male jews aged sixteen to fifty step out of the ranks he shouted if anyone in that category is left in line one minute from now every second woman in line will be shot the shoemaker felt the terrible wonderful flood of relief he experienced every time he survived a selection out of a total of thirtynine adult male jews twentyeight had fallen into the condemned category as the remainder of these stepped from the line a convoy of gray field cars and one heavy troop transport truck roared across the appellplatz toward the rear of the camp a square flag showing two triangles and a nazi eagle flew from the left mudwing of the longest car so its true thought the shoemaker heinrich himmler has finally come to observe his handiwork sergeant sturms troops clubbed the condemned men toward the rear of the camp with rifle butts and truncheons while the balance of the prisoners remained standing in the snow rachel jansen remained on her knees hugging her children her fatherinlaw had not yet regained his senses the shoemaker swept his eyes over the decimated jewish section looking for his few remaining friends nothing but gray heads now all prisoners return to blocks the shoemaker drifted to the edge of the pack as the dazed crowd broke into small groups and moved toward the six inmate barracks he knew he should follow but something held him back the emotions surging through him were so powerful that he hesitated to face them not for a year had he visited the rearmost area of the camp and for good reason behind the hospital halfburied in the earth stood a small airtight chamber designated the experimental block but called simply the eblock by the camp population when it was mentioned at all only once had the shoemaker observed one of the special actions that occurred at the eblock and he had observed it from the inside he had been wearing a heavy rubber body suit at the time with a sealed gas mask connected to a cylinder of oxygen the other man in the chamber a russian pow chained to the steel wall and designated a control by klaus brandt had been stark naked what the shoemaker saw happen to the russian when the invisible gas hissed into the chamber had driven him nearly to suicide and tonight heinrich himmler had come to see a similar spectacle for himself without further reflection the shoemaker broke away from the crowd of survivors and walked purposefully toward the rear of the camp the risk was great but less for him than for other inmates his leatherworking skills were legendary in totenhausen and all ss knew him by sight he had done at least one repair job for every soldier in camp a boot here a shoulder strap there a pair of slippers for a mistress somewhere such was the currency of his survival if someone stopped him he would claim he had been called to examine a pair of shoes in the hospital ignoring the searchlights he entered the shadow of the hospital hurried forward and peered around the corner of the threestory structure the troop transport truck had been parked in the mouth of the alley so that it blocked his vision he squeezed between the truck and the hospital wall and edged forward until he could see sergeant sturm had halted the prisoners halfway up the alley at the other end stood the gray field cars of the convoy motors running two dozen ss soldiers of the leibstandarte adolf hitler had already surrounded the autos several doors opened as one men wearing pale gray uniforms stepped into the icy night the shoemakers eyes settled on a smallish officer who had just removed a pair of pincenez glasses the glasses must have fogged as he stepped from the heated car for he passed them to an adjutant who wiped them clear with a handkerchief and then returned them when the man put the pincenez glasses back on the shoemaker felt his hands begin to shake he was standing less then forty meters away from ss reichsführer heinrich himmler himmler listened patiently while doctor brandt explained some arcane detail of the presentation he was about to witness as they moved toward the eblock the shoemaker saw that one side of the alley was lined with thirty or so technicians and chemists from totenhausens poison gas plant in their white lab coats they had been almost invisible in the snow himmler nodded affably as he passed them brandt motioned toward the eblock then turned to speak and saw that the reichsführer was no longer beside him himmler had stopped to address one of totenhausens six civilian nurses four of the women were old battlewagons but two greta müller and anna kaas were blond and single and barely thirty the shoemaker had mistaken them for lab technicians himmler seemed quite taken with fraulein kaas and no wonder he was middleaged pudgy and chinless while she could have posed for one of goebbels posters celebrating the aryan female ideal brandt stood by impatiently hed intended for the nurses to be scenery not fullscale diversions at last himmler gave a little bow and moved away from anna kaas brandt led him quickly to the hospitals rear steps from whence he could observe the entrance to the eblock just across the alley two camp spotlights had been pressed into service to focus on the chambers sunken entrance himmlers guards craned their necks in curiosity a muffled bang startled several of them causing a ripple of suppressed laughter among the totenhausen ss it was only a corpse they knew swelling and bursting as it settled into the shallow grave pit beyond the electrified rear fence the condemned men crowded together like a herd of antelope sensing predators drawing around the shoemaker could clearly see the young dutch lawyer who had so stoically accepted his fate sergeant sturm barked an order for the men to strip sharp blows from rifle butts convinced those who responded too slowly the shoemaker put a hand over his mouth was there a more pathetic sight than a group of adult men stripped naked by force in the biting cold their genitals shrank beyond any sexual recognition one of himmlers men brayed something about circumcised jews and their lack of manhood the shoemaker had to admit that from where he stood only the lack of breasts marked the prisoners as men when the clothes and woodensoled shoes lay piled in the snow the first of their owners were herded down the four concrete steps that led to the entrance of the sunken chamber the steel door had a great wheel set in its face like a watertight hatch inside a uboat the shoemaker shivered when he heard the hermetic pfft that signaled the opening of the door what went on in this alley day after day was horrible but what he was seeing now was completely beyond his experience the eblock had been designed to accommodate ten men in standing positions tonight nearly thirty were being forced into the steel chamber he could imagine the nightmarish scene that must be taking place as sturms troops forced the naked men in on top of one another when the last prisoner had been beaten through the door it was levered shut and the wheel cranked into its closed position major schörner signaled to a man who stood by the corner of the eblock this man who wore a striped prison shirt flipped a switch causing the doublepaned porthole observation windows set in the low walls to come alight acid flooded the shoemakers stomach the man who had thrown the light switch was named ariel weitz and he was a jew the wiry little homosexual had worked as a male nurse in hamburg before the war and after being sent to totenhausen had wheedled his way into the job of brandts assistant his behavior in this job quickly made him the most hated man in camp were it not for the terror of reprisals weitz would have had his throat cut long ago the shoemaker watched him hover at the corner of the eblock eagerly awaiting his next order brandt led himmler to the side of the eblock with major schörner following at a discreet distance they stopped beside an odd machine that stood manhigh on a pallet in the snow the shoemaker had never seen this machine before but it looked like a sophisticated pump of some kind brandt removed something from his pocket and held it up for himmlers scrutiny no bigger than a rifle cartridge it flashed in the light glass the shoemaker thought himmler nodded and smiled at brandt seeming to express goodnatured skepticism then brandt turned to the machine and inserted the piece of glass into a compartment in its face at that moment the shoemaker noticed a smallgauge rubber hose connecting the machine to a fitting on the side of the eblock major schörner assisted the reichsführer onto a stool beside one of the eblocks observation portholes he turned back to brandt who moved his left hand to a switch on his machine then raised his right and said i begin the action now there was a quick lowpitched hum from the machine then silence faint screams emanated from the soundproofed eblock the shoemaker saw himmler jerk backward and nearly fall off the stool then right himself ten seconds later the screaming stopped himmler got up from the stool and backed away from the window he wobbled on his feet but when major schörner rushed to steady him he jerked away as if he had been burned very slowly he seemed to come back to himself danke sturmbannführer he said herr doktor as brandt scampered across the snow to himmlers side the shoemaker edged as far as he dared along the side of the truck yes reichsführer said brandt you have surpassed yourself are you positive those men were killed by the gas in that phial you showed me nothing else absolutely reichsführer soman four the aerosol form is particularly fastacting remarkable i saw nothing in that room but dying men that is what you ordered reichsführer brandt you are a genius you will be lionized for a thousand years you and von braun klaus brandt snapped his arm skyward heil hitler will this gas kill as efficiently in the open air it will work exactly as you have seen tonight astounding will any further testing be required not on the gas however beyond aerosols vecteurs we are working on handheld gas grenades and several other delivery systems our problem is protective equipment reichsführer weeks ago i was promised new lightweight impermeable suits from raubhammer proving ground but they have yet to arrive before we can deploy soman on the battlefield we must be sure that our own troops are safe you shall have your suits herr doktor after what i have seen tonight i intend to schedule a fullscale demonstration of soman for the führer let us say in a fortnight himmler gave brandt a reptilian smile the test will take place at raubhammer proving ground if those swine do not have their suits ready i shall place them naked in the area to be saturated by soman brandt laughed obligingly reichsführer if you can assure me a steady flow of test subjects the perfection of ancillary delivery systems would be hastened ive recently had trouble replenishing my stocks i need healthy males now and speer is taking them all for the munitions factories you will have your specimens herr doktor im afraid that even in jews are something we still have a surplus of himmler raised an arm and took in sergeant sturms assembled ss troops kameraden he shouted his breath steaming in the cold i know that your work here is difficult yes it takes a strong constitution to witness what i have just seen and yet remain good and decent men you men are our finest flower the seeds of the reichs future you alone have the strength to do what must be done that is why we will win this war the englishman and yes the american too merely does his best in all contests the german does what is necessary kameraden sieg heil heil hitler during the answering salvo of sieg heils the shoemaker lay prone in the narrow space between the truck and the hospital wall with the snow soaking through his burlap clothes he saw brandt escort himmler back to the waiting vehicles and join him in his field car as they sped away joined soon after by the troop truck major schörner signaled to two ss men standing behind the eblock within seconds scalding jets of highpressure steam and detergent chemicals blasted into the chamber to flush the corpses walls ceiling and floor clean of nerve gas the remaining mixture of air and toxic liquid was sucked out by powerful vacuum pumps finally two small steel vents were opened in the roof and scorching dry air treated with decontaminants removed all traces of soman from the chamber major schörner looked around expectantly ariel weitz scurried up to him like an obedient terrier the usual weitz jawohl sturmbannführer schörner seemed entranced by the sight of the little jew hurrying down the steps that no other man would tread without a stutter in his heartbeat when weitz disappeared the major hastened back toward the front of the camp the alley was empty the shoemaker listened to the fading engines impelled by morbid curiosity he darted across the alley to the far side of the eblock crouched in the snow and pressed his face to an observation porthole the sterility of the scene stunned him there was no blood or feces not even a speck of dirt the steam had taken care of that but the position of the dead revealed the madness of what had gone before the twentyeight jewish men who died tonight had been packed inside the eblock like tinned herrings most had died standing up their corpses were tangled in a general riot of limbs their dead skin blistered pink by the highpressure steam their open eyes glazed and protruding horribly one mans head was jammed against the window from which himmler had watched the shoemaker almost screamed when the corpses near the door began to move then he saw ariel weitz pushing his way in among the dead like a grave robber the man was not even wearing a gas mask perhaps his guilty conscience had spawned a death wish weitz turned up his nose and sniffed the air like a hausfrau checking her bathroom apparently satisfied he reached into his pocket and withdrew a pair of precision pliers then he leaned over one of the fallen corpses the shoemaker saw the face clearly its pink mouth frozen in a rictus of pain and horror it was the young dutch lawyer jansen weitz pulled a small torch from his back pocket and shined it into the oral cavity his grisly effort was rewarded by the glint of gold carefully he inserted the pliers into the corpses mouth fitted the tongs around the tooth and yanked it free of the bone weitz brushed away skin that had sloughed onto his hand then pocketed his prize and put the pliers back into the lawyers mouth the shoemaker felt his hands shaking what kind of monster could plunder the corpses of his own tribe for its exterminators he stared with murder in his eyes as weitz fitted his pliers around yet another goldcrowned tooth then as if suddenly aware that he was being watched ariel weitz looked up straight at the window from which the shoemaker watched the shoemaker froze he met weitzs startled gaze for a few seconds peered into the twin abysses of his eyes then he ran across the empty alley and along the wall of the hospital he forced himself to slow down as he neared the inmate showers running could draw gunfire from the watchtowers at any time as he passed the appellplatz an image of the old dutchmans diamonds flashed into his brain was it worth the risk the value of gems had been low throughout the war in the camps at least a treasured brooch might fetch four potatoes in a black market trade but times were changing as the red army offensive gained momentum some ss had shown an interest in goods that would help them buy their way westward in the event of a russian breakthrough he made five quick passes over the welltrodden snow where he and the jansens had stood during the selection just as he decided that sturm had defied major schörner and returned for the diamonds he saw a flash on the ground to his right he bent down scooped up a handful of snow then moved quickly toward the inmate blocks sifting the snow as he walked he counted four loose diamonds in his palm slipping the stones into his pocket he silently scaled the wire fence and dropped to the other side bitte please do not shoot the shoemaker clutched his chest in shock only when he recognized rachel jansen the wife of the dutch lawyer did he begin to calm down she was standing in the shadow of the christian womens block with her tiny boy and girl clinging to her legs what are you doing out here he asked furiously the dutchwoman hesitated too long my children needed the toilet they have loose bowels dont lie to me you came to look for the diamonds didnt you he saw by her expression that he was right rachel jansen either had courage or she was a fool the ss took the stones already he said in a gentler tone you must go back she nodded hesitantly can you tell me anything of my husband the truth the shoemaker felt a sudden and surprising rush of emotion against his better instincts he took the young womans soft face between his hands very quietly so that the children would not hear he said you must be strong rachel your husband was a fine man but he is dead they are all dead he expected a hysterical response but after an initial shudder a quick blinking of the eyelids rachel jansen pulled away from him her right hand went to her forehead then covered her eyes oh dear god she whispered we are alone the shoemaker caught up a child in each arm and began walking to the jewish womens block rachel followed at the door he set the children down thank you she said you are de schoenmaker yes ive only just arrived but already ive heard of you some people they say bad things the shoemaker shrugged he was thinking about ariel weitz they say you collaborate with the germans he glanced anxiously toward the jewish mens block he had no time for questions but something about this young woman had struck him perhaps it was her children or the brave husband she had lost or her ability to sustain the blow of losing him and not shatter as so many had he reached into his pocket and closed his hand over the four diamonds he started to pull out a single stone then brought out two he placed them carefully in her hand thats all i could find he told her use them well before she could respond he turned and hurried toward the jewish mens block as he passed under the faded yellow star over the door the musty stew of caked sweat and mold and naphtha hit him the smell of home he lay on his hard bunk stunned to find himself not sharing a blanket for the first time in many months no shortage of bunks tonight none of the eleven survivors of his block asked where he had been he wanted to sleep but he could not get ariel weitz out of his mind in the darkness above him hovered the image of the jewish traitor the golem startled in the midst of his ghoulish work what had shocked the shoemaker what made him run was not the fear of getting caught it was the tears as the little ferret looked up from the corpse huge wet tears had been streaming down his face that sight had shaken him to his core because if ariel weitz still possessed some secret well of compassion some vestige of identity from the world of light then could not the shoemaker as well he let his mind reel back through time to his life before hitler the pungent stench of the block gave way to the warm colors and smells of his home bread cooking in the oven good matzo his wife working over the kitchen stove and in the back of the apartment his shop there shaping leather at the last his son only fourteen yet nearly as tall as his father so quickly becoming a man he heard his wife calling avram avram come there are men in the street brown shirts the shoemaker hugged himself and shivered in his bunk that nazi rally had marked the beginning of the end for him the end of the time when he would be known by his given name soon after his wife and son fled germany hilters thugs began rounding up jewish combat veterans along with all the rest just as his son had predicted avram was arrested with a truckload of other jews from rostock and taken to a distant camp there he had become prisoner a number of prestige now in the hellish universe of the camps where a low number indicated either survival skills or luck both treasured commodities when all his comrades died he was transferred north to help build another prison in the land of numbers totenhausen camp not fifty kilometers from rostock his home city there here he had carved out a small place for himself existing in darkness moving through life in single steps with each step hoping to avoid the god of the camps which was death so far he had been lucky if survival was luck some believed the dead were the lucky ones sometimes he believed that too but tonight in some nameless slice of time between seeing the tears staining weitzs ratlike face and giving the two diamonds to rachel jansen the shoemaker had become avram stern again and that terrified him because once again he had something to lose one hour after the shoemaker found sleep anna kaas was standing beneath a tree in a dark clearing five miles northeast of totenhausen a giant of a blackbearded pole stood beside her ravenously chewing the salted ham she had stolen from the camp stores kneeling on the ground at her feet was the gaunt young man with wild hair and violinists fingers he bent over an opened suitcase and began tapping out coded number groups on a morse key the numbers had been encoded to conceal the words on the sheet of paper in annas hand while the young pole tapped and his older brother wolfed down the ham anna reread her message himmler personally observed special action tonight field test of soman four to be held at raubhammer proving ground in fourteen days the führer will be present she took a match from her purse and set fire to the paper it burned quickly with her eyes she followed the dark antenna wire from the suitcase to the tree branch high above them she wondered exactly where the dots and dashes were going six hundred miles away in bletchley park england young clapham received the message transcribed and decoded it then he lifted the telephone and placed a call to soe headquarters in baker street brigadier duff smith was awakened from sound sleep on an office cot to take the call when he heard the word scarlett followed by the contents of the message he thanked clapham hung up reached into a nearby tumbler and splashed water on his face then he calmly walked to the next office up the hall and said barry wheres winston tonight rachel jansen spent her first morning as a widow trying desperately not to fall asleep she had not rested for many hours but until she was certain that her children were relatively safe she would not sleep she sat stiffly on the floor her back pressed against the narrow bunk she had been assigned one of three stacked like bookshelves against the front wall of the jewish womens block her fatherinlaw stood unsteadily beside her her two children jan three and hannah two sat on either side of her their heads pillowed upon her shrinking breasts with stinging eyes rachel looked warily around the barracks for the last hour women of every size and condition had been staring at her she could not understand it during her short time here she had taken great care to offend no one the women she had mentally christened the new widows those who had arrived with her and also lost their husbands last night were not staring they seemed to be suffering various degrees of shock but the others were the only characteristic the staring women shared was their hair most of them had several inches of it its the oldtimers she thought uneasily the camp veterans are staring at us rachel pressed her thighs tightly together and thought of the two diamonds the shoemaker had given her it was a bit of an indignity to hide them in so intimate a place but she had seen female veterans of the camp hiding coins rolled photographs and other small treasures there in the showers and she had quickly followed their example it proved a wise decision since then she had witnessed two surprise searches why do they stare so she thought anxiously my son benjamin jansen whimpered for the hundredth time my home and my business werent enough they had to take my only son quiet rachel whispered pointing to the snoring children sleep is their only refuge the old man shook his head hopelessly there is no refuge from this place except through the back gate rachels young face hardened stop whining if it hadnt been for that shoemaker knocking you down youd already be out the back gate the old man closed his eyes though exhausted rachel stared defiantly back at the toughest looking of the women a thickset slav with ashcolored hair and blocked out the old mans fatalism it was not easy the thought of the back gate was enough to paralyze anyone already she had learned that the irregular tattoo of muffled bangs echoing in the trees behind the camp which she had thought were gunshots were actually explosions of gas through the swollen skins of decomposing bodies buried in shallow pits behind the camp her husbands resting place hey barked a gravelly voice dont you know why everyone is staring at you rachel lashed out blindly with her right hand and blinked her eyelids she had fallen asleep just long enough for the big slav to cross to her bunk leave us alone she snarled the coarsefeatured woman towering above her did not back away she squatted down and jabbed a stubby finger at benjamin jansen she wore leathersoled shoes rachel noticed the only pair in the barracks theyre staring because of him the woman said in a thick polish accent this is the jewish womens block he cant stay here the ss tolerate a certain amount of movement between the womens and the childrens blocks helps to keep mischief down but no men are allowed in the womens block the old goat can listen to what i have to say then he has to go rachel looked at her fatherinlaw to make sure he understood youve never been in a camp before have you the woman asked none of you we passed through auschwitz rachel answered but only for an hour im afraid this is all quite new to us it shows how exactly the woman wrinkled her wide flatboned face in scorn a hundred ways but that doesnt matter now that your rich husband has gone through the back gate maybe youre not too good to socialize with us eh or maybe you want to be transferred to the prominents block no no we want no special treatment good because there is no prominents block here thats buchenwald in totenhausen everyone is equal the woman seemed to take great satisfaction from this statement rachel extended her hand i am rachel jansen i am honored to meet you rachels formal manners brought a sneer to the womans face im frau hagan she announced i am block leader i am also a pole and a communist frau hagan said this as if it were a challenge to the devil i am kapo of jewish women prisoners because i understand yiddish of course not everyone in this camp is jewish you know there are christian poles russians latvians estonians gypsies ukrainians even germans more communists too a whole world behind an electric fence frau hagan frowned again at benjamin jansen i came over to tell you the facts of life camp life before your ignorance gets you and others killed rachel nodded quickly we appreciate your kindness frau hagan snorted the first thing i tell you is this whatever you were outside forget it the sooner the better the higher up the ladder you were the harder it will be for you to get used to the camp what were you what did your husband do he was a lawyer a very good one frau hagan turned up her heavy hands in mock despair you see thats terrible another spoiled princess my father was a carpenter rachel added quickly thats a little better i was a washerwoman on the outside a maid to a german businessmans family yet here i am block leader thats very impressive rachel said carefully frau hagan stared at rachel trying to see if she was being made fun of she decided she wasnt now the badges your children are wearing the plain yellow star jood that means jew in dutch eh some language well a jew is a jew no matter what the letters yellow triangles mark them all but there are other colors youll see people here have been brought from many camps but in general the badges are based on the auschwitz system knowing the badge colors can mean life or death for you here rachel looked down at the cloth badge sewn onto the left breast of her tunic it was made of two triangles one superimposed upon the other to form the star of david the top triangle which was red and pointed up bore a large n on its center beneath this was a bright yellow triangle pointing down the red triangle frau hagan explained means political prisoner its nothing to do with anything youve done its just a convenient tag for the germans they think they have to label everything in sight or it doesnt exist the big capital letter marks your country of origin same with all foreigners yours is n for netherlands see mine is p i see youll see a lot of green triangles too green marks the criminals people who were actually convicted of crimes before they got here not all the greens are bad but dont cross any of them they stick together frau hagan scowled suddenly keep your boy away from the pink triangles pink marks the homosexuals keep him away from any man who gets too close there are pederasts here dutch girl and they arent required to wear badges as rachel absorbed the import of frau hagans words hannah began to stir her movements woke jan her threeyearold who reached into his pocket and took out a small wooden dreidl rachel had managed to smuggle the top all the way from holland neither child could really spin it yet but the dreidl was a reminder of a safer place and time she started a game where the children slid it back and forth between them frau hagan glanced at them you havent told them what last night meant no rachel whispered their father told them he was going on a long trip to work there is nothing to be gained by telling them otherwise frau hagan seemed to agree with this judgment im surprised they let you keep your son she mused young as he is and blond its a miracle he wasnt taken away to be aryanized rachel shivered in horror marcuss grandfather was blond she said a gentile frau hagan had already forgotten the children she silently counted off badge classifications on her fingertips black she said black marks the asocials dont trust them youll also see an armband with the word blöd its worn by the feebleminded retards theyre generally harmless jehovahs witnesses wear purple triangles theyre kind but dont make friends with them they dont last long in here theyre too hardheaded frau hagan sighed there are other badges and colors but you cant learn them all in a day the big polish woman fell silent at a sudden rapping on the barracks wall the other women scrambled for their bunks frau hagan pointed at benjamin jansen under the bunk the old man rolled under rachels bed and tried to conceal himself as best he could an inmate at the window whispered its all right its only anna rachel heard a collective sigh of relief a half dozen voices murmured nurse kaas like a speaking round rachel watched in fascination as a small group of prisoners almost like a delegation with frau hagan at their head lined up to receive the revered visitor there was no knock the door was simply thrust open and left that way despite the winter wind a tall shapely blond woman wearing a white uniform with blue trim stepped inside and pulled a small parcel from beneath her skirt we thank you most humbly fraulein kaas frau hagan said taking the package and passing it to another inmate rachel was shocked by this formal speech from the woman who had only moments ago ridiculed her own courtesy the blond nurse looked slightly embarrassed how is frau buhle today frau hagan shook her head no better im afraid but she holds on if you could possibly take time to examine her not today were quite busy in the hospital of course rachel stared at the two women the physical differences between them were startling next to the blond nurse frau hagans skin looked gray and dry as a dust rag it suddenly dawned on her that nurse kaas was german she was part of the camp staff the nurse glanced anxiously at the open door behind her perhaps just a quick look she said frau hagan led her to a bunk at the far end of the barracks camp veterans melted away before them as if yielding a path for an earthly saint then closed in behind when the nurse knelt down rachel lost sight of her rachel was curious about the nurse but she remained beside her own bunk better not to interfere she took advantage of this break to rest her eyes a bit the last seven days had been a blur of withering terror and unspeakable indignity the cattle car had been the worst endless hours sitting without heat or food on frozen railroad sidings marcus fighting like a dog for a handful of water for the children both of them sleeping standing up in the press of filthy bodies as the train crossed into poland each with a child in their arms holding hannah naked and feverish over an overflowing bucket while she emptied her roiling bowels then squatting herself in the filth and finally choosing a space among the dead for her family not bothering with the bucket or anything else anymore but only with breathing and keeping away those who had lost their reason the stop at auschwitz had been a merciful deliverance a silent man in a business suit pulled them out of a glassyeyed throng queuing before a doctor and loaded them into an open truck which carried them to another train that train hauled them northwest for three days back into germany and finally disgorged them in a bombshattered marshaling yard in rostock and from there by truck to this place totenhausen the place where marcus died so i am a widow she thought with a strange detachment the idea did not seem difficult to grasp considering the totality of transformation she had been forced to endure in the last thirty hours she could still feel the bite of the shears as they scissored her hair to the skull she remembered the last feeble protest of her dignity as she was forced to strip naked in the snow beside a barbedwire fence and parade before snickering ss troops who called the dehumanizing procedure a medical inspection then in rapid succession came delousing the tattooing of her inner forearm the distribution of striped uniforms and wooden shoes the application of badges to the uniforms and the taking of a detailed medical history and now with seeming inevitability widowhood the tears had stopped a little while ago and rachel had vowed not to let them return she had to force herself to think to concentrate on one thing only survival it was a skill she had learned while very young as a german jewish child orphaned during the great war she had been sent to amsterdam to live for a while with a childless jewish couple she had grown to love them but more importantly she had made sure they grew to love her even at four she knew she never wanted to be hungry again she quickly mastered the dutch language and manners and when the time came for her to return to germany the couple had adopted her her marriage to marcus jansen a native dutch jew had completed her transformation from german orphan into dutch wife when the nazis invaded holland in and her family was forced to go into hiding she adapted to the attic room above the christian familys shop with such grace that her whole family was able to follow her example she had actually given birth to hannah in that attic but the events of the last week beginning with the bloodcurdling sound of the gestapo beating down the door of their hiding place had stretched her adaptive capacity near to breaking she wont last much longer said a voice in german rachel opened her eyes to see the german nurse moving toward her instructing frau hagan as she walked the nurse carried a stethoscope in her right hand her ration will not help her now the nurse was saying share it amongst yourselves just keep her warm and the blond nurse froze in midstep whats he doing in here rachel followed the nurses gaze she was staring at benjamin jansen who was trying unsuccessfully to hide under rachels bunk he only got here yesterday frau hagan explained he sneaked in here to visit his grandchildren well boot him out as soon as youre gone youd better if sergeant sturm catches him here hell be on the tree by nightfall ill take care of it frau hagan promised what about the selections last night was the worst yet nurse kaas seemed suddenly in a rush we can only pray the worst is past frau hagan nodded youd better go before stepping outside the nurse straightened her luxuriant hair with both hands to rachel she looked like a knight adjusting armor we pray you will come again soon frau hagan said hopefully dont expect too much only what you can do auf wiedersehen anna kaas was gone frau hagan turned and marched like a sergeant major back to rachels bunk get up from there old man benjamin jansen rolled out from beneath the bunk and stood beside rachel listen to the rest then get your ass out of my barracks for good you heard the nurse mention the tree yes but i have seen no trees inside this camp its not a real tree glupi its a tall post driven deep into the ground there are two crossbars nailed to it one down low another up high youve seen that to the side of the hospital frau hagan nodded the germans call it the punishment tree we just call it the tree she motioned for a woman to move rachels children out of earshot there are three official punishments in this camp all are administered at the tree and all can be fatal theres the whip the rope and the dogs the whip is for a first infraction of the rules they take you to the tree tie your hands and make you let down your pants or lift your skirt in front of the assembled prisoners then they bend you over the lower crossbar and lash you with a horsewhip they lash you until youre bloody with the whole camp staring up your backside the tough ones survive it others dont some die from exposure some from shock the rope is worse they tie your hands behind your back then loop a heavy rope around the first one and hoist you up to the top crossbar by your hands your shoulders pop out of joint immediately if you lose consciousness and most people do after fifteen minutes of agony the ss throw buckets of water on you to revive you the rope can drive you mad or it can kill you in winter it can kill you very quickly rachel glanced fearfully at her children who sat silently against the far wall with wide eyes and the dogs benjamin jansen asked frau hagan chuckled bitterly i think you can figure that out theres a set of manacles on a chain attached to the lower crossbar of the tree they strip you manacle one ankle then sergeant sturm sets his dogs on you the pole made a sudden snapping gesture with her hand like canine jaws ben jansen jumped no one survives the dogs old man sergeant sturm feeds and trains them and hes honed them to a fine pitch of killing its a gruesome sight sturm was a dog master with an einsatzgruppe in the east one of the ss hunters his duty was tracking stubborn jews into cellars and sewers then killing them he brags that he has even trained one of his shepherds to rape women who have been tied down rachel felt her stomach flip over frau hagans bland face hardened if you hear screaming during the night dont get up and when morning comes dont let your children look toward the tree what theyd see there would be worse than your most terrible nightmare of what hell could be rachel buried her face in her hands where in gods name have they brought us forget about god frau hagan advised hes forgotten about you there is some good news though this camp is better than some were guinea pigs here not work slaves you were brought here for herr doktor brandt to experiment upon and brandt likes his guinea pigs in reasonably good health that means the food is edible and we dont have to sleep in our own shit of course this paradise lasts only until the day youre selected or until you break a rule sturm and his men are always watching for infractions the rulebreakers are their source of entertainment but what are the rules where are they posted in the germans heads frau laughed harshly thats why its so hard to stay within them youve got one mark against you already little dutch girl what do you mean youre too pretty you havent been starved yet so youve still got your breasts the big pole reached out and ran her hand over rachels skull already a fine coat of black stubble had sprung up rachel instinctively jerked away frau hagan laughed again yes someone might get very creative to get you into a bed schörner is drunk most of the time but sometimes he perks up his drinking is the best and worst thing about him sergeant sturm is the one to watch out for hes a pig i advise you to start looking as ugly as you can as soon as you can although im sure they already noticed you during the medical inspection rachel shuddered at the memory the ss may be animals but remember one thing frau hagan glared at benjamin jansen you too old man its the unwritten law of every camp the prisoners worst enemy is the prisoner the block leader squinted at rachel as if trying to gauge whether any of her hardearned wisdom had taken root you know i survived auschwitz for three years she said i have no tattoo number you know what that means i am less than zero i helped build that stinking place i was a kapo there a good one i saw a lot of dutch and they never lasted long especially the women they couldnt accept the change they never bathed never ate i hope youre different dutch girl at auschwitz the dutch women became musselmen after only two weeks what is a musselman a bag of bones princess a bag of bones that doesnt care if it eats anymore a walking corpse but i have seen no one like that here i told you this camp is different they didnt bring you here to work you to death they brought you here to work on you but what can you mean frau hagan glanced at the children youll find out soon enough the big pole placed both hands on her wide hips do you understand these things ive told you rachel nodded uncertainly rations in two hours guard your shoes spoon and cup with your life keep your childrens things yourself eat your bread as soon as you get it your stomach is the best safe against thieves she grabbed ben jansen by the collar out you go rachel watched in amazement as the block leader hauled the old man to the barracks door and shoved him out into the snow she darted to the doorway as her fatherinlaw plodded toward the jewish mens block she heard a rapid shuffling behind her when she turned she saw frau hagan passing out small sausages from the parcel nurse kaas had brought the pole met her starved gaze but did not offer her a sausage rachel turned away she felt sure that a diamond would buy a few sausages for jan and hannah but they were not starving yet she would have to use the stones more wisely than that with luck they might last through the war she wondered what the shoemaker would say if he knew that when he found her hiding in the shadows by the fence she had not been sneaking out to the appellplatz to search for the lost diamonds but sneaking back it had been a frightful risk to leave jan and hannah while she searched but the three diamonds she had found plus the two the shoemaker had given her made five and she had no regrets clearly life inside the camp functioned on the same principle as life outside economics she had told her fatherinlaw nothing about the diamonds and she never would he had proved last night that he was no judge of when to expend his treasure he had been desperate of course but rachel was sure that the diamonds could not have saved marcus from the selection bribery was not a public business she would need allies to survive and she would choose them very carefully someone like the shoemaker perhaps or even frau hagan the block leader would soon learn how far a dutchwoman would go to survive as she walked across the floor toward her children rachel kept her genital muscles flexed it was probably not necessary but she had no experience in such things she would walk that way until she knew the diamonds were as secure as if locked inside a vault she might not yet know how best to spend them but she would have them to spend when the time came jonas stern lay on a threadbare mattress and stared sullenly at the stained ceiling of his jail cell it had been five days since he and brigadier duff smith drove to oxford to speak with the american doctor and stern had spent four of those in a cell where the hell was smith after mcconnell refused the brigadiers request smith had driven stern back to london and dropped him at a rooming house run by some good friends of mine stern soon realized that smiths good friends were offduty london policemen but evading british police had become second nature to him in palestine and the london variety proved no more adept at surveillance than their middle eastern cousins stern had passed most of that first day in various london pubs where he ran into more than his share of american soldiers with allied troops massing for the invasion gis were thick on the ground it wasnt long before stern began trying to take out his anger at mcconnell on the nearest americans to hand he survived one brawl in shoreditch without serious damage then he ran into a squad of marines outside the entrance to the strand palace hotel bar the liquoredup gyrenes did not take kindly to being called pacifistic dilettantes especially by a suntanned civilian with a german accent the military police found stern lying flat on his back with two glowing shiners and the fragments of a chair scattered around him he had awakened in jail with ribs so bruised he could barely breathe and a new american slang term added to his growing list shitbird he railed at his jailers to call brigadier smith and they claimed they had but the scotsman never showed up either the police were lying stern decided or else he was precisely where the brigadier wanted him yesterday he had used peter owens handcuff key to unlock his manacles and attempt an escape but the coppers had been ready that escapade had caused his transfer to his current accommodations his body jerked at the harsh clang of metal against metal shove yer bucket through the bars and make it quick barked a jailer if you spill any youll clean it up wiv your shirt stern rolled over and faced the stone wall he couldnt decide whom he hated more brigadier smith or doctor mark mcconnell at that moment mcconnell was going over some notes in his laboratory in oxford when the telephone rang he tried to ignore it but the caller was persistent mcconnell glanced at his watch ten pm perhaps it was mrs craig the woman of the house he billeted in offering him a late supper he picked up the phone yes yeah hey said a male voice with a brooklyn accent is this dr mcconnell yes i need to see you doc i got a problem excuse me i think you have the wrong number im a medical doctor but i dont see patients im associated with the university right said the caller youre the one i want i been patched up pretty good already its something else i really need to see you mcconnell wondered who in gods name had recommended him to a man with mental problems im afraid im not a psychiatrist either i can recommend a good man in london though the voice on the phone grew agitated you got it all wrong doc its you i need to see not a sawbones or a headshrinker who is this mcconnell asked bewildered do i know you nah but i knew your brother you knew david mcconnell felt his heart thump whats your name captain pascal randazzo dave just called me wop though i was his copilot on shady lady mcconnells heart rate was still rising a member of davids crew had survived where are you captain he asked excitedly right here oxford my god how did you get out of germany do you have word of david a long pause thats what i need to talk to you about doc do you think we could meet tonight hell yes captain you can come to my lab or i could buy you supper somewhere have you eaten yet yeah ill come to you if you dont mind sooner the better my labs sort of tucked away in the university do you think you can find it im from new york doc long as its streets and buildings i can find it its trees and woods that screw me up mcconnell couldnt help but smile what a strange pair randazzo the wop and david the georgia redneck must have made where are you now captain the mitre inn he gave randazzo detailed directions then hung up what the hell was going on if there was word of davids crew why hadnt the air force called him five days ago he had made the most difficult telephone call of his life to tell his mother that her youngest son was presumed dead had that status changed he paced the floor while he waited for randazzo to arrive what could the copilots survival mean no chutes had been sighted by the other bomber crews on the raid but that didnt necessarily mean there werent any in the last four years he had heard stories of miraculous survival that defied all explanation perhaps david had managed to crashland his bomber instead of just crashing he was a fantastic pilot he had the medals to prove it mcconnell jumped the first time he heard the sound thumpthumpbump it was irregular in tempo but continued to grow louder he decided it must be a janitor pushing something heavy up the three flights of stairs probably a mop and a bucket of water then he heard a knock on his lab door doc said a muffled voice hey doc he hurried over and opened the door before him stood a short young man with dark eyes curly black hair and a thick fiveoclock shadow he leaned heavily on crutches and his left leg was encased from ankle to hip in heavy plaster the air force uniform was soaked with sweat captain randazzo the wop in person i had no idea you were wounded im sorry no problem doc randazzo thumpbumped his way across the floor and collapsed into a chair beside the very window mark had dropped the telegram from just a week before still aint used to these fuckin things he said what happened to your leg broke it in two places in the crash bad parachute landing never had much practice mark could hardly contain his excitement you mean you got out of the plane did david get out sure did but the air force said no chutes were sighted randazzo snorted i aint surprised were flying in coffin corner to start with and we were so goddamn low by the time we jumped that the squadron had already left us behind the italian thumped his plaster cast with the tip of a crutch thats how i got this fuckin thing we jumped too late still its better than dying i guess mcconnell studied the oliveskinned face and bleary eyes randazzo had been drinking probably for several days maybe you should just tell me what happened captain the young officer looked out of the window at the dark skyline of oxford only black spires broke the indigo screen of sky and stars yeah he said thats what i came for mcconnell waited the raid went okay made the initial point with only two losses in the squadron we dropped all ten bombs within a thousand feet of the mean dropping point we creamed em wont be no fighters rolling out of regensburg for a while the problem came after mcconnell prompted fuckin ay right after we left the rally point the return leg a real problem what happened about five flak shells thats what they happened to blow about ten holes in shady lady the germans had us conned before we ever passed over add in about twenty mes attacking wingtip to wingtip randazzo licked his lips and stared out of the window looks like some kind of castle out there huh like an errol flynn movie or something mcconnell waited but the captain said nothing further what do you remember about david captain after the flak hit the plane those fuckin bastards randazzo screamed suddenly goddamn murderers mcconnell rocked back on his feet spittle flew from randazzos mouth as he tried to get to his feet using one crutch mark hurried over and gently pushed him back down onto the chair take it easy captain you said you were hit by flak what happened then flak randazzo said in a remote voice yeah after five or six hits shady lady was buckin like a jersey hooker guys were screamin in back joey our ball turret gunner was dead already i told dave it was time to bail out but he wanted to try to nurse her back to england we were somewhere near lille thats in france after the messerschmitts made their pass i knew the lady wasnt ever gonna see england again the engines were on fire and she was dropping like a brick off the empire state building mcconnell felt his mouth going dry he actually heard the scrape as randazzo drew a hand across his heavy black cheek stubble i screamed at dave to hit the silk but he says we gotta wait til the crew gets out i tell him i think the crews dead he tells me go check pilots sit way up high in a fortress you know so i go back radio man waist gunners dead i hump down the chute bombardier and navigator cut to shreds nobody on the interphone it was time to bug out shady lady was shaking herself to pieces dave held her steady while i jumped he jumped a few seconds later randazzo cleared his throat and took a deep shuddering breath dave had got us away from the flak batteries thank god or theyd have shot us while we fell we landed about a quarter mile apart i stayed put my leg was broken i didnt know that then but i knew it hurt like a son of a bitch dave got unharnessed and started working his way toward me were you in a forest fields what i was at the edge of a tree line in a big bunch of bushes randazzo looked at the floor but dave was exposed for the whole walk open field mcconnell looked at the floor randazzos voice was barely a whisper we didnt know it but wed landed fairly close to a village an ss unit saw us coming down they sent out a patrol to follow the chutes a kubelwagen thats a german jeep came over the top of a little rise while dave was still walking he dropped to the ground when he heard the motor but theyd seen him drove straight to him randazzo scratched violently in his hair they started interrogating him on the spot there was a lieutenant there and four other guys all ss one sergeant i think they were asking dave where i was he wouldnt tell em name rank and serial number just like in the movies john fucking wayne randazzo buried his face in his hands sobbed once then fell silent mark struggled to find his own voice then what happened captain well three of the ss guys stood dave up in front of the lieutenant lieutenant pulls out his ss dagger ever seen one like some kind of miniature sword this kraut holds the dagger up to daves chest and starts asking questions in german or english mcconnell asked not knowing why except that david understood no german randazzo looked temporarily at a loss german he said finally yeah didnt matter though cause dave wasnt having any after about the third question the lieutenant slaps him hard right then dave spits in the guys face mark closed his eyes the kraut lieutenant stabbed him the guy just exploded went crazy no randazzos face worked strangely as he spoke the other guys let go of dave he fell he laid there on the ground a minute then rolled over onto his back then they uh mark held up his hand dont tell me the rest captain i dont think i want to know i gotta tell you said randazzo it was my fucking fault mcconnell realized then that the young copilot was wounded far more extensively than in the leg all right he said softly what happened i never seen nothin like it dave was still alive but they started puttin dirt in his mouth dirt then the sergeant finds a stick and starts shoving the dirt down daves throat randazzo was crying now mark couldnt stop himself either he died like that doc those kraut lowlifes choked him with dirt and and i just laid there and watched it happen mcconnell could scarcely move he forced himself to reach out and squeeze randazzos shoulder there was nothing you could have done captain not without sacrificing your own life the italian looked up with tearfilled eyes dave would have done something mcconnell wanted to deny this but he knew it was true that redneck son of a bitch would have come screamin out of those bushes like a whole goddamn division armed or not randazzo was sobbing and laughing at the same time not the wop though he shook his head pathetically i just laid there like a goddamn yellow coward and pissed my pants mcconnell waited until the man had regained his composure captain goddamn it captain id like to know the rest how did you get out well the ss kind of seemed to lose interest after dave was dead they poked around the field awhile but by the time they got to the woods it was getting dark and id been crawling for all i was worth i was damn lucky the next morning some resistance guys from the village walked right over me they were half crazy arguing all the time like a bunch of senators but they got me to some people whod taken flyers out before randazzo shook his head so here i am and dave is still back there in france i dont know doc hq doesnt like these kinds of stories to get out but i just had to make sure you knew the truth your brother was the bravest son of a bitch i ever met he was a goddamn hero youre probably right captain mcconnell said absurdly trying to maintain some semblance of professional distance but youre no coward he let his gaze wander to the window what will you do now randazzo leaned over and picked up his crutches then struggled to his feet if this leg heals up right im goin straight back to the flight line mcconnell looked back at him you must be joking randazzos face was set in stone i aint joking doc im gonna drop bombs on those bastards until germany aint nothing but a crappy footnote in some dusty old book in a broken down college like this one mcconnell felt suddenly lightheaded as if he might simply float up to the ceiling im in shock he thought thank you for coming tonight captain it means a lot to me to to know the truth i wish you well randazzo worked his way over to the door he saluted mark then turned without a word and hobbled from the room mcconnell heard him thumpbumping his way slowly down the stairs the three flights took him nearly three minutes after the echoes faded mcconnell went to the window pushed it open and sucked in great gulps of cold air his skin was tingling just as he had finally begun to accept the idea that his brother had perished bravely in an air battle pascal randazzo had appeared like a specter to shatter even this grim comfort david had not died in battle he had been brutally murdered in cold blood murdered by hitlers infamous black corps the schutzstaffeln the ss one of mcconnells clearest childhood memories was of the day his younger brother was born their father had delivered david himself his medical practice had long been moribund but he insisted upon bringing his own son into the world mark remembered the look of pride on his fathers scarred face one of the only times the pride was in himself and not his sons he braced his hands on the stone window casement and leaned out the air here was so different from the sweltering nights of his youth the dark parapets and spires rising from the icy english cobbles did look like something out of robin hood a great castle a fortress and wasnt that what he had used it for a place of refuge from the war for five years he had worked here in safety while braver men had given their lives to fight the nazis they had watched friends die just as randazzo had yet they fought on in spite of their fear i know you doctor the young jew with brigadier smith had told him youre no coward youre a fool you believe in reason in the essential goodness of man you believe that if you refuse to commit evil yourself someday you will conquer evil you have yet to taste even a sip of the pain so many have drunk to the dregs in the last ten years ive had my sip of pain mcconnell said softly the feeling churning in his belly was like nothing he had ever known bitter burning volatile it was fury he realized an inchoate anger so profound he could not give shape to it he tried to fight it to remember the words thoughtful men had spoken about the futility of violence as a means to a better world but compared to the images flashing behind his eyes those words meant nothing they were merely aggregates of letters symbols of the futility of language in the face of deeds he turned away from the window and went to his small cluttered desk he rummaged in the top drawer for a few moments then pulled out a small white card he lifted the telephone and placed a call to london to the number on the card despite the late hour the phone was answered on the third ring smith here said a gruff voice brigadier this is doctor mark mcconnell there was a pause what can i do for you doctor that trip you mentioned germany smith grunted what about it whatever it is ill do it the brigadier said nothing for some time get some sleep he said finally dont say any goodbyes well take care of all that ill send a driver to your house at sharp mcconnell set the phone in its cradle and walked out of the laboratory without looking back at ten before midnight the telephone rang in a london police station the duty officer listened to the gruff voice on the line for a few moments then hung up and grumbled thinks hes the bloody first sea lord that one who the ell was it bill asked the night jailer the duty officer squared his shoulders with exaggerated crispness brigadier duff bloody smith thats who whos he when hes at home im not sure curses like a regimental sergeantmajor though what did he want the jewboy told me to have him washed and ready by six in the morning or hed have my balls for breakfast you going to oblige the duty officer scowled aye i reckon smiths got connections with the commissioner thats how the jewboys been here all week without being charged the night jailer raised a bushy eyebrow id hop to it bill itll take a while to clean him up the duty officer hiked his belt over a bulging belly im glad to be rid of that bastard to be honest makes me nervous hardly said a word since his first day in its his eyes i think hed cut both our throats for a shilling thats a flippin jew for you bill mcconnell rolled over and read the clock hanging on his bedroom wall it was after three am but he could not find sleep he had gone to bed at midnight dozed for an hour then sat bolt upright in a fit of compulsion one facet of the proposed mission had not been discussed antinerve agent protection and he did not intend to rely on any gear duff smith might supply he dressed quietly and bicycled back to the university let himself into his lab and quietly removed two prototype antigas suits he had been secretly experimenting with for the last month the ride home with the heavy gear strapped to the bike had nearly exhausted him but the suits and tanks now lay packed in two suitcases at the foot of his bed yet something else had kept him twisting in the bedclothes long after that brigadier smith had ordered him not to say any goodbyes and he had tried to obey but the sense of something important left undone of words left unsaid was too powerful to ignore with a soft curse he climbed out of bed lit a candle at the small desk in his room and picked up his fountain pen the letter to susan came fairly easily it was probably not much different than the millions of letters written by other husbands during the war he apologized for sending her home during the battle of britain and told her he had been faithful during the years since which was true there had been no children yet and he regretted that but in the end it would make it easier for her to build a new life should the worst happen the second letter took more time when he thought of his mother he felt a terrible guilt a sense that he had no right to risk his own life no matter what the cause no right to risk taking away her only surviving son yet it was his life and in the end she would understand that he lifted the pen and wrote dear mother if you have received this letter i am no longer in this world you have taken hard blows in your life and do not deserve this one but what i went to do i had to do dad would say that i threw my life away in a useless attempt to revenge davids death but you know me better than that i have learned that there is truly an infinite capacity for evil in the human heart and because of my abilities i have an opportunity and probably an obligation to do what i can to stop it there just comes a time when a man says enough there are some practical matters to be attended to back during the blitz i wrote a will and mailed it to old mr ward in town as you know the monthly payments he disburses to you and susan come from my six industrial patents it is a strange irony but with the war expansion the proceeds from those patents have grown to a substantial amount of money in the will i assigned three of those patents to susan and three to you it gives me great comfort to know that you will never have to worry about getting by again or work so hard as you did during the depression in my letter to susan i wrote that she should remarry and try to make a new life with the children she deserves i hope you will encourage her in that but she is not the only one who needs encouragement it may not be a sons place to speak of these things to his mother but i am after dad passed i think you sealed away a part of yourself in the belief that david and i would never understand if you ever loved another man that is a noble sentiment but it is wrong david and i and yes dad too wanted nothing so much in life as your happiness you always said you were a tough old girl but you are not so old and no one should have to spend their life with only memories not one day of my life passed without you in my thoughts i know the same was true for david god bless you and keep you your son mark he sealed each letter in a separate envelope then wrote a short covering letter asking the don he billeted with to forward the letters to georgia if he had not heard from mark in ninety days he laid both envelopes on top of the letter blew out the candle and went back to bed this time sleep did not elude him it came without warning and without dreams a sleep so deep it was almost like death at onetwenty am brigadier duff smiths telephone rang for the last time that night smith here he answered i gave it my best shot brigadier the scotsman leaned back in his chair you earned your money corporal it worked asked the voice i wrote the bloody script didnt i christ sir you did that all right i felt so sorry for the poor bastard i could barely tell the story it was the details that clinched it and the plaster cast wow it was like it really happened it was easy that story was not fiction corporal it has really happened jeez it really got to me hurting the guy that bad you dont want the money then hey i want every fucking cent i earned it five hundred simoleans brigadier smith chuckled cynically i foresee a stellar career for you in the american cinema corporal he hung up the telephone consulted a calendar scrawled a few notes on a pad then made his last call of the night it was answered by a male secretary but after eight minutes the brigadier was rewarded with the unmistakable voice of winston churchill i hope this is bloody important duff the prime minister growled you pulled me away from the marx brothers the doctor is in winston there was a pause how soon can you get here by the end of the film probably dont let any yanks see you duff theyre creeping around london like phantoms at the bloody opera pour me a glenfiddich if you have it done a woman was speaking yiddish in the darkness she spoke with the guttural inflections of eastern europe but rachel jansen had no trouble understanding her she would have understood even if she had not known yiddish despair needs no translation every woman in the block had gathered in a tight circle around a guttering candle hooded by a tin can they sat on the floor with their knees under them listening like mourners in a dark temple the candlelight did little to smooth their stark prematurely old faces and it absolutely died in the hollows of their eyes all but frau hagan wore the yellow triangle on their shifts rachel had never seen or imagined anything like this ritual the women called it der ring the circle each night they gathered in this way and spoke by turns emptying their memories children were banished from the block during the circle and rachel soon learned why the stories told here would have plunged childrens minds into black depression and nightmares scarring them forever they were difficult enough for adults to endure but every woman in the room already bore indelible scars what could it hurt to hear others reveal their own at least they could share their misery but sharing misery was not the purpose of the circle its purpose was to record a woman called the scribe wrote down in shorthand everything that was said paying particular attention to names dates and places each night the scribes annotated record was hidden in a space behind the wall where insulation would be had insulation been provided for the barracks which it had not after hearing a single nights entries into that record rachel had known she would never have the courage to read the full text it was no less than a testament of the unwillingness or perhaps worse the inability of god to protect his servants with great effort she managed to block out the speakers voice she admired the purpose of the circle but for the past four nights she had used this time to digest whatever she had learned during the day and to try to apply that knowledge to her familys survival unlike the other new widows who walked through the camp in various states of lethargy rachel strained to catch every conversation sifting each for some scrap of information that might help protect her children already she had experienced extremes of hope and despair first she had learned that if she and her family had been captured a few months earlier her children would never have been picked out of the line at auschwitz but sent directly to its gas chambers but with international pressure building against the rumors of nazi death camps the ss had decided to create special family sections inside certain camps red cross inspectors would be allowed admittance at the front gate then steered down prepared routes to areas where they would witness scenes of family life not so different from that outside the camp fence albeit with fewer material comforts they would leave confident that the grisly rumors were the exaggerations of frightened jews frau hagan told rachel that when reichsführer himmler mentioned this program to herr doktor brandt brandt had jumped at the chance and the system had brought certain benefits a few families were spared the agony of forced separation which frau hagan claimed was worse than death for some as she had seen such separations drive mothers to suicide but the odd thing was since the adoption of the family camp system not one red cross inspector had ever been granted admittance to totenhausen it was not until yesterday that rachel learned why and the answer had left her in a permanent state of terror it seemed that until recently klaus brandts talents were not sufficiently taxed by his poison gas experiments on behalf of reichsführer himmler as a hobby he had taken up private researches into the etiology of spinal meningitis some said he had done this with an eye toward developing patentable medicines with which he could make a fortune after the war in any case brandts research used up children at a staggering rate as his normal method was to inject meningococcus bacteria into healthy spines then chart the effectiveness or failure of various compounds against the infection brandts adoption of the family camp system insured a constant flow of children for his experiments frau hagan claimed the meningitis research had slowed considerably in recent weeks but rachel was not comforted the thought that jan or hannah could be plucked from the appellplatz at any moment and taken to the hospital to have deadly bacteria injected into their bodies was simply too horrifying to shut out the thought that any children were at risk of this that some in fact were dying in agony in the hospital on this very night kept her in a constant state of near panic she now devoted every waking moment to discovering some way to have her children exempted from these experiments a sudden sob from the circle broke her train of thought a listener had been moved to tears by the speakers words rachel found herself drawn into the narrative by morbid fascination the speakers story was so much more harrowing than her own it made her nervous to think what she would say when her turn came the trucks were in the square the woman said determinedly focusing her eyes on the bare floorboards as if her old village were standing there in miniature the ss beat everyone out of their homes those who were too slow about it who stayed behind to pack some valuables or necessities they died first i had believed the worst rumors on the day before id already packed a bag there were rifle shots from every direction they caused panic at first but most of us hurried toward the trucks we were like cattle no one wanted to know what the shots meant mothers shouting to their children children alone screaming the men calling to each other asking what they should do what could they do the ss had already shot the mayor and the police chief from the bed of the truck we saw the worst of it the children the poor babies on praga street the germans were killing the babies outright smashing their heads with rifle butts swinging them by the heels against walls i myself saw an ss grab an infant from hannah karpik and dash its head against the street cobbles hannah went mad tearing out her hair and beating her fists against the ss after a few seconds he took out his pistol and shot her in the stomach then left her for dead the woman shrugged that was the germans in damosc in lodz too echoed a woman from the outer edge of the circle the same but worse while we stood in lines in the square the ss backed a flat truck up to the hospital wall we could not understand what they were doing someone opened a third floor window then small packages began flying out of the window when the second package landed in the bed of the truck we realized what it was they were throwing the newborn babies down from the nursery three floors they laughed while they did it like barbarians from the dark ages said the first woman our rabbi was crying out to god to deliver us while a young man cursed god in a voice twice as loud on that night i felt the boy was right how could god watch that slaughter and not be moved to act its always the same said another woman a voice much older and cracked with phlegm why write them down the same story told a hundred times a thousand times no one cares that is why we must write them all frau hagan said forcefully to show what the hun is really doing good men sometimes do bad things in war but with the ss it is the rule it is policy our stories piled on other stories each one documented can prove this madness only then will it be impossible for them to deny it later later scoffed a disembodied voice what is later who will be left to dig up our papers our stories who will be left to listen soon the germans will own the world cover your stupid mouth said frau hagan there is always a reckoning the red army is coming to set us free stalin will crush hitler into the ice of russia drown his tanks in the pripet marshes we must be ready when the soldiers arrive we must point out the butchers to them stalin wont come hitler almost took moscow in fortyone anyway stalin hates jews as much as hitler it doesnt matter the streets of moscow will soon have german names liar frau hagan snapped emptyheaded fool ask the dutch girl she came from amsterdam she had a radio ask her about stalin ask her about the red army all eyes turned to rachel tell them urged frau hagan its true rachel confirmed the russians began a winter offensive in december only days before i was captured i heard that they had advanced into poland as i told you frau hagan said triumphantly i heard also on the bbc that they were driving the germans back across the ukraine nearly fifty faces turned to rachel and fired questions at her in a jumble of languages what was happening in estonia in warsaw italy what about the americans the english im afraid i dont know much she apologized there are rumors of an invasion this year they say that every year said a disparaging voice they will not come they dont care about us a long shriek suddenly pierced the night the women in the circle fell silent rachel had heard screaming earlier like several women shouting for help but it had come from farther away from the direction of the ss barracks and she had been unable to make frau hagan take notice of it but when the second shriek sounded this one obviously from close by frau hagans face told rachel she sensed real danger i may have to speak to frau komorowski the block leader said dont risk it said a woman let them solve their own problems frau hagan ruminated ill wait a few minutes finish the story brana should i hide the papers asked the scribe what if the screams make them search finish the story the woman called brana resumed her narrative telling of the open trucks driving through the winter blast to meet a prison train at an empty stretch of track of families loaded into unheated cattle cars as rachels had been without food water or toilets rachel found herself unwillingly reliving her own nightmare journey from westerbork when something raised the hairs on her upper arms quiet she warned in a sharp voice frau hagan glared at her what is it dutch girl there is someone outside hide your papers frau hagan looked skeptical heinke is listening at the door she has heard nothing hide the papers i tell you frau hagan snatched the papers from the scribe and stuffed them under her shift her eyes went to the woman called heinke at the door anything the guard shook her head frau hagan curled her upper lip at rachel ss heinke hissed suddenly into the bunks the hooded candle was instantly extinguished a wild scramble ensued as the women found their allotted places in the tiered bunks rachel realized then that they had practiced this maneuver a thousand times the only sounds she heard were the grunts and curses of the new women as they stubbed toes and barked shins in their inexperienced haste she admired the oldtimers walking quickly without sound was a skill she had mastered long ago in amsterdam and not an easy one holding her breath in her own bunk she waited for the slamming door and pounding boots of an ss search team instead she heard a furtive knock then the door cracked open and a shadow slipped through hagan whispered the shadow irina is that you da everyone stay in your bunks ordered frau hagan rachel heard the muted thud of the heavy poles feet hitting the floor frau hagan crossed the room in total darkness and held a whispered conversation with the kapo of the christian womens block in less than a minute the door opened and closed again another child has gone missing frau hagan announced to the room a gypsy child there was a heavy silence a boy child asked a quiet voice yes eight years old rachel heard a whimper in the darkness that was his mother we heard screaming frau komorowski ordered her gagged and tied to her bunk for her own protection the gypsy had told them she was going to doktor brandts quarters to get her son back she named the right place said a voice god help the boy said another it is unspeakable was it the same as before frau hagan answered wearily a latvian political saw ariel weitz talking to this gypsy boy earlier today rachel heard spitting and cursing in the darkness then voices that changed almost too rapidly to follow devil hissed one woman one of the men should squash that worm we should kill him ourselves dont talk madness said frau hagan kill weitz and we all die he serves brandt so brandt protects him sturm protects him even schörner protects weitz and schörner despises him schörner uses him too said a knowing voice weitz informs for schörner to think he was born a jew mused another weitz is worse than the ss a thousand times worse the shoemaker is also a jew observed frau hagan the shoemaker makes shoes weitz summons children to be violated then killed what about the last boy probably gassed with the men someone speculated no said frau hagan he was shot last week at the pit why didnt you tell us asked a dismayed voice what could you have done yascha rachel realized then that frau hagan could recognize people by the timbre of their whispers enough talk the pole said conclusively after a brief silence she said you have good ears dutch girl irina flattened herself against the outside wall to avoid the searchlight is that what you heard rachel swallowed i heard something i lived in hiding for three years in amsterdam above a shop there were customers in and out all day the slightest noise meant danger you learned well from now on you will guard the door rachel closed her eyes was that a good thing to be guard if it kept her in frau hagans good graces it probably was but would the woman called heinke become her enemy now did you hear me dutch girl frau hagan asked tomorrow i guard the door yes now sleep everyone rachel heard the creak of brittle wood as the block leader climbed into her bunk since her second day in camp rachel had watched the men with pink badges and every other man like a mother hen but so far had detected no sign of impropriety toward jan could the commandant of totenhausen be the danger frau hagan had warned her about could there be two kinds of selection that had to be avoided to survive if so how could she protect her son the herr doktor held absolute power of life and death over every inmate he had already ordered the death of her husband if klaus brandt wanted to abuse her jan she was helpless to stop him with a shiver of loathing rachel remembered ariel weitz if weitz was brandts procurer perhaps he could be bribed to leave jan alone she had the five diamonds yet even if weitz could be bought would it help brandt probably chose his victims while walking through the camp in his white coat pretending to be a healer it was unspeakable yet it was reality she could not fly back to holland with her children beneath her wings she would have to think of something where could help lie the shoemaker had proved he had compassion but rachel had hardly seen the man in the past four days and what of anna kaas the young nurse obviously felt some sympathy for the prisoners could she suggest some way to keep jan out of harms way rachel thought of jan and hannah lying in the jewish childrens block just meters away a sephardic jewess from salonica had the job of sleeping in the childrens block to keep order at supper rachel had given her half of her own bread ration in exchange for a promise that jan and hannah would be allowed to sleep side by side shed considered offering the woman a full weeks ration in exchange for her job but finally decided against it a week without bread would set her on the road to starvation and while she would be closer to her children she would be farther from the adult women who knew the rules of survival particularly frau hagan as a german shepherd howled on the camp perimeter rachel decided that the block leader was her tether to life her bridge to survival whatever frau hagan needed she would get from rachel jansen guarding the door would be only the beginning mcconnells driver arrived in oxford at six am as brigadier smith had promised one hour later he deposited his passenger and two extremely heavy suitcases at the entrance to kings cross station in london with instructions to board train which departed at am for edinburgh scotland the station echoed with the voices of servicemen from ten different countries wearing dozens of different uniforms and all apparently more lost than mcconnell he did not see how he could possibly find smith or how smith could find him in the throng yet as he sidestepped a canadian in the midst of bidding a tearful farewell to an english girl six inches taller than himself he felt someone tug at his arm he turned and looked into the twinkling blue eyes of duff smith the soe chief wore a natty tweed jacket with the left sleeve pinned to the shoulder no uniform today brigadier duff smith smiled but said nothing he led mcconnell to a private compartment a luxury beyond price on the crowded train jonas stern sat sullenly beside the window after closing the door smith shook mcconnells hand and said in a jovial voice glad to have you aboard doctor mcconnell nodded at stern but the young man offered no greeting mcconnells trained eye instantly noted the faded hematomas beneath his skin obviously stern had not spent a peaceful week since their last meeting whats all that rubbish sputtered brigadier smith pointing at mcconnells bags youre not going to brighton for the month you know i know its equipment and its necessary well be supplying your gear for this trip doctor youll have to leave these behind you cant supply this equipment brigadier smith looked intrigued lets have a look then mcconnell turned the heavy suitcases on their sides and opened them one contained what appeared to be a pile of folded rubber topped by some type of transparent rain gear for the head the other case held two yellow cylinders about twenty inches long and some corrugated rubber tubing is that german printed on those tanks smith asked yes these are portable oxygen cylinders taken from crashed luftwaffe bombers i figured if were trying to pass ourselves off as german we should be carrying german equipment good thinking doctor really but i dont think ive ever seen a gas suit quite like that its the latest american impermeable suit how in gods name did you get hold of it i still have a few friends stateside brigadier edgewood arsenal in alabama ive been experimenting with this suit for a month now the clear vinyl gas mask was developed for soldiers with severe head wounds i modified it to accept a hose from these oxygen cylinders using some new equipment from the underwater diving field i also developed and installed a specially trained acetate diaphragm to enhance speech capability youre looking at the only airtight suit in the world that allows soldiers to see each others faces and speak while fighting brigadier smith looked at stern i told you he was the right man for this job eh for once jonas stern had no glib remark ready do you have two of those suits he asked mcconnell closed the cases and sat down opposite him yes and youre damn lucky were about the same size brigadier smith picked up a straw basket from the floor rations in here lads i wont be making the trip with you but ill see you sometime tomorrow so where are we going stern asked cant you tell me now that hes finally here smith stuck out his lower lip if you must know youre going to achnacarry castle where in gods name is that duff smith smiled hed heard that question repeated a hundred times before achnacarry the name alone was enough to send some men into a cold sweat some say its the end of the world he said but theres others who claim achnacarrys the next thing to heaven mostly scotsmen camerons at that mcconnell looked up sharply at the name cameron why the hell are we going there stern pressed smith stopped smiling first secrecy second training third time gentlemen i cannot tell you why but the time factor has suddenly become critical in eleven days the target of our mission will cease to have any strategic value but if time is a problem stern argued why go all the way to scotland for gods sake just tell me what you want done and put us into germany ill make sure it gets done the brigadier shook his head you may have harried the germans in north africa laddie but you dont beard the lion in his den without some specialized training we have eleven days you are about to spend seven of those with the toughest men in the british army the co at achnacarry which is now called the commando depot by the way is a friend of mine and he has generously agreed to have his instructors pound their hardearned knowledge into your thick skull in seven days you will be a different man mr stern a better man and just possibly ready to accomplish the mission im sending you to do smith ended the argument by stepping out of the compartment change trains in edinburgh he told them you want spean bridge station therell be someone waiting for you id conserve those rations charlie vaughan runs a tight ship if you reach the castle late there may not be supper the brigadier looked at his two recruits for several moments cheer up he said by the time you reach spean you should be fast friends he laughed softly as he marched off down the corridor mcconnell leaned back into the corner of the compartment he wasnt sure exactly where spean bridge was but he thought it was well up into the scottish highlands possibly near loch ness it was going to be a long trip the train lurched forward exactly on time and gathered speed rapidly as it moved north out of london the day was clear and cold the sky gray after several minutes stern said what changed your mind doctor what made you decide to come on this mission mcconnell kept looking out of the window none of your business he said in a neutral tone are you sure youve got the nerve for it this mission could get bloody you know i wouldnt want your pacifist sensibilities to be offended mcconnell slowly turned from the window you obviously like fighting he said but im not your problem whoever youre mad at take it out on them this is going to be a long ride he settled back into his seat and closed his eyes stern stared furiously at him for a while then turned to the window and watched the winter countryside as the swaying train rumbled past alexandra palace the two men did not speak again for the next eight hours spean bridge shouted a highpitched voice stretching out the syllables until the words were barely recognizable when mcconnell blinked himself awake stern the picnic basket and one of the suitcases were gone spean bridge shouted the conductor for the third and last time mcconnell snatched up the other case and scrambled out of the compartment he found stern on the station platform huddled beneath a green awning eating a soggy sandwich from which the bread crust had been cut away cold rain poured relentlessly from a slate sky dark forbidding hills rose on all sides of the village of spean they looked to be made of solid rock cloaked with frost and crowned with snow it was still early in the afternoon but mcconnell had the feeling night was coming on then he realized that it was darkness fell early in the highlands in winter and dawn came very late as the train chugged out of the station he looked around the platform it was as deserted as the greenandwhite station building which was locked tight smith said there would be someone to meet us mcconnell said i dont see anybody sourfaced and puffy from sleep stern said nothing mcconnell reached into the picnic basket and took out a sandwich just then he saw a tall figure wearing a kilt and a green beret standing motionless at the end of the platform the tartan was predominantly red with highlights of yellow and forest green doctor mcconnell the man called rolling the r with a highland burr thats me the kilted man marched toward them mcconnell had never dreamed he would be intimidated by a man wearing a dress but he was well over six feet tall the newcomer stopped and stood in the freezing rain outside the awning as casually as if he were basking in may sunshine there was an unsettling animal strength about him his chest was high and broad and the calves that stretched his stockings looked sculpted from bronze shortcropped hair framed a chiseled handsome face illuminated by sea blue eyes sergeant ian mcshane the giant said mildly youre stern i ken stern nodded mcconnell held out his hand but the sergeant just looked at it i dinna ken much about you mcshane said and i dinna need to know more our business has nothing to do with who you really are from now on mcconnell youre mr wilkes he looked at stern youre mr butler the highlander eyed both men from head to toe either of you ever in the military then stern straightened ive had some experience have you now well well find out tomorrow what we have to work with its fallen to me to shepherd you two through a wee bit o training quite irregular actually still the macvaughan ordered it thats the way itll be with a last appraising look at his charges sergeant mcshane turned and walked back the way he had come stern and mcconnell looked at each other then snatched up their bags and hurried after him at the end of the platform they saw the scotsman climb into a covered jeep and start the engine hey mcconnell yelled sergeant wait mcshane leaned out and said follow this road west across the caledonian canal turn north at gairlochy march along the loch till you sight bunarkaig then up the switchback road to the castle its about seven miles all told you cant get lost but theres plenty of room in the jeep stern objected mcshanes blue eyes seemed to grow tired thats no the point at all mr butler nobody rides to achnacarry their first time up all transport is by foot he glanced at sterns worn leather shoes well get you some proper gear at the castle i will take those bags for you though mcconnell loaded the heavy suitcases into the jeep then tossed sterns leather bag after them but its pouring rain stern shouted sergeant mcshane looked skyward and smiled aye its pissin it down all right i suggest you get used to it mr butler it always rains at achnacarry stern whirled toward mcconnell perhaps to suggest that they try to board the jeep by force but the american was no longer standing behind him he was walking toward the main road leaning grimly into the rain see you at the castle mr butler sergeant mcshane said the jeep spun its tires and fishtailed onto the road headed west leaving stern standing alone in the mud stern slung the picnic basket over his shoulder and trotted after mcconnell catching him on the stone bridge for which the village had been named where are you going he yelled lets wait for the rain to stop it may not stop mcconnell said walking faster on the rising grade stern quickened his pace and punched mcconnell on the right shoulder do you really want to walk seven miles through freezing rain no i dont so i think ill run it even with these hills it probably shouldnt take more than an hour and a half two hours at the most what mcconnell broke into a trot leaving stern fuming in the road his dark hair plastered to his head stern took the last sandwich from the basket and wolfed it down he watched the american top a ridge disappear then reappear a quarter mile farther on a dim shadow against the gray wall of rain growing steadily smaller arschloch he muttered in africa he had walked over endless miles of desert without water when forced to but schlepping up these mountains in a driving rain when there were surely options available was insane he kicked the empty picnic basket and began jogging up the road he kept up his pace for about a mile and a half then slowed to a lopsided walk so that he could massage the knifelike stitch in his right side all he could see ahead was more hills a long black lake and a few tiny stone houses no traffic on the road no sign of mcconnell no castle then he saw the bicycle mcconnell reached the top of the switchback road that led to achnacarry castle exactly sixty minutes after he started running the steep hills combined with the thrashing wind and rain had nearly beaten him but hed made it the outlines of a great baronial house emerged from the darkness warm yellow light glowed in one upper window he slowed to a walk and made for the building down the shallow slope below the castle the gleaming tin roofs of prefabricated nissen huts made a strange contrast to the medieval landscape he had seen so far as he neared the castle something else caught his eye it was a row of graves the graves followed the line of the drive each was marked by a white cross and a board which bore a name rank and brief epitaph the first one mcconnell stooped over read he showed himself on a ridge line the second read failed to take appropriate cover under mortar barrage as he stood puzzling over the inscriptions he heard a slow creak then a familiar voice called out of the darkness the dead dinna mind the rain mr wilkes sergeant mcshane but id advise the livin to get indoors mcconnell jogged up to the great wooden door wiped his muddy shoes and squeezed past mcshanes broad body he found himself in a spacious entrance hall which had been stripped of all furniture wheres your friend then mcshane asked mr butler mcconnell shrugged back out there somewhere i guess the highlander eyed him with new interest im not surprised you must have set a cracking pace to make it that quickly ive done a little running have you now well thats a handy thing to have done if youre required to spend any time at achnacarry mr wilkes theres many a man who wished hed done more of it ive seen university distance runners fall flat in these hills the scots lips cracked into a tight smile course eighty pounds of gear on their backs doesna help much suddenly the front door was shoved open from outside mcconnell turned and saw jonas stern standing in the doorway with a satisfied smile on his face he was wet to the skin but didnt look at all winded before mcconnell or sergeant mcshane could speak he said butler reporting for duty sergeant mcconnell looked at the sergeant with bewilderment but the dour scot was an old hand at appearing unflappable you made good time mr butler he said i was about to lock the door go ahead mcshane did then led them through a hall dark with wainscoting and turned up a wide staircase youll stay in the castle until further notice he said youll see hundreds of men coming and going in all manner of kit speaking several languages theyre commando trainees you leave them be theyll do the same some will be instructors theyre not marked as such but you wont have any trouble tellin who they are not if they all look like you mcconnell thought sergeant mcshane looked like a highland clan chief whod stepped straight out of the eighteenth century remember the scotsman said youre mr wilkes and mr butler dinna be givin those names unless youre asked the co of the depot is colonel vaughan you two may not be military but youd better snap to if he comes near the macvaughan doesna suffer fools gladly they stopped in a dim passage with heavy wooden doors on either side mcshane pointed to the second door on the right stern pushed it open inside the small square room were two cots a paraffin lamp which had been burning for some time and a bare clothes rack baths up the passage mcshane said no hot water in this part of the castle he put his forefinger between sterns shoulder blades and shoved him into the room mcconnell quickly followed so as to stop any overreaction on sterns part you two must be important the sergeant mused youre the first civilians i know of to pass through achnacarry mcconnell bent over one of the cots and picked up a horsehair rope about four feet long with a permanent loop at one end and a straight wooden handle about six inches long attached to the other an identical rope lay on the other cot whats this he asked toggle rope mcshane said every commando carries one at all times youll soon see why i dinna want to see you without it thats it then ill see you at breakfast six am he turned and started back toward the staircase mcconnell went after him and called is a brigadier duff smith staying in the castle tonight sergeant mcshane didnt break stride i canna charge my memory about that just now mr wilkes realizing he would learn nothing else until morning mcconnell went back to the room and began taking off his wet clothes he stripped to the skin as his shorts were soaked through then climbed into bed stern paced the hall for a few moments then did the same mcconnell thought it odd that stern turned off the lamp before removing his clothes it was almost as if he were trying to hide his body mcconnell lay silent in the dark for some time but he could not go to sleep without asking one question howd you make it up here so fast he said finally you found someone to give you a ride stern answered in english giving a fair rendition of mcconnells georgia drawl none of your business is it mr wilkes mcconnell took the barb in silence he wondered if stern realized that their code names had been taken from margaret mitchells gone with the wind it had been the biggest picture of but god only knew what corner of the desert jonas stern had been living in then duff smith had obviously selected the code names knowing that mcconnell would realize the significance of being named after the milquetoast ashley wilkes he was nearly asleep when sterns disembodied voice said did you see those grave markers mcconnell blinked in the chilly darkness i saw them nothing but dirt under those crosses what do you mean the graves are empty right how do you know i know the british army fought with them in africa on their side if you can believe it those graves are typical of their crap they put those crosses there to scare recruits showed himself on a ridge line what rot the british armys just like those graves mcconnell saw nothing to be gained by arguing with stern about the british i guess well find out tomorrow he said stern grunted contemptuously in the darkness sweet dreams mr wilkes he said in german come morning ill show those limey bastards commando training mcconnell kicked stern out of bed at nine am after a quick trip to the toilet at the end of the hall he dressed in the clothes mcshane had provided army denims gaiters and a heavy green cotton smock last he put on the toggle rope with its loop at one end and short handle at the other he coiled it around his hand then clipped the coil to the web belt he found in the clothes bag stern was already dressed and standing by the door you dont have your toggle rope mcconnell reminded him i dont need it mcconnell shrugged and led the way to the first floor of the castle they met sergeant mcshane in the entrance hall the highlander wore his green beret but he had forgone his kilt in favor of denims a khaki shirt and camouflaged rain smock i was about to come lookin for you he said you missed breakfast were ready said stern ready mcshane stared at him in amazement i dinna see your toggle rope i dont need the damned thing oh youll be needin it mr butler now go back and get it move when stern returned with the rope mcshane led them outside into a gray highland dawn the smell of wood and peat smoke mingled with the scent of coffee and pine bringing mcconnell fully awake at last he could see the place to which brigadier smith had sent them achnacarry itself was built of gray stone with crenelated parapets and mock turrets at the corners the gurgle of water from behind it announced a river he could not see but beyond the castle roof rose wooded hills shrouded in mist like that in the foothills of the appalachian mountains in northern georgia a majestic treelined drive led down from the castle to the glen below where a great loch with a surface like burnished silver lay in the growing light but the pastoral scene ended there achnacarrys expansive lawns were dotted with corrugated steel nissen huts and canvas bell tents a metropolis of instant housing in the center of a field mcconnell saw a tent as big as an aircraft hangar and just across the drive the long row of graves stern claimed were empty not far from the graves a powerfully built soldier of about fifty was speaking to a tall bearded farmer twenty years his senior the soldiers voice modulated quickly between apology and indignation his accent the furthest thing imaginable from highland scots thats the colonel sergeant mcshane said mcconnell was perplexed thats colonel vaughan aye but thats a london accent i thought he was a highlander like yourself i thought he was lord of the castle mcshane laughed the laird you mean no no the real laird cameron of lochiel moved two miles up the loch to clunes for the duration but he keeps an eye on his place make no mistake its his duty to all camerons around the world mcconnell regarded the heavyjowled colonel vaughan seemed a bit on the bulky side for a commando though he certainly looked as tough as an old army boot vaughans a commando himself mcshane shook his head exregimental sergeant major in the guards i dont see any commandos stern observed theyre on their thirtysixhour scheme should be in any time though whats a thirtysixhour scheme mcconnell asked exactly what it sounds like thirtysix hours of running up and down the lochaber hills in full kit under live fire be glad you missed it they were out in that storm last night aye and its a good thing they didna run across you two a cacophony of wild primitive screams rose out of the trees from behind the castle what the hells that mcconnell asked mock assault on the arkaig bridge climax of the scheme mcconnell watched in amazement as over a hundred commandos wearing strange cloth caps charged out from behind the castle with bayonets fixed whats that theyre yelling sergeant who knows theyre free french blokes by the time the french commandos reached the nissen huts their enthusiasm had vanished as they collapsed around their tents colonel vaughan marched up the drive cursing under his breath what is it sir sergeant mcshane asked vaughans face glowed red with anger some fool pinched a bicycle from a crofters hut down the hill bloody beggars accusing one of our lads one of ours sir right claims no one local would have pinched it says everyone knows its his only transport other than his carthorse mcconnell looked stern in the eye but saw no reaction if he turns out to be right vaughan bellowed ill flay the man who did it we cant afford to offend the locals and god forbid lochiel should hear of it he glanced suspiciously down the hill at the exhausted frenchmen suppose one of the frogs could have pinched it he mused seems unlikely though at last vaughans eyes focused on stern and mcconnell whats this lot then dummies for the bayonet course theyre our special guests sir vaughan stuck out his lower lip and gave them a measuring look duffs boys eh very well carry on as we discussed sergeant yes sir and you look into that bicycle aye colonel vaughan started to go then paused tucked his chin into his chest and squinted at stern mcconnell wondered what had caught his interest the desert tan sterns languid posture the insolent curve of his mouth the colonel leaned his massive head in toward sterns chest and spoke with paternal familiarity youd best get that chip off your shoulder lad before somebody knocks it off vaughan cut his eyes at mcshane happens quite often round here eh sergeant seems to mcshane confirmed now that you mention it colonel vaughan nodded once at mcconnell then disappeared into his castle sergeant mcshane stared pointedly at stern know anything about a missing bicycle stern silently returned the stare right mcshane said lets get to business not much daylight in winter as the sergeant led them across the grounds mcconnell leaned toward stern and whispered whered you hide the bicycle dont know what youre talking about said stern sergeant mcshane eventually stopped on top of a small hillock on the other side a stocky man of about forty sat on a camp stool smoking a cigarette with obvious enjoyment a clipboard and a pen lay on the ground beside him my orders said mcshane are to see where you two stand as far as taking care of yourselves were going to check your godgiven ability first weapons come later lets see how youd do if you were caught without one the instructor on the stool grinned up at mcshane funny how often that very thing tends to happen isnt it ian true enough john are you busy these two will only be with us for a few days not at all just put a few poles through their paces youre the unarmed combat instructor stern asked the man on the stool frowned at the sound of sterns voice german accents were seldom heard in the lochaber hills mcshane said all of us are qualified to teach any part of the course but sergeant lewis does specialize a bit this part of the course is actually called silent killing sergeant lewis stood up and grinned again though this time his eyes stayed sober step into my parlor lad ill let my friend warm you up stern said mcconnell turned to mcshane is this really necessary get on with it mr wilkes mcconnell eased cautiously down the bank he felt his pulse quickening his entire pugilistic experience consisted of one round of boxing in a makeshift ring in the fairplay high school gymnasium it was the week after tunney hammered jack dempsey for the title in philadelphia the high school boys had caught a sevenday boxing fever his opponent had been a head shorter and fifteen pounds lighter than himself he remembered because in less than three minutes the smaller boy had hit him harder faster and more times than he had ever been hit in his life those three minutes had been an education he suspected he was in for a similar experience now dont be shy sergeant lewis said come right in mcconnell held up his fists in a classic boxing stance right arm bent slightly at the elbow left fist brushing his tucked chin sensing his hesitation lewis stepped forward and smiled offering his head as a target mcconnell tried the only ruse he knew he let his eyes drop to his opponents belly feinted at the body with a left jab then drove his right fist straight at sergeant lewiss chin when he ceased his forward motion he was sitting on his butt four feet beyond the spot where lewis had been standing the instructor had apparently converted the momentum of his punch into some kind of judo throw youre no a fighter mr wilkes lewis said thats plain enough i wont even try to explain what i did then because we dont have time for you to learn he turned to mcshane ill do what i can ian but i say fit him up with a pistol and pray he doesnt get caught without it mcshane nodded in agreement then motioned to mcconnell who climbed gratefully back up the bank your turn mr butler sergeant lewis said his voice had a rather unpleasant edge to it stern walked easily down the bank his long arms swinging lightly sergeant lewis took a step toward him are you ready ready enough the instructor shook his head do you hear his accent ian i pegged him for a jew when i saw him but hes a bloody german to boot he turned back to stern say something else stern straightened up to his full height all right sergeant shut your fucking mouth lewiss face lit up with pleasure blow me he curses like an english sergeant he saw some action in north africa said mcshane did he now lewis began to slowly circle stern stern stood with his knees slightly bent hands hanging loose at his sides mcconnell thought he looked birdlike a thin statue of brown sinew and bone with only his eyes tracking the british sergeant lewis kept his hands high open and in front as he moved his body gave off a frightening intensity like a ball of knotted muscle and adrenaline but stern gave no indication that he planned to move for the remainder of the morning finally sergeant lewis took a step forward daring him to strike stern did nothing tired of this game lewis feinted with a curled right hand then fired his left foot at sterns head sterns response baffled both his opponent and his audience he stepped back in a motion that appeared almost leisurely at the same time driving his left hand sharply upward at a speed barely visible the sergeants whole body followed his kick skyward he turned a half somersault and crashed onto his back at sterns feet lewis scrambled up his face nearly purple with embarrassment and anger youre the cleverdick arent you john sergeant mcshane cut in i think thats enough bloody hell it is ask mr butler if its enough or is it mr birnbaum or rubenstein he shook his finger in sterns expressionless face you are a bloody fourbytwo arent you stern replied in a perfect british accent got something against jews have you mate i knew it ian knew it the second i saw his desert tan lewiss face quivered this is one of the bastards that crippled my brother wally in palestine could have been stern said quietly you bloody bastard mcshane shouted john but it was too late lewis was already moving toward stern his hands a blur mcconnell watched in disbelief as stern allowed himself to be struck twice three times defend yourself he yelled stern absorbed another blow that snapped his head back and left his cheek scarlet taking his reluctance to fight back as an opportunity to move in for the kill lewis abandoned the oriental chops and threw a curled fist straight at sterns throat before the punch could land stern dropped to the ground caught his weight on the fingers of his left hand and flung his right foot around in a great sweeping kick that snapped sergeant lewiss knee like a scytheblade mcconnell heard a crack then a highpitched yell as lewis went down both hands gripping his leg he moved instinctively toward the injured sergeant but mcshanes powerful hand restrained him mr butler move back up here right now stern looked up at the highlander then leaned over sergeant lewis and said an australian taught me that i guess you never met him then he walked slowly up to where mcshane and mcconnell waited that wasna smart mr butler mcshane said not smart at all he asked for it maybe but youre not here to advertise yourself mcshane looked down the bank lewis was massaging his rapidly swelling knee better have the mo check that for you john ill stop by his quarters tonight for a report this is nothing lewis yelled and struggled to his feet im still going ian mcshane turned to stern and mcconnell and said lets go where stern asked firing range suits me mcshane gave him a look of annoyance i thought it might at first the firing range seemed merely another venue for stern to demonstrate his martial prowess they arrived to find two frenchmen wrestling with a small roughly finished machine gun the weapons instructor a glaswegian named colin munro watched the spectacle sadly the gun would spit out a burst of bullets jam then clear just in time to startle the wits out of its operator that gentlemen sergeant mcshane said is a british sten marktwos in trained hands its prone to jamming in untrained hands its all but useless is that what were taking in stern asked no mcshane reached into a crate on the ground and brought out a welloiled submachine pistol of blueblack steel with a folding metal stock mcconnell saw stern grin with anticipation this is the german schmeisser mp mcshane said operates on roughly the same principle as the sten much in the same way a mercedesbenz operates on the same principle as a bedford truck colin munro laughed appreciatively fires a pistol cartridge but its reliable mcshane loaded a clip and handed the weapon to stern i presume youre a dab hand with this mr butler ive held one stern took the schmeisser and holding it waisthigh with both hands aimed at a mansized pile of sandbags thirty meters away hold on said munro thats a closein weapon lad step out to the marker there give yourself a chance man stern smiled back at mcshane then pulled the trigger he fired four threeround bursts all of which struck the target in the chest area then sprayed two nearby targets with the remaining shells in the clip thats what im talking about munro shouted at the frenchmen fire discipline mcshane gave stern a sidelong glance this is my ringer colin calls himself mr butler is he as good with a pistol better stern said mcshane loaded another clip into the schmeisser and handed it to mcconnell mr wilkes the submachine gun didnt feel entirely foreign in mcconnells hands but when he fired missing the sandbags completely he realized he did not have even a semblance of control over the weapon what do you say colin mcshane asked what can i say give me two weeks and ill turn him around we dinna have one week give him a ladies gun then small revolver best results without training mcconnell flushed at this though he knew he shouldnt give a damn while stern laughed he stepped back and selected a worn boltaction leeenfield from the rifle rack anybody down in that target pit he asked pointing two hundred meters downrange dont know answered munro but i dont see as it matters much he grinned at mcshane if you think youve hit it you can run down there and fetch the target mcconnell chambered a round then raised the enfield to his shoulder he looked down the open sights and drew a bead on the black bullseye it was odd he thought the way the body seemed to remember things the mind let slip away he rolled his shoulders once feeling the faintest breeze at his back and adjusted his aim slightly for the drop of the bullet he squeezed the trigger munro barked a short laugh five quid says that was maggies drawers ian then he said more kindly have another go son mcconnell worked the bolt three times in quick succession feeling better with each shot then the chamber clicked empty dinna worry mcshane said well get you a revolver damn me would you look at that exclaimed munro downrange someone in the pit had raised the red pointer used to indicate hits the red circle hovered over the bullseye the weapons instructor picked up a walkietalkie from the table that you bill he asked righto colin crackled the reply funs fun now give us the real score what do you mean i was stowing some targets down here when you opened up you shot the bleedin eye out of it as usual wasnt me bill i think weve got ourselves another alvin york up here mcshane looked curiously at mcconnell mr wilkes deer hunted when i was a kid mcconnell said everybody did where im from your family obviously didna go hungry mcconnell enjoyed the look of puzzlement on sterns face they tell me my grandfather was a sharpshooter for bennings brigade maybe that had something to do with it us army munro asked confederate states of america mcconnell laughed sergeant mcshane put the leeenfield back into the rack two bloody mystery men he mumbled thats what ive got here stern was still staring at mcconnell right mcshane said one more stop this morning the death ride get your toggle ropes ready the highlander set off across the meadow moving almost silently through the brown bracken like the expert hillman he was as mcconnell and stern followed mark saw a huge vertical rock face in the distance something was moving across it like small insects then he realized that the insects were men he breathed a sigh of relief when mcshane turned away from the cliff the sergeant marched until they reached the river arkaig which was in flood from the recent rains then worked his way along its bank the cold gray water tumbled over rocks and tore through thickets with a highpitched rushing sound mcconnell saw a huge limb slide past like a boat broken free of its moorings here we are mcshane said where stern asked mcshane pointed skyward the death ride gentlemen fifty feet above their heads mcconnell could just make out a black cable stretched taut from a treetop to the base of another tree across the river the angle looked to be about fifty degrees there was no safety net sergeant mcshane laid his hand on a plank step nailed to the tree beside them it was one of several dozen that led up to a tiny platform in the topmost branches like the crows nest of a ship death ride stern said mockingly i dont see how this childs game can possibly help our mission mcshane sighed with forbearance when you get where youre going mr butler i think youll find this exercise was a great help you know where were going stern asked i know youd better be gettin your backside up this tree mcshane took sterns toggle rope and threaded the wooden handle through the loop at the other end creating a flexible hoop throw the loop over the cable he said then twist your wrists into each end and jump gravity does the rest with a last scornful look stern scaled the ladder like a fireman mcconnell followed more slowly once on the platform stern tossed the looped toggle rope over the wire as mcshane had instructed then without any hesitation he seized an end in each hand and threw himself out into space mcconnell watched him sliding across the river like a runaway cable car sterns face remained confident until he reached a point halfway down the rope at that moment someone on the opposite bank began firing a semiautomatic rifle when mcconnell saw stern jerk his knees close up into his body he knew something was wrong a few blank gunshots added for show shouldnt worry a combat veteran like stern then mcconnell realized what was happening stern was dodging real bullets sergeant mcshane was signaling for mcconnell to go his conscious mind screamed that he should climb back down to the ground but something pushed him on he tossed his toggle rope over the cable twisted his wrists into loops on either side of it and leaped off the platform he felt the wind in his face saw the river flashing up to meet him heard the shriek of rifle bullets passing within inches of his body then the river bank knocked his knees up into his chin stern pulled him to his feet come on im going to get that bastard two bullets slammed into a tree less than a meter away stern dove to the ground and screamed arschloch all right gents mcshane shouted across the river youve seen one use for the toggle rope plenty more to come back on this side now stern beat the bushes for five minutes but the sniper had vanished he was still seething when they finally managed to ford the river and rejoin sergeant mcshane after lunch a brief affair of beans and cabbage soup sergeant mcshane led stern off to receive some special instruction that apparently he alone needed mcconnell was handed a sealed box which he soon discovered held a textbook and a notebook the textbook was a volume on colloquial german prepared by some branch or other of british intelligence into it someone had inserted a loose sheet headed common ss commands and responses the notebook contained some very interesting handwritten information on organic phosphates the building blocks of nerve gases and also some schematic drawings of apparatus that would likely be involved in the production of such gases he wondered if this information had originated in britain or germany at the bottom of the box he found a note from brigadier smith it read this should keep you busy while stern capers about in the forest doctor dont let a misplaced du trip you up eh ill see you soon duff mcconnell spent the afternoon studying in the shadow of an old stone episcopal church he was grateful for the books they allowed him to focus his mind on facts rather than giving free rein to the guilt and grief that had troubled him for the past few days by the time sergeant mcshane rounded him up for dinner darkness had fallen and he was starving near the center of the nissen hut village several long mess tables had been set up they were long wooden affairs scarred by years of use he was reminded of dinner on the ground at some baptist churches hed visited as a boy but the impression did not last long sergeant mcshane had made the mistake of seating him and stern with the french commandos stern had not spoken more than three sentences before an exlegionnaire noticed his german accent mcconnell tried to explain in high school french that stern was a german jewish refugee but the situation deteriorated much too quickly for reason to play a part true to form stern did nothing to defuse the situation when the exlegionnaire emptied a glass of ale in his face stern launched himself across the table like a man diving from a cliff before the astonished frenchman could react sterns thumbs were attempting to punch a hole in his windpipe within seconds a halfdozen french commandos had come to their comrades rescue but stern refused to let go mcconnell saw elbows thrashing as the frenchmen mercilessly pummeled him then almost as suddenly as it began the brawl was over the conclusive force was sergeant ian mcshane the huge highlander waded into the mob and snatched out bodies like a man yanking roots from the earth one wellplaced blow dislodged the last of the frenchmen and a mighty heave brought stern to his feet dazed and bloody the exlegionnaire was lying on the floor his face white his neck red and swollen what the bloody ell happened here roared a voice mcconnell recognized as colonel vaughans the milling isnt for a week yet the redfaced co of achnacarry sorted out the melee in a matter of seconds his last order banishing stern from the mess area without speaking sergeant mcshane hustled both stern and mcconnell between the trainees huts and across the drive then onto a dark path behind the castle as they approached the river the silhouette of a small nissen hut appeared directly in the path mcshane shoved stern up against its steel wall listen you he said in a controlled voice thats never happened at our mess before and it never will again if it does ill wring your bloody neck myself he poked a thick finger into sterns chest and i can do it laddie fancy fighting or no mcconnell had no doubt of it youve got a problem mr butler mcshane said still holding stern to the wall and like the colonel said youve come to the right place if you want it cured from now on this is where youll eat and sleep ill have your gear sent out tonight the scot shook his head and glared at them i dinna ken who decided to send you two here for training but he must be short of a full shilling youre about the least likely candidates for an important mission i can possibly imagine just as stern seemed about to reply and mcconnell was praying he wouldnt they heard the muted thump of feet running up the path a uniformed orderly appeared and saluted sergeant mcshane what is it jennings mr butlers wanted at the castle sergeant at the double colonel vaughans office mcshane sighed i tried to warn you he told stern ill have your bags waitin by the door its not the colonel sir the orderly said its an officer from london a brigadier smith about bloody time stern muttered he shouldered past mcshane and headed back toward the castle mcconnell shrugged at the highlander and the astonished orderly then walked into the nissen hut and closed the door there were two cots inside but no blankets a small paraffin lamp sat in one corner but he saw no matches he lay down on the bare cot and tucked his face into his forearms on balance the days events had disturbed him brigadier smith might believe sterns propensity for violence was an asset but mcconnell did not the calculated use of force to achieve an objective was one thing explosive reflex aggression another for whatever reason past trauma or simply a bellicose temperament jonas stern was unstable and an unstable man was a poor leader wherever they were really going mcconnell decided he would follow no orders but his own stern found brigadier smith seated behind colonel vaughans desk wearing a tweed coat and stalkers cap smith waved stern to a chair against the opposite wall you started quite a stramash out there im told he said this morning too a what stramash brawl fisticuffs stern shrugged i told you before lad im a flexible sort of fellow but charlie vaughan isnt in case you dont know former guards rsms get extremely annoyed by a lack of discipline and they go absolutely purple over the flouting of authority or tradition do you see what im getting at stern his instructors are antisemitic one of them tried to kill me and that french bastard was begging for it smith sighed wearily youre not getting my point at all no one knows youre up here but myself the good doctor and these commandos if you happened to disappear while visiting these lovely scottish hills well there wouldnt be much that i or anyone else could do about it you see in fact i doubt anyone would ever find you so lets just concentrate on the business at hand the brigadier gave stern his most engaging smile stern drummed his fingers soundlessly on his knees so smith opened a map case and spread it across colonel vaughans desk totenhausen experimental concentration camp he said in mecklenburg your old stamping grounds stern sat up his anger forgotten the camp is fairly isolated the nearest large city is rostock twenty miles to the west what used to be poland is sixty miles to the east berlin is a hundred miles south stern nodded impatiently hed known all this since he was a child the camps support village is dornow three miles north smith went on pointing at a spot on the map there are german troops in the area but no elite formations except at totenhausen of course whats at totenhausen a hundred and fifty deaths head ss troops totenkopfverbände stern murmured right and a particularly nasty bunch according to the reports the commandant is a physician named brandt an ss lieutenantgeneral and chemical genius you dont find many scholars in the ranks of the ss but brandt is one the senior security officer is sturmbannführer wolfgang schörner interestingly enough hes not a nazi noticing sterns puzzled expression smith said thats not as uncommon as you might think at one time the ss was considered by some to be a potential enemy of the party in internal nazi power struggles schörner is whats known as nur soldaten among the old ss fighters only a soldier it means hes not a superloyal party fanatic he fought in russia under paul hausser one of the few ss officers with a real military background lost an eye at kursk surprised by the depth of smiths knowledge stern gave him an inquisitive look the curious thing is why schörners there at all smith continued the rest of the troops are former einsatzgruppen butchers or career concentration camp guards i rather think schörner was stationed there as a spy for the wehrmacht the army high command doesnt like himmler having a monopoly on weapons as powerful as sarin and soman i think they wanted an ss officer at totenhausen who would keep them informed schörners older brother is a big cheese on kesselrings staff in italy wolfgang had just been invalided out of the russian theater because of his eye and he needed a job getting the picture simple enough stern said schörner spies on the ss for the wehrmacht whats the inmate population of totenhausen very low fluctuates between two and three hundred depending on the pace of the gas tests so were going to sacrifice three hundred innocent people to kill half as many ss men no were going to sacrifice three hundred doomed prisoners to save tens of thousands of allied invasion troops a matter of perspective everything is in war stern to major dickson youre a bloodthirsty terrorist to your own people youre a hero and what am i to you brigadier smith smiled thinly useful lets get back to business totenhausen is separated from dornow by a small group of forested hills the only hills anywhere thereabouts actually the camp is nestled against the east side of them on the north bank of the recknitz river the trees grow right up to the electrical fence theyre meant to conceal the camp from aerial surveillance smith pulled another map from his case it showed a closeup view of the hills the village of dornow to the north of them and a detailed diagram of totenhausen camp itself abutting the southernmost hill whats that on the central hill stern asked electrical transformer station its the key to the whole mission do we have to blow it up ive had experience with that no we want the lights burning right up until the last second look here smith used his pipe stem to indicate six parallel lines that connected the power station to totenhausen these are the overhead electrical transmission lines that power the camp and factory they run straight down the hills from the power station into the camp the total line distance is two thousand feet on a twentynine degree slope one night before you go in a british commando team will suspend eight cylinders of british nerve gas from a wire on the pylon nearest the power station the cylinders will be hanging from roller mechanisms rather like those used on cable cars stern frowned the cylinders roll down the hill into the camp and detonate basically yes our technical people have rigged pressure triggers on the bottoms and sides of the cylinders rather like those on conventional mines once a trigger is tripped a small bullet charge blows out a cap on the cylinder head the cylinder releases its contents under high pressure diffusing a lethal gas cloud at ground level its world war one technology but damned efficient stern took a moment to visualize the plan but if the cylinders are hanging from a power line he said what keeps them from slamming into the crossarms that hold up the line on the way down thats exactly what i asked said smith taking a pen from his pocket to illustrate his explanation its a rather neat trick actually dont think of the cylinders as hanging down from the line even though they are the roller wheel mechanism is like a man riding a bicycle on a circus wire the wheel sits on top of the outermost wire on the pylon now imagine the bicycle rider holding his arm straight out from his body in his hand is a fourfoot metal bar hanging straight down and attached to that bar well beneath the wire is the gas cylinder which is positioned so that its center of gravity is directly below the wire you see as long as the roller rides atop the outermost wire the bar holding the cylinder which curves up and outward before going down will strike nothing its a bloody miracle of engineering i believe it what do these cylinders weigh one hundred thirty pounds apiece sixty kilograms thats full can the power line hold that weight smith smiled like a gambler confident of his cards do you have any idea what a twoinch thick coating of ice weighs along a hundred meters of wire quite a lot but in northern germany the lines are designed to hold it and thats in normal times the war has caused copper shortages all over the world everyone has had to fall back on steel wire for conductor material including the germans our intelligence reports indicate that the wires at totenhausen are actually made of wrapped steel winch cable some of the highest tensilestrength wire in the world stern nodded in admiration what about the electrical current its fairly highvoltage but thats one of the reasons we chose this method because electrical transformers tend to blow out quite frequently many key power stations maintain a backup set of transformers ready to go online the moment the primary set is blown totenhausen not only has backup transformers theyve got a set of backup lines now listen closely you cant afford to muck this up totenhausen uses a threephase electrical system that means three live wires are required to run the camps plant and equipment the pylons that support these wires consist of two tall support legs joined at the top by wooden crossarms there is a live wire running across each end of each crossarm and one running right over the middle for a normal threephase system that would be enough but brandt doesnt want his lab without power even for an hour at totenhausen there is a backup line for each of those live wires running right alongside it these backups carry no current but become live whenever the primary lines are shortcircuited this could be caused by lightning falling limbs or sabotage stern finished right leave it to the germans to be so efficient but in this case im afraid their efficiency has doomed them how so because were going to hang our cylinders from one of those auxiliary lines and there theyll wait until you arrive to send them down the hill stern nodded slowly what if the auxiliary lines become active not to worry the gas cylinders are metal as are the suspension bars but the rollers are fully insulated its exactly like a squirrel running along a power line stern as long as he doesnt ground himself to a pole or a branch he can run for miles the whole scheme is brilliant barnes wallis himself sketched out the roller wheelcylinder combination he designed the dambuster and tallboy bombs you know bloody genius stern waved his hand impatiently how do i release the cylinders from their positions on the line childs play when you arrive each roller will be held in place by a lubricated cotter pin youll find a heavy gauge rope of pure rubber connected to all eight cotter pins all you need do is yank the rope to pull out the pins gravity will do the rest it sounds simple enough but tell me this why dont you have whoever hangs the cylinders go ahead and carry out the attack it would be a lot simpler smith looked down his nose at stern because theyre british old boy i thought you understood that our american cousins have not given their seal of approval for this mission and i cannot risk having british commandos caught flagrante delicto also the men who are doing that job know a lot about soldiering but damned little about chemistry we need mcconnell on the ground but mcconnell is american what if hes captured smith hesitated well discuss that later after staring silently at the brigadier for several moments stern laid his index finger on the diagram of the camp on it were marked electrical fence voltages barracks and who occupied them dog pens gas storage tanks a small cinema and various other facilities you cant get this kind of detail from the air he said especially that information on the ss major schörner youve got someone inside havent you when smith did not respond stern said an agent inside a concentration camp how do you get their information out tricks of the trade lad you haganah chaps arent the only ones who know how to play shadow games my god is it schörner himself smith chuckled if only it were eh stern looked back at the map when mcconnell and i go into the camp how can we be sure all the ss troops are dead you cant not until youre close enough to be shot probably thats why youll be wearing german uniforms stern went still what you dont fancy the idea standartenführer stern i wont wear one suit yourself no pun intended but give ear hitlers commando order of specifies that any troops captured on a commando raid in uniform or out armed or unarmed will be slaughtered to the last man an ss or sd uniform is about the only hope youll have of bluffing your way out if things go wrong besides youre a native german you could actually pull it off stern glowered at the scotsman ill think about it how long will it take the gas to dissipate i cant be sure of that but since mcconnell brought along his special suits it really wont matter youll be able to go in immediately that should greatly reduce any chance of ss reinforcements arriving from elsewhere before you finish what do we do once were inside go straight to the factory first get a sample of soman mcconnell will know how to use the minicanisters and universal couplers after that let him take you on a tour through the plant anything he points at you shoot a picture of laboratory logs notes things like that take them then steal a german vehicle and run for the baltic coast youll find an inflatable boat cached there and a royal navy submarine waiting to pick you up stern laid his elbows on the desk and looked into smiths eyes an inflatable boat you do know the baltic coast is often frozen this time of year quite thats why they wont be expecting you to leave in a boat youll find the raft cached by a shipping channel maintained by icebreaker ill give you all the details later stern felt far from reassured how are we getting into germany he asked from here we stage to sweden by air then we you mean mcconnell and me smith leaned forward i mean myself as well ill be bivouacked on the swedish coast waiting for confirmation of success the brigadier could not conceal his excitement this is no hop into the french countryside to keep the resistance in biscuits man its a thrust to jerrys vitals if we pull off this bluff well have changed the course of the war stern studied smiths craggy face do your masters know youre flying over occupied territory if you were captured no chance of that ive arranged special transport for this trip you wont believe it until you see it from sweden you and mcconnell will go into germany by moon plane thats a singleengine wooden kite painted matte black a lysander right youll be landed just west of the hills hopefully out of sight and sound of both dornow village and the camp well be met yes but you wont know by whom until you get there sterns eyes flickered with apprehension password your password for the reception party is black cross thats what ive named the mission as well black cross is the allied code name for nerve agents its meaningless to the jerries youll get a more detailed set of codes before you leave when will that be exactly brigadier smith leaned back in the chair and rested his hand in his lap in exactly ten days stern heinrich himmler is going to stage a demonstration of soman at raubhammer proving ground on the lüneburger heath among those present will be adolf hitler himmler intends to convince the führer that nerve gas is the only weapon that can stop the coming allied invasion and my boy himmler is right smith held up his hand and splayed his fingers five days before that test six nights from now you and mcconnell are going in that gives you a fourday window in which to make your attack four days to wait for the proper wind and weather conditions four days to convince heinrich himmler that the führers fears of allied gas capabilities are extremely well founded stern stood up and flexed his fists with nervous energy i want to know about this contact of yours brigadier our lives will be in his hands from the moment were inside germany is it someone in the village a soldier in the camp who smiths face gave away nothing if i told you that his life would be in your hands and right now he is a lot more valuable than you are i see stern leaned over the maps in silence for nearly a minute one question it seems to me that a place like this would have a lot of safety equipment gas masks suits safety drills that kind of thing i think the reality will surprise you remember sarin and soman can kill simply by contact with the skin im sure brandt and his staff have special protection but to really protect the ss troops everyone would have to wear a full body suit and mask at all times its just not practical there are gas alarms in the factory itself but the ss troops dont even carry masks with them if you ask me himmler considers the totenhausen detachment expendable satisfied this sounds like it could actually work its going to work brigadier smith fired his pipe and leaned back in colonel vaughans chair tell me he said how are you and the good doctor getting along stern shrugged hell do his job i suppose as long as he doesnt figure out that the real objective is to kill people not disable the lab and factory he wont as long as you dont help him dont worry about that are we finished finished smith slapped the desk with a bang not nearly youve still got some training to do before bed training climbing that pylon is going to be ticklish especially in the dark weve rigged a dummy here for you to practice on weve got climbing spikes harness the lot ive climbed a hundred telegraph poles stern objected i can do it without spikes and without practice smith chuckled the pylons at totenhausen are sixty feet tall laddie and may well be covered with ice more games stern grumbled look i know youve no use for us smith said equably were not too fond of you either to be frank but youve got to set that aside its jerry you want to kill remember he stood up and walked to the closed door and rapped sharply on it someone pushed open the door it was sergeant mcshane dressed for foul weather from the highlanders hands dangled leather belts and straps fitted with medievallooking spikes of iron brigadier smith folded his maps with amazing dexterity for a onearmed man then tucked his case under his arm take him up the hill sergeant he ordered when stern finally trudged into the nissen hut behind the castle all his muscles were shaking with fatigue by then someone had sent an orderly to the hut with blankets pillows and matches but mcconnell was not yet asleep he was reading his german textbook by the light of the paraffin lamp stern collapsed onto his cot and lay staring at the ceiling mcconnell closed the book what were you doing to get so wet studying electricity what about you mcconnell dropped the textbook on the floor colloquial german ss protocols and orders plus a little organic chemistry say something in german wie geht es ihnen ach your accent is terrible tell me something i dont know dont worry stern said in an exhausted voice ill do any talking that needs to be done i doubt well have to do much i suppose were going in dressed as germans stern turned his head and looked across the narrow space that divided them why do you say that christ theyre fitting us up with german weapons theyve got me studying ss orders what else could it be stern said nothing ive been doing a lot of thinking lying here mcconnell said and ive got to tell you this mission doesnt make sense sterns voice was suddenly wary what do you mean i mean how the hell are two men going to disable a nerve gas plant one man really as far as i can tell ive got nothing to do with the sabotage there must be other men going on this mission men we have yet to meet is that all youre worried about no frankly its the whole concept look stern whether you believe it or not i am committed to this mission but i dont like problems that dont add up its the logic or rather the absence of it that bothers me i just dont see how brigadier smith can be telling us the truth at least he isnt telling me the truth stern tried to sound unconcerned why do you say that think about it if the allies possess no nerve gases as smith claims this mission of ours isnt going to solve the problem so we disable one plant big deal i know for a fact that the germans already possess massive stockpiles of tabun and probably sarin as well my seeing the inside of the plant that produces soman would help allied research granted as would photographs but is that worth letting hitler know how much we fear his nerve gases thats what this raid is going to do also smith claims hes sending us in there to steal a sample of soman he doesnt need us for that soe already managed to smuggle out a sample of sarin without our help i analyzed the damned thing myself stern watched mcconnell closely but if the allies do possess nerve agents this mission is completely unnecessary we could simply send a sample of our gas to the reich chancellery sorry adolf weve got it too the british wouldnt do that stern said why not we know the germans already have the stuff and by doing that we would avoid any chance of a massive retaliatory gas strike if we cause a large release of soman in the process of disabling this plant hitler might well hit london with every ounce of nerve gas hes got stern forced himself to keep silent the americans questions were disturbing unless you possessed the missing pieces of the puzzle unless you knew that the british did possess their own nerve gas but only a minuscule amount and that in ten days heinrich himmler was going to convince an uneasy adolf hitler that the superweapon best suited to destroying the allied invasion on french sand was nerve gas and that the only chance of stopping himmler was to convince him that hitlers fears were true that the allies not only had nerve gas of their own but would not hesitate to use it stern knew mcconnell would instantly grasp the logic of that but he also knew the american would never willingly take part in the ruthless attack required to do the convincing yet one question mcconnell had raised stuck in sterns mind if the british possessed a limited amount of their own nerve gas as brigadier smith claimed why didnt they simply send a sample to the reich chancellery as mcconnell had suggested or at least leak evidence of their capability to himmler why risk massive chemical retaliation by wiping out everyone in totenhausen as he tried to fall asleep stern could not suppress a suspicion that even he was not being told the whole truth about the mission and only then did he realize that the first worm of doubt had entered his mind long ago probably the moment he realized brigadier smith intended to lie to mcconnell because if the soe chief was willing to lie to an american to manipulate him he would not hesitate to lie to a jew he considered a terrorist the question was what could he be lying about deep inside the porton down chemical research complex a frustrated chemist stared through a heavy glass window at the hairy face of a rhesus monkey the monkey was strapped to a metal chair inside a chamber not very different from the eblock at totenhausen camp though much smaller the chemist knew it must be his imagination but he had the distinct feeling that the monkey was grinning at him in mockery increase the dose he said the hiss of gas released under pressure sounded in the lab the monkey bobbed its head several times but continued to breathe and yes it was very definitely grinning now the chemist slammed a hand down on his knee then went to his desk picked up the telephone and asked to be connected to a telephone number he had been given early that morning there was a bit of a muddle at the other end but soon an authoritative voice said brigadier smith here this is lifton sir porton down weve established a new limit but im afraid the news isnt quite what wed expected well nonlethal after fortytwo hours bugger all smith bellowed whats the problem its stability sir weve got lethality and if i may say so were lucky to have that the germans have had their best people on this for years given time im sure doctor you have exactly five days to give me a gas that will remain lethal for one hundred hours keep me posted the chemist jumped at the sound of the disconnecting line oh richards he said to his assistant yes do we have a pistol near to hand not that i know of doctor lifton one of the guards outside might lend us one i suppose why the chemist stared furiously into the gas chamber because id like to shoot that damned monkey rachels plan to gain frau hagans confidence had worked she wasnt sure why perhaps it was the fanatical vigilance with which she guarded the door each night during the circle or perhaps the detailed answers she gave when frau hagan asked about war news shed heard on the bbc in amsterdam before being captured once she had even sensed a vague sexual interest on the block leaders part in the end she did not care why frau hagan had taken her under her wing only that she had for the last two days the big pole had invited rachel to come on what she called her morning patrol of the camp rachel felt terribly nervous without jan and hannah beside her but frau hagan assured her that the children were safe the patrol was really more of a morning constitutional though the block leader did notice many things rachel missed she noted which sentries were posted where which of the three ss doctors under brandt had slept late the volume of black market traffic in clothing and utensils and sexual favors exchanged behind the showers and a dozen other things rachel noticed the prisoners more than the guards they traveled in small groups most often with those who shared the same badge color asocial with asocial political with political criminal with criminal jew with jew above all she watched the children many clung to their mothers shifts as jan and hannah did whenever possible but others seemed to have free run of the camp like a grimyfaced army of midget partisans they darted in and out of alleys crouched under steps squabbled in the barracks spied on everyone and stole anything that wasnt guarded or nailed down including food from those too old or weak to protect themselves rachel found it all bewildering for four years she had heard that the camps in the east were labor camps totenhausen was more like a sanitarium except that its staff was homicidally insane and armed to the teeth there was little to do but idly pass the time and hope to avoid random death unless of course you counted frau hagan as your friend this morning the block leader had ordered rachel to memorize the layout of the camp pointing out which buildings were to be avoided and which areas were safe from the view of the tower gunners the task did not take long totenhausen was surprisingly small and laid out with the usual german precision in a perfect square of electrified barbed wire the inmate blocks occupied the west side and the ss barracks the east these alternate universes separated by the appellplatz where roll was taken twice each day once in the morning and once at night the administration building and officers quarters stood at the front of the camp and faced south towards the river which flowed less than forty meters from the main gate and backed against the wooded hills at the rear of the camp was brandts hospital with the halfburied eblock squatting in its shadow like a vicious dog in uneasy sleep the only building which compared to the hospital in size was a large wooden barn which occupied the entire northeast corner of the camp and was surrounded by a tenfoot wire fence that is where they make the gas rachel asked pointing to the tops of two brick smokestacks that jutted from openings in the high barn roof frau hagan quickly crossed herself the furnace of the devil she said softly dont point i thought you were a communist said rachel communists dont believe in god do they frau hagan pulled her gray coat around her god may be dead dutch girl but the devil is alive and well im getting cold lets walk they skirted the factory fence until they reached the ss barracks then cut between the barracks and the dog kennels rachel felt a prickle on her skin as she passed the watchful shepherds a sudden wild shouting from the direction of the appellplatz made her cringe football frau hagan said without breaking stride rachel squeezed her nails into her palms and walked on what happened early this morning she asked i heard screaming and shouting in the yard frau hagan sighed wearily and kicked a mound of snow the gypsy woman tried to run to the wire someone stopped her they should have let her go rachel was horrified to the electric fence of course it happened all the time at auschwitz its the most popular method of suicide there the wire could have ended it for the gypsy now something worse will happen maybe for all of us what do you mean hagan turned her flat face to rachel as she walked if they took your child from you dutch girl what would you do i would go mad just so and a madwoman is capable of anything very dangerous for the rest of us hagan stopped stretched her thick arms then methodically bent and touched her toes several times exercise she puffed i know how shocking it is you heard the talk yes the distinguished doctor brandt is the pederast there are some among the prisoners too but brandt is the worst that mongrel weitz brings them to him one sometimes two little boys in a month since the family camp ruse started so you see the world is turned upside down it would have been better for the gypsy and her son to have been gassed at chelmno than to have been saved and brought here cant we do anything to help the boy rachel asked thinking of her hidden diamonds couldnt we bribe someone frau hagan looked puzzled bribe them to do what kill the boy that is his only escape from here and if something happens to that boy brandt will merely send weitz for another perhaps your jan rachel shuddered what about that nurse anna kaas cant she do something frau hagan grabbed rachel by the shoulders and shook her violently are you a fool after all never again mention that name in the yard never do you understand i yes i mean i wont since this whole insanity began she is the only german i have seen do anything to help prisoners the only one the pole shook rachel again her life cannot be risked in a useless attempt to save a doomed child put that out of your stupid head rachel jerked away but before she had gone five steps frau hagan caught her by the arm not so fast dutch girl you talk of bribes what have you got to bribe with nothing rachels face grew hot only my food like everyone else sergeant sturm has been questioning people you know hes asking about some diamonds he says were lost in the yard the night of the last selection i dont know anything about that rachel immediately regretted her lie frau hagan could order her searched anytime and she knew every trick of concealment she would search rachels inner body first someone said it was your idiot fatherinlaw who had the diamonds you still dont know about it no i mean i didnt know he had the diamonds not until that night major schörner made sturm throw them into the yard frau hagan considered this that night after the selection you went to the toilet you stayed a long time my children were sick frau hagans gaze didnt waver the diamonds were in the appellplatz rachel blurted on the other side of the fence you could have climbed the fence and left my children behind rachel recalled the wild moment of madness it had taken to let go of jan and hannahs little hands and climb the cold wire if i were caught doing that i would never have seen them again frau hagan nodded that is true dutch girl i wonder if you have that much courage i assure you i dont so if i searched you now i would find no diamonds no the block leader cocked her square head to one side did you see anyone else that night when you went to the toilet rachel felt cornered she hesitated but then feeling like a traitor she said the shoemaker i saw him outside the block fence that night frau hagans eyes flashed with satisfaction i should have known you wont tell sturm more yells sounded from the direction of the main gate come on dutch girl frau hagan pulled her along emerging from behind the headquarters building rachel saw a dozen ss men stripped to their brown undershirts charging wildly around the parade ground in their knee boots sergeant sturm was leading one team in a game of soccer in which a couple of large ammunition crates served as goals a fairly large audience of both prisoners and ss men had gathered to watch the game as there was no physical barrier separating the ss parade ground from the appellplatz rachel saw immediately that sturm and his men approached sport with all the brutality they brought to their normal duties two players on the opposing team were already limping from injuries received at their hands thats willi gauss leading the team against sturm frau hagan said as they moved into a press of ragged spectators hes a technical sergeant inferior to sturm in rank gave me a piece of cardboard once to mend my shoe frau hagans comment made rachel think of the shoemaker scanning the crowd she spied him by the block fence a wiry darkskinned man standing a head taller than the other prisoners who runs the jewish mens block she asked in an offhand tone frau hagan gave her a guarded look after the last selection the shoemaker has the lowest number the survivors will probably elect him there are only a handful left he has been at this camp even longer than me you dont like him he helps the ss by making shoes for them and boots and slippers for them to send home to their slutty wives why are you so curious dutch girl rachel was spared having to answer by the unmistakable crack of bone echoing across the yard on the field one of sturms men stood laughing and pointing over a prostrate figure as the fallen man was carried off the field sergeant gauss called out to a lone figure leaning against the headquarters building please sturmbannführer my goalies out of action give us a hand rachel had not noticed schörner beneath the overhang of the roof the major waved away the sergeants entreaty but more players joined in pleading that they would have to stop the game unless someone made up the deficiency in numbers schörner finally stripped off his gray tunic and the bright knights cross that hung around his neck then folded both and laid them carefully on an electrical junction box well frau hagan mused this might be interesting why schörner against sturm ever since he got here last september schörner has been riding sturm and his men about security when hes not drunk that is he cant get them to care were in the middle of germany they cant see any danger is there any danger frau hagan shrugged schörners afraid of old ghosts russian ghosts i expect she chuckled for him the danger might be out on that field after conferring with schörner sergeant gauss took over as goalie and allowed the major to take a forward position within two minutes it became apparent that schörner was no amateur he stole the ball twice and moved it upfield alone only to be brought to a sudden stop by the rough tactics of sturms men who were expert at accidentally overshooting the ball and smashing headon into their opponents to the delight of both teams however schörner did not call a penalty which he could have used his superior rank to enforce instead he played all the harder kick it down their throats sturmbannführer sergeant gauss shouted gleefully from the goal schörner succeeded in stealing the ball a third time he moved across the parade ground with deceptive ease sidestepping sturms brownuniformed men and keeping the ball dancing on the toe of his boot he passed off once only to find the ball coming right back at him obviously his team believed he represented their best chance of scoring he picked up speed as he neared the goal only one man a brawny corporal blocked his path but several were racing up from behind with only one eye schörners peripheral vision was seriously impaired he counted himself lucky that the two men pursuing him one of whom was sergeant sturm were closing from his left side the right side would just have to take care of itself he neatly bypassed the corporal leaving him befuddled in the center of the field and drawing some laughter from the sidelines but sergeant sturm and a thickset private angled in from his left the goalie crouched and spread his arms wide in anticipation schörner drew back his foot and let fly but at the last minute pulled the force behind his kick the ball rolled forward two meters and stopped he planted both feet ducked and threw his left shoulder backward catching sturm full force just above the groin the explosion of air from the sergeants lungs silenced the field so that when he flipped over the majors back and hit the ground the thud was audible to all the other pursuer stood dumbfounded while schörner darted back to the ball drove it past the goalie and into the ammunition crate with a bang a shout went up from gausss team though even they were stunned by the majors willingness to give sturm a dose of his own medicine grinning as though he had never felt better schörner walked over to sturm who lay gasping on the ground and offered him a hand sturm did not so much bat the hand away as refuse it but his rage was plain schörner turned waved to sergeant gauss then walked back over to the headquarters building and collected his clothes frau hagan was shaking her head schörner will pay for that one day she said but hes a major rachel pointed out sturm is only a sergeant that doesnt matter nearly every man here is loyal to sturm you see the brown uniforms theyre all deaths head troops schörners from a different division the das reich they fought everybody from the french to the russians sturm and his men never shot anything but unarmed prisoners in rear areas schörner despises them and they hate his guts maybe theyll kill each other rachel said and we can go home when the bell rang for the midday ration rachel took jan and hannah with her to the soup pot where a russian green dispensed watery soup and a little bread she also took frau hagans bowl to save the block leader the trouble of the queue she had already learned to position herself in line so that her familys ration was dipped from the bottom of the pot where the cabbage leaves had settled still the food was not enough to keep jan and hannah healthy frau hagan chastised her for it but rachel divided half her ration between the children when jan and hannah were asleep rachel followed the block leader back outside she had just caught up with her when a shadow darted out from behind the punishment tree and blocked their way before rachel even recognized the man frau hagan spat at him back worm ariel weitz flinched before the block leaders anger youd better listen he warned or youll be on the tree state your business frau hagan growled then piss off weitz pointed at rachel the major wants to see her schörner frau hagans brows drew together what does schörner want with this girl why dont you ask him my fat blockführer shell be at his office in a moment frau hagan glowered at the informer leave us worm the informer scowled then hurried off frau hagan spat again weitz is a tick growing fat on the nazi wolf one day i will squeeze him until he bursts with hot blood what can major schörner want with me rachel asked not jan not my little boy no no frau hagan said reassuringly weitz would simply snatch the boy and take him to brandts quarters with schörner it could be anything he may want you to clean his quarters he may want to ask you something about holland then again it could be you he wants me frau hagan gave her a knowing gaze the night after himmler was here women were brought into the camp as a reward to sturm and his men that was the screaming you heard the night you became door guard the screaming i refused to hear dont look that way there was nothing i could do for them anyway the women were from ravensbrück the main womens camp i dont know exactly what happened but schörner didnt take part in it he doesnt mix with sturm and his thugs considers himself a german gentleman still sturms little party may have excited him he is a man after all usually he buries his anger in a bottle but who knows be careful dutch girl rachel tried to control her rapid breathing she felt lightheaded should i resist this isnt amsterdam choice doesnt exist here remember your children ill make sure theyre watched until you return please thank you rachel squeezed her arm oh what am i to do the older woman looked uncomfortable go now if youre late he will be harder on you rachel stood terrified before major wolfgang schörner after her experiences with the ss and frau hagans warnings he seemed more apparition than man he sat calmly behind his desk wearing a clean gray uniform he had changed clothes since the soccer game rachel could hear ariel weitz behind her shuffling his feet schörner inclined his head toward the door which then opened and closed quietly behind her schörner frowned a crude man he said but useful rachel said nothing she found herself trying to guess schörners age thirty seemed about right though the eyepatch made him look older unlike sergeant sturm and the other ss men schörner was not scrupulously clean shaven a days shadow of dark beard grew evenly from his cheeks to his jawline the two top buttons of his tunic were undone he drummed his fingers on the desktop you are frau rachel jansen rachel nodded ja herr major schörners face brightened instantly but i thought you were from holland ich bin holländerin herr major but your german is perfect perfektes hochdeutsch i spent the first seven years of my life in magdeburg herr major i was moved to holland as an orphan after the great war schörner leaned back in his chair and regarded rachel im sorry they cut your hair in this camp that is done before the medical inspection so i had no opportunity to intervene the barber told me it was quite beautiful rachel tried not to appear in a hurry to leave the office i noticed you at that inspection schörner said softly he sounded almost embarrassed by this confidence after what seemed an age he said you remind me of someone rachel swallowed who is that herr major it doesnt matter the longer rachel stood there the more uncomfortable she felt herr major she said hoarsely what is it that i have done you have done nothing yet frau jansen but that will soon change i hope schörner stood and stepped from behind the desk he was a tall man lean but strongly built only now did rachel notice the bottle of brandy standing open on the bookshelf against the wall three quarters empty schörner poured himself a glass and drank it in one swallow then he tipped the glass toward rachel no thank you herr major schörner turned his palms upward as if to say what can i do then he took a step toward her hesitated then took another rachel felt a shiver run across her shoulders she suddenly realized that major schörner was very drunk did you come here straight from amsterdam he asked yes herr major this place must be a shock to you she didnt know how to respond i try to make the best of adverse circumstances schörners eyes opened wider just so that is exactly what i am doing myself rachels puzzlement showed on her face schörner sighed deeply the ss frau jansen the true ss was established as an elite order like knights at least that was the idea in the beginning lately all manner of men wear the sig runes estonians ukrainians even arabs my god when i joined the ss a single dental filling was enough to disqualify a man he closed his eyes briefly nothing is as it used to be rachel tried not to move a muscle the change from the enthusiastic athlete of the soccer game to the drunken officer before her was disorienting youve seen the guards here said schörner moving closer scum most of them some were pressganged from the bremen jails not one of them has seen real combat he lifted her chin with his right hand does this talk surprise you schörners touch had paralyzed her i im sure i dont know what youre talking about herr major schörner let his hand drop of course you dont how could you while i was fighting in russia you were hiding in a cellar in holland yes as you say herr major schörner seemed to find humor in this i dont blame you for hiding you know not a bit the world is a difficult place for your people just now he looked into his bookcase have you ever been to england no herr major i was at oxford you know its remarkable thought rachel i am standing here having a conversation with an ss officer a member of the murderous legion that never speaks except to command and those commands given almost exclusively to order preparation for death i didnt know that she said awkwardly you were one of the german rhodes scholars schörner shook his head a regular student a paying student anyway oxford terminated the german rhodes scholarships in i was at kings college my fathers ideal of a gentleman was the english public school man absurd isnt it he walked slowly around rachel with great effort she remained perfectly still when schörner next spoke his mouth was practically in her right ear miles from the battle he murmured without any preamble he slipped his right hand into rachels shift and cupped her left breast she felt a jolt like an electric shock then a sudden weakening of her bladder just as quickly she remembered the diamonds and forced her legs together schörner squeezed her breast gently like a woman at market appraising a melon she shivered be still rachel obeyed schörner stroked her breast for several moments then removed his hand she felt tears welling in her eyes his hand fell to her right hip his breathing grew shallow she could endure no more only a moment ago he had been speaking to her like a human being now she took one step forward and turned sharply to face him herr major she said in the most indignant and aristocratic german she could muster does a gentleman force himself upon a lady schörner stared at her with a mixture of anger and fascination rachel searched frantically for some frame of reference the ss officer might relate to would you have me against my will she asked i should think that would be like stealing a war medal schörner seemed intrigued by her reaction rachel pushed ahead what had she to lose now you say you are a man of honor would you falsely wear a medal for gallantry it is the same with the act of love schörner smiled sadly then scratched at the edge of his eyepatch there is an important difference frau jansen he pulled his knights cross from beneath his collar medals cannot keep a man warm at night he said fingering the fine ribbon of red white and black they cannot erase the loneliness of this place for even a moment but you could i think one hour in your arms could do it at least for a while rachel was speechless here was one of the men who had murdered her husband and god knew how many others in cold blood now asking her to go to his bed herr herr major she stammered i appeal to you as a gentleman i am a new widow i am not ready for this schörners face locked itself into a mask of formality i see he said stiffly you are still grieving you require time to purge the memory of your husband from your mind he walked to the window and looked out at a squad of sturms soldiers drilling in the yard how long do you think you will need rachel was dumbfounded i dont six months major schörner took a deep breath and paused as if mentally consulting a list of social mores impossible he said finally outside the normal mourning period is quite long of course up to a year he turned from the window here things are different we are at war after all thousands of women are made widows every day you cannot let your youth pass by simply because of a little sentimentality rachel tried to think of some further argument but came up with nothing i shall give you one week schörner said then he moved back behind his desk and sat down is that all herr major yes oh just a moment from now on you will receive a special diet when the evening meal is finished go to the alley between the hospital and the experimental block inmate weitz will meet you there with food schörner picked up a pen and began scratching on a form that lay on his desk rachel felt a sudden wild courage like the implacable instinct that had driven her over the block fence to search for the diamonds may i bring my children herr major what schörner looked up and blinked may i bring my children to eat this special food oh a knowing gleam came into his eye yes i suppose so rachel turned and stepped toward the door she stopped at the sound of schörners voice if you change your mind before the week is out you can find me in my quarters i am there every night do not take too long he returned to the file on his desk auf wiedersehen rachel nodded to the door auf wiedersehen herr major frau hagan was waiting behind the cinema annex of the administration building rachel did not walk directly toward her but toward the barracks area frau hagan contrived to walk in such a way that their paths seemed naturally to intersect in the appellplatz what did he want she asked me for sex yes i told you you came here too healthy im surprised it was schörner though they walked for a few moments in silence at least it isnt sturm you might not survive a night with him hes an animal he would throw you to his pack when he was finished god what am i to do you must go to him tonight no he gave me a week what he said i could have one week to finish mourning as if even a year would be enough frau hagan stopped walking i think the major is taken with you dutch girl as far as i can recall schörner has never had a woman in this camp and why else would he let you wait a week he could have you right this minute there is nothing to stop him rachel drew a quick breath he told me i remind him of someone i think perhaps perhaps he has some remnants of decency left the pole seized rachels wrist in a clawlike grip dont ever think that if you walked within a meter of the wire he would shoot you himself if you disobeyed an order he would have you on the tree without a second thought rachel felt herself losing control as they neared the block she threw her arms around frau hagan like a terrified child why me she wailed i am a jew i thought i was like a disease to the ss frau hagan stroked rachels nearly bald scalp that is what goebbels and himmler say but people are people i know of a case where an ss man actually fell in love with a jewess they were both shot what am i to do then frau hagan gently disengaged rachel and held her at arms length at the end of the week you will have to give in she said firmly this is not amsterdam you have no choice but as they entered the block rachel decided that maybe she did have a choice if she had to yield to schörner in seven days regardless why shouldnt she try to get something out of it something for her children it is a curious fact that men who share extreme hardship even those who previously dislike or even hate each other form unspoken bonds that last forever not because of insensitivity or stupidity do armies train their recruits by driving them up to and beyond the point of maximum endurance for thousands of years this system has forged the callow young men of numberless nations into soldiers ready to die for their comrades even if these comrades are bound only by common hatred of their tormentor the army of course the process that bonds people need not be so extreme strangers standing at a bus stop will studiously ignore each other for quite some time but let the bus be late let a hard rain begin lashing the street and the fragmented crowd quickly becomes a group united by resentment against the bus company and its lazy drivers it was a range of experiences between these two extremes that began to bridge the chasm between mark mcconnell and jonas stern though mcconnell spent much time alone studying german and organic chemistry and stern climbed iceslickened poles until he could do it wearing a blindfold the two men found themselves thrown together on night marches obstacle courses at meals and most importantly in the dark hut behind the castle in the exhausted minutes before sleep took them a thaw was inevitable and smith should have seen it there was simply no escaping the fact that the two men had no supporters at the castle other than themselves no grumbling cadre of brothersinarms as the commando recruits had no friendly colleagues as the instructors had they were two civilians alone training in a program wholly outside the normal routine of the commando depot for the staff they were an inconvenience a disruption to be tolerated only at the request of the commanding officer who was merely doing a favor for a friend and excepting sergeant ian mcshane that tolerance was markedly thin some of sterns early remarks about mcconnells pacifism had gotten around and the instructors quickly came to view the american with the jaundiced eye that many in oxford had in sterns case the prejudice was more open antisemitism was widespread in the british army but sterns german accent put him right over the top he could hardly pass anyone at the castle without drawing a dark look or muttered imprecation and so by the fourth day the two men so different in philosophy had been forced by prejudice onto common ground stern had maintained his fierce mask of cynicism but mcconnell soon sensed the somber reflective intelligence behind it sterns reappraisal of mcconnell occurred more slowly until something quite unexpected taught him that first impressions can be far from accurate at the toggle bridge a long net of intertwined toggle ropes that spanned a wide stretch of the river arkaig sergeant mcshane was taking great pleasure in pointing out to stern this ingenious use for his favorite tool stern retorted that the bridge suspended above the rushing waters had required at least fifty toggle ropes to construct whereas he and mcconnell would have only two while they traded barbs on the castle bank a group of french commandos were being instructed on how to properly negotiate the flexible bridge under fire the arkaig was still in flood concealing rocks that could snap bones like twigs if a man fell the twenty feet from the bridge to the river a concealed sniper fired nearmiss shots with a rifle and to further enhance the realism of the exercise explosive charges had been laid in the riverbed consequently several furious commandos found themselves bunched at the middle of the sagging bridge while an instructor with a clipboard shouted cockney epithets from the bank maligning their ancestors back to william the conqueror every time a bomb exploded in the river the frenchmen screamed at each other with redoubled fury between bouts of laughter sergeant mcshane explained to stern and mcconnell what the frenchmen were doing wrong his laughter died when after a particularly violent explosion one of the young commandos lost his footing and slipped down through the spiderweb of toggle ropes somehow catching his throat in the tangle his body jerked taut like that of a man being hanged then his head snapped up and he plunged into the river only the observers on the bank realized what had happened and of them only mcshane and the other instructor knew that two men had recently lost their lives under identical circumstances in that case an explosion had shaken two men off the bridge the flooded stream quickly swept them past all chance of aid and their drowned bodies were later recovered at the mouth of loch lochy a grappling net had since been suspended from the iron footbridge downstream but sergeant mcshane was taking no chances by the time the frenchmans absence had been noticed by his comrades the highlander had already dived into the flooded river and begun swimming after the floating body mcshane swam strongly and urged on by the shouts of the men on the bridge managed to overtake the frenchman in time the commandos on the bridge fought their way over the toggle ropes while mcshane dragged their fallen comrade up the far bank even from where mcconnell and stern stood it was plain that the young commando was badly hurt sergeant mcshane had all he could do to keep the mans friends far enough back to let him breathe it was the highlanders cry for a medical officer that broke the spell on the near bank mcconnell splashed into the shallows then dived into the rushing water and fought his way across stern raced up the bank and scampered across the toggle bridge when mcconnell broke through the circle of men on the far bank he saw a young man gasping like a landed fish but getting no air into his lungs the commandos lips were already turning a deathly gray cyanosis he thought not much time the french commandos shouted wildly in their own language that someone should pump the water from their comrades lungs the young mans eyes bulged with terror as he tried vainly to suck air into his chest mcconnell elbowed two commandos aside saying sharply je suis un medecin le docteur this parted the clamoring mass of frenchmen he knelt beside sergeant mcshane and palpated the frenchmans throat the larynx had been fractured i need a penknife he said jai besoin dun couteau what are you doing mcshane asked the mans got water in his lungs no he doesnt he just cant breathe un couteau weve got to lay him on his stomach mcshane insisted push the water out help me turn him mcconnell knocked the sergeants arm aside then grabbed the young frenchmans hand and held it to mcshanes face look at his nails sergeant hes suffocating while mcshane stared transfixed at the blue skin beneath the nails someone thrust a small swissmade pocketknife into mcconnells hand he flicked open its two blades and chose the smaller for its sharpness the young frenchmans face was turning bluer by the second using his left index finger mcconnell probed carefully for his primary landmark the cricothyroid membrane at the center of the adams apple then brought the point of the knife blade in contact with the skin dinna try that sergeant mcshane said hell choke on his own blood ive seen it happen in the field if his throats crushed weve got to get him to a hospital hes dying mcconnell snapped hold him down he raised the knife blade turned horizontally so as to pass cleanly between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages hold him sergeant stunned by the americans sudden assumption of authority mcshane restrained the frenchman with his left forearm but grabbed mcconnells arm with his right wait damn you im a doctor mcconnell shouted turning on the big scotsman then he shouted in french metsle deahors get this man away a dozen hands jerked the astonished highlander clear three french commandos took his place and pinned their young friends head and body to the cold ground with one clean stroke mcconnell punched the knifepoint through skin and membrane the frenchmans chest heaved mon dieu gasped a dozen commandos in unison i need something hollow mcconnell told them jai shit jai besoin de quelque chose de creux a reed a straw a pen un stilo anything quickly as blood trickled from the small incision he rotated the knife blade caudally to widen it then he slid his right index finger down the side of the blade and into the hole drew out the blade and left his finger in place to preserve the integrity of his incision he was about to shout again when jonas stern knelt beside him and slapped a dismantled pen into his hand the togglebridge instructor was using it to mark his charts stern had already snapped off the end of the pens barrel creating a hollow tube mcconnell took the fat end and slowly fed it down the inside of his finger and into the incision exactly as he had slid his finger down the knife blade the moment the barrel entered the trachea the young frenchmans chest heaved again then slowly began to fill with air regardez shouted a soldier mcconnell ordered two commandos to hold their mans legs higher than his head while he squatted beside the mans neck and held the tube in place in less than a minute the frenchmans face lightened a shade in three minutes he had regained some pink and his pulse was strong how is he then sergeant mcshane had squatted just behind mcconnell his larynx is in bad shape but hes stable he needs a good surgeon now theres an ambulance on the way from fort william should be here in a few minutes good a french medic appeared and knelt beside the patient he nodded in silent admiration of mcconnells work then began taping the pen barrel to the skin so that it would remain in place during transport mark stood up and shook out his hands only now did he realize they were quivering been a while since ive done anything like that he said nothing but lab work for the last five years sergeant mcshanes voice carried open respect that wasna a bad show mr wilkes bloody good mcconnell extended his right hand its mcconnell sergeant doctor mark mcconnell im pleased to know you doctor mcshane said firmly shaking it i thought you were some kind of chemist man mcconnell smiled you were right about not trying a tracheotomy its a dangerous procedure even for a surgeon in a hospital i performed a cricothyroidotomy almost no danger of nicking an artery that way whatever you did it was the right thing the sergeants blue eyes held mcconnells doing the right thing at the right time thats a talent mcconnell shrugged off the compliment where did stern get off to you mean butler uh right right here said stern rising from the crowd of frenchmen thanks for that pen to mcconnells surprise the young jew leaned forward and offered his hand as mcconnell shook it stern turned to mcshane and said i think he might do after all eh sergeant mcshane nodded once aye he might at that walking back to the castle mcconnell realized that he had not enjoyed praise so much in quite some time that night lying on the cots in the cold nissen hut stern and mcconnell spoke for the first time about something other than their impending mission ive often wished i was a doctor stern said quietly not really for the day to day life you know but since i got to palestine in north africa as well ive seen a lot of men die he was silent for a while then he said the funny thing is i remember them all not their names especially but their faces their last seconds its struck me a dozen times how alike we all are at the end they never get it right in the pictures most men want their mothers if they can talk at all isnt that something ill bet they havent written their mothers in a year but at the end its the only thing that could ease their fear some call out to their wives or children ive stood and watched them die like that miles from any kind of hospital no first aid kit nothing mcconnell lay in the dark and said nothing stern was only twentyfive years old yet he had seen more death than most men would in their entire lives he slid up onto one elbow have you ever helped anybody in that position stern what do you mean mcconnell could just make out sterns silhouette in the darkness a prone body with arms crossed over its chest you know what i mean stopped their pain when i was an intern i saw a few patients i thought would have been better off dead but my hands were tied of course i just wondered what a man would do if there were no constraints stern waited a long time to answer mcconnell had closed his eyes and turned on his side when he heard a soft voice say once what i did that once in the desert some friends and i had raided an arab settlement horseback one man a boy really got hit in the back as we rode away half his insides were blown out through his stomach he couldnt ride any farther the arabs were behind us if wed doubled up we never would have got away not with him dripping blood all over arabs are madmen for tracking you over sand there wasnt much choice it was death or torture for him still nobody wanted to do it we kept hoping he would die on his own but he didnt we waited as long as we could but he just lay there gurgling and crying and begging for water stern paused he didnt tell us to leave him either so so i did it nobody ordered me to but if wed waited any longer we would all have been taken you did it while he wasnt looking stern chuckled bitterly in the darkness you watch too many films doctor he knew what was coming he put his hand over his eyes and whimpered bang we rode away jesus not a good thing for a jew to do somebody had to i guess i just wish i could have helped him really helped him like you did today mcconnell pulled the blankets up against the chill what could he say as the minutes passed he wondered whether stern was sleeping if he was what was he dreaming of what peace had he ever known his childhood was back in germany in the decade of despair and dementia that spawned adolf hitler could his brain still conjure images of a rhineland lost forever mcconnell closed his eyes without setting foot on a battlefield the fear the shame the raw intensity of human beings purposefully killing each other had already entered into him what lay behind all this what had brought a georgiabred pacifist to a drafty nissen hut behind a castle in the remote scottish highlands his brothers murder it was absurd the entire western world stood poised to invade hitlers fortress europe what could he and stern possibly accomplish there the next afternoon mcconnell was summoned to the castle by sergeant mcshane when he arrived he found brigadier smith waiting by the main entrance in his tweed jacket and stalkers cap obviously in a state smith tossed his head sideways indicating that mcconnell should follow him and led the way to a spot behind the castle where the rush of the arkaig over the rocks would cover his voice he faced the river as he spoke what the hell do you think youre playing at doctor mcconnell stared at the brigadiers back without comprehension what are you talking about smith whirled im talking about you wagging your bloody tongue around that empty skull of yours are you drunk brigadier listen doctor whatever your opinion of this mission you have no business infecting stern with your bloody pessimism do you hear suddenly mcconnell understood for the last few days while he had tried to reason his way through the logic of their mission stern had confidently deflected all questions by claiming that his objections could be explained away by simple facts that were being witheld from him for reasons of security but perhaps the truth was different perhaps stern had become worried enough to voice his own concerns to brigadier smith did he speak to you he asked smith reddened speak to me after that lazarus act of yours by the river yesterday he sneaked into charlie vaughans office and used the telephone to track me down in london had a bloody grocers list of questions mcconnell couldnt help but smile did you answer them i did nothing of the kind and ill answer none for you either what i will tell you is this youre not half as smart as you think you are theres more to this mission than you will ever know and you had better leave it to the professionals like you right unless you plan to back out now is that it mcconnell squatted beside the river and said nothing for some time the great manipulator deserved to sweat a little im tempted he said finally i know youre lying to me about the mission brigadier and i think youre lying to stern as well you never planned on the two of us becoming friends did you smith laughed harshly if you think jonas stern is your friend youre more naive than i thought believe it or not doctor im the only friend you have in this business mcconnell stood up and faced him if were such asshole buddies like you say maybe you should be going into germany with me since this is going to be such a bloodless mission and all dont be ridiculous smith said but i will be only a hundred miles away on the swedish coast thats interesting smith clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth well are you pulling out or staying in mcconnell skipped a flat stone across the river im in i just want you to know i know youre lying i dont know exactly how or why but i know he wiped his hands on his pants and smiled at the soe chief i wouldnt miss this insanity for the world he left smith standing beside the river with his mouth open four days had passed since schörner spoke to rachel three days left before she had to go to him of course she did not have to go to him she could run into the wire like the suicides at auschwitz but then jan and hannah would be left alone in a particularly black mood rachel had considered running to the wire with both children in her arms thinking it better that they die with her than have brandt take them for his ghastly experiments but she was not ready to do this the instinct to live was strong inside her she could feel it like a separate will motivating her actions without hindrance of thought in some prisoners she saw this instinct was not so strong several of the new widows had been steadily descending into terminal melancholia since the night of the big selection soon they would be musselmen the new voice inside rachel told her to ignore those women it was an echo of frau hagan despair is contagious this new voice also suggested a plan to save jan and hannah and rachel heeded it the plan centered around food her nightly trips to the alley for major schörners special rations did not escape the notice of the other inmates but she endured the glares and epithets in silence because what she was doing in the alley was not what the other prisoners thought she was doing when ariel weitz met her with the food each night good vegetables and real sausage rachel let jan and hannah eat their fill but did not touch her own portion while weitz stood watching from the end of the alley she would sit hunched over with her face in her hands seemingly despondent while her children ate sooner or later the new voice told her he will tell schörner you are not eating and the major wants you fat and soft for his bed not bony and dry like the other women in order to get what he wants from you perhaps he will grant you what you want from him it was really a small thing schörner wanted she told herself it was what every man had wanted from her since she was thirteen on the day he first spoke to her his proposition had horrified her but now though rachel would admit this to no one the prospect no longer seemed so repugnant especially in light of the other fates possible in totenhausen she thought also of her marriage of how she had believed it would be and then how it actually was as a child she had been taught that marriage was a partnership and to a large extent this had proved true but in the area of sexual relations sometimes it had not as gentle as marcus had been there were times when hed wanted her and she had not wanted to give herself and on some of those occasions he had not accepted her refusal he had never actually raped her but he had insisted until hed got what he wanted and that essentially was what major schörner was trying to do now or would do in three days time schörner was a straightforward sort of man and far from ugly and whatever inhuman crimes he might commit in the name of germany he seemed to possess a personal code of honor how difficult a thing would it be for him to help her by lifting his little finger at the right moment he could save her childrens lives this thought strengthened rachel for a while but on the afternoon of the fourth day she realized how deranged her thinking had become marcus might have occasionally demanded his way with her but hadnt she vowed to be his wife forever hadnt she sworn her love to him a thousand times a few nights of confusion and anger weighed against years of kindness and support were as nothing she was a prisoner here wolfgang schörner was her jailer one of the legion that had murdered her husband and thousands perhaps millions of her people schörner was a killer rachel was reflecting on this when the gypsy woman finally snapped for the past few days ever since her suicide attempt the women in the gypsys block had kept her tied to her bunk except during appell but today since she had lain absolutely still for seven hours the gypsy was allowed to leave her block one glimpse of klaus brandt pushed her over the edge rachel was standing alone near the headquarters building when she saw brandt step out of the hospital his white medical coat shining like a bright flag over a gray sea almost immediately a bundle of rags began running toward him from the block fence it was the gypsy woman she ran without sound arms windmilling wildly her eyes locked onto the oblivious doctor a towergunner saw her first to run in camp was to invite execution the gunner shouted a warning toward the ground then laid both hands to his machine gun rachel waited for the rattle that would end the gypsys life but another german shouted to the gunner not to fire it was one of sturms dog handlers patrolling the factory fence she watched in horror as the guard unhooked the leash of his german shepherd then shouted jüde and clapped his hands together it was the most horrifying thing rachel had ever seen the dog bounded over the snow at three times the speed of the gypsy woman the barking startled brandt from his reverie the corpulent doctor blinked at the fastapproaching woman who began shouting words no one in camp could identify the shepherd leaped when the gypsy was still ten meters from brandt knocking her facedown onto the snow within seconds another dog joined the attack like everyone else in the yard rachel stood rooted to the earth watching the dogs savage the woman she understood for the first time the urge some men had to hunt down and kill wild animals somehow it was an affirmation that this terrible thing could never happen to them this thing that must have happened countless times to their primeval ancestors when the third dog joined the melee rachel turned away and hurried toward her block where frau hagan was watching the children she did not want jan or hannah coming outside to see what the noise was about she heard someone possibly brandt himself shout an order in german to restrain the dogs but it really didnt matter no one could survive the butchery she had just seen anna kaas stood over the gypsy woman working quickly against great odds the canine teeth had torn much of the womans skin to shreds but that was incidental the real damage had been done to the blood vessels and of course there was the shock anna risked the ire of doctor brandt by clamping a major artery before any physician arrived then she set about treating the shock she raised the womans legs and covered her with a blanket in less than a minute large patches of the blanket were soaked with blood she was on the verge of taking further steps when greta müller rushed into the surgery be careful said the young nurse why i just heard the herr doktor say he would be attending to this woman personally both nurses knew what this meant it would have been better to let the gypsy bleed to death anna watched greta busy herself with trays and disinfectant anything to take her mind off the matter at hand and also to look busy when the herr doktor arrived thirty seconds later klaus brandt strode through the swinging doors of the surgery with his fringe of gray hair white coat and prussian bearing he was a perfect cinema picture of the concerned and able physician rushing to an emergency nothing could have been further from the truth he moved to an autoclave against the far wall and removed a cc syringe will you be assisting me nurse kaas he asked that is my honor herr doktor greta said quickly anna looked at the diminutive nurse silently thanking her greta cut her eyes toward the door meaning that she should get out while she could from the main hallway anna heard brandts cold voice requesting something she wrung her hands furiously and walked outside the appellplatz was empty sergeant sturms troops had herded everyone into the blocks sixty meters across the snow she knew eyeballs would be pressed to cracks in the block doors watching for the slightest indication of an ss reprisal she looked up at the guard towers every machine gun was trained on those doors four of sturms doghandlers appeared from the direction of the kennels each holding a straining shepherd on a chain leash none of the dogs wore muzzles anna heard the hospital door open she felt a brush of clothing against her shoulder saw the back of a white coat as brandt passed her and negotiated the icy concrete steps down to the ground she knew she should keep silent it would be madness to speak but she could not stop herself herr doktor brandt paused then turned and looked up his face expressionless the patient anna said brandts face suddenly came alive like a still picture shocked into motion the patient expired nurse kaas cardiac arrest im afraid the shock was too much for her he took a step toward her it was you who clamped the femoral artery anna nodded hesitantly you know that is not within your professional competency brandt gave her a mechanical smile still it was a good job initiative is to be encouraged you might have saved her if you hadnt killed her anna screamed silently but she said nothing she simply watched him turn and walk across the appellplatz toward his quarters she went back into the hospital greta was cleaning the surgery the bloodsoaked blanket now covered the gypsy womans face on the tray beside her corpse lay the syringe and a halfempty vial anna picked it up and read the label phenol brandt had injected carbolic acid directly into the womans heart muscle causing an agonizing death that had probably lasted one or two minutes it was his favorite method of elimination as he called it he murdered her anna said in a monotone greta looked up and stared as if anna were mad were nurses greta arent we greta müller looked away she seemed caught between anger and compassion finally she said politics i dont understand it im just a country girl the führer says the jews and the gypsies are an infection you have to kill an infection to save the host the host body is the nation i understand that principle many of our greatest physicians have endorsed it even sauerbruch anna shook her head hopelessly but i dont understand one thing greta said what the little nurse pulled back the blanket and pointed at the mutilated throat this one she would have died anyway what are you saying greta the nurse shrugged and pulled the blanket back over the corpses face sometimes in life it is necessary to do difficult things but it is not necessary to like it rachel sat rigidly in a back corner of the jewish womens block hugging jan and hannah to her chest frau hagan stood across the block watching the appellplatz through the crack in the door every block veteran believed a reprisal was imminent rachel knew nothing about reprisals she had not been in camp long enough to experience one some women had been hissing that the ss should kill every gypsy in the camp since it was a gypsy who had gone after brandt what madness madness when fear could pit good people against a woman whose only crime was trying to exact justice from her sons murderer if brandt had violated jan rachel knew she would have done the same and probably suffered the same fate she prayed that the gypsy woman was dead to be torn to pieces by dogs she shuddered she could not keep waiting for schörner to ask why she was not eating the food he was sending her she had hoped by her fasting to convince him that fear for her childrens safety was driving her toward starvation and that by offering protection he could bring her willingly and in good health to his bed but she could wait no longer brandt might decide in the next five minutes that he wanted jan to replace the gypsy boy in his quarters he could order a selection and take both of her children to the meningitis ward no she would simply have to go to schörners office today and try to baldly bargain with him he could have what he wanted frau hagan could call it collaboration she had no children to protect to rachel only one thing mattered on the day the allied armies finally arrived russians americans she didnt care who they would find rachel jansen at the gate of totenhausen with her two children in her arms alive as it happened rachel did not have to steel herself to walk into major schörners office and ask to speak to him fifteen minutes after the gypsy woman died schörner sent weitz to the block with orders to bring rachel to him her first response was panic had schörner grown tired of waiting and decided to punish her the pole will take care of your brats weitz muttered as he pulled rachel across the appellplatz i think that bitch is in love with you at schörners office they walked right past the clerk and into the majors presence schörner sat behind his desk his face cleanshaven today his tunic buttoned to the throat he dismissed weitz and opened his mouth to speak but rachel started first a moment please sturmbannführer may i ask you a question schörner looked discomfited by her directness go ahead then it is a difficult question herr sturmbannführer im not squeamish rachel concentrated on speaking perfect german are you a man of your word sturmbannführer a man of honor rather than explode with indignation as rachel had feared schörner leaned back in his chair and regarded her with interest he chose to answer her question with a question of his own do you know what honor is frau jansen i will tell you when our armies marched into athens a german officer ordered a greek soldier to strike the greek flag from the acropolis the greek took down the flag wrapped himself in it and stepped off the parapet he plunged to his death that is honor schörner sniffed and looked toward his office window do you think sturm and his men know anything of honor always sergeant sturm rachel thought why do they hate each other so much why does a major trouble himself about a sergeant if the russians overran this camp tomorrow schörner said sturm would kiss the ass of the first private through the gate and offer to sell him a watch and you sturmbannführer schörner steepled his fingers and gazed into rachels eyes only the day of action can answer that question but i can tell you this my word is my life i am glad to know that sturmbannführer because i have a favor to ask of you schörners eyelids lowered a little a favor you have asked something of me i wonder if i might ask something from you i see what is it rachel felt her words slipping away she had rehearsed them all the way across the appellplatz but to stand here like a beggar and offer to trade herself it was too difficult speak schörner demanded coming to his feet what is the matter with you weitz tells me you refuse to eat any of your food i go to great trouble to send that to you the other prisoners endure the same hardships as you yet they have no trouble eating in fact they gobble their food like swine rachel felt the floodgates burst it is my children sturmbannführer my son im worried that her throat closed involuntarily if schörner perceived jan as an obstacle to sexual congress with her might not he simply order the boy taken to the eblock and out with it woman schörner shouted rachel could think of nothing but the truth sometimes sometimes children disappear here sturmbannführer this statement took schörner completely aback he stood motionless for a few seconds then he walked to the door and made sure it was completely closed youre speaking of herr doktor brandt of course he said in a low voice rachel nodded quickly schörner sighed the commandant has a problem it is true he said softly a weakness as a man and a german officer i despise him however i tolerate him not because he is my superior but for one very simple reason he is competent in fact he is probably a genius can you understand brandt is not like mengele and the other quacks they call doctors at auschwitz brandt was educated at heidelberg and then at kiel as a medical doctor he was a senior chemist with farben for a while after which he moved into pure research he worked with gebhardt schräder himself schörner rubbed his chin as if mulling over how much to reveal research is what he is doing here farben provides him with equipment and materials and what he is working on frau jansen well never mind i have forgotten myself in the presence of a beautiful woman he looked rachel from head to toe you have some sort of accommodation in mind i take it yes sturmbannführer that would be fair of course but i must be honest the simple fact is that i cannot protect your son as commandant brandt has absolute authority over everyone here including me but you are second only to him and i have heard some people say that well that brandt is afraid of you schörner laughed i can assure you that rumor is false sturmbannführer i think that a small gesture from you at the right moment might save my son even my daughter schörner made a sound indicating great weariness frau jansen i can only give you advice keep the boy out of the appellplatz except during roll call make him look sick rub his skin with something to give him a rash give him lice it wont kill him and it might save him make his skin look yellow jaundiced but what about medical inspections ive heard that they periodically remove the sick and she faltered eliminate them schörner finished sometimes they do yes ss doctors are bloodthirsty even when working on their own brothersinarms they would rather hack off a leg than try to save it for you schörners right hand went to his eyepatch you would come to me tonight sturmbannführer please promise me you will try for that for that i could come as schörners eyes bore into hers rachel felt wretched and ridiculous what was she offering to have her body the major had only to lock the door and bend her over his desk she could not afford to scream much less fight him yet that did not seem to be how he wanted things to happen perhaps schörner said carefully i could help about the medical inspections i could send word to you just beforehand you could clean your boy up a bit so that he wouldnt be eliminated for sickness rachel put her hand over her mouth but then dr brandt would see him up close and clean he might decide he wants him for the medical experiments or for you know what schörner threw up his hands there is only so much i can do that is the system i didnt devise it i am merely trapped inside it as you are rachel let this remarkable statement pass unchallenged but in a way schörner was right he could only do so much to thwart the desires of his superior officer it was a miracle he had offered even this much of course he didnt have to live up to his word and he would probably grow tired of her after a few nights then what would she do frau jansen im sorry sturmbannführer come to your senses please we are agreed you will come to my quarters tonight rachel felt the coldness of a crypt seeping out from her heart tonight she said naturally it was weitz who escorted rachel to schörners quarters the camp was dark blackedout to conceal it from allied bombers once she was inside the physical act happened quickly the major had obviously been waiting at the door she did not fully undress she merely became bodiless for a few minutes a mind that absorbed the inanimate environment around her cherry furniture of which schörner had a few nice pieces scrounged from god knows where a phonograph an old gramophone that clicked steadily insisting that the end of the record had been reached a framed picture on the wall the obligatory sternfaced father and mother with schörner in front in civilian clothes and a tall smiling young man beside him in a wehrmacht captains uniform his older brother of course also a little blond girl smiling at the level of schörners belt there were other photos stuffed between a bureau mirror and its frame a group of grayuniformed men standing in deep snow and beyond the snow a white haze of sky split by bare black trees a pile of burning scrap metal behind the men materialized into a tank that would never move under its own power again the mens faces were grim but every man was touching a comrade in some way as if to reassure himself he was not alone on the great white plain rachel had assumed that when schörner finished she would be told to go back to the womens block or at least allowed to go but after she pulled on her underpants and rose from the couch schörner asked if she would stay a bit she hesitated wondering what he could want had he not satisfied himself he looked quite at ease schörner led her into his front room and bade her sit down in a wing chair he poured some brandy which rachel left standing on the low table before her then schörner simply looked at her to rachel the room seemed filled by a brittle silence she did not feel particularly uncomfortable or particularly comfortable either she simply noticed that the majors quarters unlike the jewish womens block did not stink of sweat and disinfectant and worse things it smelled of leather and gun oil and faintly of cigars while he sat there watching her she wondered if she was a different person for what she had allowed him to do she didnt feel different at least not any different from when she had walked in the door fifteen minutes earlier but perhaps she was not thinking clearly like a person who has had a limb torn off by a shell while rachel sat thinking these things major schörner began to talk it struck her as quite odd the things he said he began by talking about the city of cologne how he missed it and then about his older brother he talked about hunting trips they had taken together as boys he required no response from rachel only that she listen she was glad he had not done all this talking before somehow she knew it would have been more difficult to block him out to erase him as a person after some time talking like this he fell silent again he studied rachel with a wistful intensity so great that she suddenly realized she knew what he was thinking this strange certainty gave her the courage to ask a question who is it that i remind you of sturmbannführer schörner answered effusively as if during all his silence he had been waiting for her to ask this very thing a young fräulein from my hometown cologne as i told you her name was erika erika möser we were sweethearts from a very young age but no one knew it she was the daughter of a rival banking family youve read shakespeare im sure it was the montagues and the capulets all over again the coming of hitler made things even worse for us unlike my father herr möser openly condemned the führer and anyone who supported him he was an arrogant man too powerful to eliminate but goebbels forced him out of the country in erika stayed behind to wait for me schörner swallowed and looked at the floor it was a mistake she was killed in the british thousandbomber raid of rachel listened in amazement it was all so unbelievable one imagined ss officers to be monsters sterile machines that obeyed orders to rape and massacre not human beings who quaintly compared their childhood romances to romeo and juliet yet schörner had killed many times she was sure of it at totenhausen alone he had presided over the executions of hundreds perhaps thousands of prisoners and tonight he had pressured her into submitting to his will you went to university schörner asked suddenly yes at vrije for two years only though i married before graduating but that is excellent now perhaps i can converse for a while in words not prescribed in the manual of orders i told you i was at oxford didnt i rachel could hardly believe he remembered he had been so drunk yes sturmbannführer you said you were a paying student not a rhodes scholar schörner laughed thats right my father wanted me to be the german asquith strange isnt it strange that a man like that would let his son join the ss let me schörner slapped his knee the old hypocrite made me join its true let me tell you a funny story secretly my father despised hitler the führer was a bounder an upstart a nobody but after or so my father began to see which way the wind was blowing so did a lot of aristocrats as well he decided hitler might take germany where it needed to go after all given that he decided he should cover his bases my brother joseph was already in the wehrmacht as per family tradition hes on kesselrings staff now in italy and so young wolfgang was encouraged into the ss the national socialist aristocracy the nazi elite you swore the personal oath to hitler rachel asked quietly yes it didnt seem such a difficult thing to do in now well let us say that the ss is not the ideal organization for an educated man not even for a halfeducated man like me educated men tend to ask questions and questions are verboten in the ss rachels curiosity struggled with her fear of provoking retaliation but even if the ss began as an elite unit how can a man of your education ignore the things they have done over these years what i have seen myself the stories ive heard schörners face seemed suddenly to grow heavy there are excesses certainly there are things i do not agree with war brings opportunities to men who in normal times suppress darker appetites you should see what the russians did to some of my friends he curled his lip in disgust but frankly if we win the war none of that will ever be brought up in polite conversation much less in a court of law the butchers will be heroes rachel was too stunned to consider her words if you win surely you dont i mean can you win once the americans and the english invade schörner smiled with surprising confidence that is exactly the problem we are working on here at totenhausen i almost told you the other day he leaned back on the sofa a man in a good humor munificent in his superiority what is this power you have over me he asked you make me want to pour out my soul what a fool i am telling all to a woman yet he did not stop he seemed to enjoy the absurdity of the situation frau jansen what i told you about doktor brandts abilities is true he is a pioneering chemist a man of genius his war gases are germanys only hope of throwing the allied invasion army back into the sea believe me when i tell you that soman can stop literally an infinite number of troops it is what we call a denial weapon no one can occupy the same area it does and if we deny the allies a foothold in france this year we can stop the russians in the east but can you win schörner bristled we might if not we can negotiate an end to the war with respectable territorial gains that would be satisfactory the alternative is the destruction of germany schörner leaned forward that is why i tolerate herr doktor brandts eccentricities frau jansen it is an interesting intellectual problem yes brandts weakness is one for which i might kill him during normal times but we are at war thus his value to germany is determined by a different equation perhaps by a different mathematics altogether rachel wondered where she fit in schörners different mathematics there he sat a scion of the master race having a parlor chat with a member of the tribe he was pledged to eradicate from the face of the earth sturmbannführer she said quietly are you not in danger sitting here with a jew in this fashion doing what we have done schörner cocked his head slightly to the side then he chuckled softly i suppose so but in this crazy camp i would say that what i did tonight hardly qualifies as a misdemeanor rachel would not be put off i am a jew she said again what does that mean to you schörner turned up his palms to me you are a woman he said i dont really care about religion i never did brandt doesnt care either to tell you the truth to him we are all guinea pigs if i was old and ugly rachel said would you still not care about my religion schörner laughed you are not old and ugly even nearly bald you are quite beautiful but please do not push me on this there are paradoxes in all societies frau jansen you did not grow up as i did so you cannot possibly understand what led me to the position in which i now find myself nor can i really understand yours no rachel said under her breath schörner stood not hurriedly but with enough emphasis to indicate that the conversation was over i have absolutely no doubt that these things ive said tonight will not leave this room you understand of course rachel felt as if an electrical switch had been thrown in her chest what she had taken as a strange intimacy was merely schörner speaking freely in the certainty that she would eventually die like all the other prisoners she could scarcely believe she had dared speak to him much less pressed him about personal matters i understand completely sturmbannführer she said submissively should i go now you may go i look forward to your next visit rachel turned to the door just a moment take the brandy with you schörner was holding out the glass she had left untouched on the table rachel considered taking the brandy to frau hagan the old pole would have no scruples about drinking nazi booty but rachel could not touch the glass somehow she felt if she accepted anything material from schörner she would be lost that she might never find herself again even if she did someday manage to escape this place it was only a small victory but she clung to it outside schörners quarters rachel saw a man standing in the shadow of the administrative building smoking a cigarette she cringed thinking it might be sergeant sturm as she drew closer she realized it was only one of sturms dog handlers he did not challenge her but he smiled in a way that made her rush past as quickly as she could the moneys as good as in my pocket sergeant mcshane shouted jonas stern stood at the foot of one support leg of a sixtyfoot power pylon his eyes glued to those of ian mcshane who stood twenty feet away beneath the poles twin the huge supports were joined at the top by a twentyfoot crossarm forming an approximate mockup of the pylon stern would have to scale in germany three electrical wires stretched from the crossarm to a second pylon one hundred yards down the hill then on again to a third on the banks of loch lochy mcshane had bet stern five pounds that he could beat the younger man to the top of the pylon and release one of the cylinders hanging from the wires ready he prodded stern glanced down at his boots the iron climbing spikes were strapped securely to his calves leaving two razor points jutting inward from the arches of his feet he would have discarded the safety belt that held his waist loosely to the pole but mcshane had insisted he wear it as part of the wager stern raised his left foot three feet above the wet ground and dug a spike into the pole then he slid the belt up high enough so as not to restrict him when he leaped ready he said see you at the top cried mcshane stern began climbing with a herkyjerky motion moving quickly up the pole but fighting the safety belt all the way with every step he vowed that he would abandon it as soon as he got to germany he glanced to his left and marveled at how smoothly sergeant mcshane climbed the man outweighed him by twenty kilograms yet he scampered up the pylon with the natural grace of a jungle ape stern focused on the crossarm high above his head and redoubled his efforts scraping both cheeks and inner forearms as he struggled upward his right hand had just caught hold of the roughedged crossbeam when mcshane shouted thats five pounds you owe me mate stern looked up the huge highlander was already sitting above him on the crossarm his bare legs hanging beneath his old kilt his face laughing beneath his green beret stern heard a soft whirring sound and looked down the hill thirty meters along the wire that began beneath mcshanes kilt a dark green gas cylinder trundled smoothly downhill toward the second pylon stern reached out and jerked the rubber rope hanging from the pulley roller nearest him yanking out the cotter pin that held the cylinder beneath it in place powered only by gravity the green cylinder began to move away from the pylon and gather speed the whole contraption looked something like a large oxygen bottle tied by its neck to a runaway skilift chair but this did not stop it from working with absolute precision i dont have five pounds stern grumbled settling into an uncomfortable perch on his end of the crossarm mcshane waved his hand you can stand me a pint in fort william beats money anytime stern nodded still trying to catch his breath theres ben nevis mcshane said see it i call her the crouching lion tallest mountain in scotland stern raised his eyes and looked out over the glen far to the south he saw the wooded hump of the mountain shrouded in mist loch lochy shimmered like polished slate in the pale sun i think youve about got the knack of it mcshane said above the rising wind course itd take you another month to get up to my level stern nodded with resignation youre damned good he admitted but why in gods name do you work so hard at it youre not the one whos going into stern stared hard into the highlanders blue eyes mcshane winked finally figured it out have you christ it only took you a week you closemouthed bastard youre going in to hang the cylinders mcshane made an indignant face goin you say im leading the bloody mission who else is going with you mcshane looked around cautiously which appeared ridiculous sixty feet off the ground three other instructors he said we get a little tired of wetnursing pups like you this is probably going to be the last real commando raid of the war you know in the classic sense i mean hit and run shoot n scoot as we used to say its all a game to you isnt it stern said in an accusatory tone the war i mean mcshanes lips maintained their smile but his eyes narrowed its one way of looking at it that way no matter how bad things get you keep some perspective but ill tell you this man when the luftwaffe was pounding london into dust and the raf lads were dying like flies over the channel it wasna any game churchill sent us across just to show britain wasna lyin down for hitler we got chewed into little pieces i lost many a mate those first two years i dinna mind tellin you the day of reckoning is at hand mcshane reached out with his boot and rocked a third gas cylinder which hung from the wire beneath him i reckon most are content to wait for the invasion but we highlanders are a vindictive lot to our own detriment sometimes smith offered me a chance to hit the bastards where it hurts so i took it stern had never thought he would feel empathy for a british soldier but in that moment he did how much do you know about the mission sergeant mcshane gazed past him to the gray hills i know all i need to know same as you dinna look to know more he glanced down to check his spikes for the descent you ought to be glad its me going you need all the help ye can get what do you mean i can take care of myself can you mcshane chuckled softly i hope you can hide yourself better than you hid that bicycle i found the bloody thing four days ago sterns mouth fell open dinna be worryin about that the colonel doesnt know i slipped it back to that crofters hut for you the highlander reached down and took hold of the cotter pin holding the third cylinder in place youll do fine he said smith knew what he was doing youre the perfect man for your job he yanked the pin from the roller wheel and im the perfect man for mine if anyone can hang those cylinders stow your gear and get out without the hun any the wiser its the boys from achnacarry stern watched the cylinder glide smoothly down the wire he was glad to know mcshane would be preparing the way for him he didnt like any of the other instructors much but after five days of training under them he had to admit that hed never met better or tougher soldiers in his life the rolling cylinder jumped the crossarm on the second pylon then settled into a steady run down toward the loch when are you jumping off stern asked by my count its time to go the cylinders from porton down are scheduled to arrive in one hour mcshane said calmly my lot shoves off then stern felt a rush of excitement tonight mcshane unclipped his safety belt slid off the crossarm and dug his spikes into the thick pole beneath it he looked over at stern and grinned i just wish i was going to be there to see those cylinders land in that camp itll be some show that one night only and no one leaves alive no one but me and mcconnell said stern right mcshane added quickly thats what i meant beyond the arkaig river where it bent north of the castle mcconnell wearily stuffed his chemistry and german books into a leather bag and started back toward the commando camp hed had enough studying and his stomach was audibly begging for nourishment to shorten his trip he turned into a section of forest known as the mile dorcha or dark mile the origin of the name was plain enough what had once been a forest lane was now a tunnel of overarching trees with the road itself sunk between high banks covered with deep moss and lichens it was the kind of place where one halfexpected to hear the thunder of hoofbeats as a headless horseman galloped out of the trees but it was no horseman that stepped out of the forest to mcconnells right causing his heart to momentarily stop it was a tall man of about sixty wearing a beautiful kilt a green beret and scuffed brogues the grayeyed stranger stood motionless beside the lane when mcconnell drew near he lifted his walking staff and raised two fingers in greeting hello said mcconnell fine day for a walk the man replied then fell in beside him yes it is mark agreed the stranger said nothing else strangely mcconnell felt no urge or obligation to speak the kilted walker seemed in absolute harmony with his surroundings as if he were as much a part of the landscape as the moss and the crooked trees in the easy silence mcconnell found himself reflecting on the past week his time at achnacarry had been a revelation the emergency surgery on the riverbank had left him exhilarated reminding him of what he had given up to work in the labs at oxford it had also marked the genesis of a careful friendship between himself and stern the taciturn jew still refused to reveal what kind of training he was doing alone but whenever mcconnell heard the kawhoom of explosions echoing through the hills he pictured stern with his hand on the detonator twice more since the episode at the river he had managed to surprise stern yesterday sergeants mcshane and lewis had trotted up to them carrying a massive tenfoot log on their shoulders lewiss knee was heavily taped but he was making a great point of showing everyone that stern had not crippled him when the two sergeants pretended to pass the log to mcconnell mark stunned everyone by taking it on his shoulder and marching off across the hill with little apparent strain he didnt tell them that during high school he had worked summers at a creosote plant where with twelve tireless negroes he had hauled sizzling black poles nine hours a day under the georgia sun and last night when he and stern stumbled upon a sergeant giving an outdoor lecture on survival cooking mcconnell had entered achnacarry folklore the cook had challenged his audience to guess which animals flesh they were eating from his fire when the stumped french commandos and jonas stern heard that the roasted delicacy in their mouths was achnacarry rat there was a race to the river to vomit only mcconnell finished his full portion explaining that during the depression he had eaten alligator possum nutria snake and raccoon he earned the cooks eternal friendship by pronouncing achnacarry rat superior to nutria which was a large water rodent of the american southeast such moments had been rare though the uncertainty of their impending mission and their impatience to get on with it set them apart from the soldiers at the castle who knew that their own battles with the germans would not begin until spring arrived youre the american arent you mcconnell jumped at the sound of the voice so smooth and silent were the movements of the kilted man beside him that he had almost forgotten his presence the pacifist ive been hearing about mcconnell glanced over at the weathered face of the stranger in the beret then looked ahead at the end of the tunnel of trees an arch of light glimmered like a great cathedral window yes he said but im afraid you have me at a disadvantage sorry i thought youd know me by the tartan im donald cameron mcconnell tried to recover gracefully from the hitch in his stride sir donald cameron laird of achnacarry castle the highlander smiled aye a mouthful isnt it he gazed high into the shadowy treetops as they moved toward the forests edge beautiful in the gloaming eh yes sir the hills here remind me of some mountains back in my home state where would that be georgia your hills have the same mist the same wooded slopes as the appalachian mountains ive heard of these mountains a great many americans come over here you know searching for roots they say quite a few camerons were pushed off the land during the clearances and many went to america some to those very mountains of yours the arch of light had grown closer but it seemed to dim as they approached is that right said mcconnell when i first heard your name it was a bit of a surprise whys that lad camerons have owned this land for seven hundred years mcconnell heard the sound of rushing water thats what i mean you see my middle name is cameron the laird didnt stop walking but he turned to face mcconnell is that a fact now and your last name mcconnell hm mostly irish that my grandmother was a cameron well theres two sets of camerons hereabouts the camerons of lochiel and the camerons of erracht sir donald winked at mcconnell lets hope she was a lochiel eh the two men emerged from the dark mile into lambent winter light the cool spray of falling water misted the air the laird led mcconnell onto an arched stone footbridge and gestured up toward two waterfalls that cascaded into a peaty brown pool below the bridge he took a deep satisfied breath i suppose the men have been giving you a lot of trouble about this pacifist business mcconnell hesitated a bit dont think youre cut out for battle eh i just think there must be a better way to solve problems the laird smiled wistfully aye youd think so after all this time men are bloodyminded creatures though the light was changing fast on the falls the frothing white turning silver in the twilight when bonnie prince charlie started to raise the rebellion cameron said my ancestor the gentle lochiel they called him rode straight on to talk the prince out of it an illtimed enterprise he called it did he succeed oh no the rebellion was born and lochiel fought like the rest but he knew it was doomed from the start ye see ended in blood and death at culloden sir donald nodded slowly at mcconnell my point lad is that a man isnt measured by how regularly he struts around beating his chest a wise man loves peace better than war he raised his forefinger and a wise man picks his battles when he can leastways mcconnell was surprised to hear such a philosophy from a highland chief a warrior breed if ever there was one its a strange world the laird mused in the redcoats burned our old castle now charlie vaughan and his english commandos have occupied the new one i dont like it but its in a good cause hitler i mean ive no use for the man no use for a german at all to be honest going to germany yourself are ye mcconnell felt a shock of disbelief brigadier smith had certainly not confided the target of the mission to a civilian even if he was the landlord dont look so surprised lad not much gets by me why else would you be paired with that german jew and dinna be worryin im no a talker its true mcconnell said feeling an almost confessional relief must be important then the lairds blue eyes bore into mcconnells going into the enemy camp means bloodshed i guess you know that im figuring it out well if they picked you for this job you must be the right man mark set his elbows on the stone rail of the bridge i didnt think so at first but now i have a queer feeling almost like well destiny or something take the name cameron right now i may be standing on land my ancestors walked and only because of this mission sir donald nodded you listen lad when the time comes when you get to the sharp end of things youll know what to do i heard how you saved that frog down by the river that was my medical training im not trained for this camerons bright eyes flashed bugger all that if youve got cameron blood in your veins yeve got the fight in ye youll bear up when the time comes he leaned his staff against the bridge rail and pulled a deerskinning knife from the stocking of his right leg then looked mcconnell in the eye i wish i were going with you thats gods truth but im too old now my son is about your age hes with the lovat scouts in any case youre a cameron by one branch or the other and youre entitled to wear the tartan mcconnell watched in amazement as the laird sliced off a sixinch swatch of his heavy woolen kilt you take this doctor he said might bring ye luck in the hard places he slipped the knife back into his stocking theres not a hun in the world could stand before a cameron with his blood up mark my words mcconnell stood straight and carefully folded the green red and yellow cloth into the pocket of his army denims thank you sir he said ill keep it close by you do that lad the light was nearly gone in the distance mcconnell heard a muffled explosion yet another prelude to the great cataclysm that would soon smash to rubble what was left of europe he leaned on the bridge rail and watched the water sluice over the falls you could lose yourself in that sound he thought in the sound and the smell of wet stone and woodsmoke and mist as he stared a great salmon leaped from the shadowy pool below the falls its sides gleamed like pewter dipped in oil and its tail flashed darkly in the dusk did you see that he cried looking to his right no one was there only the empty stone bridge and the lane leading back into the mossy tunnel of the dark mile the laird of achnacarry had vanished as crazy as he felt doing it mcconnell reached into his pocket to make sure the swatch of tartan was still there to make sure he hadnt hallucinated the whole damned thing he hadnt the cloth felt reassuringly coarse against his fingers he started back toward the castle thinking of what lochiel had told him pick your battles he hadnt picked this one duff smith had picked it for him it was odd in war you ended up taking orders from men like smith pragmatic generals who assessed casualty projections with all the detachment of actuaries at lloyds why couldnt it be a man like sir donald cameron who sent you in harms way a man of flesh and blood and compassion a leader who didnt manipulate but inspired mcconnell slung his book bag over his shoulder and broke into a run feeling his temples throb with frustration hed had it up to the neck with training it was time to get on with it while mcconnell ate alone in the solitary hut behind the castle jonas stern sat in colonel vaughans office still half expecting to be raked over the coals by the colonel for stealing the bicycle it was not charles vaughan who appeared at the door however but brigadier smith the soe chief wore a heavy raincoat and his stalkers cap but tonight he carried no map case he sat down heavily in vaughans chair pulled a bottle of singlemalt whiskey and two glasses from a file cabinet and poured two fingers into each glass drink that he ordered stern stern sat motionless whats wrong you havent scrubbed the mission scrubbed it i should say not mcshane and his men are flying toward germany as i speak what is it then smiths voice carried a note stern had never heard from him before almost compassion i drove over from the takeoff point just to see you he said weve had some news out of germany it may concern you how the brigadier pulled a folded sheet of paper out of his inside coat pocket three days ago soe scraped a pole off a baltic ice floe hed worked wonders for us but he was blown he managed to bring out one last haul among his papers were several lists of names people whod died at certain camps one of those camps was totenhausen stern nodded slowly and smith handed the sheet across the desk scanning it quickly stern saw about fifty names some obviously jewish others not there were numbers beside each name he found it near the bottom of the page a name that stood out like letters of fire among the others avram stern stern cleared his throat how old is this list he asked in a shaky voice we dont know could be months could be as recent as a week is it your father lad how the hell do i know stern exploded there could be a hundred avram sterns inside concentration camps in the rostock area smith asked softly stern raised his right hand pleading for silence i told him he said staring at the floor i begged him but he wouldnt leave i was fourteen and i could see it but hed fought for the kaiser in the great war said hitler would never betray the veterans what shit what shit he stood up and moved to leave hold on a minute smith said i know this is a hard blow i debated whether or not to show you that list but its a mans right to know you may not come back from germany yourself stern nodded dully youre going in tomorrow night almost the dark of the moon smith seemed hesitant to proceed ive got to say this you know you cant bring anyone out with you what do you mean i mean jews smith said firmly no one is coming out of germany but you and mcconnell if you do bring anyone out the sub wont take them aboard clear no one can ever know about this mission stern ever especially the americans to hell with the americans how can i bring anyone out if im not going inside the camp until after the attack thats exactly my point see that you dont smith examined his fingernails is the good doctor still trying to talk you out of going what oh no he talks doesnt mean anything talking never adds up to anything so youre ready then even if mcconnell loses his nerve balks whatever youll carry it through stern looked up in exasperation his burning black eyes answer enough and the prisoners i know what has to be done theres a good lad smith gave a satisfied grunt then poured himself another whiskey and took a measured sip theres one last bit of business we have to discuss its rough but necessary and youre the man for it i can see im listening youve been in hostile territory before you know how it works there can be no question of either of you being captured alive especially mcconnell with all he knows it simply wouldnt do stern reached into his shirt and brought out a small round medal with the star of david engraved on it smith had never noticed the chain before stern worked the dull silver between his fingers then opened his hand in his palm lay an oblong black pill ive carried it ever since north africa he said the brigadier raised his eyebrows in surprise good show usually best for everyone yourself included however i doubt whether dr mcconnell shares your philosophy of preparedness in fact i doubt the man would take cyanide even if he had it he wouldnt agreed stern duff smith sat without speaking for nearly a minute finally he said you understand sterns black eyes never blinked if thats the way it has to be he said in a toneless voice zol zayn azoy so be it when stern had gone brigadier smith folded his list of names and put it back into his pocket then he drank the whiskey stern had left on the desk he hadnt really wanted to lie but he had no alternative in all his experience he had never ordered a mission quite like this one war always required blood to achieve victory but never had he seen the equation so starkly laid out black cross did not require the sacrifice of trained soldiers at the hands of the enemy but the murder of innocent prisoners by one of their own people under the cold light of a planning table it was a simple calculus of casualties versus potential gain enormous gain but smith had enough experience in the field to know that for the man on the ground who would himself have to take those innocent lives cold reason might not be enough in that situation a man needed conviction that burned like lye in his belly he had just given jonas stern that conviction soe really had scraped a pole off the baltic coast three days ago and the pole had been carrying a list of dead jews but there was no avram stern among the names smith had no idea whether avram stern was alive or dead and he didnt much care hed gotten the name from major dickson in london who had a file on jonas stern an inch thick requisitioned from the military police in palestine the funny thing smith reflected was that his lie about sterns father dying in totenhausen was probably as close as anyone would ever come to knowing his true fate and if that lie gave the son the fire he needed to carry out black cross then the old jew would not have died in vain cheeky sod thundered a familiar voice drinking my whiskey ill pin your ruddy ears back duff smith blinked up at the massive bulk and florid face of colonel charles vaughan sorry he said rising to his feet i was breaking a bit of bad news a dram softens the blow what vaughans expression changed instantly to paternal concern ere now duff i was only aving you on lets drain the bottle eh absent friends thanks just the same charles smith stepped out from behind the desk and patted the colonels upper arm i need to get back to baker street vaughan frowned in disappointment all right then cloaks and daggers did your special cargo come through all right fine i appreciate your lending me mcshane and the others a tough job wants tough men theyre my best no mistake and no one will ever know they were gone duff rest assured of that thanks old man smith stepped through the door then turned back his lips pursed thoughtfully you know charles its frightening how committed some of these jews are coldblooded as gurkhas when it comes to the killing wed better look to our guns in palestine after the wars over vaughan rubbed his square chin i wouldnt lose sleep over that duff i dont think adolfs going to leave enough of them alive to start a riot much less a war ss oberscharführer willi gauss peered through the trees into darkness then he turned back and looked deeper into the forest at the house he had left behind through the pouring rain he could see that frau kleist had already switched off the lamps with a satisfied sigh he stepped out of the trees and began following the narrow footpath that led around the wooded hills and back to totenhausen it would take him forty minutes of trudging through wind and rain to reach the camp but he didnt really care his trips to frau kleists engendered an entirely different sort of fatigue than that produced by closeorder drill frau kleists husband was captain of u stationed in the gulf of mexico but the old man hadnt been home for eighteen months and his wife was not the type to martyr her sexuality for the german navy willi thought the situation funny sybille kleist hated the sea but shed married a submarine captain because she loved his dashing uniform so typically german claiming that her husband didnt get home frequently enough to warrant living in a seaport she had chosen to live alone in a very comfortable house outside her home village of dornow the captains misfortune was willi gausss salvation sybille kleist was insatiable in bed willi was twentythree years old she forty yet sybille drained him to exhaustion twice a week sometimes three times some nights she would not even let him step outside the house to have a pee she waited for this need to make him hard then used him again and willi wasnt complaining only lately had she begun to talk nonsense she claimed she loved him even at twentythree willi knew that was dangerous when the war was over captain johann kleist would return uboat captains were notoriously proud and tough men willi planned to have broken off the affair long before that day still one or two more trips to sybilles bed wouldnt make the ending any more difficult as he approached a dogleg on the dark path he heard a muted thump somewhere ahead it sounded vaguely familiar but in the rain he couldnt place the sound as he rounded the turn he heard a swish in the trees to his left then another thump had sergeant sturm finally decided to follow him and see what he was up to in the forest at night seconds later willi stopped dead in the slushy path ten meters away stood a giant of a man wearing a dark uniform only the whites of two eyes flickered in the space where the face should have been when willi saw the parachute and shroud lines flap in the wind a small voice in his brain said kommando he discounted it after all he was standing on german soil far from any battlefront perhaps major schörner had laid on some type of exercise to test the totenhausen guards this thought stayed willis hand for a moment then he grabbed for the holster on his belt a bright flash bloomed in front of the parachutist willi felt a tremendous blow in the stomach then he was looking up into the stormy sky over mecklenburg the parachutist bent over him willi felt more puzzled than afraid and tired unbelievably tired as he stared upward the blackedout face above him swirled disappeared then coalesced into the soft features of sybille kleist she looked different somehow she looked beautiful as he lost consciousness willi realized that perhaps he loved her after all hes dead ian said a voice in english sergeant mcshane kicked the body it didnt move make sure he ordered a dark figure dropped to the ground and drove a dagger into the fallen germans heart papers mcshane said the kneeling figure rifled the dead mans pockets and came up with a brown leather wallet hes a sergeant ss oberscharführer willi gauss heres a ration card with the word totenhausen mcshane nodded i dinna think a lone sergeant with a pistol constitutes a patrol colin still someone might be expecting him back at camp the achnacarry weapons instructor looked up from willi gausss corpse i smell liquor on him ian mcshane watched the path while he freed himself from his parachute harness within seconds two more shadows raced up and stopped beside him both men instructors from achnacarry one was alick cochrane another highlander built on the mcshane model the other john lewis the judo instructor stern had embarrassed on the first day of training by taping his knee exercising it furiously each day and packing it in ice each night lewis had made good his promise to be fit enough for the mission do you know where we are ian alick cochrane asked between the two main groups of hills west of the village and the camp as planned but were too far south bloody storm still it could have been worse jumping blind like that aye cochrane agreed i dinna think i could have done it if you hadnt jumped first where are the cylinders and the other gear asked lewis mcshane looked up at the dark hills and shielded his eyes from the driving rain should be north of us on the plain where were supposed to be the electrical station should be at the top of these hills to our left due east colin munro wiped his dagger clean and rose to his feet how do you want to play it ian mcshane looked down at the dead man in the path and forced himself to think clearly from the moment they entered german airspace things had begun going wrong theyd flown out of wick airbase in scotland in the most secret aircraft of the special duties squadron a luftwaffe jua that had forcedlanded in cornwall and then been refitted by soe for highpriority missions into europe the junkers and a germanspeaking raf pilot had carried the team unchallenged over the occupied low countries but the weather soon intervened a baltic storm had unexpectedly veered south and settled like a wall over the old german border the pilot wanted to turn back but mcshane had forced him to fly straight into the storm using the recknitz river as a landmark he was able to bring the commandos almost directly over their target they had jumped blind without flares or radio to guide them and miraculously landed without injury however their cargo chutes and gas cylinders had been dropped too long after them mcshane knew he could eventually locate the cargo chutes hed watched them falling as long as he could the dead man at his feet was the problem oberscharführer willi gauss could wreck the entire mission before mcconnell and stern even reached germany simply by having been in the wrong place at the wrong time mcshane glanced around the dark forest someone could easily have heard the fatal shots fired the silencers on the stens were far from silent ian alick cochrane asked gently we bury him in the woods mcshane barked right here bury our chutes in the same hole no time for anything else then well retrieve the cylinders bury the cargo chutes and move up the hill those cylinders said colin munro ill bet if we ditched the carrying poles and each of us took a cylinder on his shoulder we could cut the transport time in half especially through these woods those bloody tanks are heavy lewis reminded them no tougher than the logs at achnacarry said mcshane will your knee take the weight then john ill manage right this is where we live up to all that blarney we give the recruits about everybody down mcshane hit the wet snow beside willi gausss corpse what is it alick cochrane grabbed his arm and pointed toward the woods forty yards to the north a yellow light had appeared in the trees after thirty seconds of absolute concentration mcshane decided the light was stationary what do we do lewis asked keep your bloody mouth shut and pray it goes away sybille kleist stood at the front window of her cottage and peered into the darkness she knew the sounds of her forest and the brief brrat that had punctuated the night after her lovely willi left was not part of the normal mecklenburg nocturne she wondered if her paramour might be returning for one more round of lovemaking she hoped so but willi did not reappear she took a drag on her cigarette and wished again for a telephone not that she could call anyone about her fears they might stumble onto willi and that would be that life was becoming far too complicated what would she do when her husband returned divorcing a heroic uboat captain would brand her as a faithless unpatriotic slut no matter how boring the man was nothing ever worked out as it should after another anxious minute of watching and listening sybille reluctantly went back to bed and lit a second cigarette the sheets were still damp from willis enthusiastic attentions thinking of him she remembered the sharp sound from the path it was probably only a stag she told herself scraping his antlers on a tree but she would be glad when she saw willi again all the same everybody up mcshane ordered softly weve only got seven hours till dawn after weve hung the cylinders and stowed the radio weve still got to make it to the beach colin munro pulled a folding spade out of his pack lets haul this bastard into the trees and get him buried it took ninetysix minutes to bury willi gauss find all eight cylinders attach the roller mechanisms and suspension arms to the cylinder heads and bury the cotton cargo chutes that had brought them all down it required a further two hours to lug the eight cylinders plus one box that was to be cached for stern and mcconnell to the top of the highest hill they set up their base at the foot of the first pylon beyond the transformer station fence the station itself was blacked out to keep it from the eyes of allied bomber formations a deep humming in the forest told the commandos that it was functioning but a quick recon by cochrane confirmed that it was deserted lewis grumbled that to climb the pylon and work around the highvoltage wires in the rain was suicide ignoring him completely mcshane donned spikes and harness tied a long coiled rope to his belt and quickly climbed one of the sixtyfoot support poles colin munro was right on his heels at the top buffeted by wind and icy rain mcshane tied his toggle rope around the crossarm as a safety measure then uncoiled the long rope and used it to haul up the block and tackle necessary to hoist the gas cylinders to the top of the pylon the commandos worked mostly in silence albeit at a frantic pace they had rehearsed the operation a dozen times at achnacarry cochrane and lewis attached the cylinderroller wheel combinations at ground level then used the block and tackle to haul the apparatus to the top of the pylon mcshane and colin munro handled the transfer to the auxiliary conductor wires at achnacarry munro had likened the transfer process to hanging a pound christmas ornament on a tightrope the cylinder was the ornament and the roller wheel and suspension bar formed the hook the analogy was apt and it stuck hanging the ornament required perfect balance and enormous strength as it had to be lifted off of the tackle hook that had brought it up to the crossarm then raised still higher and set down on the outermost auxiliary wire all without man or metal touching the live wire that ran just inches away mcshane provided the strength munro the balance once the roller wheel had been fitted onto the wire munro would climb from the crossarm onto the cylinder itself while mcshane held both man and machine in place with a rubber rope attached to a hook on the cylinders bottom then mcshane would let the cylinder with munro astride it roll down a predetermined distance from the crossarm when it stopped munro would remove a lubricated cotter pin from a pouch on his belt and fit it through a hole in the roller wheel then he would simultaneously arm the six pressure triggers that protruded from the hard wire netting covering each cylinder the final step was to attach clips on a heavy gauge rubber rope to the oversized ring at the end of the cotter pin it was this rope attached in reverse sequence so that the cylinder farthest from the pylon would be freed first that jonas stern would use to initiate the gas attack everything went according to plan until the last cylinder mcshane and munro had decided to rest for sixty seconds before fitting the last tank into place it hung just beneath them still suspended from the block and tackle controlled by cochrane and lewis below the two men were resting side by side on the crossbeam mcshane sitting and munro squatting with uncanny balance when they heard a loud boom from the power station behind them whether it was a lightning strike or a limb that had fallen across a live wire neither man knew but ian mcshane grunted explosively as the auxiliary wire energized and the rubber rope came alive in his hands the highlander did not know he had made a sound he knew only that his arm had been yanked by a gorilla so he tried to yank back then suddenly the current was gone and he toppled off the crossarm his toggle rope saved him tied from his belt to the crossarm it held him suspended fiftyseven feet above the ground in a perfect position to watch his mission end in catastrophe he stared helplessly as the farthest cylinder from the crossarm began to roll down the wire toward totenhausen then he saw the most remarkable feat of bravery or madness he had ever witnessed a black shadow flew through the air above him and caught itself on the fourfoot suspension bar between the moving roller wheel and the cylinder head at first he thought the shadow was an owl or a nighthawk then he realized it was colin munro the weapons instructor had heard mcshanes grunt and seen him try to jerk free in the process yanking the pin from the cylinder farthest from the crossarm without an instants reflection munro had leaped off the crossarm mcshane stretched out his hand in a futile attempt to snatch munro back but the moment was past man and machine trundled away down the wire quickly gathering speed seconds later he lost sight of both in the darkness forty yards down the auxiliary line rolling rapidly toward the second pylon colin munro felt electricity crackle in his hair the knowledge that the wire above him was live that he himself was live nearly made him lose his stomach it was a miracle he was not dead already in that he had landed atop the cylinder without tripping one of the armed triggers yet he knew that for the next few seconds at least he was safe just as a bird can perch on a live conductor wire so can a man if he is not grounded and if the voltage is not too high this knowledge calmed him long enough to make some very quick calculations he had perhaps thirty seconds before the roller wheel reached the next pylon smashed the porcelain insulator there and shorted out the entire system then his christmas ornament would roll the remaining distance down to totenhausen crash to the ground and detonate with him aboard filling his lungs with deadly nerve gas if he had not already been killed by the fall the mission would be blown his friends hunted down and killed all he could hear was his own voice saying something he had told the achnacarry recruits a thousand times no matter how well we train you lads there will always arise a situation for which you cannot be prepared it is then that the men separate themselves from the boys steeling himself against pain munro clutched the suspension bar in his hands and swung both legs up and over the conductor wire to try to slow his descent the friction of the wrapped steel wire burned right through his woolen trouser legs and his skin the cylinder slowed but not enough when the wire sliced though his calf muscles to the bone munro screamed and he knew then that he did not have the courage to mutilate his hands the same way he was less then forty feet from the second pylon when he remembered his toggle rope with his left hand he reached behind him and snatched it off his belt then he swung the wooden handle over the wire just ahead of the roller wheel the wheel snapped the handle like a twig but the toggle rope itself tangled in the aluminum forks and began to foul the roller mechanism the cylinder skidded for two yards then began rolling again this final motion jerked the remainder of the toggle rope up into the mechanism the rope took colin munros arm with it his hand went under the wheel and snapped with a louder crack than the wooden handle had made roller and cylinder skidded down the last ten feet dragging the flailing commando behind it just before it struck the crossarm the wheel jerked to a stop colin munro did not his body was flung up over the pulley and onto the crossarm closing a circuit between the live wire and the earth from two hundred feet up the hill ian mcshane saw a bright yellow flash with a sizzling blue core then he saw the distant lights of totenhausen dim once twice and come back on mcshane burned the pole in his haste to get to the ground creosote and splinters raked his arms and face as he slid earthward when his boots hit the snow he raced down the hill leaving cochrane and lewis to tie off the rope holding the final cylinder in place at the foot of the next pylon mcshane found his friends body munro was lying on his stomach his right hand was mangled the arm torn and broken and his tattered trouser legs were soaked in blood the air smelled of ozone as if a bolt of lightning had struck here munro himself smelled of burnt hair and cooked flesh mcshane dropped to his knees and felt for a carotid pulse knowing it was useless he crouched there thinking until cochrane and lewis appeared what the hell happened ian alick asked breathlessly damn damn damn mcshane cursed the auxiliaries energized shocked me blind i accidentally jerked out one of the pins my rubber gloves must have been dirty and let the current bleed up to my arm the cylinder got away but colin jumped out onto it by god he stopped the bloody thing mcshane stood and peered into the darkness high above them that looks like whats left of a toggle rope up there colin managed to foul the wheel with it damn me muttered cochrane looking closer at munros body he grounded himself on the pole said mcshane he was dead before he hit the ground what the hell happened to his foot asked lewis munros right foot was bare and split open at the ankle as if it had burst from within the current must have come out there mcshane said blew his damn boot off either i didna catch the full current or it must have traveled down an arm and a leg on the same side missed my vitals colin wasnt so lucky no cochrane murmured but he saved the mission ian he saved us that he did alick mcshane waited until he knew his voice was steady but weve still got two cylinders to hang the one back there and the one over our heads what about the germans asked lewis i saw the lights flicker down below mcshane walked over to the nearest support pole and jammed one of his spikes into the wood either they noticed or they didnt if they come its a fight well be givin them if not well finish the job give me your rope lewis handed over a long coil im going to cut colins toggle rope free then well use this rope to tow the cylinder back up and pin it beside the others alick cochrane stared it was something to witness the kind of determination that could block out a dead comrade and push on with an impossible mission but he knew his friend wasnt thinking clearly ian he said gently if we try to tow the thing well be electrocuted ourselves i dinna think the auxiliary wires are live anymore mcshane said whatever shorted the main lines was temporary because colin shorted the auxiliaries and the lights are back on below cochrane considered this colins body may only have faulted the backups for a second ian they could still be live well then ill just jump clear out onto the cylinder like colin did and pin the bastard right where it is ill use something easily breakable like a heavy twig the momentum of the other cylinders will knock it free when the time comes cochrane began scouring the snow for a suitable stick what about colin lewis asked you want me to bury him while youre up there mcshane had already driven both spikes into the pole and started climbing but he stopped and looked down finding lewiss eye by god if we can break our backs to haul gas cylinders john we can haul colin to the beach hell be buried in scotland or ill die gettin him there cochrane handed two twigs up to mcshane its sixteen miles to the beach ian the big highlanders eyes narrowed then weve no time to waste have we sergeant gunther sturm strode with great satisfaction through totenhausen camp it was a fine morning with fine prospects the arrogant bastard who had been riding him since september had finally made a mistake he had taken a fancy to the bald jewess who strutted around the camp like a princess and that made him vulnerable schörner had been tolerable up until the night himmler came allowing sturm to run the camp as he had before the majors arrival from russia there had been some misunderstandings in the beginning but once sturm realized it was a matter of principle with schörner not to profit from the prisoners bad luck and not simply a matter of greasing his palm sturm had kept a low profile and limited his looting to easily concealable and highly profitable items like diamonds the two men had never gotten along personally but who ever said officers and noncoms had to be friends it was all the old dutch jews fault he had shoved the diamonds into sturms hand just as schörner blundered up to see it and of course the major had reminded him of their previous misunderstanding holding his past mistakes over his head just like every officer loved to do the bastard wanted sturm to know he could be cashiered for looting anytime schörner chose but the major had made his own mistake now sleeping with a jewess raping one in the heat of action was one thing but this was something different three times already sturms men had reported seeing the jansen woman leaving schörners quarters late at night the only question had been how best to respond the normal procedure would be to report schörner to the herr doktor but denouncing an officer for violations of the nuremberg racial laws was a tricky business when the man you had to denounce him to was guilty of the same crime and to an even more disgusting degree sturm had considered going outside the chain of command and reporting schörner to a higher ss authority perhaps colonel beck at peenemünde but breaking the chain of command was practically a crime in itself on top of that schörner came from a wealthy family there was no telling how much influence his father might be able to bring to bear in berlin not to mention his stinking knights cross no there was only one way private satisfaction and sturm had come up with the perfect answer he would provoke the jansen woman into some desperate act then he would be fully within his rights when he shot her brandt would have no complaint and schörner could do nothing without admitting hed become romantically entangled with a jewess it rankled sturm to no end that he had to plan this way at any other camp he could simply walk up to rachel jansen and shoot her here he had to have a good reason to damage one of brandts guinea pigs and that was where the diamonds came in it would cost him the stones to get the bitch but it would be worth it the spot sturm had chosen for his ambush was a narrow alley between the ss barracks and the dog kennels he had picked his day and his hour well too brandt was gone to ravensbrück to witness some experiment or other and schörner was in dornow questioning the locals about the missing sergeant willi gauss finally it was the time of morning when the jansen woman usually walked a circuit of the camp with the block leader hagan sturms plan for luring the jewess to the alley was simple all he needed was one of her children he chose the son youre digging your own grave frau hagan said nothing good can come of it rachel kept her eyes fixed on the snow as she walked my children eat well they are gaining weight but for how long how long will schörner stay interested you dont know how their minds work schörner was lonely enough to come to you but soon hell hate himself for it youll be the one to pay for his disgust with himself i have no choice he can protect jan and hannah you believe that if brandt selected jan tomorrow what could schörner do if he disobeyed an order brandt would put him in front of a firing squad he just tells you what will keep him between your legs like all men he chose me remember lets dont talk about it frau hagan raised her hands in a gesture of futility always you listen to my advice but not about this you think ive never seen this before how do you think ive survived so long rachel looked up at her i would like to know that not by doing what you are doing or what the shoemaker does listen in i and seven hundred other poles from tarnow were transported to oscweicim what the germans call auschwitz in upper silesia we built that camp digging all the time no food or water only the strong survived it was there that i became a communist we built a synthetic rubber plant at buna they called it auschwitz three but that place was hell on earth there was a man there named spivack a pole from warsaw small but wiry like a monkey i worked with him hauling bricks and cement after a week i knew he was the toughest man i had ever seen at the end of the day when the big oxes had fallen down he was still working it was his mind that was tough you see he was a communist nothing but death could beat him frau hagan waggled a finger at rachel it was the german communists who tried to stop hitler in the beginning but the german people were afraid of marxism even the german jews cowards afraid to let go of their bourgeois comforts the big pole laughed bitterly where did all their comforts get them eh up the chimney thats where what happened to spivack frau hagan shrugged i was transferred here but ill tell you this he didnt let the ss treat him like a dog even some of those bastards respected him all the punishment he could take thats what ive done and im still here still alive but you dutch girl youre riding on the back of a tiger not everyone is as strong as you rachel said i judge no one here rachel hagan hurry an older woman raced into the alley between the hospital and the eblock frau hagan shouted for her to slow down but she ran right up to them and grabbed rachels shift they took jan hurry a sudden heat suffused rachels skin what one of sturms dog handlers came for your boy there was nothing i could do rachel grabbed the womans arm hannah shes safe where is the boy now frau hagan asked they took him to the kennels rachel started to run but frau hagan grabbed her upper arm walk she commanded running will get you a bullet in the back i must go to him you must also be careful sturm has planned this well i think what do you mean brandt is out of town and schörner left for dornow this morning too much coincidence schörner is away rachel felt suddenly faint my god what can i do i dont know frau hagan set her jaw in a grim line but i will come with you when rachel rounded the corner of the ss barracks she saw jan standing with his back to the dog kennels sergeant sturm was squatting in front of him his broad face pressed close to the little boys jan was crying an ss private stood to the side his submachine gun pointed leisurely at the threeyearold rachel screamed and raced toward her son but sturm stood up and caught her in a bear hug please rachel shrieked kicking wildly let him go moeder moeder jan whimpered frau hagan scooped up the boy and started to run but the ss private backed her against the barracks with his submachine gun sturm lifted rachel off her feet dropped her beside the kennels against the wall he ordered face the wall rachel craned her neck to catch a glimpse of jan frau hagan was holding the boy tightly against her bosom sturm slapped rachels face bend over and grab your ankles whore i will please dont hurt my son ill do whatever i like now bend over lets have those diamonds jan shut your eyes frau hagan covered the boys eyes as rachel bent over the kubelwagen carrying major wolfgang schörner barreled through the front gate of totenhausen without slowing and screeched to a stop in front of the administration building schörner had learned nothing about technical sergeant gauss in dornow but a little extra effort had paid off hed decided to question the occupants of some of the outlying houses between dornow and totenhausen and the fourth house he came to belonged to sybille kleist schörner had scarcely gotten sergeant gausss name out of his mouth when frau kleist broke down completely somethings happened to willi she sobbed i knew it i wanted to come forward sturmbannführer but i swear to you twice this morning i started to come to the camp to report but i couldnt why not madam schörner had asked frau kleist attempted some semblance of haughty dignity i am a married woman sturmbannführer willi sergeant gauss assists me with certain heavy work around the house there is nothing improper of course but if my husband ever misconstrued my inquiries will be conducted with the utmost discretion schörner said with forced patience sergeant gauss was here last night just after he left i thought i heard something i know i did i looked outside but saw nothing god help me sturmbannführer but the more ive thought about it the more i think the noise sounded like gunshots soft but very fast at that point schörner had read sybille kleist the riot act ten minutes later he ordered all search parties to concentrate in the area of the kleist residence then left for totenhausen to summon sergeant sturm with his best dogs as he climbed out of the kubelwagen schörner saw a wireless operator emerge from the hq building rottenführer he shouted where is hauptscharführer sturm im not sure sturmbannführer i heard the dogs barking a moment ago perhaps he is exercising them schörner entered the alley between the dog kennels and the ss barracks just as sergeant sturm hiked up rachels shift and bunched it around her waist marching stiffly up the alley he saw sturm pull down her underpants brace his left hand in the small of her back and reach between her thighs with his right achtung hauptscharführer sergeant sturm snapped straight and gaped at the advancing major cleanshaven and dressed in his field gray waffenss uniform the eyepatch tied across his face like a wound badge schörner personified the nightmare of every ss noncom achtung sturm squared his shoulders and thumbed the seams of his trousers rachel pulled up her underwear and ran to frau hagan exactly what is going on here schörner asked sturm regrouped rapidly i am conducting a search sturmbannführer it looked to me like you were conducting a rape sturmbannführer this woman is concealing contraband on her person schörners eyes flicked to rachel what kind of contraband food explosives no sturmbannführer diamonds the very gems you instructed me to get rid of some nights ago schörner pursed his lips surprised by this response i see and how do you know she has these diamonds i have reliable information sturmbannführer a report from another prisoner rachel felt her stomach twist what fellow prisoner would inform on her to the ss and where is she hiding these gems sturm felt a surge of confidence for once the facts were in his favor she hides them in her private parts sturmbannführer like all these shameless jewish cows schörner was silent for a moment if that is the information you received hauptscharführer you should have informed me i would have instructed a civilian nurse to search the prisoner your conduct was highly irregular and quite unbecoming a german soldier sturm reddened he would not be humiliated in front of a jew i know my duty sturmbannführer if this prisoner is breaking the rules i will search her wherever i find her your duty hauptscharführer said schörner raising his eyebrows while you were molesting women in alleyways i was out doing your duty for you not only have i discovered that our missing sergeant was carrying on an illicit affair with the wife of a hero of the kriegsmarine but also that he was dallying in bed with this woman just last night the woman reported hearing gunshots soon after he left i hurried back here to enlist the help of you and your dogs to search the area and what do i find you acting in an even more disgusting manner than gauss the news about gauss surprised sturm but he did not intend to let rachel escape sturmbannführer i will personally take the dogs and search the area but first we must relieve this prisoner of the contraband schörner glanced around the alley the ss private was making a point of looking the other way sturms strategy of isolation had backfired on him i suggest hauptscharführer schörner said icily that you gather your dogs and stop wasting my time this prisoner is known to me i doubt seriously whether she possesses any diamonds or that she would hide them in the disgusting manner you describe apparently your mind works in the same direction as sergeant gausss sturm knew he should have dropped it there but he couldnt how do you know what is or isnt hidden between her legs he asked schörners head snapped back as if sturm had slapped him thats right sturm said this time more confidently i know your game youre no better than gauss or anyone else by my standards youre a damn sight worse schörners hand was around sturms throat in less than a second he slammed the stunned sergeant up against the wall of the kennel and squeezed his neck with enough force to kill the german shepherds went wild sturm was trying to speak but no air could escape his throat schörners voice grated like broken glass you wish to say something hauptscharführer he loosened his grip just enough for sturm to whisper the sergeant sucked in as much air as he could then rasped youre not fit to wear that uniform you jewfucking bastard schörners face went completely white to hear such words from a man who had never fought in a single battle who had never even come under hostile fire made him temporarily lose his reason he drove his right knee into gunther sturms groin when sturm doubled over in agony he smashed his fist down on the back of his neck before the sergeant could react schörners boot was across the back of his neck crushing his face into the gravel rachel watched from the hospital wall in horror and fascination she could tell that frau hagan was even more stunned than she was sturms red face was being ground into the gravel like a willful dogs major schörner seemed to be considering whether or not to go ahead and snap sturms neck with his finely polished hobnailed boot he regarded the back of the sergeants bare head for several moments as if carefully weighing the pros and cons of the choice rachel heard a sudden roar of engines from the other side of the barracks a motorcycle with an empty sidecar swept into the alley and skidded to a stop beside schörner its rider removed his goggles and stared at the prone figure on the ground what is it rottenführer schörner asked the riders eyes stayed on sergeant sturm sturmbannführer its speak up man sergeant gauss sturmbannführer we found his body hes been murdered shot by an automatic weapon what where near the kleist womans house just as you said buried in the snow we had to dig up half the yard but we found him and sturmbannführer thats not the worst of it we found four parachutes buried with him british parachutes schörner lifted his boot off of sturms neck get up hauptscharführer get every dog and man you have and meet at the kleist house immediately he leaped into the sidecar of the motorcycle take me to the spot rottenführer zu befehl sturmbannführer sturm got slowly to his feet as the corporal kicked the bike into gear what are you staring at schörner asked him as if nothing had passed between them there may be british commandos in the area everything else can wait sturm nodded dully too much had happened too quickly for him to take it all in jawohl he mumbled then he hurried into the kennel and lifted six chain leashes off a hook inside the door schörner looked at rachel his eyes full of intense but unreadable emotion then the motorcycle roared out of the alley rachel hugged jan to her breast and looked at frau hagan the polish woman shook her head hes mad she said he has lost his mind jan jan rachel crooned in a low voice everything is all right now no it isnt frau hagan said this is just beginning what do you mean will sturm report him i dont think so i think those two will settle this privately schörner must have something on sturm something bad enough that sturm is afraid to bring charges against him for consorting with you thats why he tried to get you this way whatever it is will probably keep him from reporting this the pole rubbed her grayishbrown hair with both hands it wont keep him from killing schörner though it may take a little time but hell find a way youre the one who has to worry now youre the pawn between them rachel shuddered lets go back to the block i want to find hannah they moved out of the alley rachel carrying jan you know the worst thing sturm said that he had reliable information that i had the diamonds do you frau hagan asked bluntly rachel hesitated then finally gave up her pretense yes im sorry i lied to you frau hagan waved her hand you keep them where he said yes where do you hide them when you go to schörner dont ask rachel quickened her pace i cant believe anyone would inform on me someone in the same position we are someone must have watched me in the toilet or the showers if i find out who frau hagan said matteroffactly ill strangle them with a bootlace but how could they do it the block leader grunted with a sound that summed up a lifetime of disillusionment i told you your first day here dutch girl the prisoners worst enemy is the prisoner what what mcconnell came awake in the dark the way he once had as an intern in atlanta eyes wide open but full of sleep shaking his head to jar his brain into action someone was shaking him by the arm get up mr wilkes wake up sir mcconnells eyes focused where he expected the face of a nurse he saw the young face of one of colonel vaughans orderlies the orderly pulled him to his feet is that your only bag sir what the hells going on mcconnell demanded is this all your gear sir no damn it i have suitcases at the castle just wait a minute jesus is this it tonight leave everything in the hut behind sir you wont be needing it follow me the orderly marched out mcconnell groped in the dark for his shoes pulled them on and went after him it was raining outside no surprise at achnacarry the orderly waited on the path to the castle bouncing on the balls of his feet mcconnell walked rapidly but did not run another habit he had developed as an intern it gave him time to get his thoughts together where the hell was stern just after supper they had both lain down in the hut now stern was gone the day had been a washout the first time sergeant mcshane had not shown up at dawn to work them to death he had not appeared during the remainder of the day either and stern quite out of character had shown no curiosity about the matter mcconnell sidestepped the rear corner of the castle and moved quickly along the wall when he rounded the front he saw only the dim yellow bulb over the castle door burning through the rain a stiff hand bumped him in the chest hold here mr wilkes said the orderly what the hell shut up doctor snapped a familiar voice mcconnells eyes focused slowly on the figure crouched against the castle wall there was a leather bag beside him stern mcconnell squatted down is this it i heard smiths plane land a little while ago stern said mcconnell felt his heartbeat quicken he realized he was clutching the swatch of cameron tartan in his hand as the cold rain ran down into his collar he noticed that the hut village in the meadow across the drive looked empty no campfires no singing where is everybody night assault stern replied whats that the colonels graduation exercise said the orderly closest thing in the world to real combat the frenchies are rowing across the loch now mcconnell heard a low rumble in the dark an engine a canvasbacked army truck slowly ground its way up the drive and stopped by the main entrance of the castle over its tailgate climbed three men who looked as if they could barely walk mcconnell caught his breath when they stepped into the glow of the bulb over the door one of the men was sergeant ian mcshane stern jumped up and ran toward the truck mcconnell followed but before they reached it the castle door opened and brigadier smith stepped out into the rain no tweed coat and stalkers cap tonight he was wearing his army uniform two orderlies behind him carried mcconnells heavy suitcases and two large duffel bags load them into the lorry smith barked he caught sight of stern and mcconnell into the truck you two youll find new clothes in those bags put them on in the shuffle at the tailgate mcconnell looked into the eyes of sergeant mcshane what he saw stunned him fatigue anger the remnants of shock when he touched the sergeants arm mcshane jerked suddenly as if in pain mcconnell saw then that his inner arms had been scraped raw and scabbed over as if he had skidded fifty yards on cement where the hell have you been sergeant he asked where youre going doctor suddenly brigadier smith was between them into the castle sergeant whisky and fire youve earned it mcshane flanked by john lewis and alick cochrane said nothing glancing over smiths shoulder mcconnell saw that lewis and cochrane looked worse than mcshane mcshane started to say something but before he could brigadier smith said carry on sergeant cochrane and lewis moved toward the door but mcshane stepped around the brigadier and laid a finger on sterns chest you mind how you go over there he said look after the doctor here right you might be findin a warmer welcome than youve been led to expect the highlander looked brigadier smith dead in the eye then turned and trudged into the castle whats he talking about stern asked they lost a man the brigadier said thats all youve lost a few yourself havent you it was colin munro the weapons instructor they hauled his body fifteen miles overland to the pickup point now get on with it eh weve got to be in sweden by three am germany by dawn stern pulled mcconnell toward the truck nothing we can do he said inside his duffel bag mcconnell found not only dry civilian clothes with proper german tags inside them but also a neatly pressed and folded military uniform of field gray winter wool he saw the silver ss runes and the deaths head badge on his captains cap and felt a chill sterns uniform was graygreen with the feared green piping and sleeve patch of the sd on the breast was an iron cross first class and a wound badge the left collar patch indicated that its wearer was a colonel standartenführer the civvies or the uniforms mcconnell asked the uniforms said stern mcconnell was still dressing when the truck began to roll stern bent over the suitcase that contained mcconnells antigas suits and began rummaging beneath them what are you doing mcconnell asked that bicycles not the only thing i stole at the castle stern said over the rumble of the truck smith is crazy if he thinks im going into nazi germany with nothing but a schmeisser and a pistol mcconnell knelt down and looked into the case he saw several hand grenades a small box and a package wrapped in brown paper what is all that stuff plastic explosive time pencil detonators grenades where did you get it vaughans private arsenal thank god those orderlies didnt search your suitcases they still might no from now on you and i carry these bags every step of the way three minutes later the truck stopped brigadier smith appeared at the tailgate at the double he said no time to lose mcconnell dropped to the ground they had stopped beside an airplane but no ordinary airplane it was a highwing monoplane painted matte black from fifty yards away it would be totally invisible smiths pilot had put the ominouslooking craft down in a wet field that didnt look long enough for a flock of geese to land in stern bumped past mcconnell with the suitcases then suddenly the night was shattered by a thunder of guns like a summer storm sweeping across georgia christ mcconnell yelled what the hell is that into the plane the brigadier shouted if we hurry well see the best of it mcconnell squeezed the duffel bags into the plane and before he could even catch his breath the grumbling lysander was climbing the crest of a hill with scant yards to spare on smiths order the pilot banked over loch lochy for a sightseeing run mcconnell had never seen anything like the spectacle below him tracer fire arced through the night like something from an h g wells novel flares exploded around the plane illuminating a dozen or so dinghies on the loch below like ducks in a shooting gallery those frogs are scared out of their wits right now smith shouted charless lads are firing real bullets inches from their arses smith told the pilot to swing around and head for checkers whatever that meant as the lysander swept along the beach just a hundred feet above exploding mortar shells mcconnell saw an ambulance parked with its headlights on high standing in the wet glow of the twin beams was a barrelchested figure with his hands clasped behind his back he raised his right arm in farewell as the lysander buzzed past him waggling its wings look at him brigadier smith shouted standing there like c b demille himself what a show the war office says charlie vaughan uses more ordnance for his night assault than monty used at alamein the pilot banked into the worst of the storm it was all mcconnell could manage to hold down the contents of his stomach he tried to take his mind off the nausea by questioning smith but the brigadier ignored him rain slapped steadily against the perspex windows the pilot was only the back of a leather cap stern a silhouette in the darkness close beside him for the first time since davids death he realized how irrevocable it all was he was adrift in a black airplane under a starless sky droning over an island that had shown no lights to heaven since the idea that there was a worldwide war going on perhaps for the soul of mankind had never seemed more real than it did now were these the smells david had known the duckblind smell of rainsoaked wool and leather the bite of aviation fuel and oil the scent of anticipation emanating from stern a sweaty tang of the hunter at first light and of course the metallic odor mcconnell fancied he smelled on himself the smell of fear for the first time the reality of his destination entered into him nazi germany there was a square yard of the glorious reich waiting for his two feet to touch down on maybe waiting for his corpse he tried to banish this thought while the lysander plowed doggedly southward against the storm and by the time the plane began to descend he had been asleep for over an hour the impact of the wheels on earth knocked him awake is this sweden he asked woozily not quite lad brigadier smiths voice the plane turned and taxied back the way it had come outside mcconnell saw only darkness then a pair of auto headlights blinked three times the pilot rolled up to the car and stopped out smith ordered they trundled out of the plane and into the car a polished humber the pilot stayed in the lysander the driver of the humber wore a chauffers black uniform and drove like a man late for his daughters wedding the german uniforms drew several glances in the rearview mirror but very shortly the car drew up beside a large trimmed hedge smith got out and led them through a formal english garden mcconnell saw a faint reflection of moonlight on mullioned windows then he was standing with smith and stern beside an oak door where the hell are we asked stern clean up your language the brigadier said tersely smith opened the door and led them into a dim corridor mcconnell smelled leather bookbindings and old chintz oiled wood and tea as they moved through the dark house he saw the gleam of brass and crystal for a moment he thought theyd entered the rooms of his tutor at oxford but that was impossible brigadier smith turned suddenly into another corridor lit by an electric wall lamp he stopped before a door the paneling beside it looked four hundred years old smith put his hand on the doorknob then looked back at stern look sharp he said speak only when spoken to and keep a civil tongue in your head mcconnell noticed with some uneasiness that the brigadiers usual informality was nowhere in evidence every word and gesture was distinctly military when smith opened the door he realized why the first thing he saw was the bald top of a round head the head was leaning over a huge map that even upside down mcconnell recognized as the pas de calais the portly body was encased in a navy pea jacket which seemed odd until mcconnell noticed that the interior of the house was barely warmer than the frigid air outside he smelled the long cigar in the ashtray before he saw it then the aromatic brandy in the crystal glass winston churchill looked up from the map and blinked by thunder he cried standing straight himmlers hooligans have come for me at last mcconnell laughed a little hysterically perhaps but the prime minister had found exactly the right gambit to put them at ease it couldnt be too often that winston churchill found himself face to face with jackbooted ss officers his grin as he looked them up and down seemed to indicate that he was enjoying it mcconnell marveled at the vitality radiating from the man churchill was seventy years old but his watery blue eyes shone with humor and almost unnerving intelligence when he stuck the cigar between his lips and spoke directly to mcconnell mark felt a sudden magnifying of his own importance like a subtle shift in the earths gravitational field so how did you like scotland doctor he asked his voice far richer than his radio broadcasts quite a tough little course eh the forward thrust of churchills prodigious head seemed an implicit challenge pretty tough mcconnell agreed duff tells me you passed with flying colors mcconnell was aware that the prime minister exploited every facet of his daunting charisma to sway others to his cause yet despite this awareness he could not but be affected by it he felt almost defensive when he heard stern mutter behind him games whats that churchill asked cocking his chin and puffing on the cigar stern isnt it i said games thats what they play up there mcconnell had no doubt brigadier smith was on the verge of knifing stern in the kidneys mr stern said churchill they play games at achnacarry because war is a game it is a game you play with a smile if you cant smile you grin and if you cant grin you get out of the way until you can he set his cigar in the ashtray and leaned across the desk his hands splayed on its polished surface i asked to see you men for two reasons because you are civilians and because you are not british subjects you are undertaking a mission of the most hazardous nature i want to impress upon you the supreme importance of this mission this mission gentlemen must not fail he hiked both trouser legs and sat behind the desk i wanted to speak especially to you doctor mcconnell i understand youre a follower of mr gandhi mcconnell found himself surprisingly willing to answer to a degree yes i hope not to the degree that some of your scientific colleagues are do you know professor bohr niels bohr the danish physicist thats the man i know of him that utopist has the most muddleheaded perspective on war ive ever heard hes like a bloody child he sat in front of me and rambled for three quarters of an hour and i still had no idea what he was talking about i think it all boiled down to resisting violence with humility at least gandhi says it in one tenth the time churchills eyes narrowed with incisive curiosity what about you doctor do you believe humility is the best weapon to use against herr hitlers armies mcconnell did not answer immediately the mention of niels bohr had distracted him the renowned physicist was supposed to be in sweden how had he sat in front of winston churchill this strange revelation dovetailed with the whispered rumors he had heard at oxford about accelerated research into atomic physics doctor churchill prompted i think events have gone beyond that now mr prime minister but i also think hitler could have been stopped with little or no violence years ago i quite agree but we live in the present his voice rose a semitone duff tells me your father won the distinguished service cross in the great war at the st mihiel salient thats right said mcconnell wondering why churchills knowledge of his past should take him by surprise also the silver star of course he threw them both into the potomac river in churchill tucked his chin into his chest and gave mcconnell a froglike stare why the devil did he do that mcconnell wasnt sure the prime minister would like the answer but he told him remember the bonus army riot in washington during the depression veterans pensions or something rumbled churchill exactly some men from my fathers old unit had gone up with the vets who were trying to get relief from the government there were about twentyfive thousand of them with their families they called and asked my dad if he would go up and try to give them some medical help he went the dc police were feeding the vets and their families but president hoover had no sympathy after three months of peaceful demonstration he called in the army the army attacked the unarmed crowds with tear gas bayonets cavalry and tanks several vets were shot some infants gassed to death mcconnell paused my father was in that crowd churchill watched with unblinking eyes do i sense some deeper moral to this story a footnote i have since learned the names of some of the officers who attacked that crowd the troops were led by a man named douglas macarthur macarthur disobeyed hoover and went far beyond his original orders macarthurs aide was a major dwight eisenhower the saberwielding cavalry were led by captain george patton so mr prime minister perhaps you understand why my devotion to the military is less than blind i do indeed politics can be a difficult business doctor i must sadly admit that i have made similar mistakes but none of that affects the current situation i dont have to explain to a man of your gifts the threat facing christian civilization mcconnell had no doubt that stern had noted the omission of jews from that formulation for your own reasons whatever they are you have agreed to go on this mission for that i thank you i am not exaggerating when i say that the liberation of europe may hang upon it churchills eyes played over mcconnells face for some moments then he took a sheet of notepaper from his desk and lifted a pen from its well there is bound to be loss of life during this mission he said writing quickly i want you to know that final responsibility rests with me churchill tore off the sheet of paper and handed it to mcconnell who read it with astonishment on my head be these deaths w im halfamerican myself you know said churchill and i reckon youre at least halfenglish doctor what mcconnell mumbled still looking at the remarkable note what do you mean churchill clamped his teeth down on his cigar and grinned any man who has survived both oxford university and achnacarry castle has earned his citizenship mcconnell heard brigadier smiths feet shifting impatiently on the floor behind him then sterns germanaccented voice cut the air of the study what about my people he asked in an accusatory tone is there a place for jews in your angloamerican paradise hold your tongue bellowed brigadier smith let him speak duff churchill said he has a right to be angry stern took a step forward the sd uniform and german accent gave his words a chilling intensity i want to know if you will really support the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine after the war churchill punctuated his words with his cigar using it like a pointer i most certainly will mr stern but the key phrase in your question was after the war theres a damned great lot of fighting to be done yet and im ready to do it stern said are you well then when you get back from this mission i shall personally see to it that you get a commission in the jewish brigade he smiled youll need a different uniform of course they wouldnt like that swastika there is no jewish brigade its been buried in paperwork for years not any longer said churchill ive unburied it the jewish brigade will fight in the liberation so are you interested stern actually snapped to attention churchill beamed this is my sort of fellow duff youve chosen well i think hell do smith said grudgingly but im afraid we really must go the schedule you know hhour churchill said with relish and right into germany what i wouldnt give to go with you he stood up and vigorously shook both mcconnells and sterns hands mcconnell thought of something else he wanted to ask but by then the brigadier had whisked them out of the room and along the dim corridor the driver of the humber met them at the outside door follow him smith said ill join you in a moment as they passed outside mcconnell looked back they were exiting from a different door and above it he saw the words pro patria omnia now he realized what duff smith had said to his pilot over loch lochy he had not said to head for checkers but chequers which was the country residence of the british prime minister as he followed stern back to the lysander mcconnell wondered if adolf hitler knew what words were engraved above the door of that house and what they meant all for the fatherland churchill was studiously smoking his cigar when brigadier smith returned smith took a chair opposite the desk and waited for the inevitable grilling the pm always gave before important operations churchill exhaled a great cloud of blue smoke sniffed then rested his cigar on the rim of the ashtray this is the only operation i have ever sanctioned that goes directly against the wishes of the americans he said soberly im still not sure i fancy using an american to do it even if he is the right man from a technical standpoint it could cause problems later there wont be any problems winston if this mission succeeds it succeeds in producing a negative the nonuse of nerve gas by the nazis and if it fails both stern and mcconnell will in all likelihood be dead what if it succeeds but the good doctor decides to unburden himself afterwards for reasons of conscience smith peered into the blue eyes trying to read the subtext of the conversation at length he said this is a dangerous mission even if it succeeds its quite possible that mcconnell and stern might not get back alive churchill steepled his fingers and focused his eyes somewhere in the shadows beyond smith does anyone know mcconnell is going on this mission anyone at all he left two letters with an oxford don for his wife and mother the usual stuff i confiscated them churchill sighed heavily if eisenhower or marshall learn ive bypassed them to make a strike of this magnitude theyve left you no alternative winston if eisenhowers armies fall dead after thirty seconds on the french beaches roosevelt and marshall will scream to high heaven about what should have been done and ike will resign but by then it will be too late churchill was nodding i agree duff the question is will the mission succeed is there a real chance absolutely what about our gas how long will it remain stable now it varies from lot to lot the last two batches from porton remained stable for ninetyseven hours whats that four days just over that and it was lethal oh quite yes dispatched two large primates rather handily churchill winced dont tell me where you got your test subjects i dont want the royal society beating down my door how old is the gas your achnacarry men took in smith looked at his watch twentysix hours and counting cutting it a bit fine arent you the raubhammer demonstration is in four days said smith if we dont pull it off by then were probably too late anyway if the wind is under seven miles per hour when they arrive stern will release the gas tonight if not tonight then tomorrow churchill picked up his pen and began doodling on a notepad thats why you want the submarine to stand by for four days the weather must be right for the attack that and the exhibition for hitler i want to give them every possible chance to make the attack as for weather four miles an hour is optimal wind speed for a gas attack of this type preferably without rain does stern or mcconnell know the gas may not work of course not churchill pulled the heavy pea jacket around his neck duff if you had to give me a percentage chance of success what would you say smith ruminated fiftyfifty for the attack itself but if the attack is successful i think theres a ninety percent chance the bluff will work winston im absolutely positive that this nerve gas initiative is an allhimmler show everything points to it when we hit him discreetly with his own personal miracle weapon well knock his legs right out from under him as far as hell know weve got ten thousand tons of british sarin ready to drop on berlin hell have to call off his show will he be able to prove we were behind the attack no were using german cylinders world war one vintage but hell know who was responsible ill see to that and if our sarin doesnt work smith shrugged then the bombers go in churchill made a growling noise in the back of his throat what will happen if we have to bomb that camp that depends on several factors again the weather how much gas is stored onsite our planes will be carrying incendiary bombs to try to incinerate as much of the gas as possible before it leaves the area still theres a chance that the nearby villages could be wiped out we just dont know enough to predict if they are wiped out im sure himmler will simply announce a regrettable industrial accident whatever happens all traces of our mission will be destroyed what if you dont hear anything from stern and mcconnell if i dont have positive confirmation of success three nights from now the bombers will go in no matter what do stern and mcconnell know about the bombers good god no churchill rubbed his forehead with both hands he had looked vital to mcconnell but duff smith knew the prime minister had only just recovered from pneumonia in december and that after surviving two heart attacks in the same month the pressures on him were enormous yet he insisted on shouldering moral responsibility for every mission theyre civilians duff churchill pointed out theyll sign releases before they leave thats not what i meant you dont think that with his brother murdered by the ss you could entrust mcconnell with the real purpose of the mission smith shook his head i dont think doctor mcconnell would kill a human being even to save his own life the telephone on churchills desk rang but he ignored it there is one flaw that could bring disaster duff what if theyre captured and tortured before they can carry out the attack you gave them lpills stern carries one at all times if you can believe it but i wouldnt trust mcconnell to take cyanide even if he had it the brigadier felt in his pocket for his pipe no need to worry on that score though if capture appears imminent stern is under orders to shoot the good doctor where he stands churchills phone finally stopped ringing thats a hard order duff it wouldnt sit well with a lot of people on both sides of the atlantic smith had anticipated this last spasm of conscience there is a precedent winston at dieppe when we sent our radar experts to reconnoiter the german radar station we sent gunmen in behind them disguised as bodyguards just in case the jerries closed in i dont see how that makes this situation any better smith smiled one of those bodyguards was an american fbi agent if the yanks had no qualms about an fbi man shooting our scientists i dont see how they could object to us doing the same brendan bracken opened the study door and said hayes lodge general eisenhower is standing by for you churchill nodded and waved his aide out of the room its a moot point duff but if any of this ever gets out who shot whom will be irrelevant all that matters is secrecy and results but tell me do you think stern would really shoot mcconnell down in cold blood duff smith stood up and patted his khakis flat winston there is absolutely no doubt in my mind the moon plane dropped out of the dark sky like a nighthawk swooping through ghostly clouds in a dive mcconnell thought would tear off its wings hold on to your seats advised the pilot mcconnell closed his eyes as the rattling lysander hurtled toward the earth the plane was packed full they had crammed the suitcase containing the antigas suits and stolen explosives in the small space behind the seats he held the case with the air cylinders on his lap he also had his personal bag which contained food his schmeisser a change of civilian clothes and some medical supplies are you going to be sick stern shouted over the roar of the engine mcconnell opened his eyes he felt like a man plunging to his death but sterns face was impassive he wondered if he looked as authentically nazi as stern did he wore a captains uniform and carried papers identifying him as an ss physician but he felt about as german as a hormel frankfurter in the dark graygreen sd uniform and cap with the iron cross first class on his tunic stern radiated a sinister authority damn this plane stern cursed adjusting the scuffed leather bag and schmeisser on his lap bad luck yelled the pilot couldnt be helped mcconnell said nothing the line of pale blue light silhouetting the eastern horizon was comment enough dawn was coming and they had yet to reach the ground the entire night had been a race against time after the meeting with churchill theyd made a brief hop to a restricted airfield there brigadier smith and an aide had led them aboard a captured junkers bomber smith claimed was so secret that they could not be allowed to see its pilot the junkers bore all its original luftwaffe markings which had made for a dangerous run out of british airspace but allowed an uneventful trip to neutral sweden during the flight smith actually ordered the pilot to open the bomb bay so that he could point out german battleships on blockade duty below them their problem began in sweden the lysander detailed to carry them from sweden to germany the plane they were in now had developed engine trouble on its way back from a mission into occupied france and because the tiny black plane had but one engine they had been forced to wait hours in a freezing shack while its pilot and the mysterious junkers pilot repaired the problem by the time they finished dawn was scarcely an hour away mcconnell had suggested they wait until the next night but smith wouldnt hear of it he practically shoved them into the lysander and ordered their pilot not to turn back for any reason mcconnell had expected to fly just over the wave tops to avoid german radar but the pilot told them there was more chance of being shot down by a kriegsmarine vessel than by a luftwaffe night fighter theyd crossed the baltic at nine thousand feet ten minutes ago theyd flown over the coast of northern germany and then the dive thank god mcconnell said feeling the plane start to level out over the lightless plain were going to touch down in a farmers field yelled the pilot the met people say theres been a hard freeze so im not expecting problems with mud he looked back over his shoulder revealing the face of a jaded twentyyearold daredevil i wont be turning off the engine himmler himself could be waiting down there for all we know i expect you to get yourselves and your gear out of the plane in less than thirty seconds nice to know we can count on you stern shouted back the pilot shook his head i take soe people into france all the time but germany you two must be daft great thought mcconnell even the help knows were idiots far out on the western horizon he saw a faint orange glow whats that he asked rostock answered the pilot we bombed it practically into rubble in fortythree but the heinkel aircraft factory is still operational they must have used incendiaries tonight the fires are still burning mcconnell noticed that stern had pressed his face to the perspex what are you looking for he asked i grew up in rostock stern said i was just wondering if our apartment block was still standing doubtful the pilot said needlessly the center of town is pretty well smashed looks like a bloody roman ruin so thats why smith chose you for this mcconnell said forgetting his airsickness for a moment you know the area thats one reason theres the signal cried the pilot get ready he pulled back on the controls and climbed then circled around for a highangle approach all mcconnell could see in the blackness below were three dim yellow lights in a line with a red one off to the side forming an inverted l the red light appeared to be blinking a morse code letter again and again the lysander fell like a hailstone on the wind mcconnell gripped his seat and watched the l race upward the wheels hit hard bounced then settled onto the bumpy ground and quickly rolled to a stop near the red light get out bellowed the pilot go stern already had the hatch open the roar of the engine filled the cabin mcconnell saw him drop his bag out then jump down mcconnell hefted his suitcase across the seat and handed it out then climbed down himself youve left a bloody case the pilot yelled mcconnell hopped back into the plane and with a groan lifted out the suitcase containing the antigas suits and stolen explosives good luck the pilot called then the black plane was off turning quickly on the frozen earth and accelerating back in the direction it had come only the fading grumble of the engine told them anything was there at all youre the athlete stern said in the darkness you carry the air cylinders when mcconnell reached down for the case it was gone a huge man with a black beard heavy fur coat and an old boltaction rifle strapped over his shoulder stood less than a yard from him the heavy suitcase hung from one hand as if it held only a weekends clothes while mcconnell stared the flare path that had guided in the plane winked out and two more figures quickly materialized out of the blackness one was a tall thin man with a fishermans cap pulled low over his eyes the other smaller and bundled to the eyeballs in a thick scarf and oilskin coat the smaller man carried no weapon but was obviously the leader password he asked in muffled german schwarzes kreuz stern replied black cross you are butler and wilkes hes wilkes you melanie follow us schnell weve been here all night if were caught in the open at dawn were dead the shadowy escorts moved so quickly across the flat ground that even mcconnell had trouble keeping up once the leader dropped flat and motioned for everyone to do the same mcconnell thought he heard the faint rumble of an engine but wasnt sure after three minutes the leader got up and continued on hurrying across the frozen fields mcconnell realized that the cold here was of an entirely different magnitude than that in scotland he should have prepared himself did it take a genius to figure out that in northern germany wind blowing from the north was coming from the arctic they were only twenty miles from the baltic coast the wind blasted across this plain like the fulfillment of a norse curse the uniforms he and stern wore useless against its power he saw a few dim lights out to his left a road a rail line to his right he saw nothing at first then the faintest corona of blue began to highlight the crest of a range of hills he shivered beyond those hills the sun was rising as they rounded the foot of one of the hills he saw dim yellow lights close ahead the leader stopped and spoke quietly to the two escorts who melted away into the shadows without a word stern and mcconnell picked up their suitcases they were approaching a small village already they had passed two outlying farmhouses a dog barked but apparently awakened no one mcconnell found himself recalling the advice stern had given him about moving in hostile territory first never smoke in the field stern claimed the smell of cigarette smoke on the wind had saved his life many times mcconnell had made a joke then but it didnt seem funny now as they neared the next cottage the leader made no effort to circle around it instead he walked right up to the front door unlocked it with a key and motioned them inside there was hardly any light but mcconnell could see that the walls of the narrow entrance hall were adorned only by a coat rack stern dropped his bags and sat down on them breathing hard pick up those cases the leader ordered youre going to the cellar give us a moment eh stern pleaded in german that was some hike the leader grunted in disgust and stalked out of the foyer mcconnell set down his bags and felt his way into a room that had to be a kitchen he smelled coffee warming on the stove it took great restraint to keep from feeling his way to it and drinking straight from the pot the leader lighted two candles and placed them on a wooden table at the center of the room mcconnell took in the sparsely stocked shelves and yellowpainted walls then said mein name ist mark mcconnell thank you for meeting us the leader shrugged and took off his hat a mane of blond hair fell around his shoulders he unwrapped the scarf from his face my god mcconnell said in english i am anna kaas said the young woman pulling off her heavy coat and revealing anything but a mans figure tell your lazy friend to take those suitcases down to the cellar youre in germany now ach du lieber hergott stern said from the doorway you were expecting a man anna said sorry to disappoint you mcconnell watched in amazement as the young woman poured the coffee she appeared to be close to his own age and she had deep brown eyes unusual in a woman who otherwise fit the aryan stereotype of the flaxenhaired blueeyed brunhild youre hours late she said you are trying to kill us mechanical trouble said stern stepping into the kitchen you work in the camp yes im a nurse there are six of us you enjoy your work even by candlelight mcconnell saw the woman color at this remark if i did would i be putting up two rude englishmen for the night she rejoined im american mcconnell told her and im german said stern i was raised thirty kilometers from here in rostock how wonderful for you anna said perhaps you can stay alive long enough to complete your mission stern walked to the kitchen window and peered through a crack in the curtains mcconnell could see the glow of daylight even from where he stood if the wind lets up said stern ill only have to survive half an hour or so to do that what do you mean anna asked i mean were executing the mission as soon as the wind falls off not if you want to succeed stern turned from the window why not the daylight is a problem but weve got the german uniforms well make it to the hill getting away alive afterward wont be easy but he waved his hand dismissively london didnt tell you anna kaas shook her head in astonishment major schörner discovered the body of an ss sergeant today buried in the hills hed been shot by a submachine gun the ss found four parachutes buried with him british parachutes verdammt said stern thats what mcshane meant by a warm welcome they killed someone during the preparatory mission smith must have ordered him not to tell us about it terrific mcconnell said its a miracle we reached the cottage anna told them major schörner has half the garrison out on patrol a motorcycle unit stopped here five minutes before i left for the pickup point if theyd returned while i was gone we would be running for our lives now how far are we from the power station stern asked about three kilometers uphill all the way heavy tree growth plenty of cover yes but a switchback road crosses your path a dozen times between here and there stern winced what about the wind has it been blowing this hard all night what is so important about the wind when stern did not reply she said it gusts but it hasnt dropped below a hard breeze all night just a minute mcconnell cut in whats all this about a power station now that were finally in germany maybe you can tell me exactly what the plan is how are the two of us supposed to disable this plant so that i can get a look at the machinery are some of vaughans commandos parachuting in behind us or what no said stern i am also confused anna said since only two of you landed i assumed your team must already be here hiding in the woods what can two men do against the garrison at totenhausen more than you think said stern you dont know what the mission is mcconnell asked her no come on stern he pressed out with it thank you for telling her my real name doctor code names are childish at this point anna said she looked at mcconnell your german is terrible danke i mean your grammar is perfect but your accent i already tried to avoid this mission on those grounds it didnt work hes not here for his language skills stern said hes a chemist anna looked at mcconnell with sudden understanding ah perhaps you werent such a bad choice then stern opened a door that led onto a small bedroom looked inside then closed it you want to know how the two of us are going to disable the plant doctor were not were going to leave it exactly like we find it except for one thing everybody in it will be dead what mcconnell felt suddenly lightheaded what did you say you didnt hear me were going to gas the camp doctor thats why i asked about the wind the ideal windspeed for the attack is zero to six miles per hour gas the camp with what with nerve gas from the totenhausen storage tanks anna guessed stern shook his head with our own nerve gas we didnt bring any said mcconnell we dont even have any do we stern smiled with the satisfaction of secret knowledge but anna trailed off pondering sterns words i see mcconnell said but he didnt see he had known smith was holding back facts about the mission yet of all the possibilities he had imagined this was not one is the target really a gas factory and testing facility as i was led to believe yes but how are you going to gas the ss without killing the prisoners im not mcconnell sat down at the kitchen table and tried to digest this theres no way to warn the prisoners without risking the success of the mission explained stern even if we could separate them theres nowhere for them to go mein gott anna whispered why didnt you tell me this back at achnacarry asked mcconnell i asked you enough times i didnt tell you because you wouldnt have come smith was not lying about one thing doctor time is critical there was no time to find someone else couldnt you at least have given me the choice you have a choice are you going to help me mcconnell was tempted to refuse merely out of anger at being tricked so completely but even underneath his anger he knew that what smith wanted them to do was wrong no he said im not going to help you kill innocent prisoners stern turned up his palms you see we were right not to tell you christ what did you gain by lying youre here arent you look all you have to do is assist me in the final phase go into the factory and tell me what to take pictures of help me get the samples smith thought youd see the necessity after thinking it through well i dont see it i knew something like this couldnt be done without loss of life i prepared myself for that but this jesus stern youre talking about murdering hundreds of innocent people i thought we understood each other dont you think you owed me a little honesty owed you sterns face reddened i only met you two weeks ago ill tell you who i owe doctor the jews waiting to be murdered in fifty death camps across germany and poland i owe the soldiers who are going to risk their lives to liberate europe and free those jews it may not be their top priority but theyll get to it sooner or later as for you you can sit here and wait for the second coming or whatever you believe will finally stop hitler im going up that hill is that where the gas is yes how are you going to get it into the camp easily there are ten electrical pylons connecting the power station on top of a nearby hill to the prison camp at the bottom last night sergeant mcshane and his men hung eight cylinders of british nerve gas from a power line at the top pylon my mission is to climb that pylon release the cylinders and send them down into totenhausen so thats it anna said staring into one of the candle flames london had me out at all hours of the night sketching poles and wires and transformer boxes all the electrical junctions at the camp i had no idea why until now i assumed they were planning to defeat the electrical fence before a general assault she sat down opposite mcconnell and looked up at stern is that really the only way to kill everyone what are a few hundred lives sacrificed if it saves tens of thousands later stern said annas eyes didnt waver you say that very easily herr stern there are women and children in that camp jews there are many jews there yes others too you dont like jews i am a jew she blinked in disbelief my god you are a jew and you have the nerve to come here you must be mad no but i am ready to die for my people if other jews must die also so be it is that your choice to make mcconnell asked those prisoners were doomed long before we got here doctor this way at least theyll die for a reason count me out mcconnell said i never counted you in stern went back to the window and watched through a crack in the curtains i told smith he was a fool to think you would help me it doesnt matter though i can make the attack without you mcconnell wasnt listening he was thinking you say those cylinders on the hill have british nerve gas in them thats right what kind of nerve gas stern shrugged i dont know nerve gas have you seen it work seen it of course not its invisible isnt it sometimes do you know where it came from what is your point doctor mcconnell didnt answer his silence obviously infuriated stern who glared angrily from the window anna looked from one man to the other stunned by the hostility displayed between them stern suddenly turned back to the window curtains as if he had heard something i see a bus he said picking up his schmeisser a gray bus full of men theyre driving from the village toward us who are they the factory technicians anna said theyre quartered in dornow the bus takes them back and forth to work every day when mcconnell began to laugh anna and stern stared at each other like funeral goers who have stumbled into the wrong parade the laugh began as a few short barks then settled into the dry chuckle of a man who realizes that he is the butt of a joke of cosmic proportions what the hell is wrong with you stern asked what are you laughing at you said mcconnell us what do you mean stern were both so goddamn stupid its pathetic what did i tell you back at achnacarry that this mission as explained to me didnt make sense but since you knew smith was lying to me it didnt bother you too much that i couldnt make sense of it but dont you see the mission as told to you doesnt make any sense either explain damn you are you blind if the british really have developed their own nerve gas where is the logic in wiping out the people in this camp stern tried to recall his first conversation with brigadier smith that night in the bentley the british only have a limited amount of gas he said slowly onepoint six tons something like that the nazis have thousands of tons stockpiled around germany smith said the allies could never catch up before the invasion that their only chance was to bluff the nazis into believing they not only have their own nerve gas but also the will to use it plus the sample remember the soman sample mcconnell watched him like a teacher willing a student toward an answer think stern they got a sample of sarin out without our help remember they dont need us for that theyve got anna here no the point of this mission is killing the people to kill everyone inside that camp and leave the machinery intact that is the plan right yes i couldnt see it because i had accepted the idea that we were coming to disable the plant but assuming smith told you truth at least about the objective what does that tell us if you wipe out this camp with nerve gas you will have committed the first offensive chemical weapons strike of the second world war the risks are incalculable and if i know one thing about duff smith hes a pragmatic bastard the same for churchill neither would take such a risk unless they had no choice they dont have a choice stern told him in four days heinrich himmler is going to demonstrate soman to the führer in the hope of convincing him to use nerve gas against the allied invasion troops hitler believes the allies have their own nerve gases himmler doesnt and for once he is close to being right churchill and smith believe this attack this bluff is the only chance to convince himmler hes wrong and embarrass him into calling off his demonstration mcconnell remained unconvinced even if all that is true he said youre missing the point if the british possess even one liter of their own nerve gas all churchill would have to do is get one vial of it into the right hands in germany even leaking the written formula would be enough by doing that they would show hitler they have strategic parity but without risking massive retaliation because the nazis would have no way of knowing whether the british had only one vial or ten thousand tons mcconnell drummed his fingers on the table no stern only one possible scenario justifies a risk like this the british have developed some form of nerve gas but theres a problem with it maybe multiple problems what do you mean what kind of problems mcconnell shrugged could be anything it usually takes three to six months to copy a war gas and thats with conventional variants sarin is a revolutionary toxin and as far as i know the british have had it for less than sixty days with churchill breathing down their necks the scientists at porton might just have been able to crack it but even then their problems would only have begun war gases are extremely difficult to mass produce for battlefield use they must be heavier than air resistant to moisture noncorrosive to standard steel they must be stable enough to retain toxicity during long periods of storage and transport also to survive the detonation of the artillery shells that carry them a nerve gas should ideally be odorless and colorless insofar as is possible if you see a gas cloud coming or smell it in low concentration its effectiveness as a weapon is greatly inhibited get to the point stern shouted sorry my point is that the british team at porton has probably developed a facsimile of sarin that has one or more of those flaws they cant send a sample to the germans because they know their gas cant withstand close analysis ie its not in the same league with sarin stern moved away from the window and planted a boot on one of the kitchen chairs why couldnt they send hitler a vial from the stolen sample send the nazis their own gas and claim its british mcconnell considered this thats not a bad idea actually ill bet smith thought of that but german chemists are very good an exact chemical copy of german sarin would be greeted with extreme suspicion theyd probably figure out that bluff he drank some of his coffee which had grown cold no i think smith and churchill looked at the situation and decided they had only one option to gamble that whatever problems exist with the british sarin the stuff will kill thats why there are only the two of us stern if the copycat sarin kills effectively it may well convince the nazis that they would be foolish to risk attacking the allies with nerve gas but if it doesnt work what have the british lost you and me two expendable civilians whether the british sarin works or not it will be gone on the wind in a few hours and ill bet you fifty bucks that the cylinders hanging from your pylon are of german manufacture they are mcconnell shook his head awed by the boldness of smiths plan were sacrificial lambs stern you may fancy that role i dont stern had gone very still anna was watching mcconnell with a strange mixture of respect and fear it stings doesnt it mcconnell laughed softly the great haganah terrorist fooled by a british general stern slung his schmeisser over his shoulder the gas might work he said you admitted that yourself if it does the mission will succeed regardless of all this i guess ill just have to find out the hard way as you americans say he turned and started for the foyer wait anna pleaded its daylight youll never reach that pylon without being caught major schörner has doubled the guard on the transformer station stern lifted his hand from the door handle what i told you there are patrols everywhere because of the dead sergeant even if you managed to attack the camp half the ss men wouldnt be there ive made a place for you in the cellar you can hide there today and decide what to do it will be dark by six tonight where is the harm in waiting until then stern came back into the kitchen i want to speak to someone higher up in your group there is no one higher anna said you are the senior person theres no one else i dont believe you who were those men who helped us at the plane friends they know nothing about the situation in camp youre brigadier smiths only contact who is brigadier smith mcconnell couldnt keep from grinning whats wrong with her i like her just fine our own mata hari shut up damn you mcconnell stood up kiss my ass stern you know that idiom yet add it to your collection stern gave both of them withering stares nodding like a man who has just discovered he is surrounded by enemies then he turned walked through the foyer and out the front door anna looked at mcconnell with wild eyes then jumped up ran to the door and shouted for stern he apparently did not stop for she came back into the kitchen wearing the blank gaze of a witness to a terrible accident he is walking toward the hills she said he will kill us all i dont know said mcconnell standing up from the table hes got that sd uniform he speaks perfect german he might make it anna looked around her kitchen as if it had suddenly become an alien environment they should have told me she said her soft voice full of resentment it is too much to ask she focused on mcconnell her face now illuminated by sunlight would he really do it she asked would he really kill all those prisoners all those children mcconnell realized then that sterns revelation had shocked the nurse as deeply as it had him he felt an urge to touch her to try and comfort her but he didnt want her to misinterpret his action im afraid hes perfectly capable of doing that he said if he really wants to you could only stop him by killing him unless youre ready to do that i dont think youd better go in to work today but i must anna looked at him with new fear in her eyes if i dont major schörner will send a patrol here can you call in sick i have no telephone how do you get to work bicycle well youd better ride damn slowly only twentyfour hours had passed since major schörner humiliated sergeant sturm in the alley but in those hours gunther sturm had boiled with a rage unlike any he had ever known it consumed him ultimately he would kill schörner but the discovery of the british parachutes had caused enough of an uproar to draw the attention of colonel beck at peenemünde sturm knew he would be crazy to try to get rid of schörner under the nose of that devil hed flirted with the idea of challenging schörner to a duel ss law entitled a man to demand satisfaction in a dispute where honor was involved but in practice actual duels were discouraged besides even with one eye missing schörner was an expert fencer and a crack shot no the only revenge he could get immediately would be through schörners jewish whore the man he had chosen to carry out his vendetta was a certain corporal ludwig grot not only was grot the most violent man in his unit but he also owed the sergeant major nearly four hundred marks in gambling debts sturm had put the matter to him over a bottle of excellent schnapps a treat he had been saving for a special occasion grot had been more than happy for the chance to erase his debts with a single favor and so simple one beating a couple of wellplaced blows where was the difficulty if a jew insulted the honor of the reich as he passed it was his duty to teach her a lesson if she died so what one less jew fouling the good german air sturm had made sure grot had a clear field for his attack schörner was meeting with colonel beck at peenemünde about the parachutes and brandt had driven down to berlin again to meet with reichsführer himmler as sturm walked his favorite shepherd an enormous male called rudi down to the vantage point he had chosen from which to observe the ambush he saw grot lounging in front of the ss enlisted barracks he gave the corporal a smug grin and reflected on how good a choice he had made during their time in einsatzkommando clearing jews from latvia ludwig grot had frequently complained of boredom he also lamented the great waste of ammunition expended in the disposal of jews one day he discovered a way to simultaneously assuage his two pet peeves he ordered several jewish prisoners to stand in a line each man pressing his chest to the back of the man in front of him he then took bets on how many jews he could kill with a single bullet in eastern poland he had won thirty marks by killing three fully grown males with a single shot from his luger near poznan he had killed five women this way but the last in line had taken several hours to die so she didnt really count sturm affectionately scratched rudis coat behind the powerful neck he almost wished schörner could be around to see the show rachel was crossing the appellplatz with hannah and jan when a guttural german voice brought her up short what was that you said jew she stopped and looked up into the perpetually angry face of corporal ludwig grot what did you call me judenlaus he barked rachel noticed that the corporal was speaking very loudly as if for the benefit of an audience she clenched jan and hannahs hands i said nothing herr rottenführer but if i offended i apologize you did offend you stinking slut rachel crumpled to the ground under the force of the first blow she wasnt sure what had happened it felt like she had walked blindly into an iron lamppost when grot kicked her in the stomach she nearly blacked out but she forced one string of words from her throat run children run to frau hagan jan caught little hannahs hand and began pulling her toward the inmate blocks grot dragged rachel to her feet and slapped her twice very hard and very quickly like a man for whom violence is an old habit the right side of her face stung as if it had been scalded the left side felt numb an image of a silver deaths head ring hung before her eyes for an instant she thought of wolfgang schörner then in the next remembered he was eighty kilometers away in peenemünde there would be no rescue today she closed her eyes and prayed that frau hagan would look after her children grot balled his right fist and punched the side of her head dropping her onto the snow then kicked her savagely in the ribs with his hobnailed boot rachel heard something crack as her left side collapsed inward grots boot stopped in its path toward her head as a womans voice shouted at him in a foreign language he looked up frau hagan was striding across the yard with all the confidence she had displayed digging peat at auschwitz or hauling bricks at buna when she was ten meters from the corporal she began berating him in german waving her hands and shouting that major schörner had unexpectedly returned to the camp and wanted grot in his office immediately confronted by this disconcerting spectacle grot stood up straight the kapo of the jewish womens block though a prisoner had an official position and she was screaming about major schörner he turned and sought out sergeant sturm who stood beneath a watchtower forty meters across the yard while corporal grot looked to sturm for guidance frau hagan covered the last few meters to him rachel gasped when she saw the gardening spade appear from beneath her gray shift grot whirled just in time to see the flash of metal as frau hagan buried the spade up to the hilt in his neck she jerked the spade back out allowing a fountain of blood to spurt from grots carotid artery both hands flew to his throat dosyç frau hagan bellowed enough to hell with you ss the big pole nodded at grot defiance in her eyes the ss man his eyes bulging in dumb incomprehension fell to the ground in a spreading puddle of blood frau hagan knelt over rachel are you all right dutch girl rachel could barely breathe much less speak tears of gratitude stung her cheeks she heard cries of rage and confusion reverberating through the camp no one could quite believe what had happened run she croaked get away while you can a savage barking chilled rachels blood but instead of cowering before the fearsome noise frau hagan rose into a crouch turned and braced herself for an attack rachel saw her face contort into a mask of fury an anger that had been building for years perhaps for a lifetime rudi sturms favorite shepherd was charging across the yard with his teeth bared he tore over the frozen ground faster than a racing hound and leaped at frau hagan while he was still four meters away the block leader shouted something in polish and held up her left forearm rudis jaws snapped shut on unprotected flesh as he landed flailing his head from side to side and fighting to push the woman off her feet with all the power in her thick body frau hagan slashed upward and plunged the spade into the animals throat an explosive squeal echoed across the snow the dog kept thrashing its head teeth ripping flesh but its motions seemed mechanical confused frau hagan yanked out the spade and struck lower ripping open its belly from groin to breastbone rudi let go frau hagan threw herself upon the beast like a madwoman mauling it with maniacal strength steam rose from the dogs open belly rachel tensed when she heard the first shot but she saw no immediate effect the second bullet thudded into flesh but frau hagan continued to slash away rachel realized then that an excited guard had shot the dog either by mistake or to put it out of its misery frau hagan looked back over her shoulder get up she shouted run youll be shot rachel struggled to move but her limbs would not obey no she yelled back come with me another rifle bullet slammed into the dog one of the towergunners fired a short burst to take his range frau hagan looked at rachel one last time her eyes shining with a strange elation then gathered up her shift and dashed toward the base of the guard tower where sergeant sturm stood watching in disbelief the enraged pole was running at full speed with the spade held high when the tower gunner cut her down the bullets blew her over onto her back where she lay without moving totenhausen lay perfectly silent from the ground rachel searched the faces of the women prisoners that had formed a loose perimeter around her for the first time since her arrival she sensed a real potential for violence among them frau hagan was known to them all dozens in the crowd owed her favors some owed her their lives she was a symbol of survival in the face of the worst the nazis could do for some seconds rachel was seized by the feeling that the women might actually follow frau hagans example and charge the guards she heard an ss man shout an order to return to barracks no one moved across the yard in the shadow of the hospital rachel spied anna kaas the blond nurse was standing beside the concrete steps looking directly at her in her white uniform she looked strangely like an angel when she had caught rachels eye anna raised both hands sharply toward the sky rachel stared back the nurse signaled again more violently get up rachel thought is that what you are telling me yes get up and walk or you will die where you lie she scrabbled up onto her forearms then her knees frau hagan lay motionless twenty meters away sergeant sturm was bellowing orders one after another some of the women prisoners were moving en masse toward the main gate where a small group of ss stood with their weapons leveled rachel got unsteadily to her feet someone fired a shot into the air the mob pushed on toward the gate at any other camp they would have been shot down without a thought but these were brandts guinea pigs the guards hesitated rachel stepped over the mutilated dog and moved toward her fallen friend she could not stop herself she felt a remarkable sense of calm for the first time she realized her children were not uppermost in her mind death was beckoning yet she felt no fear she had almost reached frau hagan when someone seized her arm she looked up into the face of anna kaas the nurse pulled her away from frau hagan toward the hospital rachel looked back at the dead pole where are you taking me shut up and follow me there was a sudden hail of gunfire rachel turned toward the main gate the ss were shooting into the ground at the mobs feet the line of advancing women wavered but several shouted defiantly then sergeant sturm pointed his revolver at the crowd and fired three times in quick succession hes shooting people rachel said the mob broke and ran leaving its wounded behind anna dragged her up the hospital steps and into the main corridor instead of taking her to an examining room she pushed rachel into a dark alcove that smelled of dirty linens before the yard is cleared you must return to your block she said quickly you dont want to see a doctor the doctors here will use your injuries as an excuse to kill you do you understand rachel stared anna took hold of her shoulders and shook her hagan is dead you are alive without you your children will die do you hear rachel nodded dully it is madness anna said a hysterical tone underlying her voice i thought we would all be dead by now and now this god knows what sturm will do after what hagan did she pulled rachel out of the alcove and marched her to the back door of the hospital you know where you are go left toward the latrines get into your block any way you can she opened the door and looked out the alley was empty go now she shoved rachel down the steps and closed the door rachel went mcconnell had been waiting alone in the cellar of annas cottage for eight hours when he heard someone knock at the front door he turned off the gas lamp and sat completely still in the darkness he knew the knocking might be stern but stern had taken off without a word and he could find his own goddamn way back in besides it might not be stern stern could have been caught by a german patrol ten minutes after he left the cottage and been tortured ever since he could have given up its location only minutes ago the sound of the knocking was faint probably because there was a staircase and a heavy door between mcconnell and the kitchen and then the foyer beyond that the knocking stopped mcconnell didnt try to relight the gas lamp he took several deep breaths and tried to slow the pounding of his heart he wasnt sure if it was light or dark outside but he figured dark where the hell was stern after his dramatic dawn exit anna had shown mcconnell through a narrow door in the corner of the kitchen that led to the cellar down a steep flight of wooden steps was a lowceilinged room stacked with bellied boxes and rusted farm machinery there was a sofa at the back and a couple of old duvets hed collected the bags from the foyer and hauled them down the steps one piece at a time while anna watched him with a hopeless look in her eyes shed spoken a few puzzled words then left for totenhausen during the first two hours mcconnell had jumped at every sound expecting to hear sirens or gunfire or whatever alarms might result from stern gassing the prison camp after that hed begun having visions of stern in the hands of the ss trying to hold out against god only knew what kind of tortures but when no storm troopers arrived to break down the cottage door and arrest him he calmed down enough to eat some cheese from his bag and consider his situation brigadier smith had proved to be even more devious than mcconnell had given him credit for the moment mcconnell climbed out of that lysander onto german soil he had become an accessory to the mission helpless to stop stern except by killing him or turning him in to the ss both moral impossibilities smith had counted on that so here he was cowering in the cellar of a frightened german nurse unable to escape germany without sterns help the nurse intrigued him she was the furthest thing imaginable from his idea of a spy had it been she who smuggled out the sample of sarin that hed tested in his oxford lab it was certainly possible but if so what had motivated her to take such a risk in the absence of facts he found himself certain that anna kaas had endured some great tragedy at the hands of the nazis why else would she risk her life to fight them very few germans had her reluctance to embrace brigadier smiths plan had surprised and pleased him she must have been excited at the prospect of action especially after months or even years of living a double life always under threat of discovery yet never seeing any benefit from the risks she took but now that the day had arrived she seemed appalled by what london had decreed must be done before leaving the cottage shed looked back at him and said its odd isnt it the nazis say we must kill jews to save the german people your brigadier smith says you must kill jews to save the jewish people i wonder do any of these men care about saving individual human beings a simplification perhaps but she had gotten to the heart of the matter maybe together they could convince stern to abandon the idea of killing the prisoners perhaps they could work out a compromise mcconnell gripped the arm of the sofa something had made a crashing sound upstairs he heard a quick scream then voices he felt along the sofa cushion until his left hand closed over the folding stock of his schmeisser hed never thought he would really use the weapon but if ss men were coming for him a shaft of light sliced down through the darkness he pointed the submachine gun at the top of the stairs are you down there a womans voice anna but she was not alone come on doctor stern mcconnell exhaled in relief keeping the schmeisser in his hands he climbed the steps to the kitchen he arrived in time to see anna pour a glass of vodka and drink it in a single swallow with trembling hands she poured another whats the matter mcconnell asked what happened i frightened her said stern leaning in the foyer doorway i tried to get in earlier but you wouldnt answer the door i didnt want to break in because i thought you might shoot me i waited for her then shoved in behind her when she opened the door where the hell have you been all day stern walked over to anna and drank a shot of vodka from her bottle rostock he said and wiped his mouth annas glass clinked on the countertop you are insane why did you go there stern took another swallow of vodka it was too windy to make the attack besides i knew wed never reach the coast without being caught if an alarm was raised not in daylight but how did you get to rostock i stole a car from the village anna shook her head you are mad i returned it to its owner stern said casually but never mind that when you got here you dropped your bicycle and ran to your door something had frightened you long before you saw me what was it anna looked away from him and drank from the glass you were right last night she said totenhausen must be destroyed whatever the cost it is an abomination mcconnell stared at her in confusion tell me what happened stern demanded she took a step back retreating from sterns sudden intensity there was a killing today is that unusual only because it was a prisoner who killed an ss man what it was a woman the blockführer of the jewish womens barracks she stabbed a corporal in the neck with a gardening spade the biggest brute in the camp why did she do that the guard was beating another prisoner to death a jewess from amsterdam stern shook his head angrily this blockführer was also a jew no but she and the jewess were friends did the jewish woman die no i got her away and sent her back to her block anna halfturned away and looked at the floor as she spoke as if she were being forced to reveal some terrible family secret hauptscharführer sturm went berserk after seeing that his man was really dead with brandt and schörner gone he was the senior officer in camp he ordered immediate reprisals two women were hanged from the punishment tree and eight more shot by firing squad ten people murdered stern grabbed her shoulder and spun her around jews no she said her voice barely audible polish christians anna pushed past him and sat down at the table the glass still clenched in her hand if schörner hadnt returned from peenemünde i think sturm and his men would have murdered every prisoner in the camp major schörner imposed order stern asked standing right over her more than that he ordered sturm confined to quarters that man has the nerve of the devil but why would he do that i think its something personal between him and sturm something to do with the woman the woman who killed the ss man no the jewess who was beaten i think schörner has pressured her into some sort of sexual arrangement stern looked pointedly at mcconnell as if to say you see what these nazi pigs are capable of and this sergeant disapproves of the majors sexual arrangement i dont think he cares about that anna said there is something else between him and schörner sturm really hates him what kind of crazy camp is this is there no discipline she shook her head slowly unshed tears pooling in her eyes its worse than anything you can imagine herr doktor brandt is in charge technically he is a lieutenantgeneral in the ss but he has no military training it is said hes a personal friend of himmler there are three other ss doctors two captains and a major to fill out the officer complement major schörner is head of security after that it drops to hauptscharführer sturm and his men no midlevel officers anna shook her head thats the way brandt likes it he wants doctors around him not soldiers at last stern moved away from her and began pacing around the table mcconnell sat down so he wouldnt have to keep stepping out of his way what would happen if i attacked the camp now stern asked the same as last night anna said in an exhausted voice youd miss half of the ss garrison because schörner has them out searching for parachutists but youd kill all of the prisoners not only that since you told me about the wind ive been thinking about it the wind at the camp blows faster than on this side of the hills it blows down the river stern made a frustrated sound in his throat also brandt had not returned from berlin when i left verdammt will he be back tonight probably but it could be quite late anna stood up and went to the sink where she ran some water over a cloth and held it against her face the whole camp has gone mad she said through the rag himmlers visit set all this off the very next night sturm and his men raped and murdered six women brought from ravensbrück schörner used to be drunk all the time now hes like a hawk watching everything its like something woke him from a deep sleep brandt abusing the children its madness i tell you like the end of the world what was that about children mcconnell asked anna hung the cloth on the basin and turned to him brandt performs experiments on children he calls it medical research but its unspeakable three times in the past ten weeks hes had boys brought to his quarters little boys he keeps them there for a while a week or so then then the gas i suppose oh god forgive me i dont know she wiped more tears out of her eyes i dont know and i dont want to stern stopped pacing and stared at mcconnell his face contorted with rage and still you wont help me destroy this place mcconnell found himself eyeing the vodka bottle with more than passing interest listen you want to kill this man brandt i understand that i do a man who tortures children doesnt deserve to live but youre asking me to kill every innocent prisoner under his power as well does that make sense to you were talking about the outcome of the entire war if you believe brigadier smith mcconnell tried to summon his most persuasive voice look stern we need to hash this thing out were in a pretty tough spot here maybe we can find some kind of middle ground if we just calm down stern kicked over one of the chairs and took a step toward him you should have come with me to rostock today doctor perhaps you wouldnt be so calm yourself are you interested in what i saw there mcconnell suppressed an urge to pick up his schmeisser in selfdefense sure he said softly our pilot was wrong what do you mean my familys apartment building was still standing in fact i went inside and asked a few questions anna closed her eyes and moved her lips silently a gesture mcconnell read as the equivalent of a catholic crossing herself oh i wasnt in any danger stern said in a sarcastic voice a policeman stopped me in the city but when he saw the sd uniform he nearly pissed his trousers he couldnt wait to get away from me being an sd colonel in this country must be rather like being god more like the devil thought mcconnell but he didnt say it yes our building is still there stern went on but things arent quite the same no bloodstains or anything unpleasant like that only when i lived there it was a jewish building now its full of little blond girls and boys miniature versions of fräulein kaas here mcconnell saw anna flinch no one seemed to remember my family stern said and why should they it was mostly children little aryan princes and princesses all living happily in flats haunted by the ghosts of little darkhaired children i do not think they are troubled by ghosts though do you doctor stern are you troubled by them doctor stern banged his schmeisser against a cabinet startling anna of all the men in the world i had to be stuck with you this woman has more courage than you he stalked down the cellar stairs but quickly returned with his personal bag which held the supplies hed stolen from achnacarry where are you going now anna asked anxiously stern slung the bag over his shoulder im going up that hill to end this madness the wind is blowing again but as soon as it dies im sending down those cylinders jesus said mcconnell coming to his feet just give me a minute to think for gods sake youve been thinking for your whole life doctor would another minute make any difference mcconnell knew there was no stopping him are you going for the sub afterwards since youre not going to help me theres really nothing i can do in the factory after the attack i wouldnt know what i was looking at much less what to take pictures of ill steal the nearest vehicle i can find and make a run for the coast what about us you mean you we cant leave anna to face the gestapo stern barked a short laugh we cant take her back with us smith was plain about that the sub wouldnt take her on board you know the british every man for himself eh stern mcconnell shook his head in disgust thats been your style from the beginning hasnt it stern pulled open the door dont worry doctor ill get you back to your warm little laboratory even if it kills me i want you to explain to smith why you couldnt compromise your sacred principles to save the allied invasion army he hefted the leather bag over his shoulder i wish you had to explain it to your dead brother mcconnell went for him then but stern simply slipped out and pulled the door shut after him by the time mcconnell got it open again he had vanished into the darkness wolfgang schörner clicked his boot heels together with the report of a parade ground inspection before him seated at an obsessively tidy desk was doctor klaus brandt the commandant of totenhausen had returned from berlin an hour earlier he looked up from a piece of notepaper hed been studying when schörner entered and regarded him over a pair of rimless reading glasses you asked to see me herr doktor schörner said brandt pursed his lips as if mulling over a complex diagnosis schörner felt the familiar discomfort he always experienced in brandts presence it wasnt only the mans perversions after four years at the sharp end of the war schörner found it irksome to be around men who worried more about their careers than the survival of the reich he was depressingly certain that whether germany won or lost klaus brandt would be a millionaire after the war while the barbed wire on the fatherlands borders would be tangled with the corpses of men like himself yet ironically klaus brandt was one of the few who held in his hands the means for german victory after what seemed an age to schörner brandt said you heard reichsführer himmler say that he intends to give the führer a demonstration of soman four schörner nodded in three days time yes correct i have just learned that erwin rommel will be there as well schörner felt a thrill of surprise of course it made perfect sense hitler had just put rommel in charge of his atlantic wall it would be the desert foxs responsibility to destroy the allies on the beaches of france is the demonstration still to take place at raubhammer proving ground herr doktor brandt sniffed peevishly yes the test will take place in three days the raubhammer engineers claim theyve finally perfected a lightweight suit that can insulate a man from both sarin and soman schörner raised his eyebrows i would like to see that suit herr doktor so would i schörner and we will theyre sending over three for our inspection brandt took a very thin cigarette from a gold case on his desk and lit it with almost feminine delicacy this demonstration will be quite a show it seems he said leaning back and blowing smoke to the side concentration camp prisoners from sachsenhausen will be dressed in captured british uniforms and made to charge across a mock beach where soman has been deployed ss volunteers defending the beach will be wearing the new protective suits it should really be something to see a fitting reward after all our hard work and welldeserved herr doktor quite so sturmbannführer the reichsführer believes this demonstration will at last overcome the führers irrational but quite understandable aversion to chemical weapons brandt held the cigarette between his lips while he examined the manicured fingernails of his left hand this will be quite a feather in himmlers cap schörner and he knows how to reward loyalty i know it well herr doktor schörner waited for further information but brandt had lapsed into silence will that be all herr doktor not quite schörner this matter of the british parachutes you have the situation under control i would hate to think anything might interrupt our production schedule with the test so near herr doktor standartenführer beck and myself believe the parachutists had their sights set on the peenemünde complex most of the sensitive rocketry equipment has been moved into poland or the harz mountains to keep it out of reach of the allied bombers but the allies may not know this beck has deployed a great deal of his strength between here and peenemünde if by some remote chance these commandos are attempting to penetrate our facility my patrols will catch them long before they get close see that they do sturmbannführer schörner clicked his boot heels again setting the cigarette aside brandt adjusted his reading glasses and looked down at the paper he had been studying when schörner entered one more thing sturmbannführer i understand that you have placed hauptscharführer sturm under house arrest schörner stiffened that is correct herr doktor why the hauptscharführer instigated the incident that resulted in the death of corporal grot as well as that of the kapo of the jewish womens block hagan and his motive i believe his motive involved some diamonds herr doktor sturm has a habit of trying to loot prisoners as they are brought in from the occupied territories i warned him once but he apparently did not take the warning to heart looting is a serious charge sturmbannführer brandt looked up over his glasses the reichsführer himself has mandated the death penalty for profiteers the basis of my action herr doktor however said brandt tapping his fingers on the desk when i returned from berlin i found a note on my desk giving a somewhat different version of events schörner felt blood rising into his cheeks was this note signed herr doktor brandt smiled but the effect was more like a grimace yes it was by four noncommissioned officers this note contained some serious charges of its own charges leveled at you sturmbannführer charges relating to infractions of the nuremberg racial laws schörner did not flinch he knew brandt was on thin ice himself here i am prepared to stand in an ss court on any charges you see fit to authorize herr doktor klaus brandt instantly raised his hands in a placating gesture at ease sturmbannführer i dont think it will come to that still it might be better if you released sturm under his own recognizance for the good of the corps you understand the last thing any of us want is a pack of sd officers down here turning over every stone and bed a hot wave of revulsion washed over schörner he wouldnt be surprised if sturms comrades had made some oblique reference to brandts perversions in their letter he pressed down his disgust as you say herr doktor im sure hauptscharführer sturm has seen the error of his ways brandt patted the desk with both hands let us concentrate our energies upon the upcoming test sturmbannführer destiny is at hand schörner fired his boot heels together and marched out jonas stern moved swiftly through the trees his steps almost soundless in the newly fallen snow hed moved uphill after leaving the cottage away from the village of dornow toward the power station toward the cylinders twice he had heard patrols pass within thirty meters of him but he found it easy to avoid them usually the orange light or smell of cigarettes betrayed the ss men thirty minutes after leaving anna kaass cottage he was standing beneath the tall wooden pylon where the gas cylinders hung he stood in the darkness beside the two great support poles and stared up through the foliage it took some time for his eyes to adjust but eventually he made out the silhouettes of the steel cylinders hanging in a neat row from one of the outermost electrical wires he felt a sudden dizziness when he realized that the heavy tanks were swaying in the treetops even without the portable anemometer he was certain that wind sufficient to move those cylinders was moving faster than the ideal speed for the attack he stomped on the snow around the base of the support leg nearest him buried beneath his feet in a box with the anemometer and the emergency radio and the submarine signal lamp were the climbing spikes and harness that would carry him to the top of the pylon within five minutes he could initiate the nerve gas attack on totenhausen the brisk wind might dilute the gass effects but if the british nerve agent worked at all it should certainly kill some ss men on the other hand if he waited for a while the wind might drop off to nothing as he stood there in the snow the hum of the nearby transformer station buzzing in his ears he felt something even stronger than his hatred for the nazis turning inside him something he would never admit to mcconnell or the nurse or anyone else something he could hardly admit to himself the visit to rostock had dredged it up and the longer he stood there the more powerful it became until to his surprise he found himself moving again down the hill away from the power station away from the cylinders he was moving toward totenhausen camp do you think he will do it this time anna asked mcconnell sat opposite her at the kitchen table two mugs of ersatz coffee made from barley between them the brew tasted terrible but it was hot if he makes it up the hill alive he probably will do you think he should do it someone must do something anna said i dont know if its right to kill the prisoners but he is right about one thing what everybody in that camp is doomed no matter what we do theyll never survive the war do you think what he said is true do you think im a coward for not helping him anna looked into her coffee people are different what he calls courage you call stupidity what you call courage he calls weakness some men are not made for war i think and that must be a good thing she looked up at him why did they select you for this mission it doesnt seem to make sense they said they picked me because im not british and because im an expert on poison gases i guess the idea was that together stern and i would make one perfect soldier a killer with the brain of a scientist what about you youre a civilian nurse yes they said there was a shortage in the medical corps but i think brandt just prefers civilians im a civilian myself she nodded a chemist yes he laughed by avocation only im actually a medical doctor annas face underwent a subtle yet profound change she seemed to be looking at mcconnell through different eyes you are a physician yes before the war anyway you had a practice briefly she sat in silence reflecting on this new information finally she said is that the reason you are so hesitant to kill mcconnell hedged part of it i suppose its part of the reason i do what i do too how do you mean anna glanced at the kitchen window its dangerous for you to be up here schörner might order a housetohouse search you want me to go down to the basement she stood up and refilled their mugs then took the halfempty vodka bottle from a sideboard ill come with you she said i guess were both waiting for the same thing what is that exactly the alarms at totenhausen if stern carries out the attack we will hear sirens even in the basement mcconnell went down the steps first and lit the gas lamp they sat on the sofa hed slept on the night before halfhidden behind the boxes and old farmmachinery parts can i ask you something he said you dont have to answer if you dont want to but im curious she looked at the floor and smiled sadly why do i work against the nazis yes yes you have to admit not many germans have oh ill admit that the few who had the courage to fight were hunted down early on the rest fall into two categories those who love the new order and those who simply take the path of least resistance the latter is a highly developed feature of the german political character but not of yours anna poured a stiff shot of the vodka into her coffee it could have been she drank but it didnt turn out that way the funny thing is what changed me i thought about it a moment ago when you talked about yourself and stern about the two of you making one complete soldier what do you mean what made me different than other germans it was a man of course a man like myself and stern i can hardly imagine a man like that she laughed this man was more like you than stern he was a doctor in fact a physician yes but he was also a jew anna said this with a certain defiance and it was the last thing he expected he didnt know what to say but he did want to hear the story this was in dornow no berlin i was raised in bad sülze not far from here my parents were rural people wellenough off but very provincial my sister and i had grander ideas at seventeen i went off to berlin to become a sophisticated city girl when i completed my nurses training i went to work for a general practitioner in charlottenburg franz perlman that was the nuremberg laws had been passed by then but i was a foolish girl i had no idea how ominous it all was the restrictions on jews were being enforced in different fields at different speeds and many doctors were still practicing franz really seemed too busy to notice he worked from morning till night and on everyone jews christians whomever anna sipped from her coffee and stared into the soft light of the gas lamp there were three of us franz the receptionist and me you can imagine how it happened its not so uncommon a situation is it a doctor and a nurse i was twenty at the time id fallen in love with him by the third week it wasnt so hard to do he was a kind and dedicated man he tried to discourage me at first he was a widower and older fortyfour i didnt care how old he was i never thought about him being a jew either after about a year he stopped discouraging me poor man i was shameless i wanted to marry him but he wouldnt hear of it he wouldnt even let us be seen together outside the office only twice in all that time did he sneak into my flat and he never allowed me in his i grew angry at him after a while about his refusal to marry me even secretly i was a fool one day he pulled the scales from my eyes he told me about all his friends who had been forced out of business or who had simply disappeared i didnt believe him at first i lived in in einem traum in a dream jewish professors had already been badgered out of the medical schools franz had received threatening letters he showed me some only then did i understand it was for my physical safety that hed kept up the illusion that we had no relationship he wanted to marry me more than anything mcconnell detected a hitch in annas voice but she got control of it again the practice was almost as busy as ever a few patients stopped coming but not many a caring doctor is not so easy to find too many worship the scalpel yes or themselves mcconnell smiled ive known a few of those franz was different he felt a deep obligation to his patients thats why he wouldnt stop finally the nazis left him no room to squirm they forbade jewish doctors practicing at all the line was drawn our receptionist refused to come to work but not me every day for five weeks i did the work of two and franz was doing the work of ten visiting the old delivering babies he was one of the last the funny thing is many aryans continued to see him and he continued to treat them she drew a deep breath i apologize for dragging this out its just i havent told anyone about this since it happened i couldnt you understand not my parents not even my sister especially not my sister i understand fräulein kaas do you do you know what finally happened they dragged him off to a concentration camp no one fine morning a wellscrubbed ss boy i mean it he was younger than i he walked into the waiting room and demanded to see the doctor he had four friends with him all dressed in black with their deaths head badges franz came into the waiting room wearing his white coat and stethoscope the ss man informed him that the clinic was closed franz said no one had the right to stop him from treating the sick no matter what uniform they wore franz told the boy to go home then turned around to go back to work a chill ran along mcconnells neck and arms they didnt kill him the boy pulled out a walther and shot franz in the back the bullet shattered his spine anna wiped tears from her cheeks he died within a minute on his own waitingroom floor mcconnell found nothing to say she raised her eyes you know what the worst of it was there were german christians in that waiting room when it happened people franz had treated for fifteen years and not one of them not one uttered a sound of protest not even to the boy who had murdered their doctor before their very eyes anna and stern wonders why i hate the nazis she balled her fists i tell you if i werent such a coward i would kill brandt myself an odd thought struck mcconnell then how in gods name did you end up working in a concentration camp after that she drank another slug of the vodkalaced coffee this really takes the prize after i came back from the city depressed and nearly destitute my older sister took pity on me and of course she was in an excellent position to help me her way of escaping the boredom of country life had been to marry the gauleiter of mecklenburg can you believe it my sister sabine is a rabid nazi she got me the job at totenhausen and i was in no position to turn it down honestly the first time i toured brandts hospital it seemed almost like a civilian institution what a fool i was it was insane thought mcconnell but typical of what the war had done to people around the world you mentioned courage before he said your franz perlman had the kind of courage i admire he had principles character conviction yes anna said to her coffee and now he is dead in this world we have made thats where principles get you maybe but ill take that over capitulation anytime what about you doctor she said i gave you my confession give me yours what keeps you from going up that hill and helping stern mcconnell slid off the sofa and sat on the floor with his back against the leg rest its simple really it was my father he was a doctor too hes dead now he fought in world war one against the germans of course my uncle too he died at the marne my father was gassed at st mihiel badly burned by mustard he never really recovered anna touched his shoulder im sorry im sure freud would have a lot to say about my career choice mcconnell said lightly i dont really give a damn i saw very young what war did to people and i didnt like it i still dont when this one started i tried to use my talents to prevent suffering not inflict it as you can see the british werent satisfied with that she leaned forward and looked down into his eyes you remind me a lot of franz doctor i think you are a good and kind man but i dont think you really understand what is happening in germany anna got up and walked over to a shelf lined with what appeared to be old account books i would like you to look at something she removed several books then reached into the space behind and pulled out a small leatherbound volume its cover worn to a dull shine this is my diary she said i began it the day after franz was killed in some ways it has been my only friend the first part contains nothing of consequence merely personal things but somewhere around page thirty i began to record my experiences at totenhausen i recorded every experiment i witnessed myself as well as things i overheard dr brandt confide to other doctors either in person or on the telephone some passages are things he said directly to me after visiting other reich medical facilities concentration camps euthanasia centers various clinics she carried the book part of the way to the stairs then turned and tossed it to mcconnell youre a doctor she said read the curriculum vitae of one of your fellow physicians when she had gone mcconnell opened the diary and began to read rachel jansen sat motionless in the wing chair in the anteroom of major schörners quarters schörner sat on the sofa opposite her sipping from a glass of brandy why didnt he kill me in the reprisal rachel asked in a monotone schörner held his glass up to a lamp and watched the light play through the amber liquid sturm is just the slightest bit afraid of me he said and well he should be id like to cut his throat with his own dagger when i look at those bruises on your beautiful face my blood burns and i can tell by the way you sit and breathe that you are hurt in the side did that bastard grot kick you this is madness rachel said softly the act of speech sending stabbing pains along her damaged ribs what if i am discovered here now tonight a reckless smile played at the corners of schörners handsome mouth that is the last thing that would happen tonight liebling brandt wants no conflict nothing that might disturb his arrangements with reichsführer himmler to brandt sturm and i are merely a sideshow besides that his voice softened i had to see you i had to know that the pig had not hurt you badly schörner leaned forward on the sofa did he if you are unable tonight i will understand rachel shivered in the chair you are cold schörner asked his voice full of concern here liebling come and sit beside me rachel hesitated then rose and walked to the couch like a woman going to the guillotine jonas stern stood in the shadow of a wooden barracks building and listened at first he heard only the wind blowing down the recknitz river anna kaas was right it was stronger here than in the treetops on the hills it took time to separate the snoring from the wind but that was the sound he realized snoring he moved silently along the row of barracks buildings a combination of stealth and boldness had brought him this far just before reaching totenhausens back fence he had crossed over three long shallow pits dug under the trees he remembered the smell of burnt flesh from north africa and recognized the pits for what they were it was the trees that gave him his plan tall evergreens grew right up to the electrical fence on three sides of the camp since he was outside the fence he simply slung his schmeisser over his shoulder climbed a fir tree shinnied out along a branch and dropped to the snow beside the barn that concealed the gas factory before his nerves had time to stop him he straightened his back and marched toward the gate that separated the factory from the camp proper there was one sentry there an ss private wearing the earthbrown uniform of a concentration camp guard stern made ready to get out his papers but his graygreen sd uniform and iron cross were apparently all the identification he needed he rapped out a heil hitler as he passed the respectful guard it was easy enough to get his bearings walking with obvious purpose for the benefit of the men in the watchtowers he moved through the alley that separated the hospital from the eblock turned left then walked up to the mesh fence that bordered the inmate blocks he strolled along the fence until he found a spot out of sight of the tower guards one sentry stood watch at the camps rear gate but he was facing the woods stern saw no insulators on the fence wires no electricity here he quickly scaled the fence and dropped to the other side hed heard the snores at the first block he heard the same thing at the next three only at the fifth barracks when he bent low to listen at the crack beneath the door did he see a faint yellow glow as from a candle then he heard a voice a whisper really the hairs on his neck rose like quills the voice was speaking yiddish he took a quick breath and slipped his right forefinger into the trigger guard of his schmeisser then he stood erect walked up the three steps and into the block the candle went out instantly he heard a frantic scuffling like rats in the walls then silence the air was warmer here thick with the smell of soiled wool and disinfectant listen to me he said softly in yiddish are you all jews here no one answered listen i am not what i appear to be please are you all jews nothing he wished he had stripped off the sd uniform outside i myself am a jew he said i have come to germany from palestine i am a spy i have come to learn the truth of what the nazis are doing to our people stern realized that if he had claimed he was the messiah sent from god he could not have stunned the prisoners more he saw a faint reflection from eyes peering at him in terror and astonishment like a den of rabbits surprised in the dark who is leader here he asked our leader is dead ss man said a harsh voice from the darkness a womans voice you know that who spoke please i have not come to harm you but i havent much time you know who we are hissed another voice what do you want ss man this is an sd uniform stern said in measured tones but i am neither ss nor sd i am a jew from rostock who fled to palestine i am ready to prove that to anyone who will speak to me say kaddish then someone challenged him for all the people you have murdered stern began yisgadal vyiskadash shmay rabo bolmo deevro hir usay vyamleeh malhusay is that enough he knows it said a hesitant voice that means nothing whispered another what year is it someone asked by the hebrew calendar stern felt the pressure of time but he was proud of the women for testing him this way what are the four questions he smiled in the darkness remembering the passover seders of his youth why do we eat matzo why do we eat bitter herbs why do we dip our vegetables why do we recline he knows more lies said the skeptic no jew would come here by choice there is only one way to tell said a more confident voice the same way the ss pick our men from the crowds stern was confused only a moment can you pass that test ss man asked the skeptic with a flush of anger and embarrassment stern unfastened the trousers of the sd uniform and let them down a little light the candle said the confident voice in the uncertain light of the candle flame stern saw five women wearing striped gray shifts sallow faces dull eyes hair cropped almost to the skulls beyond them others waited watchful in the darkness come closer said one of the women she was young with a dark thatch of hair and onyx eyes he obeyed the darkhaired woman crept forward with the candle and crouched in front of him he speaks the truth she said he is circumcised several women gasped stern pulled up his pants when the woman before him straightened up he peered deep into her eyes she seemed younger than the other women healthier too when he looked down he saw not only skin over her bones but also feminine contours i am rachel jansen she said you must be mad mcconnell had been reading annas diary for an hour he did not want to go on but he could not stop he felt numb even now he could not quite accept it the nurses diary described nothing less than the systematic perversion of a renowned national medical community into the utter negation of everything medical science had sought to achieve since the time of hippocrates he had expected some horror stories for months rumor had been rife in england about the brutality of the nazi detention camps but annas diary had little to do with brutality brutality was a universal flaw in the human character commonplace in every society this diary described atrocities committed on another scale altogether even outright murder seemed banal in the face of what he had read in the last hour one of the most alarming passages had had its effect because of who was involved as much as what was done dr brandt returned from a trip to auschwitz main camp in silesia all afternoon he complained to rauch and schmidt how the reichs money is being wasted there he said dr clauberg has allowed his professional standards to fall deplorably that claubergs experiments with mass sterilization border on quackery mcconnell knew well the name clauberg but could annas diary really implicate the physician who had developed the standard test for progesterone action a test that still carried his name if the diary could be believed it could clauberg has apparently taken to castrating both men and women by means of massive doses of xrays brandt claims the inefficiency of this method is obvious to anyone with even rudimentary experience of gamma rays and their effects to prove his point brandt requested a male prisoner which hauptscharführer sturm promptly provided yearold russian pow after the prisoner had been forcibly restrained by ss troops brandt pro ceeded to perform a vasectomy to show his protégés how rapidly the procedure could be executed by a skilled surgeon he accomplished the procedure in four minutes a discussion of female sterilization followed in which brandt again claimed surgery as the most efficient method he said clauberg will never regain his prewar eminence brandt plans to sterilize six women tomorrow morning to prove his point before scheduled test of sarin iv aerosol compound the shock of this entry had lasted only until mcconnell reached the first detailed description of one of klaus brandts research projects this passage alone was enough to damn the nazi state for all eternity eight days ago brandt purposely infected four boys and four girls with rapidly fulminating group i meningococcus bacteria by the droplet infection method droplets being obtained from live carriers held prisoner in the isolation room greta müller and i were instructed to rotate hour shifts in the experimental ward until the study had run its course this is my first opportunity to record what happened our functions were to a record the onset of symptoms b take blood samples and white counts when indicated c administer sulfadiazine and also dr brandts own formulation to the separate patient groups at the proper intervals d administer fluids to prevent dehydration e chart the progress of each patient until recovery or death the youngest patient was six months old female the oldest five years male the average age was three and one half years on the fourth day after infection meningococcus was recovered from the blood of all patients most had characteristic rashes at this time brandt ordered oral administration of sulfadiazine to two patients simultaneously giving his secret preparation to two others the remaining four patients including the female infant he designated as controls the control group quickly exhibited symptoms of the septicemic stage of the disease irregular fever hypersensitivity rapid pulse and respiration most curled up in the characteristic position and cried out when disturbed all four developed serious rashes three of these hemorrhagic white counts of all controls hovered between and first fatality in the control group fouryearold female caused by overwhelming septicemic infection of body covered by hemorrhagic rash routine postmortem by dr rauch infant control quickly exhibited bulging of the fontanelles due to massive infection experienced convulsions low pulse rate and respiration death occurred six days after initial infection the two patients given sulfadiazine showed marked improvement within hours those given brandts preparation were slower to improve the controls quickly progressed into the next stage of the disease the bacteria disappeared from their bloodstreams and localized in the meninges patients experienced vomiting and the familiar bursting headache caused by increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid also constipation urine retention and stiffness of neck muscles due to nerve root involvement two of the smaller childrens spines and necks drew backward into the characteristic bow none could flex his chin third fatality in control group threeyearold male died in agony on gretas shift i had managed to feed him some aspirin that morning nothing else brandts postmortem revealed cause of death to be internal hydrocephalus ventricles of the brain were dilated and the brain convolutions flattened by the pressure of a thick purulent fluid also optic nerve involvement patient was blind in one eye at time of death purulent exudate extended all the way into the spinal canal throughout the course of the experiment brandt performed several spinal punctures to examine cerebrospinal fluid he was infuriated by the slowness of his own preparation compared to that of sulfadiazine the children were terrified of these spinal punctures and had to be restrained by ariel weitz and ss men on day six brandt resorted to direct injection of his preparation into the spine of one child this leads me to believe that his secret preparation is unrelated to the sulfonamides as local therapy is not required when using those brandt plans to duplicate this entire experiment in one week using a different preparation also one box of polyvalent antimeningococcus horse serum arrived yesterday mcconnell looked up from the diary he realized then that he was in a kind of shock there were at least a dozen separate entries recording similar experiments on children and references to nearly fifty more performed by brandt and his assistant physicians all accurate down to the last medical detail but what horrified him most was that these experiments had no valid medical reason behind them it was known that meningitis could be cured by sulfadiazine was klaus brandt torturing children merely to try and find some new pharmacological agent with which to enrich himself after the war mcconnell closed his eyes and pressed his fingertips to his temples how could anna kaas record such things without apparent emotion he had searched for some sense of guilt or revulsion in the record but after the first few entries all references to her own perspective virtually ceased then he realized or rather hoped he had realized what she was up to the german nurse was acting as a sort of verbal camera recording what she saw in the manner that courts of law would demand evidence of a witness injecting emotion into her record would only cloud the issue after the war but still he thought to realize that she had stood by while these atrocities were committed and in fact had participated in them was difficult to grasp he longed for some expression of anguish or plea for forgiveness however insufficient or inarticulate from the vulnerable soul that lies at the core of every human being but as yet he had not found it he was certain of one thing if he got out of germany alive the nurses diary was going with him jonas stern sat in stunned silence in a corner of the jewish womens block more than forty women surrounded him a single guttering candle flickered on the floor he had never seen such eyes before not even in the faces of soldiers unmanned in the midst of great carnage eyes like black mirrors at once shallow and bottomless he had the feeling that if he pressed his finger to one of those eyes it would shatter and fall inward through a black cavern of grief and loss that could never be filled he had learned much in his short time here hed asked a few questions about the histories of the women mostly to keep up the fiction of gathering intelligence for zionist leaders in palestine and london but when he heard some of the answers all else went out of his mind for a while each story was a variation on the same theme we were doing all right hitler came to power the rich fled the nazis came to our town our village our city our house our flat they killed my father my mother my husband my sons my uncles my sisters my daughter my grandparents and almost every story ended with the same line i am the last of my family as the women spoke stern learned that the block leaders death and the brutal reprisals that followed had thrown the block into disarray and that the young dutchwoman who questioned him had assumed the dead poles position by default he had made up his mind to ask her the question he had risked his life to come here and ask when she said how do you plan to get out of the camp herr stern he knew what was coming some of the women had begun to dream of escape he had to discourage them they could not know that he had no intention of leaving the vicinity of the camp until until what until he had killed them all of course herr stern rachel said again im walking out through the front gate the same way i got in rachel was silent for some moments but that doesnt make sense an ss man without transportation stern shifted uncomfortably i told you before this uniform is sd sicherheitsdienst more feared even than the gestapo not even the ss question the sd stern saw a flash of hope in her dark eyes i have a favor to ask of you rachel said a great favor i cant take you out he said quickly not me my child he stared at her you have a child here two a boy and a girl and you want you want me to take only one child the young woman took hold of his hand and squeezed her eyes blazing with urgency better that one have a chance at life than both die she said and they will surely die if they stay here stern saw desperation her eyes but also a fierce determination she meant what she said they are very small she said in a pleading voice that drove stern into a rage of shame and impotence you could easily carry one stern jerked his hand away the realization that this woman had so honestly confronted the impossibility of her own survival that she would give up her child to a stranger shook him to his core he stared into the ring of faces surrounding him searching for some sign of censure none of the other women seemed shocked by rachels request in annas cellar mcconnell had finally found the diary entry he was searching for it was near the end dated only two weeks ago more and more civilians are being killed by allied bombs in case i do not survive the war i will here speak a little about things almost too painful to face i know what the world will ask about me how could this woman have stood by and watched these horrible things she was a civilian she was a nurse she did not have to do these things no one held a gun to her head well that is both true and false i am a civilian but i live in nazi germany at war and i knew enough about klaus brandt after one week here to know that a request to be transferred might mean death brandt has absolute power in totenhausen if he orders your death you are dead only sturmbannführer schörner seems unafraid of him i think schörner saw too much death in russia to be afraid of anything some will call me a coward for not leaving this place for not refusing to participate in these experiments even at the cost of my life am i a coward yes i have lain shivering in my bed with nightmares of hauptscharführer sturm beating down the door of my cottage to arrest me and take me to the tree i have been close to suicide but the worlds condemnation means little not all the torturers in the world could cause me the agony i have felt when the beseeching eyes of dying children looked to me for help and i could not give it i have an answer for the world but no excuse when i first arrived at totenhausen i was already severely depressed due to the fact that my lover had been murdered by the ss in berlin when i realized what actually went on here i believe i entered a state of deep shock after i regained some perspective getting away from totenhausen became my only thought but then i considered my situation if brandt allowed me to leave the camp i would succeed in distancing myself from the crimes but the crimes would still go on they would continue just as before but unseen by anyone who was disturbed by them as i was i felt like a little fish swimming inside a tidal wave i could try to swim in the other direction but the wave would thunder on for many days i hardly spoke then i decided i had been sent to this hell for one reason to be a witness to record what i saw this i have done and continue to do i have become hardened to things that would shame a murderer but i no longer think of suicide now i pray that i will survive this war i pray that my diary will be the noose that finally snaps klaus brandts fat neck i worry sometimes that i am beyond saving that i am damned in the eyes of god but more often i wonder if god even sees this place how could god exist in the same universe with totenhausen camp mcconnell closed the diary he had found the reassurance he sought even in this crucible of human depravity some measure of hope of human integrity survived anna kaas had rebelled against the madness she described but her rebellion was not the empty whining of political dilettantes she had not offered impotent moralizing words and then retired into the wings of rationalization or selfdelusion nor had she committed some brave but vain act of selfsacrifice as mcconnell might have done she had done something far more difficult she had sacrificed her humanity in order to attempt the only thing that might ever have some real effect on the men who committed the horrors she witnessed each day to tell the world what they were doing when he realized this mcconnell also understood something else that anna kaas had accomplished something no one before her ever had she had changed his fundamental belief about the futility of violence all his life he had stood with his father against war but tonight simple written words had bred a cold light that revealed to him something worse than war or perhaps a new kind of war a war of mankind upon itself a selfconsuming madness that could only end in complete annihilation his medical experience gave him the perfect metaphor for his new understanding cancer the system that had created totenhausen and the dozen other camps he had read of in the diary was a malignant melanoma festering within the human species it moved maliciously under cover of a more conventional malady but it would eventually destroy everything in its path and like any melanoma it could not be stopped without destroying healthy tissue in the process as he sat with the closed book on his lap mcconnell came to a conclusion inconceivable to him before tonight if his father a physician and combat veteran who had preached nonviolence for twenty years could by some magic read anna kaass diary and then come face to face with doctor klaus brandt he would shoot him down like a mad dog for the last time i cannot do it stern said it will be a miracle if i escape alive with a child i would have no chance he forced himself to look away from rachel jansens face a light had gone out behind her eyes where there had been hope he saw only ashes i want to ask you something he said all of you come closer the gray faces drew nearer to him what is it rachel asked i am interested in a particular man a jew from rostock we received reports that he died at this camp i want to know if any of you can tell me anything about him if you remember him how he lived perhaps how he died what was his name between us we know everyone in the camp avram stern said quietly avram stern from rostock rachel looked at the other women then back at stern you mean the shoemaker stern felt a flush of apprehension shoemaker he was a cobbler yes rachel slowly held out her hand and touched his chin she lifted his face turning both cheeks to the light my god she murmured you are his son sterns body tensed you knew him rachel looked puzzled knew him i know him hes sleeping less than thirty meters from us right now when the door to the cottage banged open above him mcconnell threw down the diary and grabbed his schmeisser he heard annas voice then a mans voice speaking german he crept to the top of the cellar stairs and opened the door a crack stern was standing in the kitchen in his sd uniform furiously rubbing his hands his face was red and his eyes full of tears as if he had run for miles in a cold wind kaffee bitte he said to anna where is the doctor sleeping anna moved to the dented pot steaming on the stove im starting to think you dont really mean to attack that camp at all said mcconnell stepping into the kitchen sterns eyes went to the schmeisser youd do better to hold that by the barrel and use it as a club go to hell mcconnell took a seat at the table danke said stern accepting a hot cup from anna if your christian hell exists my friend ive just been there and you know what its full of jews what do you mean you went into the camp stern raised the cup to his windburned lips watching mcconnell over the rim camps are made to keep people in not out so how did you get out underneath a medical supply truck a rather odd time to take deliveries dont you think anna said from the stove there are as many christians as jews in totenhausen herr stern stern surprised mcconnell by not responding to this statement the young zionist seemed preoccupied his hairtrigger temper nowhere in evidence so why didnt you attack the camp mcconnell asked too much wind said stern his eyes fixed on the table i see did you learn anything useful useful how you dont want this mission to succeed remember anna looked over sterns shoulder at mcconnell her eyes seemed to be asking if this was still true i have a proposition for you doctor stern said in a neutral tone im listening its obvious that i cant carry out this mission as planned without your help so i propose a compromise anna set a cup of barley coffee in front of mcconnell he nodded thanks what kind of compromise if you will help me to gas the ss garrison i will do everything in my power to save the lives of the prisoners mcconnell sat back hard in his chair had he heard correctly annas eyes were riveted on him obviously she had heard the same thing well hell he said talk about saul on the road to damascus sterns chair crashed back against the stove as he came to his feet whoa said mcconnell raising both hands take it easy four hours ago you were ready to kill everybody in the place now you want to save them stern felt his hands trembling when he embraced his father for the first time in eleven years it was as if a jacket of ice had melted away from his heart everything he had planned to say if he ever got the chance how stupid and stubborn avram had been to remain in germany how cruel to make his wife and son strike out for palestine without his protection all went out of his mind the moment he saw the pathetic state his father was in avram stern had not even recognized his own son when jonas spoke his hebrew name and the name of his mother the man known as the shoemaker had nearly fainted dead away while rachel jansen kept the other women back they spoke of many things but jonas had come quickly to the point in an almost inaudible whisper he asked his father to come out of the camp with him avram had refused jonas could not believe it it was rostock all over again only it was different ten years before avram had refused to believe that hitler would betray the jewish combat veterans he no longer labored under such delusions but he remained as stubborn as ever now he claimed it was impossible for him in good conscience to abandon his fellow jews to the fate that awaited them in totenhausen jonas had argued violently and in fact came very close to revealing his true mission but avram had not been moved the only concession he made was that if jonas could somehow help the others to escape he would go also and so brimming with anger and frustration jonas had told his father to sleep in the jewish womens block until he came again trekking back across the hills stern had calmed himself enough to settle on a plan because of his fathers hardheadedness he now had to try to accomplish something even the chief of soe believed to be impossible find a way to kill totenhausens ss guards with poison gas while sparing its prisoners to do that stern knew he would need mcconnells help he hated this new dependence almost as much as he hated himself for being unable to follow through with the original plan and he had no intention of revealing his weakness to the american i am willing to try to save the prisoners stern said through tight lips if you will help me kill the ss men get the photos the british need and steal the sample of soman but i will still carry out the attack alone if you refuse to help me everyone will die then perhaps even you and fräulein kaas calm down mcconnell told him just sit down and be still for a minute please anna righted sterns chair and set it behind him but he did not sit mcconnell tried to penetrate the crystalline shine of sterns eyes but it was like trying to read through black quartz sterns reasons were his own and for the time being at least would remain that way all right mcconnell said after a moment that sounds like a fair bargain to me youve got a deal ill help you stern was more shocked by this reversal of position than mcconnell had been by his he reached awkwardly for a chair and sat down opposite mcconnell at the table easier sell than you thought huh said mcconnell well dont look so pleased with yourself i want to know how you propose to kill a hundred and fifty ss soldiers without killing the prisoners as well youre the one who wants to save them stern said almost too quickly you find a way a fleeting intuition told mcconnell that sterns words had very little connection to what was in his heart he had no evidence of this but because stern almost always said exactly what he thought his words invariably had the ring of conviction but his last remark had sounded forced overdone and yet what could he possibly be hiding youre supposed to be the genius stern went on filling the silence mcconnell had left lets see you prove it i will said mcconnell his eyes and ears taking the measure of the new personality before him ill find a way half an hour and a second pot of coffee later mcconnell still had no answer the three of them sat around the table like students trying to solve a complex calculus problem stern had suggested a couple of desperate commandostyle plans to free the prisoners before gassing the camp but each would have required at least a dozen men and splitsecond timing his ideas brought mcconnell no closer to a solution but they did confirm his suspicion that stern for whatever reason suddenly possessed a heartfelt desire to save the prisoners lives it was anna who put him on track stern was telling them about something his guerrilla band had tried against a british fort when she broke in and said ach the eblock stern stopped talking what the experimental block its the sealed chamber at the rear of the camp where brandts gas experiments are carried out what about it asked mcconnell the ss avoid it like a plague ward i was thinking what if we could slip the prisoners into it a few at a time maybe half an hour before you attack when the cylinders detonated the prisoners would be safe inside the eblock while the ss troops choked to death outside stern gaped at her across the table thats brilliant just a minute mcconnell interrupted how big is this chamber annas smile faded ive never been inside it but youre right its small from the outside it doesnt seem so small but its a doublewalled chamber a room inside a room let me think ive seen the numbers on test reports i think nine square meters thats only a hundred square feet mcconnell said how high is the ceiling just enough room for a tall man to stand two meters six and a half feet how many prisoners in the camp she shook her head after todays reprisals two hundred and thirtyfour its impossible youre right said stern you couldnt squeeze even half of the prisoners inside damn theres got to be a way mcconnell spread his hands flat on the table and sat still for nearly a minute his mind exploring every possible variant of annas idea maybe there is he said finally what said stern you have an idea anna is right about the eblock in principle the essential problem is exposing the ss to the gas while protecting the prisoners from it but shes thinking backwards what do you mean asked anna get the ss to go into the eblock and kill them with the gas while the prisoners are safe outside in theory yes but the ss wont go near the eblock besides there are a hundred and fifty of them mcconnell couldnt resist a smile im sure youre right but i also feel sure that the architect who designed totenhausen was thorough enough to include a bomb shelter in his plans her eyes played over his face as she absorbed the full import of his words my god youre right its a long tunnel and it will hold more than every ss man in the camp thats it said stern his voice almost crackling with excitement we sneak two cylinders into the bomb shelter trick the ss into it and auf wiedersehen mission accomplished ill bet that gas is twice as effective in an enclosed space probably ten times as effective said mcconnell plus the wind ceases to be a factor in the plan stern shook his head smith was right doctor you are a bloody genius mcconnell bowed in mock humility how many entrances does the shelter have anna two the main entrance is in one of the ss barracks the other is in the basement of the hospital the morgue do you think you could block the morgue entrance so that no one who entered from the ss barracks could get out that way i think so yes if it is more effective in a closed space stern reasoned one cylinder should be enough but ill use two to be sure its a simple matter of taking them down from the pylon and whats the matter asked mcconnell we cant get them down from the pylon no we can do that the problem is getting the cylinders into the camp i dropped inside the wire from an overhanging tree limb i cant do that with steel cylinders stern looked down at the table for a moment then raised his eyes to anna theres only one way to do it he said a car she said quietly he nodded can you get one anna bit her bottom lip as she considered this i have a friend greta müller her father is a farmer who supplies food to the ss oberabschnitt at stettin he not only has vehicles but petrol to run them with a car we could lay the cylinders flat on the backseat or sling them beneath the undercarriage with chains that would be better pure energy radiated from stern as he visualized the plan you could drive in late tomorrow night and park by the hospital id be waiting for you after i unchained the cylinders you could lead me to the morgue entrance of the bomb shelter all id have to do is move them in and set them to detonate at the proper time he leaned toward anna the full weight of his personality radiating from his dark eyes can you get a car im almost certain i can she said looking back at him with a strange fascination greta thinks i have a lover in rostock a married man ive kept up that story so i can get the car sometimes without her asking questions ive used it three times before though usually with more notice tell her its a crisis hes trying to end it with you just a minute mcconnell interjected its the only way anna said i realize that but youre both overlooking a serious problem what is it stern asked impatiently to get the ss troops into that shelter we need an air raid why i can set off the siren myself the ss wont know if the raid is real or not theyll run straight into the gas mcconnell glanced at anna she did not look confident weve had only one air raid in the years ive been here she said and that was a false alarm all drills are scheduled also there are officers for every phase of the raid soldiers who man the alarm who fight fires who make sure each building is evacuated not including the prisoners of course theyre left exposed youre saying it wouldnt work asked stern im saying that if no bombs began to fall many soldiers would probably never go into the shelter i doubt very seriously whether the entrances would be closed unless bombs were actually falling you couldnt rely on it for gods sake stern muttered theres got to be a way there is said mcconnell a real air raid he tapped the tabletop with his fingers and i think we can get one brigadier smith knows the exact coordinates of totenhausen hes the one who started this whole thing the least that bastard can do is to send a handful of bombers over to help us finish the job all we need is a radio thats just what we dont have said stern mcshane cached one for us but its useless i dug up the parachute container on my way back from the camp to take out the climbing spikes and harness the container was cracked and half filled with water the parachute obviously didnt open properly our signal lamp for the submarine was dry but the radio was drowned and its vacuum tubes smashed stern leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling even if we get a radio he said a real air raid gives us another problem we can ask smith to schedule the raid at a precise time but theres no guarantee the bombers will arrive at that time you see i do said mcconnell theres no way to time the cylinders in the bomb shelter so that theyll detonate just after the bombs have fallen and kill the ss men whove run for cover right stern relaxed his neck so that his head hung limp over the chairback unless unless what stern straightened up and gave him an odd smile unless im waiting inside the shelter with the detonator in my hand what its the only way said stern ill wear one of the gas suits you brought from oxford youre certifiably nuts are you saying the suit and mask you designed wont protect me in a sealed room full of nerve gas i damn sure wont offer you any guarantee hell thats like playing russian roulette i rather like the idea stern said glancing at anna the simplicity of it and ill be there to watch all those ss bastards claw each others eyes out jesus whispered mcconnell youve got guts ill give you that its settled then which brings us back to the radio anna said softly stern smoothed back his dark hair and gave her an appraising look you have a radio dont you fräulein kaas she shook her head the nearest radio we can use belongs to the polish resistance the polish resistance is operating nearby no theyre in poland but the border is two hundred kilometers away youd need a radio just to contact them i can contact them herr stern but you will have to take my word for that why because as reckless as you are you might be captured i cannot expose others to that risk you think i would tell the ss anything anna regarded him with suspicion in her eyes there should be no question of your talking herr stern im sure the british provided you with a cyanide capsule they went to great lengths to provide me with one are you telling me you would not take your capsule if you were about to be captured they didnt give me a cyanide capsule said mcconnell not that i want one or anything anna cut her eyes at stern but he avoided her glance do you have one mcconnell asked him damn it stern snapped i want to know how youre getting word to these poles i must know if theres any real chance to get word to smith word will get through anna said with serene confidence i know smith has someone else inside that camp stern insisted i know the codes for this mission they were taken from that clark gable picture we are butler and wilkes you are melanie smiths base in sweden is atlanta and totenhausen is tara so tell me please who is scarlett anna said nothing you dont have to give me a name stern said just tell me the method of contact she sighed telephone all right someone will call them for me from the village i will say no more i knew it stern exulted major schörner is scarlett he is isnt he tell me i knew you didnt set up a link to london on your own anna went into the foyer and put on her overcoat think what you wish herr stern there is only a little darkness left i must be on my way anna arrived at totenhausen winded and nearly frozen through from her bicycle ride over the hills she had been rehearsing her excuse all the way i neglected to properly store some tissue samples in the lab the words were on her tongue as the guard stepped up and peered at her through the electrified wire but he just smiled and signaled for his comrade to open the gate she rode straight across the deserted appellplatz to the hospital and entered through the back door she made no attempt to move silently stealth would draw more attention than noise the hallway on the second floor was dark she felt her way along the wide corridor until she came to the door she wanted she tapped softly knowing it would be locked almost instantly a threatening whisper said whos there i have a gun pointed at you its anna open the door she heard a click the door was pulled back ariel weitz stood there in his shorts a pistol in his hand she walked past him into the room it was hardly more than a broom closet but it had hot and cold running water luxury compared to what the other inmates endured the smell of cigarettes and cheap schnapps hung in the air what are you doing here he demanded i need a crash meeting with who the wojiks and they must bring the radio you are crazy you want me to call them yes tonight right now i wont do it weitz shook his head with theatrical exaggeration you must do it everything depends on it his feral eyes suddenly lit up the commandos are here just make the call herr weitz how many they are going to attack the camp tell stan to meet me at the same place as before i cant weitz said stubbornly schörner will catch me i doubt that hes probably in bed with the jewish woman he gave her a sidelong glance you know about that i know many things why are you so anxious i thought you were the nerveless one its schörner hes changed he hardly drinks anymore always watching everything what do you expect after one of his men is found murdered and wrapped inside a british parachute that was bad youre right but i think its the jansen woman as much as the parachutes schörner has come alive he thinks hes in russia again anna summoned her most persuasive voice herr weitz everything you have done up to this point has led to this one moment everything is ready but nothing will happen if you dont get the wojiks to meet me tomorrow he hugged his hands to his chest like a mountaineer fighting hypothermia all right all right he said ill try youll do it as soon as i leave anna moved toward the door then looked back and herr weitz dont drink so much weitz nodded but his eyes were already far away im so tired he said his voice modulating into a feminine register everyone thinks im a monster even schörner my own people hate me worse than they hate the ss but that is what has allowed you to do what you have done yes but i just it cant go on i must explain make them see how it really is anna walked back and laid a hand on his bony shoulder she tried not to recoil from the feverish skin herr weitz she said softly god sees how it really is the bloodshot eyes opened wider the wojiks will be there tomorrow she said again midafternoon with the radio weitz closed his clammy hands around hers and squeezed theyll be there jonas stern leaned out of the back window of greta müllers black volkswagen and saluted a wehrmacht private as they passed through dettmannsdorf dont press your luck mcconnell snapped from behind the wheel stern laughed and leaned back inside he made a striking figure in the graygreen sd uniform and cap and he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself anna had planned to meet the polish partisans alone after feigning illness near the end of the days work shift but when stern heard that she intended to borrow greta müllers car for the journey he had insisted on going along i believe he had said in an arrogant voice that a young woman escorted by standartenführer of the sd will be much safer than a woman out driving alone anna had been unimpressed ultimately hed had to threaten to abandon the idea of saving the prisoners before she submitted while waiting in the cottage for her to get off from work mcconnell had decided to accompany them as well he saw no point in waiting for the ss to arrive at the cottage and inform him that his fellow spies had been caught and he was under arrest youre the big cheese hed told stern i can be your driver or something so that was how they played it mcconnell drove the car while anna and stern sat in back like privileged passengers the rendezvous was only ten miles from annas cottage in a small wood northeast of bad sülze as the vw rolled past the hamlet of kneese hof she told them they were halfway there they bypassed bad sülze proper by swinging south and crossing a small bridge over the recknitz river two kilometers of gravel road carried them onto a moor and to the edge of the wood pull into the trees anna instructed off the road mcconnell obeyed stern got out and looked around the car his schmeisser at the ready mcconnell followed carrying a bag containing bread cheese and his own schmeisser ill go ahead said anna stan is very careful ill talk to him first explain things before you come out in those uniforms hed shoot you down without a second thought but when they arrived at the meeting place no one was there stern and mcconnell crouched in the snow while anna walked into the middle of the clearing a half hour later a thin nervous young man walked out of the trees and began speaking to her he was unarmed and looked strangely familiar to mcconnell they spoke a full five minutes before anna motioned for stern and mcconnell to come out say something in english she told mcconnell hurry well fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty good enough she asked the thin pole the young man mulled it over stan already saw both of you she told stern he could have killed you any time im glad hes in a good mood today put your gun on the ground stern reluctantly obeyed they dont have their radio what they share it among three resistance groups but they can get to it by midnight tonight that gives brigadier smith less than twentyfour hours to set up the bombing raid stern said its going to be close mcconnell started as a giant of a man stepped from the trees less than twenty meters away he had a thick black beard and carried a world war one vintage boltaction rifle probably a mauser which he pointed right at sterns chest mcconnell didnt blame him stern looked every inch an officer of the sd co slychac stern said in a friendly voice the big mans face brightened pan mòwi po polsku stern switched to german a little i was born in rostock i knew some polish seamen the bearded man held out a meaty hand stanislaus wojik he said vigorously shaking sterns entire arm thats my brother miklos stan wojik looked like a man who had lived by his hands before becoming an amateur soldier but his brother miklos was almost a caricature of a starving artist a secondchair violinist in an orchestra of modest reputation hollow cheeks and large eyes as sincere as a childs mcconnell suddenly realized where he had seen the brothers before they were the two other members of the reception party that had met the moon plane on the night he and stern landed in germany he reached into his sack and took out a block of english cheese stan nodded thanks and tossed it to his brother stan speaks fair german anna said good said stern squarely facing the big pole i think i should hold my gun on you while we talk if someone comes up on us ill say youre both our prisoners we stopped to eat stan wojik shrugged and laid down his rifle stern picked up his schmeisser mcconnell noticed that stan wojik had a heavy meat cleaver hanging from a leather thong on his belt the big man patted it and laughed i used to be a butcher he said i still cut meat occasionally he grinned nazi sausage when i can get it stern laughed appreciatively then in a mixture of polish and german began explaining what they wanted stan wojik listened intently nodding during each pause mcconnell only followed about half of the exchange stern and the elder wojik ate cheese while they talked but miklos sat quietly beside anna his eyes hardly leaving her face when the conversation was finished stan turned to mcconnell and said in german you are american yes tell roosevelt we need more guns we need guns in warsaw but stalin wont give us any tell roosevelt with guns we can beat the nazis ourselves we arent afraid to fight mcconnell saw no point in trying to explain that the odds of him ever talking to fdr were slim to none ill tell him he said he was surprised when stern took a sheet of notepaper from an inside pocket and handed it to stan wojik the pole seemed surprised too mcconnell walked over to read it stern had handprinted a message in english followed by polish and german translations code atlanta freq request diversionary air raid very near but not on tara on at precisely hours raid absolutely essential to success butler and wilkes is this smart mcconnell asked what if hes caught stern shrugged if hes caught that note will be the least of our problems without that air raid in the right place and at the right time our plan wont work you said that yourself its worth the risk of him carrying the note to get the message right stan wojik nodded where do these men live mcconnell asked unable to curb his curiosity miklos laughed we are from a place called warsow on the polish border warsaw warsow stern corrected its a small village near the island of usedom thats where the peenemünde rocket complex was until the big bombing raid last august stan wojik understood enough of this to add much experiments still go on rockets fly all across poland airplanes without pilots very dangerous weapons is there still an ss garrison at peenemünde stern asked some ss yes they forced you out of warsow mcconnell inquired stan shrugged hard to fight the germans in towns you live in the forests now we live wherever london needs us move all the time the meeting was over anna gave the poles the rest of the food from mcconnells bag miklos thanked her effusively while stan greedily eyed sterns schmeisser on impulse mcconnell reached into his bag and took out his own schmeisser which he held out to stan and indicated through hand motions that he was willing to trade for the boltaction mauser and a box of cartridges stern started to object but then apparently thought better of it they made the trade as they were leaving stan wojik gestured at stern with his new submachine gun and said can you fool the germans in that uniform in a transformation that stunned mcconnell and anna more than the poles stern planted both feet wide apart on the ground squared his shoulders put his hands on his hips and barked several lightning commands at the wojiks in harsh german the big pole took a step back and laid his hand on the meat cleaver then he looked at mcconnell and laughed nervously i think maybe he does that too well careful he doesnt get to liking it stern relaxed and shook stan wojiks hand again your radio set has adequate range sweden is only a hundred and sixty kilometers across the water the pole grinned and thumped his broad chest if we dont get confirmation ill steal a boat and sail across myself youll get your bombs my friend farewell dowidzenia said stern as they drove back along the dettmannsdorf road stern said thats the kind of brave son of a bitch who wont survive this war hell never win a medal and hell die blindfolded and alone against some dirty brick wall shut up anna said from the backseat even if thats true theres no point in talking about it mcconnell had to agree they had no trouble getting back to annas cottage the trouble started after nightfall when mcconnell and stern tried to slip up into the hills to retrieve the two gas cylinders they needed to boobytrap the ss bomb shelter three times they had to drop to their bellies in the snow to avoid ss patrols with dogs the soldiers were working in pairs mostly on foot though one motorcycle with a sidecar had roared past on the narrow switchback road spewing a rooster tail of snow behind it before leaving the cottage stern had told mcconnell that their german uniforms would be enough to prevent anyone taking a close interest in them so far he had shown no inclination to test his theory when they finally reached the pylon where the cylinders hung mcconnell caught his breath in astonishment the two wooden support poles were as thick as oak trees and joined at the top by a heavy crossarm he could faintly see the outline of something hanging from one of the power lines but in the confusion of the treetops he couldnt be sure what he did not see how they could climb to that crossarm in the dark but stern lost no time proving the boasts he had made at achnacarry he quickly donned his climbing spikes then the gas mask mcconnell had persuaded him to wear though without the full body suit it was practically useless tied a long coil of rope to his belt and went up the pole like a chimpanzee forty seconds after he put metal to wood he was straddling the crossarm sixty feet above the ground mcconnell heard a few metallic clinks above him but nothing else after about fifteen minutes the first gas cylinder materialized out of the darkness above his head the camouflaged tank descended silently swinging in a gentle arc as stern lowered it with the heavy rope when mcconnell tried to stop the swinging to keep the protruding pressure triggers from striking the snow the cylinder knocked him to the ground seeing this stern tied off the rope at the crossarm and descended he had wisely disarmed the triggers before lowering the cylinder and the two of them let the tank down without serious incident by the time stern climbed the pole and repeated the process his muscles were cramping from overexertion youve got a big stain on your uniform mcconnell told him when he reached the ground the second time tar said stern pulling off his sweatsoaked gas mask the nurse will have to get it off are you ready i dont suppose we can drag these things not if you want to live until morning the tracks would lead the ss right to us what is it doctor what are you thinking mcconnell crouched beside one of the cylinders i was thinking we might be able to test the gas before the raid to see if it works or not then wed know whether the attack was even worth trying can we do that mcconnell lightly touched one of the pressure triggers then examined the cylinder head i dont think so not without losing the entire contents of a cylinder wed have to trip a trigger to get the cap off and after the cap is blown theres no stopping the gas what the hell said stern lets try it one cylinder should be enough to kill everybody in that bomb shelter youre missing the point if we empty one of these things and the gas works it could kill every living creature for a hundred yards around how long do you think it would take schörners patrols to discover that also the ss would hear the detonator go off and even wearing a suit i wouldnt want to be anywhere close when it blew its just too goddamn dangerous mcconnell stood up no dress rehearsal lets move mcshane said something about using carrying poles to move the cylinders stern said we can tie our toggle ropes between two long branches and cradle the tank like a body on a litter sounds good itll take two trips but itll be worth it it took a few minutes to find dead branches strong enough to take the weight but once they did the rest went quickly they moved with silent purpose through the trees each knowing that poor concentration could mean death for them both their spirits rose when new snow began to fall mercifully covering their tracks they buried the two cylinders in a copse near the winding hill road it would be a simple matter for anna to stop gretas vw there tomorrow night just long enough for stern and mcconnell to chain the tanks under the car on the way back to the cottage they kept off the road as much as possible they were moving down the dornow side of the hills when stern smelled the telltale odor that had given him early warning of danger so many times in his past cigarette smoke he reached out for mcconnells arm but felt nothing he dropped onto his belly without a sound a match flared in the darkness three meters ahead in the first second stern realized many things that they had blundered unawares onto a road cut that there were two ss men standing in the cut holding machine pistols in one hand and cigarettes in the other that their heads were at the level sterns knees had been before he dropped that mcconnell was too far away to warn without giving himself away he could only hope the american had smelled the smoke in time he hadnt by the time the match flared mcconnell was already at the edge of the road cut when he tensed his weight broke the ledge of packed snow and he halftumbled halfslid down into the road and crashed onto his stomach the ss men nearly pissed themselves with fright but they managed to throw down their cigarettes and aim their machine pistols at the groaning figure on the ground a german shepherd broke into furious barking seeing the dog stern simply ceased to exist in his own mind he possessed no mass made no motion he knew the slightest sound or faintest odor might draw the animals attention one of the ss men dragged mcconnell to his feet and shined a flashlight into his face the second man covered him with a machine pistol the ss uniform and captains rank badge confused them they didnt recognize mcconnell but they werent yet confident enough to treat him like a criminal the man with the flashlight began asking questions in rapidfire german while the shepherd growled menacingly mcconnell said nothing merely handed over his forged identity papers the man with the flashlight examined them closely four feet above them stern silently slipped his schmeisser off his shoulder and crept forward like a mink over the snow a fallen log stopped him he felt the heat of battle in his blood like a drug pounding through his heart and brain but for the snow he might have been in the desert again scouting against rommels troops it took tremendous restraint to keep from dropping into the road and shooting both ss men with a wild shriek he forced himself to think rationally if he killed the soldiers they would soon be missed major schörner would probably launch a massive manhunt stern would have no choice but to go immediately back up the hill and release the cylinders and then his father would die that was unacceptable but he had to do something mcconnells university german wouldnt fool the ss men for twenty seconds at least they had no radio he thought gratefully he considered stepping out of the woods bold as brass and playing the role of standartenführer ritter stern for all it was worth but even if he succeeded in fooling them the very least they would do was report his presence to major schörner more likely they would demand that he return to totenhausen with them when mcconnells frightened eyes glanced up to his hiding place stern realized he had a third option brigadier smiths option under no circumstances can we allow the good doctor to fall into enemy hands if it looks like hes going to be captured alive youre going to have to eliminate him that was an order but smith had given that order on the same night he told stern his father had been killed in totenhausen the lying bastard and yet the order was logically sound there was only one problem if he killed mcconnell who would then help him save his father the poles whispered a voice in his brain stan wojik would like nothing better than to add an ss garrison to his scorecard with a silent curse stern rose up above the log and sighted his schmeisser down on mcconnells chest he would wait until the soldiers forced the american to start marching down the road back to totenhausen then he would fire fire and run like hell he pressed his finger to the trigger it took all of mcconnells courage and concentration not to look up to where he knew stern must be all he could think of was randazzo the wop describing how david had been murdered by ss troops in a situation exactly like this one where the hell was stern why hadnt he marched out of the woods doing his sd impersonation the man with the flashlight jabbered something in a guttural voice then shoved mcconnell backward the only words he caught were who is doctor and peenemünde he opened his mouth to answer but no words came out the officer with the machine pistol stepped forward and jerked mcconnells walther from its holster los marsch the man shouted pointing in the direction of totenhausen mcconnell stole a last look in sterns direction then turned and started up the road he had walked about ten yards when the brrat of the silenced schmeisser split the darkness he felt a hammerlike blow between his shoulder blades then he was lying facedown in the snow unable to move he felt the german shepherds teeth tearing into the ss uniform teeth raking his shoulder brrrat went the schmeisser again he heard a thud then footsteps crunching rapidly up the road the dogs jaws snapped shut on his neck an explosive howl assaulted his eardrums he flipped over onto his back in time to see stern pin the german shepherd to the ground with his boot and fire a single shot into its mouth get up stern ordered now up in spite of the shock of it all mcconnell quickly worked out what had happened stern had shot one of the ss men first the startled shepherd had immediately pounced on mcconnell as it must have been trained to do stern then shot the second ss man ran up and kicked the dog off his back and killed it where the fuck were you mcconnell asked shut up snapped stern he was already dragging one of the dead ss men into the trees below the road spread snow over those bloodstains mcconnell obeyed so this is it he thought feeling his blood pounding in his ears this is action by the time he covered the stains stern had already piled both corpses and the dog out of sight in the trees what do we do now mcconnell asked dizzy with adrenaline someone must have heard something where do we hide the bodies shut up and let me think said stern we cant bury them dogs would find them too easily id like to throw them in the river but we wouldnt make it that far stern snapped his fingers sewers dornow must have a waste line running to the river you mean carry the bodies into the village the dog too theres probably an access hole near the edge of the village probably not too far from annas cottage ill scout it out you dont think bodies will be found in a sewer stern bent over to lift one of the corpses if they start to stink so what sewers stink anyway mcconnell grabbed his shoulder stern you saved my life i thanks just thanks thats all sterns eyes flashed in the darkness dont thank me too quickly doctor it was a near thing mcconnell wanted to ask what he meant but stern had already hoisted one corpse onto his shoulder and moved off under the trees mcconnell awoke from a dead sleep his heart pounding after their return from the dornow sewer stern had told him to sleep fully dressed now he knew why someone was pounding on a door above them stern had already scrambled to his feet and was checking the clip of his schmeisser the muted hammering reassured mcconnell it was not the cellar door being assaulted but that was small respite stern kicked him someones trying to get into the cottage mcconnell drew his walther and followed stern up the steps through a crack in the door they saw anna sweep into the kitchen wearing only a nightgown she glanced in their direction hesitated then went into the foyer to answer the knocking whos there she called fräulein kaas open the door stern moved into the kitchen and crouched behind the cabinets nearest the foyer mcconnell stayed on the cellar stairs but aimed his walther through the door nurse kaas open the door anna braced her back against the door and closed her eyes its quite late she shouted identify yourself mcconnell glanced at his watch just after midnight i am sturmmann heinz weber youre needed at the camp immediately major schörners orders anna glanced back into the kitchen then turned and opened the front door a tall lance corporal stood there his breath steaming in the cold what is the problem sturmmann i cannot say nurse you have a car nein a motorcycle with sidecar please you must hurry wait here i must put on some clothes hurry the sturmbannführer will have my head if were late late for what just hurry the soldier disappeared from the doorway anna hurried through the kitchen without any intention of stopping but mcconnell threw open the door and grabbed her arm dont go he said surprising himself as well as her she looked strangely at him i must go i have no choice stern pushed her toward her bedroom then shoved mcconnell back onto the cellar stairs and pulled the door shut after them when they reached the bottom he said what the hell was that about when mcconnell didnt answer stern poked him in the chest with the butt of his schmeisser like a striking snake mcconnell drove his open hand into sterns chest and slammed him up against the wall dont ever do that again he said stern was so stunned by this reaction that he merely watched the american climb back to the top of the stairs and sit down beside the door shell be all right he said shes managed this long without your help mcconnell glared down at him you dont know anything schörner and brandt could be planning to torture every nurse in that camp right now you dont know what those bastards are capable of and you do what do you know about it doctor youve spent the whole war hiding in england mcconnell descended the stairs and walked to the broken bookshelf near the far wall he pulled annas diary from behind the old account books and tossed it to stern thats what i know you ought to read it sometime it might even turn your stomach though you want everyone to believe thats impossible stern looked down at the diary oh its possible and i know exactly what those bastards are capable of theyve been doing their worst to my people for ten years remember mcconnell squatted on his haunches and stared at the floor do you think they found the bodies or maybe the cylinders not the bodies not that quickly maybe we should wait on top of the hill mcconnell said if it looks like the games up you could still send the cylinders down into the camp stern opened his mouth but did not speak mcconnells suggestion hung in the air like a challenge i mean if schörner is onto us mcconnell went on that would be our only chance to execute the mission are you telling me that youre willing to kill the prisoners now stern asked what else can we do forget it doctor were going to wait here and if they come for us if they come ill hold them off as long as i can you try to get around them and up the hill the climbing spikes and harness are in my bag you can send the gas down yourself stern looked as if he believed what he was saying but mcconnell knew better if the ss came for them here he would never reach the gas cylinders he probably wouldnt even make it out of the cottage stern had to know that so what was keeping him from going up the hill to be in position to release the gas if it became necessary something in his eyes kept mcconnell from voicing the question the front gate of totenhausen was wide open and waiting when the motorcycle carrying anna kaas reached the camp the lance corporal raced across the parade ground and the appellplatz and skidded to a stop before the hospital theyre waiting in the basement he said the morgue anna climbed out of the sidecar and walked up the hospital steps inside and to the left was the stairwell two flights led up one down she walked through the door and went down in designing totenhausens hospital klaus brandt had given special attention to the morgue for it was in this room that he did much of his work analyzing the pathologic effects of his gases and also of the meningococcus bacteria four autopsy tables stood in the center of the room which was dominated by a mirrorlike wall that housed a set of stainless steel drawers each of which could accommodate two adult male corpses or four children anna had a strong stomach but she nearly fainted when she reached the bottom of the stairs the autopsy table nearest her was bare but the second was occupied by a naked man that even from a distance she instantly recognized as stan wojik the poles black beard was matted with blood his battered head swollen his massive body covered with cuts and bruises jonas sterns prediction had already come true anna had seen enough corpses to know stan wojik was dead come in nurse called a voice from across the room major wolfgang schörner stepped out from behind a rack of metal shelves he was carrying a telephone in his left hand and speaking into the mouthpiece which he held in his right he waved anna farther into the room that is correct herr doktor he said two of sturms men are missing they never returned from patrol of course they could be lying drunk in one of the local villages but this time i dont think so anna knew she should try to listen to the conversation but it was difficult her eyes were drawn inexorably to the third autopsy table dont look yet said a voice in her head you cant stand it yet she forced herself to watch schörner he was pacing now carrying the phone with him on a long line beck still thinks the target is peenemünde he was saying but i am not so sure anymore im beginning to think the allies may know about our facility after all the poles were caught between here and peenemünde but that tells us nothing about their activities or their target only questioning will do that standartenführer beck is on his way down from peenemünde with a gestapo interrogator schörner listened for a while his face intense herr doktor i dont think you should bother yourself you know the gestapo yes i absolutely agree ill see that im present when they interrogate him ive brought in one of the nurses to make the man presentable yes gute nacht schörner put down the phone and signaled anna over she kept her eyes locked on his face she did not want to meet the eyes of the man lying on the third table i want this man cleaned up schörner said hes bruised a bit but do what you can there was no way to avoid it anna looked down miklos wojik stared up at her with the eyes of an animal caught in a steel trap when he recognized her he began to cry god forgive me anna thought desperately but dont let him say my name how bad is he schörner asked anna pulled back the sheet that covered the young poles body it wasnt nearly so bad as his brothers his emaciated chest was bruised and one wrist looked like it might be fractured but there were no cuts or burns she cleared her throat what happened to him sturmbannführer schörner looked down at miklos wojik with clinical detachment he is a polish partisan i would have preferred to question the other man myself but hauptscharführer sturm and his men apprehended them both sturm decided to question them on the spot as you can see he allowed his zeal to override his professionalism anna looked back at the body of stan wojik from this angle she noticed that his genital area was particularly bruised probably the result of repeated kicking it was easy to imagine sturm taking great pleasure in that she wondered how the hauptscharführer would have fared against stan wojik without armed storm troopers to back him up a gestapo agent will arrive shortly to interrogate this man schörner told her he is very annoyed that we have allowed one prisoner to expire prematurely i trust you will have this one looking decent by the time he arrives anna nodded ill do what i can sturmbannführer bitte schörner was staring into her eyes with almost priestlike intensity when the unmistakable crack of rifle fire echoed down the stairwell sturmbannführer anna cried what was that schörner had not moved a muscle another reprisal he said quietly hauptscharführer sturm believes there is more to the mystery of his lost patrol than whisky or easy women he has convinced brandt that shooting prisoners is the way to find out what theyre being shot against the hospital wall schörner made a disparaging sound as if a spy network could be run by the wretches in this camp whom did they kill this time anna asked schörners eyes narrowed you have an interest in particular prisoners no sturmbannführer i was merely curious i see i believe they shot five jewish women and five polish men he means to shoot ten prisoners every twentyfour hours anna knew by schörners calmness that rachel jansen had not been among the condemned but then she wondered perhaps that would be the easiest way to extricate himself from any future difficulties you are fraulein kaas schörner asked anna felt a sudden flush of panic yes sturmbannführer your sister is the wife of gauleiter hoffman yes sturmbannführer listen to me obviously any nurse could clean this prisoner i specifically called you here because i needed to speak with someone reliable someone at the center of things here but still outside you understand im not sure sturmbannführer let me be clear then if you had to pick someone from the camp staff who might be capable of treason who would it be annas voice was a whisper treason sturmbannführer yes someone in this camp is leaking information to either the polish resistance or the allies perhaps both and its certainly not a prisoner ive known for some time that there is an illegal radio transmitter operating in the area anna knew then that the whole thing was a wicked charade schörner was about to place her under arrest the gestapo man was on his way to interrogate her not miklos wojik do you know any of the lab technicians well schörner asked technicians no sturmbannführer see them in dornow in the tavern i do not socialize sturmbannführer a pity you are a beautiful woman what about your fellow nurses do you feel confident of their political loyalties anna could make no sense of her frantic thoughts what would be the clever thing to say what would jonas stern say schörner tapped the autopsy table he seemed wholly oblivious to miklos wojik are we the target he murmured the radio gauss the stolen car and now these poles he gave the table a final slap i must go to brandts office for a while nurse while im gone i want you to think about what i asked you i cant stand it anymore she thought ive got to get out of here sturmbannführer may i retrieve a medical bag from the surgery upstairs ill send a man for it please attend to this man immediately he hurried up the stairs anna went to the sink and wet a cloth then returned to mikloss side and laved his brow with warm water the young pole was crying again im sorry miklos she whispered what happened he shook his head hopelessly they killed stanislaus he croaked they hurt him first oh god damn them anna shut out her pity miklos did you send the message to sweden did you get to your radio no im sorry we didnt get more than ten miles the woods were full of ss they were everywhere as if they were looking for us they werent they were looking for someone else your friends the sergeant who killed stan kept asking about parachutes did they catch your friends not yet miklos what about the paper the paper the jew gave you stan got rid of it in time they didnt find it anna felt a flutter of hope are you positive he burned it just before they closed in miklos was breathing too fast stan fought them he kept on fighting so they shot him in the legs so they could beat him without him fighting and anna pressed her hand over his mouth dont think about it miklos breathe through your nose youre hyperventilating the pole caught her wrist in a desperate grip and pulled her hand away help me anna he begged you must help me she fought back tears it seemed that her fate was to stand at the side of the doomed and be unable to help them theres nothing i can do for you she said there is anna you must she heard heavy boots pounding down the stairs an ss private rushed into the room carrying a black medical bag he handed it to her then took up station at the foot of the stairs she leaned over mikloss face and began to wash his chest with the rag what can i do she whispered kill me said the pole in a voice no louder than a breath the color drained from annas face you must stan told them nothing but he was strong more tears rolled down mikloss cheeks i am not strong anna i am afraid i always was if they do to me what they did to stan i will talk i know it i cannot do what you ask whats he saying there called the ss guard anna straightened up hes out of his head i think he may have a concussion she leaned down again as if examining mikloss eyes the gestapo is coming said the pole theyre worse than the ss they use electricity i cannot do it suddenly miklos wojiks eyes focused with an intensity of pleading anna had never seen in her life not even in the eyes of the victims of brandts experiments i am a dead man he whispered nothing can change that but if you dont do what i ask you and your friends will be dead too an electric tingle raced across annas scalp and shoulders what miklos said was true if he talked they would all die she would be tortured how long could she hold her silence if sturm were allowed to do whatever he wished to her and if she somehow survived the ordeal there was always the ravensbrück camp for women she opened the black medical bag and scanned the neat rows of ampules and glass syringes lying in their fitted slots beneath elastic bands antiseptics local anesthetics sulfa drugs insulin was that the answer no it would take a massive overdose to kill and as his blood sugar plummeted miklos would experience cramps that would panic the guard there she reached into the bottom of the bag and palmed a vial of morphia then leaned down and put her head on miklos wojiks chest as if listening carefully guard she cried this man is having heart palpitations ill call a doctor the ss man volunteered starting toward the telephone schörner had been using no i need adrenaline immediately run to the pharmacy room and get some the guard shifted on his feet im not supposed to leave my post hell die without it the ss man nodded ill be right back anna selected a cc syringe and drew six cubic centimeters of morphia into the barrel she could not afford the time to tie a tourniquet to make a vein stand up nor could she use a superficial vein that might leave clear traces of a puncture her eyes searched mikloss naked body the poles groin area was badly bruised just as his brothers had been beneath one of those bruises inferior to the inguinal ligament ran the femoral vein it took experience to hit a deep vein blindly but anna had been forced to use the femoral dozens of times when unable to locate superficial veins on emaciated prisoners she pressed two fingers of her left hand hard into the flesh between mikloss penis and his right hip bone he groaned as she compressed the bruise but anna instantly felt a powerful pulse beating beneath her fingertips she glanced at the stairs then angled the needle just beyond her fingers and punctured the bruised skin and tissue when she drew back the plunger dark blood swirled in the barrel of the syringe with a silent prayer she closed her eyes and injected the entire contents of the syringe into the vein miklos lifted his head as she drew out the needle did you anna had not met his eyes since making her decision now she did they were closed boze he murmured god bless you anna how long soon may god forgive me for this terrible thing miklos opened his eyes again they were brown and very large i forgive you he said forcefully i forgive you now myself god sent you to me anna you are his angel and you dont even know it i suppose thats how it always is there was a clattering of boots as the private rushed back in and handed anna the adrenaline is he still alive yes danke i think perhaps it was merely a panic attack his heart is weak though he has reason to panic the guard muttered miklos closed his eyes so he would not to have to look at the ss man anna stood rigidly beside him as his breathing slowed after the guard returned to his post she walked around the table and held the young poles hand miklos squeezed back weakly after two minutes he lapsed into a coma she held his hand for another minute to be sure then let it go she had reached her limit hes sleeping she said to the guard ive done all i can for him he is presentable for interrogation she summoned her last reserve of courage tell wolfgang i will come again if he needs me but i need sleep now i am on duty tomorrow she pocketed the original ampule of adrenaline from the medical kit so at least that part of her story would hold up then moved toward the door she knew she should wait for schörner to return it would be madness to leave she should wait and calmly play the part of dumbfounded nurse while schörner apologized for the prisoners death to the gestapo man from peenemünde but she simply could not do it the private stepped into annas path as she neared the stairs but her professional manner and her use of schörners christian name intimidated him enough not to challenge her she marched past him up the stairs and out of the hospital with every step she felt as if she were condemning herself but she kept walking she kept walking until she had walked right out of totenhausens main gate seventeen minutes later miklos wojik died while anna was gone mcconnell and stern had sat in the cellar for an hour then had grown so anxious they came up to the kitchen and ate some moldy cheese in the darkness every minute or so stern would go to the front window to check the road for approaching vehicles they heard a motorcycle once but it turned out to be only an ss man headed into dornow when anna finally did arrive they never heard her coming she simply opened the door and stepped inside the dark foyer stern switched on the kitchen light she stood in the kitchen door her blond hair tangled and plastered to her cheeks her overcoat soaked through as if she had fallen a dozen times in the snow she shivered uncontrollably mcconnell jumped up and steadied her put on some coffee he told stern stern didnt move what happened he asked what did they want you for annas eyes seemed out of focus its over she mumbled what do you mean stern grabbed his schmeisser off the counter they know were here i dont know but schörner caught the wojiks oh god mcconnell murmured did you walk back here yes jesus schörner said stern schörner isnt scarlett anna shook her head well did they get the message to sweden no no no message no air raid no scheisse have the poles talked yet how long has schörner had them they havent talked anna said halfturning as mcconnell pulled off her wet overcoat how do you know stern pressed they cant what do you mean theyre dead yes both of them yes what about the note my note to smith stan got rid of it before they were taken how do you know that miklos told me you talked to them only miklos stan was already dead tortured tortured then how do you know he didnt talk anna finally focused on stern because miklos told me she said her nostrils flaring in anger and because i knew stan wojik he was tough tougher than you will ever be herr stern he hated the nazis he hated them so much he lived in the forest like an animal to fight them you think the jews are the only ones who have suffered in this war what about the other one stern asked undeterred the thin one he was tortured as well he didnt look so tough he was though tough enough to ask me to kill him mcconnell and stern looked at each other anna spoke without inflection certain now that events were beyond her power to change hauptscharführer sturm killed stan before they ever reached the camp a gestapo man from peenemünde was on his way to totenhausen to question miklos schörner told me to clean him up for questioning we were alone miklos told me he knew he would talk if they tortured him like they had stan he said he said he knew he was weak he asked you to kill him stern said yes anna touched her cheek as if to reassure herself she was really alive i refused at first but then i realized what it would mean if he talked you did it said mcconnell she nodded listlessly six ccs of morphia in the femoral vein mcconnell lifted his hand to comfort her but she drew back did you see him die stern asked i saw him go into coma stern turned to mcconnell would that kill him morphia a full grain in the femoral vein would almost certainly do it respiratory arrest then death how is it you are here then stern asked his voice harsh and relentless you killed a prisoner and they just let you walk out stop interrogating her said mcconnell you realize they could be outside right now stern moved quickly to the window you damn fool she could have led schörner right to us see anything mcconnell asked sarcastically its too dark i know i should have stayed anna said finally pushing her hair out of her eyes but i couldnt do it i might have gone mad right in front of schörner i told the guard that mikloss heart was weak that id done all i could do i told him schörner could send for me if he needed me again stupid stern muttered from the window blöd schörner is bound to send someone after you i dont care anna whispered i just dont care anymore youd better care or youll be dead but i dont dont you see i just killed a friend a boy really i murdered him no one should be asked to do that no one its war stern said flatly war anna started around the table toward him what do you know about war she asked mcconnell watched in amazement as the german nurse put both hands on sterns chest and shoved him backward against the sink what have you done she demanded talk thats what talk talk talk im sick of your talking if you think the ss are coming get your ass up that hill go on gas the whole camp kill all the prisoners i dont care i dare you to do it the blood drained out of annas face when she wobbled on her feet mcconnell reached out and pulled her to him she allowed it jonas he said softly i think weve reached the point where we may have to consider that what are you talking about what do you think im talking about stern turned back to the window and made as if he were watching the road but we agreed to try to save the prisoners youd better hurry anna said into mcconnells chest they shot ten more while i was there what stern whirled from the window and stared at her like a man steeling himself to take a bullet who did they shoot anna raised her head five jewish women and five polish men stern blinked several times his relief obvious but why did they shoot these people schörner knows something is going on at the camp at first he thought the parachutes and the rest of it had to do with peenemünde but not anymore on top of everything else they seem to have lost an ss patrol mcconnell raised his head and caught sterns eye anna laid her hand on his chest as if to thank him then straightened up and went to the sideboard and lit three short candles it was easy to forget that the electric light could draw unwanted attention schörner really called me to the camp so he could question me she said he thinks someone on the camp staff is a traitor either a nurse or a lab technician its sturm who is pressing for the execution of prisoners his way of rooting out the leak when anna went to the stove to brew a pot of the awful barley coffee mcconnell decided she was all right at least for the moment he turned one of the chairs around and sat with his forearms resting on its back the way the old guys did on porches back home listen stern he said quietly god knows i didnt come here to kill innocent people but the things ive learned since ive been here im starting to understand why the british tried this crazy bluff we tried to save the prisoners we did everything we could hell two good men died trying to help us but weve got to face facts now we failed we failed and theres nothing to do but go back to the original plan stern looked furtively around the kitchen i dont want to do that anymore what do you want to do run for the coast go for the sub and leave this nazi death machine ticking along like a swiss watch stern actually seemed to be considering this you want a sample of soman doctor i can get you one tonight ill walk right into that factory and draw off a canister myself get me one of the minicylinders out of your bag mcconnell turned up his palms in confusion what the hell is going on here stern you know that isnt the main objective of this mission were supposed to convince the germans that we have our own nerve gas and the will to use it stern dropped his schmeisser on the counter and sat down at the table do you have the will to use it doctor do you have the will to kill every man woman and child in that camp god help me i think i do mcconnell said thinking of annas diary until last night i dont think i really believed the nazis would use sarin or soman but now theres no doubt in my mind you think i like admitting smith is right hes a devious manipulative son of a bitch but given what i know now i believe this mission or one like it is probably the only chance of stopping the nazis from using sarin and soman whats turned you so bloodthirsty all of a sudden yesterday you were a goddamn pacifist whats in that diary anyway anna turned from the stove her eyes on mcconnell i showed it to him he confessed stern that diary describes something i never thought possible what the systematic murder of thousands of jews no thats bad enough but its been done before all through history in fact whats different about what the nazis are doing is that theyve put the doctors in charge theyve succeeded in inverting human values so completely that theyve transformed the healers into the chief killers stern made a wry face you think doctors killing people is somehow different than other men doing it yes a doctor is sworn to preserve life do no harm thats the first rule a doctor who murders is worse than a priest who murders popes and priests have presided over some of the worst carnage in history but intentional mass murder in the name of medicine ive never heard of it before hitlers propaganda machine has instilled a sort of biopolitical mentality in the german people hes convinced them that certain races yours for example are deadly bacilli that must be eradicated there is apparently a whole generation of german doctors that actually believes it is healing the body politic by killing millions of people you once lectured me about evil stern well im convinced okay if there is pure evil in the world the nazis have achieved it sterns laugh held bitter irony words he said youre an intellectual so you have to draw some grand meaning from everything what did i tell you the first time i saw you the nazis understand the true nature of man they deal with what is they took the lust for power and turned it into a religion and it works it could work anywhere doctor even in america ill bet some of your colleagues would line up for the chance to say who should live and who should die its fun playing god no it isnt stern you know that but im afraid weve got to do it tonight when stern did not respond mcconnell said hitler hasnt unleashed mans true nature hes taken such a huge leap into madness that even now no one has begun to grasp whats really going on but we know stern and that obligates us to try to do something about it but you said the british nerve gas wont even work it might work we have to try stern threw up his hands go ahead then you try i will if i have to why dont you tell me whats really going on here you came to germany ready to sacrifice yourself and anyone else to accomplish this mission now youre balking for the last two days youve been ready to believe the gas worked now youre not something changed last night jonas what was it what are you keeping from me youre crazy snapped stern he got up and started pacing the kitchen the muscles in his forearms taut as wires maybe i am mcconnell conceded but ill be less crazy if you just tell me why you wont go through with the attack tell him anna said from the stove or i will stern stopped dead and stared at her after a moment his eyes glazed with hatred you tell him and ill kill you you go to hell she shouted fearless in her anger or act like a man that would be better something seemed to go out of stern then hope maybe or the will to keep lying he closed his eyes and leaned back against the sideboard blocking the light from one of the candles how long have you known he asked annas voice softened the night you got here you said you were from rostock when i heard your real name i thought of the shoemaker just for an instant but you were so different different how what do you know about him well he repairs boots for the ss makes leather goods for them are you saying hes a collaborator no just that you seemed so different from him different enough that i dismissed the idea for a while but yesterday i saw him up close again then i knew what the hell are you two talking about mcconnell asked you know somebody in that camp my father stern said his voice almost inaudible my father is a prisoner in the camp okay hes been there for three years mcconnell looked at anna and saw the confirmation in her eyes jesus why didnt you tell me before now all you had to do stern held up a hand for silence i have discovered that im a coward doctor not a pleasant thing you were right i was ready to sacrifice them all then i found out my father was one of the prisoners and i couldnt do it its pathetic its human stern you are also right stern said to anna he and i are different but it is my duty to try to save him for my mother for yourself goddamn it said mcconnell why dont you just slip in and take him out tonight i have no doubt you could do it he wont come hes crazy he wont leave the others behind no one spoke for a while mcconnell stared at one of the candles going back over the situation yet again he blanked the people from his mind and tried to see it as a purely scientific problem from every possible angle no matter how unlikely three minutes later he felt the hair on his arms rise anna get me a pencil and paper he said hurry please what is it stern asked whats wrong nothing just be quiet for a minute mcconnell took the things from anna and began scratching numbers and letters on the paper stern walked around and peered over his shoulder what the hell is that daltons law of partial pressures you want to make a contribution or you want to be quiet stern scowled and moved away two minutes later mcconnell set down the pencil all right listen he said if youre willing to go back into that camp tonight we can save your father stern came back and stood over him how by doing what anna originally suggested moving the prisoners into the eblock before the attack its an insane risk for you for all of us really but well its your decision anna looked at him in confusion but all of the prisoners wont fit into the eblock thats right said mcconnell all of them wont but half of them will stern said softly its the only option stern that or run playing god anna said my father would never agree to be among the saved stern said almost to himself he would give up his place to a woman or child im afraid thats what its going to come down to mcconnell told him depending on who makes the final decision of course what do you mean how many people can fit in there anna said the chamber was three meters by three and two meters high he looked at her right she nodded after we talked about it i checked a test record to see if i was right i was thats eighteen cubic meters of total space mcconnell looked down at his sheet six hundred and fifty cubic feet to me you can squeeze a lot of bodies into that stern said especially underfed bodies mcconnell nodded patiently if it were merely a question of space but its not its a question of oxygen eighteen cubic meters of air wont support everyone we can fit in there not for long those movies youve seen where ten men get trapped in a sealed bank vault or a gold mine and spend two days trying to figure out a way to get out yes theyre so much scheisse okay think about it like this i tie a paper bag over your head thats all the air you have how long can you survive on that not very long right and thats all the eblock is a big paper bag only its made of steel youve got one hundred square feet of floor space that sounds big but believe me its not you could probably force a hundred malnourished women and children inside however every single body that goes in displaces a certain amount of air from the chamber reducing the available oxygen damn it how many people can survive in there that depends on who goes in mcconnell picked up his pencil how does the inmate population break down there are six barracks buildings anna said two for men two for women two for children there are two for each because the jews are separated from the other prisoners privileged as usual stern muttered normally there would be fifty persons in each barracks anna went on totalling three hundred but brandt has had trouble replenishing the ranks the jewish mens block has less than fifteen men in it both childrens barracks are nearly full and the jewish womens block just under that the christian womens block is under quota after the reprisals the total camp population is probably about two hundred and twenty i counted fortyeight women in the jewish womens block stern said but theyve shot five since then mcconnell picked up his pencil and began scratching again figure for fortyfive women and fifty children stern said we could fit that many inside physically i mean mcconnell looked up i know what youre telling me just give me a minute please these are big numbers total milliliters of air oxygen percentages total and consumed thats per kilogram per minute a pediatric figure christ mmm okay ive got it how many mcconnell set down his pencil assuming fortyfive women and fifty children the available oxygen would last one hundred and two minutes thats only a guess but its a solid guess one hour and fortytwo minutes anna said is that long enough frankly i dont think so smiths scientists planned this attack with only eight cylinders that suggests a gas on the order of sarin which im certain it was copied from if the british gas works lethal amounts could persist for as long as four hours maybe even longer four hours is too long said stern ss reinforcements could arrive from somewhere else mcconnell considered this factor ss reinforcements could be as deadly as sarin if they werent killed by the gas we must pare the numbers down to allow for two hours of oxygen no less numbers stern echoed youre talking about people i know that mcconnell said evenly the one hundred and twentyfive i already excluded from the equation are people too theyre just not jews for once stern did not lose his selfcontrol when faced with an unpalatable truth whats wrong with the fucking nazis all of a sudden he grumbled they usually build everything twice as big as anyone else the gases brandt tests in the eblock are the most toxic in the world anna explained sometimes they run several tests in a day the eblock was designed small enough to be cleaned thoroughly and quickly with steam and detergents the whole process is automated its just a bigger version of the bubble back in my lab said mcconnell bubble i remember said stern except you use rats they use people so tell me how many people can survive for two hours in brandts bubble you want to save all the children or all the women my god anna whispered you have no right to do this youre right mcconnell agreed but i am doing it kinder said stern save the children but the children must have someone to take care of them when they come out anna argued women use more air said stern therell be enough women left to take care of the children take out women mcconnell carefully recalculated his equation if you took out ten women he said the oxygen would last one hundred and nineteen minutes almost exactly two hours if you want my opinion id take out twenty women its horrible i know but by trying to save too many we could kill them all wait anna cut in what about an oxygen bottle mcconnells eyebrows went up oxygen bottle depending on the type it could make a significant difference there are several large tanks in the factory in case of accidents i cant get access to those but in the hospital we have two portable bottles i dont know the exact amount of oxygen in them but i think i could steal one the other is being used on a pneumonia case an ss private it would be missed immediately stern was nodding excitedly at least that would let us save all the women yes maybe even the few men mcconnell held up his hand theres another concern here these time limits im giving you are for total oxygen depletion that means death before that there would be episodes of hysteria fainting possibly some violence youre talking about terrified women and children packed inside a sealed chamber probably without lights they could be tearing out each others eyes after an hour trampling the children god knows what you understand youre saying dont increase the numbers at all im saying we should count that oxygen bottle as a reserve theres no guarantee we can even get it into the eblock on top of that these people may have to stay inside the chamber three or four hours before its safe to come out stern nodded in resignation can we even get the eblock open mcconnell asked its always open anna said who would want to go inside it point taken okay jonas i think you should go back in right now tonight youve got about three hours of darkness left talk to your father explain the situation tell him to start slipping people into the eblock just before dawn thats when well attack stern laughed doctor you may know chemistry but you know nothing about military tactics he sat down at the table and picked up mcconnells pencil what do you think is going to happen after this attack of ours where are these women and children going to go where were they going to go if we saved them all this isnt hollywood stern we can give those people a fighting chance thats more than what they have now maybe they can make a run for poland try to reach the resistance you obviously dont know that half the polish resistance groups will kill a jew as quickly as a nazi will goddamn it stern no youre right doctor theyll have to try for poland but they cant do that in the daylight women and children in stolen ss trucks crossing fifty miles of nazi germany by day youre crazy i dont fancy trying to find our british submarine in the daylight myself also if i sneak back into the camp tonight which might not be so easy considering what fräulein kaas just did there ive got damn little time to convince my father or those women to condemn their friends to death then sneak out of the camp up the hill and send down the gas stern tossed the pencil on the table no its got to be tomorrow night he turned to anna what time is the final roll call seven pm then well attack at eight the confusion will be much greater for the ss at night and well have hours of darkness to escape you realize that tomorrow night will be the fourth night weve been here mcconnell reminded him if we dont make it to the submarine by dawn the next day it wont be there well make it and what about the gas it could be degrading into harmless chemicals right now and the reprisals what if they shoot ten more people tomorrow what about your stern slapped the table shut up goddamn you ive made my decision if youd ever seen unarmed people hunted down by troops in the daylight youd know why mcconnell hesitated but reluctantly nodded his assent well just have to pray schörner doesnt close the net on us by tomorrow night he said but what about anna she cant go back into totenhausen after what she did tonight anna closed her eyes if i dont theyll know somethings wrong they already know they must you killed miklos and kept them from interrogating him maybe they dont know that said stern the ss had already roughed him up she told the guard wojiks heart was weak maybe they think he just died ive also got to get that oxygen bottle into the eblock anna reminded them mcconnell started to argue further but she cut him off by asking stern a question do you think your father will consent to go into the eblock with the way the numbers have worked out i very much doubt it stern stood up and leaned against the stove for warmth you must persuade him perhaps he would agree to lead the women and children to poland he might ive got all day tomorrow to think of something stern snapped his fingers there is one thing i can do tonight though he walked around the table and disappeared through the cellar door anna took mcconnells hand under the table and squeezed it you are a strange man she said stern came back up the stairs carrying his leather bag whats that for asked mcconnell the two cylinders we were going to put in the ss bomb shelter if were going back to the original plan we need every ounce of gas we can get for the attack yes im going to drag those two cylinders as close as possible to the camp fence with the plastic explosive and time pencil fuses from achnacarry i can set charges on the cylinder heads and time them to coincide with the attack eight oclock i completely forgot said mcconnell feeling like an idiot youre right were going to need the highest saturation we can get at ground level ill come with you anna squeezed his hand painfully under the table no point in both of us risking capture said stern slinging the strap of the bag over his shoulder i can drag the cylinders myself mcconnell thought about it then acquiesced just dont get caught he said i couldnt climb that pylon in a week stern grinned surprising both anna and mcconnell you could if you had to doctor but dont worry about it were due some good luck he picked up his schmeisser and moved toward the foyer at the door he looked back and caught mcconnells eye beckoning him to follow what is it mcconnell asked pulling the front door closed after them the ss may come for her stern said frankly it worries me that they havent come yet what are you saying im saying you should wait for me in the cellar she should stay upstairs if they come and she goes with them voluntarily they might not search the house im not an idiot stern i know that but you her im not blind all im saying is that now is not the time it irritated mcconnell that stern had seen through him so easily there may not be any other time he said stern shrugged do what you have to but if they do come here and they dont find you take the spikes from the cellar climb the hill and go up that pylon when you get to the top tie yourself on with your toggle rope and wait for me as long as you can he laughed mcshane was right about those ropes after all wasnt he anyway youll be in the treetops but youll be able to see the camp road if it looks like schörners men are coming up the hill for you send down the gas its set up so a child could do it after youve done it forget about me forget about her and try to reach the coast you just might get out alive mcconnell was shaking his head but stern said if it comes to that point doctor she and i are dead already stern held out his hand for the first time since mcconnell had known him mcconnell took it its less than twentyfour hours stern said squeezing his hand what can happen in a day hes gone mcconnell said shutting the door against the cold what did he say anna asked from the table without sterns manic energy there to distract him mcconnell noticed for the first time the tremendous toll all of it was taking on anna her skin especially around the eyes had completely lost the pallor of that first night and taken on the shiny darkness of overripe fruit hes setting the two cylinders for eight tomorrow night hell send the rest down at the same time he said i should wait for him in the cellar and you should wait upstairs she looked surprised i assumed he would tell you to wait on the hill in case he was caught and you had to carry out the attack tonight he doesnt plan on getting caught what do you think mcconnell sat down opposite her to tell you the truth i dont even know if i could climb the pylon they didnt train me for that you have to climb it to release the gas according to stern i could go with you anna suggested help you theres no reason for me to stay here there no reason for you to risk going with me besides you you look done in you really should try to sleep anna folded her arms together as if she were cold i cannot sleep i am exhausted but i dont want to drop off schörner could send someone for me at any moment mcconnell weighed the dangers of remaining at the cottage against trying to reach the pylon on the hill anna has anyone suspected you before now i dont think so but it wont take schörner long to put it together she brushed her hair back from her face if they come for me if sergeant sturm comes for me i think i would kill myself rather than be taken mcconnell looked into her eyes she was not only exhausted she was absolutely terrified he felt stupid for not seeing it earlier and she meant what she said about suicide look im not leaving you behind he said im taking you out with us stern said the british wouldnt let you take anyone out mcconnell tensed at the sound of an engine on the dornow road but the vehicle didnt turn into the lane that led to the cottage how long have you been helping soe he asked six or seven months to hell with what the british say im taking you out smith owes you that she kept looking at him in her eyes he sensed or hoped he sensed some flicker of hope for herself he could tell that she had been forcing herself not to think about what would happen after the attack but now he had offered her a chance and he saw that she wanted it what about the hill she asked to hell with it id rather wait here in the cellar he slid his hand across the table with you she lowered her eyes but did not take his hand stern told me youre married i am why didnt you tell me last night i dont know you didnt ask she looked up at him again what is it you want doctor you i know you want me why do you want me he searched for some reasonable answer but could not find one is it because you might die tomorrow or even tonight he considered this i dont think so why then because i love you love me annas lips curled with a trace of irony you dont even know me i know you youre mad no argument dont say you love me doctor not to persuade me to give my body to you you dont have to say that i dont say it easily youre the second woman ive said that to in my entire life her eyes searched his face for deception i know a lot of men say it mcconnell went on just for that reason its the easiest way to get a woman to let you have your way with her im sure and you say it now his eyes didnt waver yes you have a wife yes you dont love her i do love her but she isnt here to comfort you and i am mcconnell watched the way her eyes changed when she talked they seemed as much a part of her communication as her words amplifying each question or statement with fine yet uncertain shades of meaning she hasnt been in england to comfort me for the past four years either he said i made it fine without any comfort there were temptations there in england enough but you ignored them you were noble trying to be i guess but you are not feeling noble now he sighed wearily look is this a test or what i certainly dont feel noble about this i feel like ive been dropped straight into hell or the closest thing to it a week ago i was a pacifist and a loyal husband tonight im planning mass murder and contemplating adultery he laughed then rather strangely maybe im working my way up in stages first adultery then a little assault and battery to get warmed up then ill go for the really big time poison gas stop it she said look lets just forget it he stood up maybe we should go up the hill what is your wifes name doctor what what is your wifes name susan you have children with her no none yet anna stood up slowly her left hand went to the button at her throat she unfastened it and moved to the next button then she said deliberately with all humility i ask susans forgiveness for what i am about to do he watched the white blouse open revealing scalloped collarbones then her breasts why are you saying that she dropped the blouse from her shoulders because she is your wife because she is here with us now and theres no use pretending she isnt anna unfastened her skirt it brushed the floor with a soft rustle she took a step forward he could see the pulse at the base of her throat i wont be ashamed for this later she said her voice trembling in spite of what we are about to do this is what it is but i refuse to be ashamed he held his hands in front of him as if to stop her are you sure you want this yes because you might die tomorrow partly he winced in spite of the impossibility of it all he had hoped for something more is it because of franz perlman the man you loved a faint smile touched her lips no thats past she reached out and laid a finger on mcconnells lips he pulled her to him and kissed her mouth he felt a sudden heat across the back of his neck and his heart beat in quick irregular bursts she molded her body against his withholding nothing hurry she said schörner could come at any moment he backed toward her bedroom kissing her and pulling her with him while she worked at the buttons of his shirt after four years of selfdenial the mere touch of her skin the pressure of her breasts as she drew breath against him made him flush with heat at the edge of the bed anna reached down still kissing him and pulled back the heavy duvet zeigs mir she said show me how you love me as she opened to him he had a sense of collapsing into her of leaving behind more than the terror and uncertainty of the past three days show me how you love me she had said but what he heard was show me we are still alive so he did yet even deep within her in the sweat and the groans and the moments of oblivion he could not escape the feeling that they were making love in the shadow of a great darkness pressing toward each other with the desperation of the condemned jonas stern lay facedown in the snow on the east side of totenhausen just ten meters from the electric fence his leather bag lay beside him the darkness and the trees gave him cover from the watchtowers but the dog kennels stood just on the other side of the fence he held his breath while an ss man led a muzzled shepherd along the inside of the wire he had already buried the two gas cylinders in the snow in shallow trenches dug at an upward angle perpendicular to the fence leaving only the cylinder heads exposed hed molded the plastic explosive around the seams where the cylinder heads joined the tanks all that remained was to prime and arm the plastic with time pencil fuses if he did it right at the instant of detonation the steel heads would be blown away from the tanks allowing the pressurized nerve gas to spurt through the fence and saturate the area of the dog kennels and the ss barracks the cylinders werent the problem the problem was the patrols crossing the hills from the cottage to the camp stern had felt as if an entire ss division had descended on the area it had taken him over two hours to get from the cottage to the camp fence and he had twice nearly stumbled into patrols the two missing ss men had generated even more of a response than hed expected lying in the snow beside the buried cylinders he tried to decide what to do next in his experience military patrols no matter what army they served reached their lowest effectiveness in the hour before dawn sometimes it was better to wait them out he had done it before and it looked like the best course of action tonight he would not let schörner catch him because of impatience the case hed stolen from achnacarry held a selection of time pencil fuses giving him great flexibility in delay times even if he waited here until dawn he could still set the cylinders to blow at eight tomorrow night thinking of colonel vaughan discovering the missing ordnance at achnacarry made him want to laugh but he didnt he heard the crunch of boot heels and the panting of another dog klaus brandt sat alone in his office in the hospital the dim bulb of his desk lamp providing the only light absolutely reichsführer he said into the black telephone and the sooner the better the raubhammer gas suits were my only worry and they have arrived i shall test them tomorrow i have a surprise for you brandt himmler replied you must have wondered why i have always demanded schematic plans of all your equipment as well as detailed updates on your new processes brandt rolled his eyes i must confess some curiosity reichsführer you will be gratified to learn that for the past year i have had teams of russian laborers carving a massive factory out of the rock beneath the harz mountains if the raubhammer test goes as planned as i have no doubt it will you will begin directing mass production of soman four at that factory in five days time brandt drummed his fingers on his desk if himmler had offered anything less he would have been insulted reichsführer i do not know what to say say nothing the only thanks i require will be the maximum possible output of soman from that day until the day the allies invade france well show speer what the ss can accomplish you have my word reichsführer but what of my work here my laboratory equipment and staff my hospital himmler made a clucking sound over the phone forget that little workshop brandt at the harz factory you will have everything you need but with twenty times the capacity you will of course bring your technicians with you i have already arranged to have totenhausen converted into a poultry processing plant i see brandt was taken aback by this and my test subjects you mean your prisoners if your work is done liquidate them we must have absolute secrecy brandt lifted a pen and doodled on the notepad on his desk perhaps i should wait until the raubhammer demonstration is completed just to be sure there was a chilly silence from berlin you have doubts about the demonstration herr doktor brandt cleared his throat cursing himself mentally for his overcautiousness none whatever reichsführer i shall begin dismantling the laboratory tomorrow and your prisoners nothing will remain fifty meters away from klaus brandt major wolfgang schörner poured a glass of brandy and sat on his sofa ariel weitz had only just delivered rachel to his quarters as tonights work had kept him much longer than usual it had been a messy business but now he could relax rachel nodded once to him then moved toward the sofa her fingers automatically lifting her shift over her head schörner rose quickly and pulled the garment back into place wait a moment he said i have something to tell you something you will very much want to hear he led her gently to the wing chair she sat with her hands folded on her lap and waited have you ever heard of eindeutschung schörner asked rachel shook her head eindeutschung is a program for the reclamation of nordicgermanic racial elements from the occupied eastern territories in this program children between two and six years of age who exhibit nordic traits as yours do especially the boy are taken into one of the lebensborn homes today i am happy to say i was able to obtain a promise that space could be made available for your children at the home in steinhöring rachels pulse quickened what is a lebensborn home sturmbannführer ah i forget you have been isolated lebensborn is the fount of life society it was established by reichsführer himmler to assist unwed mothers of pure racial stock in delivering and raising their children the facilities are models of cleanliness and these homes they accept children of parents who are not of pure racial stock they do yes its a matter of biological selection but i have already vouched for your children the senior man at steinhöring is a friend of my father i see rachel thought for a moment what happens to these children after they reach the age of six oh they are adopted long before then the demand far exceeds the supply the demand who demands them why good german families of course frequently families of childless ss officers rachel closed her eyes schörner could not contain his excitement i dont know why i didnt think of it sooner its the perfect solution they would be raised as nazis schörner looked put out as germans rachel is that so terrible i would never see them again a strange smile played over schörners lips children are not the only ones taken into the eindeutschung program liebling rachel cringed at the intimate word her relationship with schörner had been nothing like shed expected rather than simply using her for sexual relief he seemed intent on creating some grotesque parody of domesticity what are you saying she asked trying not to trust the glimmer of excitement she felt i could go with my children schörners smile disappeared that would not be possible however all is not lost i shall be reassigned very soon my parents are still alive in cologne i believe it might be possible for me to take you there and have you employed by them as a servant as part of eindeutschung but i am a jew sturmbannführer stop saying that papers are easily enough had especially in the current situation do you want to survive or dont you rachel stared at him in wonder it was a measure of the gulf between them that schörner could sit there and offer what he thought was salvation while she saw only grief and pain sturmbannführer i do not consider life without my children worth living exasperation flared in schörners voice they would be given the best of care in a lebensborn home until they were adopted by an ss family of course he forced himself to calm down listen who knows perhaps after the war we you could locate the adopting parents and convince them to even schörner fell silent at this ridiculous fantasy rachel he said firmly my ability to protect your children at this point is negligible you must decide soon the alternative is what must i say it brandts work here is nearly done after that i cannot tell you more i cannot decide this i must have time to think but your children would survive isnt that what you want yes cried a voice in her mind the war will be over before long and the nazis will lose you could find them you could tell every woman in the circle what you are doing so that after the war people would know you were telling the truth perhaps you could even mark the children in some way give them a small scar to help prove they were yours after the war they would probably have forgotten you of course and they might have changed a bit under the influence of ss parents but rachel leapt to her feet she was too torn even to make sense of her own thoughts do you require anything further of me sturmbannführer schörner moved toward her then stopped himself no you may go but think about what i told you these are desperate times rachel we must not close our minds to radical solutions she stared at him for a long time then she turned walked to the door and knocked for ariel weitz anna swept back her hair from the dampness at her neck she was lying naked beneath the duvet she had brought to the cellar from upstairs two pale candles on the floor gave the only light mcconnell lay on his back with her head in the crook of his arm it will be dawn soon she said maybe we should go up the hill if schörner catches stern we wont get another chance to carry out the attack mcconnell pulled her closer dont worry about that why not because even if those bastards caught stern which they wont they couldnt make him talk not in a week that nut would slash his own throat with a broken bottle before hed talk just to spite them she laughed softly in the darkness why dont you try to sleep he said ill watch over you i cannot sleep she said the way this has all happened you and me the wojiks being caught what we must do tomorrow i cant force it out of my mind long enough to sleep and it will all be over soon enough in any case mcconnell turned and looked into her eyes do you think stern came here with orders to kill me he asked giving voice to his suspicion for the first time if i was captured i mean annas face grew somber i think he did yes the cyanide capsule right yes they always give one especially to someone like you who is valuable because of what they know i guess they were afraid you wouldnt take the capsule if you were captured he rose up on one elbow but i was captured anna last night stern told me not to tell you the point is he didnt kill me he could have easily but he didnt he killed two ss men instead she stiffened the missing patrol stern killed them yes ach where are the bodies the sewer in dornow my god schörner is bound to find them before tomorrow night mcconnell took a deep breath maybe but its odd isnt it about stern disobeying his orders i mean no he likes you mcconnell laughed he doesnt like me perhaps like is the wrong word he respects you you are something he can never be whats that innocent naive full of hope she pulled the duvet up to her chin american i dont feel very naive and ive got damn little hope if you want to know the truth anna turned under the covers and pulled him close its mad anyway you know why didnt the allies just bomb totenhausen to rubble because bombing it flat wouldnt change anything in himmlers head feeling the moist heat of her skin he turned and rolled her on top of him she shifted only slightly and he was inside again looking up into her eyes who thought up this mission she asked refusing to move one of churchills men mcconnell put his hands on her thighs and tried to gently rock her she used her weight to stop him churchill is behind this plan ultimately yes i saw him he gave me a note absolving me of guilt for the people who would die on this mission like he was the pope or something anna she sat up and flattened her palms on his chest he watched her abdominal muscles contract as she slid slowly forward and back her eyes never leaving his face do you know what im going to do if i get out she said you are going to get out well if i do im going to become a doctor a childrens doctor its the only way i could ever live with the things i have seen brandt do to them mcconnell didnt want to think about any of it he pressed harder and watched her eyes as she moved above him she seemed about to speak but instead she leaned down and pushed her arms beneath his back crushing her breasts between them she buried her face in the hollow of his neck she was physically very strong he realized strong enough that her arms around his back almost stopped his breathing as she clung fiercely to him and as badly as hed wanted her he sensed an intensity in her that dwarfed his own how had she survived this long living on a knifeedge between the mundane and madness pretending to be unmoved by things that would sicken a coroner holding her silence praying for the day when she could somehow strike back anna caught her breath and rose above him again her nails digging into his arms she had held back a great deal of herself upstairs she had opened just enough to allow him in offering herself as a refuge and he had taken her but now she had forgotten him or at least the surface of him what did she feel he wondered what did she see with her eyes shut tight and her face suffused with hot blood the shade of franz perlman the jewish doctor murdered in berlin or was she like some desperate swimmer in a dark ocean glimpsing a faint and distant light that promised hope and life if only she could reach it mcconnell made himself believe that that he was that light that he could get her out of germany alive that he could get them both out but when she cried out her fingers tangled in his hair her hips thrashing against his own he heard only the anguished sound of someone whose light has disappeared raus shouted a male voice raus get up mcconnell jerked awake and grabbed for his pistol anna had beaten him to it she was sitting up with her breasts uncovered and the gun pointed straight at jonas sterns chest you think thats funny she said put that thing down stern snapped get up and get dressed its light outside her face went white morning what time is it eightthirty the cylinders are armed and buried by the dog kennels they will detonate automatically at eight tonight anna threw off the covers and began pulling on her clothes mcconnell noticed that stern didnt look away while she did it wait he said she had her blouse on and was buttoning her skirt i cant im late already anna christ you cant go back there shes got to stern said we settled this last night bullshit mcconnell stood up and pulled on his shorts then took hold of annas arm schörner might be sitting there waiting for you what the hell did he tell that gestapo man last night when he arrived to question wojik i dont know anna said fastening a belt around her waist but if i dont go theyll come for me here and youll both be killed besides ive got to put the oxygen bottle in the eblock anna that bottle wont make enough difference to please stop she took his hand unless the worst has already happened ill be back long before eight she stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the mouth ill be all right keep your head down today you too herr stern im counting on you to get me out of this country stern looked from her to mcconnell what is she talking about anna smiled at him then hurried up the cellar stairs she didnt look back when she went through the door what the hell was she talking about stern asked again mcconnell pulled on the gray trousers of his ss uniform im taking her out with me you have a problem with that stern shrugged thats between you and the royal navy doctor your wife might have something to say about it though go to hell anna knew something was wrong as soon as her bicycle coasted out of the heavy trees and onto the drive leading to totenhausens main gate not only had the gate guard been doubled but even with the pale winter sun lighting the hillside and the river the men in the watchtowers were probing the shadows beneath the trees on the perimeter with their spotlights when anna stopped at the gate the guards exchanged odd glances but did not detain her why should they she was riding straight into the lions jaws shed decided that if major schörner confronted her her first line of defense would be that she had merely followed orders he had asked her to clean the patient not sit by him all night and she had done that shed left the patient sleeping and in reasonably good shape if pressed further she would allow some anger to come through after all she was a civilian nurse not an ss auxiliary medical research was one thing torture another was it a crime to possess a weak stomach she turned left to pedal around the cinema annex activity in the camp seemed normal enough except for the extra guards and the lights she saw no sign of ss vehicles from peenemünde perhaps colonel beck and his gestapo torturer had already come and gone perhaps all was well after all she held that thought until she rounded the corner of the cinema a naked woman was hanging from the punishment tree hanging by her hands which had been tied behind her back so that when she was hoisted up her shoulders would be dislocated the womans torso was bloody her legs dark purple for a moment anna thought sergeant sturm had finally managed to kill rachel jansen but as she pedaled on toward the hospital she saw that it was not rachel this woman had blond hair it only appeared dark because of the matted blood please god no anna whispered as she stopped at the hospital steps the dead woman was greta müller the young nurses hands were tied behind her back and she swayed gently from the rope that held her to the bar anna knew she should not look too closely but she could not look away someone had hung a large paper circle around gretas neck a target a target for a firing party most of the circle and gretas chest had been shot away every instinct told anna to run to turn around and pedal out of the camp as fast as she could but where could she run to schörner might be watching her at this very moment she knew she should enter the hospital but her legs had stopped moving gretas body told a long and terrible story the bruises showed where the questions had started a series of burns traversed the length of her left arm more serious queries ragged wounds on her thighs revealed that sturm and his dogs had taken a turn before the end why greta anna asked her voice almost a childs whimper she looked across the appellplatz she knew that if she saw schörner or sturm or brandt then she would scream why her you stupid animals i am the traitor i am the spy she was actually speaking aloud when someone opened the hospital door and snarled get inside you stupid cow ariel weitz stood in the hospital doorway his ratlike face white with fear stop gaping at her get to work when anna did not obey weitz reached out and jerked her into the building he pulled her down the righthand corridor and into an empty examining room get hold of yourself he said shaking her by the shoulders youre signing your death warrant if you cant act normally mine too i dont understand anna wailed what happened what do you think they tortured her all night then shot her but why she didnt do anything weitzs face twisted in savage anger what did you think would happen after you ran out of here last night you left your post and that stupid pole died schörner wanted blood i thought sturm was bad my god when schörner loses control but why greta weitz threw up his hands why because schörner was raving about security and treason and god knows what he didnt believe miklos died naturally but why didnt he come for me it would have been you weitz ground his teeth schörner was ready to send sturm after you i knew if they interrogated you all would be lost i didnt have any choice i had to give them someone else anna stared at him what do you mean i told schörner i saw little greta slip into the morgue before you got there i suggested that she might have done something to kill him you didnt i did weitzs eyes danced with maniacal light i told him id seen her before in dornow too talking to suspicious characters poles probably i told him a dozen lies all to save you but greta didnt know anything why did they kill her youre such a little fool they thought she did know something they tortured her until she was useless and then shot her as an example anna felt her legs go out from under her weitz managed to shove her backward so that she collapsed onto a doctors stool i cant do it anymore she moaned nothing is worth this im just glad miklos died weitz said he would have told them everything i would have killed him myself if id had the chance tell me what time are they attacking the camp anna raised her hands to her face tears of hysteria welled in her eyes and a scream gathered in her throat only hours ago she had glimpsed a chance at a life beyond this place some light of sanity beyond madness but it had been an illusion by leaving last night she had doomed her friend to unspeakable torture what time weitz pressed anna squeezed her shaking hands into fists only anger could bring her through now she thought of the day franz perlman had been murdered by the ss in berlin eight oclock tonight she whispered weitz nodded good good i want to be ready how many men no men what there wont be any men no men but how my god theyre going to bomb us from the air no no what then gas gas poison gas how can they do that anna looked up with bloodshot eyes its better that you dont know she stood up ive got to get away from here weitz blocked the door you cant go anywhere youll ruin everything everything i did will have been for nothing i didnt ask you to do anything weitz gave her a chilling smile i see you wish it was you hanging up there on the tree you didnt see what they did to little greta anna shuddered better me than an innocent girl ha none of us are innocent here even though we worked against them we stood silent while it went on we have participated there are no clean souls in this building except the children dont shed any tears for fräulein müller you sicken me anna hissed get away from me get away you you filthy jew weitz clapped his hands together like a monkey ha ha you see weve worked together six months you and i plotting and scheming we made this raid possible but in the end you are a german and i am a filthy jew anna held up her hands i didnt mean that herr weitz i have nothing against jews i once loved a jew weitz cackled still louder of course you did every german has his pet jew the one that really doesnt deserve the gas but somehow we all end up there all but you she said cruelly oh ill get there soon enough but ill be taking a few germans with me anna had no desire to know what he meant i cant face brandt today she said or schörner or sturm not any of them youll have to face schörner eventually he said go sit in the childrens ward for a while that should stiffen your spine go sit with the little boy brandt uses as a living culture medium hes deaf and mute now from the meningitis that should remind you of why were doing this what was the life of greta müller worth compared to the children we have seen murdered here i cant think that way anna whispered then dont think at all play your part for a few hours and go home you can miss the final act what will you be doing weitz put his hand on the door handle dying probably but before i do im going to finish klaus brandt gas is too good for that slug for years ive dreamed of how i would kill him if i had the chance weitz held up a dirtynailed forefinger you wouldnt want to see it i promise you hansjoachim kleber deputy chief of police in dornow village was thinking that seventy years old was too old to be climbing down an icy iron ladder into a sewer tunnel but he had little choice kleber had assumed his rank in the police department in late after the last dornow men under sixty disappeared into the army and since nothing illegal ever happened in dornow not since the ss had built the camp over the hill anyway he was placed in charge of maintaining the electric lights and the sewer tunnel he didnt complain much the work paid enough to keep him in tobacco he groaned as his rubber boots plopped down into the cold muck at the bottom of the ladder at least it didnt stink so bad in winter the complaints had started coming in just after noon several dornow families were dealing with backed up sewage and they didnt like it so of course old kleber had been called away from his warm fire to root through the filthy tunnel with his wehrmacht flashlight the old man shone the beam southward where the tunnel ran for nearly a mile before emptying into the recknitz river the tunnel itself was five feet high with iron rungs set in its sides to assist maintenance workers only a trickle of waste flowed in the narrow channel at its bottom that meant the blockage must be to the north closer to the village seconds after kleber turned in that direction his torch illuminated the corpse of a dog a shepherd by the look of him lying with its fanged mouth open in the middle of the shallow sewage stream he had no idea why a dog would have entered the sewer unless it was starving which didnt appear to be the case the old man scratched his chin and moved cautiously forward ach he grumbled as the torch beam lit up a thick tangle of branches mud raw sewage and rats kleber unclipped a heavy shorthandled rake from his belt and after beating away the rats began pulling away branches it was heavy work for a man of his years he laid the flashlight on an iron rung and went to work with both hands he could hear the rats splashing around him dirty shiteaters he cursed then his rake hooked into something that would not give kleber let go of the handle and picked up his flashlight mein gott he whispered stumbling backward the metal teeth of his rake were caught in the sodden brown trousers of an ss man a dead ss man as the light beam played over the waxy features of the corpse kleber realized with horror that the body was lying in the arms of another this was what had caused the branches and other flotsam to collect here and the rats he stood there a few moments thinking for two days the ss had been combing the hills with dogs and in everincreasing numbers what they might be looking for had been the subject of quiet but extensive speculation in the main tavern in dornow kleber figured he knew now what they were looking for he shook his head slowly then turned and splashed back up the tunnel to raise the alarm otto buch bürgermeister of dornow sat silently at his desk and tried to look appropriately submissive as the senior ss security officer of totenhausen camp shouted at him about parachutes polish partisans and traitors he really had no idea why this oneeyed war hero thought a village mayor could do anything about his problem buch had exactly two police officers under his command one of whom was the old grandfather who had discovered the bodies if things werent so damned serious he would have laughed he found it funny that it was an interruption in the orderly flow of fecal matter that had brought a flood of the same substance down upon his head sturmbannführer schörner buch said soothingly you have viewed the bodies yourself you see my uniform covered with excrement do you not buch wrinkled his nose it is difficult to ignore sturmbannführer but allow me to inquire have you formed an opinion as to how these men died they were shot in the back with an automatic weapon buch folded his hands over his substantial belly sturmbannführer we in dornow make every effort to assist the ss at totenhausen despite the great secrecy that surrounds your facility but this he waved his hand this sounds to me like a military problem schörner raised himself to his full height it is about to become a civilian problem bürgermeister as soon as i can get enough troops here i am going to conduct a housetohouse search of the village otto buchs face reddened are you saying he spluttered indignantly that you suspect someone in this village of harboring antifascist partisans i am well i dont believe it ive known everyone here for years the only people i might even consider as suspects would be the civilian support personnel who have moved here since your camp was built schörner listened as a motorcycle skidded to a stop in the street below the mayors office he moved to the window and saw the ss rider charging into the first floor doorway below schörner had the office door open by the time the rider reached the top of the stairs the rider pulled off his goggles and saluted sharply youre wanted at the camp immediately sturmbannführer herr doktor brandt has ordered a selection a selection yes sir the messenger glanced at the portly mayor you may speak freely schörner said the herr doktor said something about testing new suits from raubhammer i am not needed for that schörner said with annoyance i have pressing business here is that what i should tell the herr doktor tell him i have an emergency here hauptscharführer sturm can easily stand in for me during a sel schörner froze in midsentence otto buch narrowed his eyes with curiosity sturmbannführer he said softly are you all right schörners good eye focused on the mayor for an instant then he snatched the goggles from the messenger bolted down the stairs and into the street the ss man and the mayor reached the window just in time to see him roar off on the motorcycle in the direction of totenhausen klaus brandt stood in the snow before the steps of his hospital a look of impatience on his face he glared at his watch then motioned for sergeant sturm to join him im tired of waiting hauptscharführer he said well start without him sturm nodded crisply ready when you are herr doktor will you be making the selection not today there are no specific medical criteria i need three subjects choose whomever you wish sturm suppressed a smile zu befehl herr doktor heil hitler rachel jansen backed out of the latrine shed holding hannah on her left hip and gripping jans hand with her right when she turned she saw sergeant sturm and three ss men waiting for her the struggle was onesided and brief two storm troopers jerked the children away while sturm and the fourth man pinned rachels arms she was screaming and crying at once as they dragged her away her eyes on her children jan stared after her with wide eyes then bent over hannah who lay motionless on the snow third time pays for all sturm growled in her ear as they passed through the block gate and into the appellplatz this time ive got permission to kill you rachel smelled garlic and blood sausage on his breath i want you to know something he went on after youre dead ill be getting those diamonds back from you you think about that while youre breathing the gas eh three jews in an oven rachels feet hung just above the ground as they marched her across the yard near the hospital steps she saw a knot of men all wore earthbrown uniforms except one who stood a little apart the shoemaker three jews in an oven rachel heard someone shouting behind her she recognized the voice before she turned benjamin jansen her fatherinlaw now she understood sturm had found some way to get rid of everyone who had witnessed the incident with the diamonds they dropped her beside the shoemaker sturm moved off to speak with brandt leaving her under the guard of four storm troopers dont try to run the shoemaker said were going to the gas rachel told him not the way you think theyre testing a new type of chemical suit we may have a chance i survived one gassing inside a suit sturm means to kill me rachel said softly to get at schörner oh god spare my children without me her words were drowned by the yells of ben jansen as he was beaten toward them the shoemaker leaned close and whispered there will be a control there always is you must volunteer to wear a suit do you hear volunteer to wear the suit rachel heard the high whine of a motorcycle on the hill road herr stern promise me that if your son comes back you will make him take my children away frau jansen the suit promise me the shoemaker sighed in resignation i promise ben jansen was babbling at rachel but she wasnt listening she tried to catch sight of jan or hannah near the childrens block was there any chance now that schörner would send them into a lebensborn home of course not she had been a fool not to accept his offer instantly to the eblock brandt commanded from the steps two storm troopers caught rachel by the arms and carried her up the steps into the hospital straight down the main hall to the rear door which led onto the alley and the eblock they were halfway across the alley when a motorcycle roared into one end of it and raced up to the hospital steps a man wearing the field gray of the waffen ss leaped off the cycle and let it fall in the snow only when he tore off his goggles did rachel see the eyepatch and realize who the rider was herr doktor schörner shouted we must put all troops on full alert immediately sergeant sturm shouldered his way between brandt and schörner the herr doktor is conducting an experiment he said everything else must wait schörner did not even glance at the captives he knew rachel would be among them herr doktor i must insist ach you stink sturm said under his breath where have you been in a sewer yes just a moment hauptscharführer brandt said in a calm voice let us hear what our security chief has to say i have located the missing patrol herr doktor schörner said both men were shot in the back with submachine guns and hidden in the dornow sewer even sturm rocked back at this news schörner pushed on maximizing the sense of imminent danger i recommend an immediate housetohouse search of dornow sturm should recall his men from the hills also the dogs we will need them to sniff walls and floors sergeant sturm turned his back on brandt thats what youd like isnt it he whispered but youre too late this time brandt walked halfway down the steps something very much like fear had crept into his bland face who do you think is responsible for these deaths schörner it could be anyone herr doktor partisans british commandos possibly both working in concert but with the raubhammer demonstration so close i dont believe we should take any chances think of rommel think of the führer brandts face went white sturm round up every available man and dog to search the village immediately but the test will continue without you brandt finished move schnell sturm glared at schörner then started up the alley start with the mayors house schörner called after him that pompous ass needs a lesson in authority good work schörner brandt said now let us continue the experiment im testing the integrity of the raubhammer suits today ah here they are now rachel turned and saw ariel weitz and three ss men backing carefully down the steps they carried between them two shiny black suits which had some type of rubber bag and hose apparatus attached to their backs she sought out schörners eyes but he refused to look in her direction schörner cleared his throat i understood that they had sent us three suits herr doktor they did but i will not soil my own suit with the sweat of a jew would you schörner schörner studied the commandants face several moments before answering nein herr doktor of course not now sturmbannführer we have a decision to make one of these prisoners must function as the control do you have a preference rachel saw then that brandt was toying with schörner somehow the doctor knew exactly what his security chief had been up to giving schörner this choice was merely one more perverse experiment designed for brandts enjoyment before schörner could answer rachel heard the shoemaker whisper softly behind her he cannot save you you must volunteer think of your children i have no preference schörner said in an emotionless voice his eye never leaving brandts face a faint smile touched brandts lips i am very glad to hear it sturmbannführer in that case i volunteer to wear a suit rachel cried stepping forward brandt studied her with interest as would i were i in your place he said he let his eyes play over her body then looked pointedly at schörner well sturmbannführer give the young lady what she wants by all means a suit schörner snapped his fingers at ariel weitz who immediately carried one of the suits to rachel and began unzipping it i too volunteer rachel turned her fatherinlaw had followed her example she watched brandts eyes examine the old tailor with clinical detachment i think not brandt said give the other suit to the shoemaker lets see if his luck holds eh schörner he survived one of these tests already you know although that was an early version of sarin as i recall not nearly so toxic as soman four as benjamin jansen absorbed these words brandt said bind the control hand and foot we cant risk him tearing the suits in his death throes the old tailor began to struggle but rachel remembered little else until she found herself sitting in a floodlit corner of the eblock her head and body encased in rubber breathing parched air that tasted like metal the shoemaker sat motionless beside her just beyond him lying against the wall she saw a small metal gas cylinder was that where the soman would come from she decided not the small tank looked almost casually left behind its pale green paint blending perfectly with the paint inside the eblock she looked over at ben jansen who lay writhing in the opposite corner just three meters away the old man had been spared the indignity of being stripped naked but only to better approximate the effect of soman four on uniformed allied soldiers as rachel watched him fighting the ropes she wondered at the wild impulse to survive that had made her step away from him and grasp at the only choice that offered a chance at life had concern for her children driven her to it of course but was it only them was there anything she would not do to survive one more day as the hissing of the opened gas valves penetrated the rubber mask she knew that there was not she closed her eyes knowing that her fatherinlaw would be dead when she opened them again she prayed only that she would live to open them anna kaas watched the steel hatch of the eblock from an open window on the second floor of the hospital by her watch eight minutes had passed since the three prisoners were sealed inside the gassing had not lasted more than a minute she knew she had seen ss men turning off the valves behind the eblock the rest of the time would have been spent cleaning the soman from the chamber with neutralizing chemicals and detergents the usual cleaning method scalding steam and corrosive bleach could not be used in a suit test because brandt always interviewed the survivors afterwards she thanked god that no one had discovered the portable oxygen cylinder not yet at least two men wearing gas masks and rubber gloves moved cautiously down the concrete steps and opened the eblocks hatch then dashed back up to ground level no one emerged as klaus brandt knelt beside one of the porthole windows and rapped on it anna looked down at her left hand in it were the keys to greta müllers volkswagen she turned her arm to read her watch pm four and onehalf hours until the attack if there was an attack with sturm already organizing schörners housetohouse search she had to get back to the cottage and warn stern and mcconnell they could make the decision stay and try to carry off the attack or run she felt a powerful urge to run right now but she would not go until she knew whether sterns father had survived every moment she stood there felt like a dare to fate but if rachel jansen had the courage to walk into the eblock under her own power anna could stand to watch for two more minutes she started at a shout from below a black figure was moving slowly up the eblock steps a bubbly white substance flowing off of the suit as it moved it was soap anna realized the detergent solution brandt used to spray away gas residue after suit tests when the blacksuited figure straightened she knew it could only be avram stern he stood nearly a head taller than brandt and in his arms he carried a limp figure which also wore a dripping suit rachel jansen anna stayed long enough to see the tall figure lay down its burden and pull off its mask revealing the prominent nose and gray moustache of the man called shoemaker major schörner was hurrying toward the prostrate figure at the shoemakers feet when anna turned from the window and ran toward the stairs how are we supposed to move in these things stern yelled trying to be heard through his vinyl gas mask he was standing in the kitchen of the cottage wearing one of the oilskin antigas suits mcconnell had brought from oxford he had gone up and down the cellar stairs three times wearing the suit mask and air tank and he was already pouring sweat you dont have to shout mcconnell told him the diaphragm set into the vinyl transmits your voice you sound like an insect version of yourself he pulled up the oilskin shoulders of the suit so that stern could lift the clear vinyl mask off his head it will be a little tougher when were both wearing our masks said mcconnell but well manage its like wearing five sets of clothes stern complained wiping sweat from his face how do we fight in them i wouldnt suggest hand to hand combat one small rip and the whole thing is useless if active nerve gas gets inside youre dead why isnt air escaping from your hose now mcconnell held up the corrugated rubber hose of his air tank which sat on the kitchen table there was a bulbous device at the point where the hose met the cylinder this is called a regulator he said its sensitive enough so that the force of your breath opens and closes it theres going to be a revolution in underwater diving after the war because of this gadget a man named cousteau developed mcconnell gaped at stern who had dropped into a crouch on the kitchen floor what is it he whispered a car just pulled up outside mcconnell knelt beside him ss stern picked up his schmeisser from a chair if it is we dont have a chance in these suits mcconnell heard the angry clicking of a key in the front door someone jerked the door handle up and down but the lock held fast scheisse cursed a muffled voice a woman mcconnell asked softly stern tiptoed to the kitchen window and peeked through a small crack between the curtains it is a woman maybe its one of the other nurses shell go away eventually stern shook his head shes not going away shes getting a suitcase out of the boot its a nice car too a mercedes too expensive for a nurse wait shes coming back to the door anna the woman shouted she jerked the door handle up and down again why have you changed your locks whats she doing now sitting down on her suitcase shes opening a book shes not going anywhere wed better get down to the cellar stern shook his head she might hear us moving in these suits jesus mcconnell murmured we should have hit the camp last night everythings fine stern said quietly if she doesnt leave soon ill drag her in here and kill her anna was driving too fast when she came down out of the wooded hills south of dornow she forced herself to slow down as the car passed the first outbuildings of the village she knew it was insane to have taken gretas volkswagen but she had to beat sturms men to the cottage the gate guards had seen her driving the vw often enough to let her leave the camp unmolested shed nearly killed herself several times on the hairpin turns in the hills but tempting death had calmed her a little then she turned down the lane that led to her cottage oh god she whispered not today she rolled to a stop behind the mercedes her sister sabine was standing beside the front door looking just as she always did the perfect gauleiters wife too much makeup and too many jewels even her casual dresses were shipped from paris ive been waiting here for two hours sabine complained anna smoothed her hair and tried to look composed and guten abend to you sabine have you been inside sabine hoffmans mouth puckered into a shrewish scowl how could i go inside youve changed your locks oh yes someone tried to break in while i was at work i didnt feel safe you should fly a party flag outside no one would have the nerve to break in ill have walters office send you one anna noticed the leather suitcase by the door she felt almost too disoriented to hold a conversation sabine what are you doing here i had no idea you were coming ive come to stay the night walter went to berlin again to kiss up to the party hacks goebbels is having some kind of function for the hitler jügend they never ask the wives anymore not that id want to go magdas such a bore she looked past her mercedes at gretas car is that yours dear it doesnt look bad at all for a volkswagen anna tried to focus her thoughts no it belongs to one of the other nurses a friend of mine she lends it to me sometimes too bad sabine picked up her suitcase lets get inside its freezing out here anna prayed that mcconnell and stern were in the cellar her pulse raced as she unlocked the door not a chair was out of place sabine set her suitcase in annas bedroom and installed herself at the kitchen table im positively starving she said what do you have anna realized she was wringing her hands not much im afraid i often eat at the camp she felt a sudden hope we should go into the village theres nonsense sabine said a little coffee would be fine i live on coffee and cigarettes these days walter too you cant imagine how busy hes become i feel like im married to the party the few hours he is home he does nothing but write speeches no time for the children to them gauleiter is a dirty word their fathers the biggest man in town and they never see him anna began boiling water for coffee sabine lit a cigarette and drew deeply she let the smoke escape in little puffs as she talked the social scene in berlin is practically nonexistent now the führer spends all his time in rastenburg in east prussia whats the point of being nazi royalty if the king is never in town tell me anna have you met any delicious officers at the camp that major schörner is quite the hero i understand they know him in berlin anna shook her head distractedly i really have no time for that dr brandt keeps us working brandt sabine spat that man gives me the chills locked away day and night operating on jews and god knows what else still walter says hes a genius whatever that means i suspect it means hes impotent she cast her jaded eye around the kitchen then into the bedroom anna was reaching for a coffee mug when her sister said do i smell a man dear anna froze what a man you know the smell sweat and old leather come anna are you hiding a sturdy little ss lover in your virginal bower anna forced a laugh youre mad sabine sabine stood up and pointed to the counter mad am i you little sneak i suppose you wear that to scare the burglars away anna felt her heart stop in the corner beneath a cabinet lay jonas sterns sicherheitsdienst cap the sd no less sabine said picking up the cap she ran her finger along the green piping secret police that fits since youve been keeping him secret from me and an officer dear who is he at the moment anna realized she had no idea what to say the cellar door crashed open and jonas stern burst into the kitchen wearing his sd uniform he pointed his schmeisser at sabine ach du lieber hergott she cried theres no need to get so excited i dont care if youre married anna deserves all the fun she wants sit down stern yelled now in the chair sabines expression changed from mild amusement to anger youd better improve your manners standartenführer she said tartly or ill have my husband speak to reichsführer himmler about you i dont care who your husband speaks to he snarled put your fat ass in that chair sabine looked at anna for an explanation but anna had covered her face with both hands mcconnell stepped into the room wearing his ss uniform whats going on here sabine demanded someone had better explain in the silence that followed sabine hoffman fully apprehended the wrongness of the situation she had never been slow on the uptake and she sensed lethal danger now like a startled cat she snatched the coffee pot off the stove and hurled the boiling water at stern in the same motion darting in front of mcconnell to reach the foyer and freedom stunned by the water and afraid of hitting mcconnell stern fired late and high the slugs from his silenced schmeisser shattered some cabinet doors but sabine was already in the foyer before stern could follow and finish her mcconnell dove through the door and leaped onto the womans back as she tore at the door handle sabine whirled clawing and screeching like a wildcat stop it anna screamed sabine be quiet mcconnell threw himself backward and whirled crushing sabine against the foyer wall and stunning her enough that she fell to the floor anna threw herself over her sister to keep stern from shooting her lie still sabine dont say anything stern was trying to push his way into the foyer but mcconnell shoved him back into the kitchen you dont have to shoot her you heard her stern shouted shes planning to stay here tonight we cant risk her ruining everything shes got to be eliminated shes my sister for gods sake anna screamed from the foyer shes a nazi stern yelled back mcconnell held up his hands to keep stern from charging the foyer door you cant kill her sister jonas i cant mcconnell pushed him back look the attack is only three hours away we can tie her in the basement she wont get out stern looked past him too much depends on this doctor mcconnell spoke very low if you kill her theres no telling how anna might react we dont need anna anymore either stern said his eyes cold all we need is this cottage mcconnell lowered his hands but leaned close to stern if you hurt anna he said i will kill you and if you manage to kill me first and i dont see that gas factory brigadier smith will have your balls for breakfast you understand theres no need for more bloodshed lets just tie her in the basement you cant hide here anymore anyway you bastard anna shouted at stern brandt ordered a housetohouse search of dornow mcconnell and stern looked at each other their mouths open how long do we have stern asked when anna didnt respond mcconnell said anna please how long sturms men could be in the village already a knock on the door silenced them all all but sabine she screamed at the pounding help me help mcconnell jerked anna off of her sister and dragged sabine into the kitchen a kubelwagen stern said from the window they must have coasted up the lane get your rifle doctor stern pushed anna up to the front door and motioned for her to reply he stood behind her with the schmeisser ready to spray the entire foyer with bullets if necessary whos there anna called her voice near to breaking weitz came the muffled reply anna sagged against the door in relief she motioned stern back into the kitchen then opened the door ariel weitz pushed past her and closed the door behind him what the hell goes on here he asked who screamed whose mercedes is that my sisters what are you doing here are you crazy sturm and his men could be here any minute youre the one whos crazy weitz snapped taking gretas car now take me to them who them the commandos or whoever is going to make the attack ive got to speak to them anna looked anxiously over her shoulder stern stepped up to the door of the small foyer with his schmeisser leveled who are you weitz looked at the sd uniform in shock i am ariel weitz standartenführer i apologize ive obviously come to the wrong house by mistake hes no sd officer sabine screamed help me weitz forced himself not to look beyond the nazi specter before him youre scarlett arent you stern said smiths other agent in totenhausen its you who calls the poles weitz looked to anna with petrified eyes then back at stern youve come to the right house stern assured him what have you to tell me hurry its all right anna said well brandt has postponed the housetohouse search he pulled in all the patrols sterns eyes narrowed why would he do that sturms dogs dug up more british parachutes near the dornow road cargo chutes this time the rains uncovered them sturm came back with the parachutes right after anna left schörner wanted to cordon off the whole village but brandt overruled him brandt thinks that by searching for commandos schörner would be leaving him and his lab open to attack so theyre sealing off the camp stern closed his eyes for an instant the only sign that this news had disturbed him how did you get out brandt sent me to dornow to get the only four technicians who are not on duty at the factory i heard him and schörner discussing plans to dismantle the lab tonight dismantle the lab tonight why would they do that i dont know but but what weitz scratched his chin well if taking apart the lab means they are moving tomorrow and the raubhammer test is tomorrow what can they be planning to do with the prisoners stern nodded anything else no standartenführer stop calling me that you are jewish yes sir if you come out of the war alive you should come to palestine we could use you there weitzs hand went to his mouth you you are a jew yes and i want you to do something for me if you can anything when the attack comes some of the ss will probably run for their bomb shelter and that shelter might well protect them unless of course some enterprising soul found a way to boobytrap it a slow smile crept over weitzs face it would be my pleasure standartenführer good man now go get back to your work and think of a reason why you stopped here in case anyone saw you weitz bowed his head and hurried away from the door stern turned back to the kitchen mcconnell was restraining sabine from behind in a wrestling hold before stern could speak anna said brandt gassed your father sterns face went white what are you telling me he whispered my father is dead anna held up a forefinger give me your word that you will not kill my sister or i tell you nothing youre lying i saw him walk into the eblock with my own eyes anna said mcconnell heard the truth of it in her voice all right said stern you can take her to the basement and tie her now tell me what you know your father survived it was a chemicalsuit test your father wore one i saw him walk out alive without even waiting for a response anna grabbed sabine by the arm and pulled her to the cellar door sabine fought no more it was plain even to her that stern would shoot on the slightest provocation youd better gag her stern called after them if i have to listen to any more mewling about nazi high society ill kill her just to shut her up mcconnell collapsed into a kitchen chair you heard that guy theyve sealed the camp schörners expecting something youll never get in there tonight you wont be able to warn the prisoners to go into the eblock ill get in stern said with absolute conviction how sterns boot heels fired together with the crack of a small caliber pistol his voice took on a saber edge it appears that standartenführer ritter stern from berlin is going to have to make a security inspection at pm greenwich mean time twelve raf mosquito bombers lifted off from skitten field a division of wick air base in scotland and headed across the north sea toward occupied europe their code name was general sherman the mosquitoes took off just behind an raf pathfinder force which was leading a wave of lancasters to the oil plants at magdeburg germany each specially modified mosquito carried pounds of bombs in its belly general sherman would remain with the pathfinder force across the netherlands but when the pathfinders turned south near cuxhaven the mosquitoes would continue east past rostock to the mouth of the recknitz river flying by dead reckoning they would follow the river south ticking off the villages as they went when they passed bad sülze they would follow the line of the river with their hs blind bombing radars until they sighted dornow village there the leading aircraft would drop parachute flares to bathe the area in light then the second plane would mark the aiming point with brilliantburning red target indicators the mossies would be near the limit of their range but with no known antiaircraft guns to worry about they could afford to make a slow accurate bomb run their primary target was a prison camp sheltered between the hills and the river known to them only as tara in tandem formation they would pound the southern face of those hills with highexplosive and incendiary bombs until nothing remained but a fire burning hot enough to boil the nearby recknitz river jonas stern walked into annas bedroom and checked his sd uniform in the mirror he had forgotten to remove the creosote stain hed gotten while climbing the pylon but that was a small thing now he straightened his collar checked the iron cross on his breast felt the pocket that held his papers staring at his reflection stern found it easy to believe that his father had not recognized him even though he had shaved in the afternoon the face and eyes under the peaked sd cap seemed to belong to a man he did not know perhaps they did so much had happened in the past three days the visit to rostock had hit him hardest finding his father alive had been a miracle and yet some part of him had not been surprised by it such miracles were not outside his experience of war but the trip into rostock into the neighborhood where he had lived until age fourteen had overwhelmed him even though he and his mother had fled germany in fear even though he knew as well as anyone the outrages perpetrated against the jews who remained behind some inaccessible part of him had clung to that small neighborhood those few streets and buildings that had nurtured him that part that repository of memory had remained german when he entered his street expecting to find his old apartment building smashed to rubble and then saw it standing as tall and proud as it ever had hope welled in him he climbed the stairs to the second floor with the unreasoning faith of a fool shedding years with each step his cynicism left at the curb with the stolen car but when he knocked at the door he had once been unable to open because he could not reach the handle it was answered not by his mother or father or his uncle or anyone else he remembered but by a bespectacled man of sixty with white hair and soup stains on his shirt stern stood mute staring past the stranger the furniture in the apartment was the furniture he had grown up with his mothers sofa and end tables his fathers bookcase and wall clock he swayed on his feet his sense of time in free fall the stranger asked if the standartenführer was all right finally focusing on the face before him stern realized that the old man was trembling in fear the sd uniform had worked its spell even as he mumbled his apologies stern caught sight of the two blond children beyond the old man the boy was only halfdressed but the tunic hanging open on his shoulders exposing his white chest was the familiar black of the hitler youth he wore it as naturally as a british boy would have worn a boy scout uniform stern almost stumbled down the stairs in his haste to get back to the car he would rather have found the whole street leveled by allied bombs and his relatives dead under the wreckage the sight of that apartment filled by the furniture of his memory but empty of the people he had known had punched like a stake into that hidden part of him that remained what he had been as a child that remained german as he turned the car out of the familiar street he truly understood something for the first time he was not german he was a jew a man without a country without even a home a man who was only what he could make of himself who could call home only that land he could take and hold by force of arms annas voice rising in the kitchen brought stern back to the present he cocked the sd cap on his head picked up his schmeisser and walked into the kitchen mcconnell and the nurse were sitting at the table they had spoken little to him since his attempt to shoot sabine who now lay trussed like a turkey in the basement but he had no regrets leaving the woman alive was a mistake if they couldnt see that so be it how do i look he asked just like one of them said anna except for the suntan maybe you are one of them stern ignored her he set his schmeisser on the table and folded his arms as he stood over them the whole thing is timing now he said its seven ohfive im taking sabines mercedes to the camp and i plan to be at the gate in ten minutes im going to leave the climbing spikes at the foot of the pylon on my way i dont plan to be inside the camp longer than fifteen minutes what are you going to tell the prisoners asked mcconnell you think you can explain the situation and get them to decide who will live or die in fifteen minutes the less time they have to think the better if all goes well you will hear an explosion at sevenfifty that will be me blowing out the transformers in the power station on the hill you will be waiting here when you hear the explosion take the volkswagen and meet me where the road comes closest to the pylon have the gas suits with you well go to the camp together and finish the job if you havent heard the grenade by sevenfifty ive failed then you must take the car up the hill put on the climbing spikes as i showed you climb the pylon and release the cylinders all in ten minutes mcconnell asked why dont anna and i just wait on the hill because the only thing that can stop this attack now is someone discovering those cylinders before the attack i dont want either of you anywhere near that pylon until its absolutely necessary but thats not enough time it is ive seen you run doctor ive seen you carry logs on your back even if you only climbed six feet per minute you could climb that pole in ten minutes youll climb it a lot faster than that if it comes to it stern picked up a piece of cloth from the table it was the swatch of tartan sir donald cameron had given mcconnell on the bridge the two buried cylinders will detonate automatically at eight he said rubbing the tartan between his fingers if youve had to send down the cylinders yourself consider the job done ill be beyond help and there will probably be ss reinforcements on the way he dropped the tartan and tilted his head toward anna she knows the area the two of you might be able to reach the sub she can take my place it wont come to that mcconnell said sure stern shifted uncomfortably on his feet listen if i dont get out and you do well my mother lives in tel aviv leah stern it wont come to that mcconnell said again just promise youll do it i dont trust smith that lying bastard told me my father was dead he slung the schmeisser over his shoulder just tell my mother i was with father at the end okay that i tried to get him out smith told you your father was dead stern nodded he wanted me angry enough to kill anybody who stood in the way of getting this job done mcconnell shoved his chair back and stood up if the worst happens ill get word to your mother but youre going to tell her about it yourself itll be the big family story the night jonas saved his old man from the nazis stern took mcconnells hand and shook it shalom mcconnell said and smiled what do you say sterns mouth split into a grin he looked unbelievably young then too young for what he was about to do kiss my ass doctor is that right close enough anna raised her eyes to stern he nodded at her then moved toward the door as his fingers touched the handle she said auf wiedersehen herr stern he stepped out into the night anna pulled a strand of hair out of her eyes he looked like a boy she said at the end he is a boy mcconnell replied a boy who probably wont live the night hes also a killer hes a match for sturm or any of them that one mcconnell nodded he has to be airman peter bottomley watched the small singleengine plane float down through the dark swedish sky and onto the abandoned airstrip it taxied right up to the junkers bomber and stopped engine running the side door opened and a onearmed man climbed down to the tarmac wearing a severe black business suit he waved to the pilot the light plane taxied away the passenger hurried over to where bottomley stood waiting how was stockholm brigadier same as ever said smith thick with intrigue damned little of which will ever amount to anything any word from butler and wilkes none sir but bletchley got an unconfirmed report that the wojiks have gone missing a shadow of concern crossed the brigadiers face missing apparently someone from the shepherd network reported that scarlett called the wojiks for a crash meeting the wojiks left for the meeting but never returned smith tugged at one end of his gray mustache schörner may have tumbled to weitz and the kaas woman then used them to draw the wojiks in he might even have bagged butler and wilkes smith looked down at his dour suit looks like im dressed for the occasion bad luck sir smith sniffed and looked southward across the frozen baltic a black channel had been smashed through the coastal ice but it was rapidly filling with small floes we dont know for certain he said still no ultra traffic indicating anything out of the ordinary at totenhausen no foiled commando attack or anything like that no sir well this is the fourth night the wind must have been calm enough for the attack by now yet butler and wilkes have not attacked the gas is nearly one hundred hours old now it looks like theyve failed whatever the reason he patted his pockets for his pipe well with a little luck on the navigation general sherman will wipe out all trace of the mission butler and wilkes might never have been there at all poor bastards bottomley raised an eyebrow and said with black humor gone with the wind eh sir have a little respect bottomley do you still want me to monitor butlers emergency frequency tonight once the mosquitoes leave the main force theyll be observing strict radio silence we couldnt stop them if we wanted to if you think butler and wilkes are done for of course you monitor the frequency man right up to the minute the bombs fall duff smiths voice was edged with anger no matter how bleak it looks one never knows in this business anyway we might learn something about why the mission failed yes sir smith worried at his mustache again i thought stern had it in him to pull it off he murmured blast i beg your pardon sir nothing bottomley lets take the radio down to that hut by the beach you never know who might crawl up out of the surf very good sir jonas stern wheeled sabine hoffmans mercedes up to the front gate of totenhausen like lucifer arriving in a black chariot hed seen the spotlights when he was still a mile away like white fingers exploring the forest and he had known then that trying to sneak back in would have been impossible he had to brazen it out as one of the six ss men guarding the gate approached the mercedes stern prayed that anna kaas had given him an accurate description of the command situation at the camp he rolled down his window and waited for the guard to arrive when the brownuniformed ss private saw the sd uniform and rank badge he reacted exactly as stern hoped he would he snapped to attention with eyes as big as spent bullets step up to the window schütze stern said in an offhand voice zu befehl standartenführer i am standartenführer ritter stern from berlin i have come here to make an arrest possibly several arrests the privates face lost what little color it had possessed i want no one but sd personnel to enter or leave through this gate for the next hour that includes sturmbannführer wolfgang schörner do you understand jawohl sturmbannführer stop shouting you will tell the other guards nothing you will tell hauptscharführer sturm nothing i shall speak to herr doktor brandt and no one else anyone who interferes with these arrests will find himself in the cellars of prinzalbrechtstrasse by morning have i made myself clear the private was too stunned to muster enough voice to answer but he clicked his boot heels and nodded get back to your post and open the gate the private fled back to his comrades and obeyed the order stern put the mercedes into gear and rolled slowly forward into totenhausen the headquarters building looked deserted he drove around it and onto the appellplatz directly ahead of him stood the hospital to his left the inmate blocks two heavy trucks were parked near the fence surrounding the large barn to his right the barn brigadier smith had told him housed brandts lab and gas factory men wearing white coats were loading boxes into the trucks stern drove straight on to the hospital and parked on the side away from the factory his watch read pm on schedule he unscrewed the soemachined silencer from the schmeisser and slipped it into his right boot then got out of the mercedes and walked around the hospital the alley was empty halfway up it he turned left and moved quite deliberately down the four steps that led to the halfsunken eblock the door worked by means of a steel wheel set in its face like the wheel on a submarine hatch the wheel turned under his hand as anna had predicted the door was open warmer air ruffled his hair as he stepped inside a faint bluish light passed through the porthole windows set high in the walls of the steel room only now did he realize how desperate was their plan the eblock felt exactly like what it was a chamber of death it was a supreme irony that in just over forty minutes it would be the one place in totenhausen where life could survive if the british gas worked he reminded himself he closed the door checked to make sure the alley was empty then climbed the icy steps and walked toward the inmate blocks he wondered how much the gate guard had told his comrades about the man in the mercedes under normal circumstances the presence of an sd colonel would move quickly up the ss grapevine but these were not normal circumstances how long would it take the news to reach wolfgang schörner there was a sentry standing before the wire gate of the fence surrounding the six inmate blocks approaching him stern realized that he was walking beneath the mutilated body of a naked woman greta müller he erased the goyaesque image from his mind and pulled out the leather case containing his forged papers flipping it open before he reached the sentry i need to speak to a prisoner he said with perfunctory courtesy a jewess its a matter of reich security im not expecting trouble so you may remain at your post if you hear women screaming ignore it if you hear a man shout for help that will be me come running the guard barely glanced at the papers again the sd uniform and rank were enough stern was through the gate in less time than it would take to light a cigarette standartenführer stern laid one hand on his schmeisser as he turned youll need this the sentry hurried over and handed him a battery torch stern nodded a curt thankyou then stepped up into the block the room was totally dark he switched on the flashlight held it at arms length and shined it on his own face i am the shoemakers son he whispered i have returned is my father here my son the answer was a joyous whisper light the candle jonas commanded hurry there was a rustling of clothes in the darkness a hooded yellow glow illuminated a circle on the floor a shadow passed in front of the light and stern felt arms go around him and squeeze tightly raw emotion surged through him so strong that he almost couldnt bear it all he could think of was his mother sitting alone in her tiny flat in palestine how do you do it avram stern asked how do you get past them never mind i must speak to you bring everyone close around me quickly rachel avram said sharply form the circle stern sensed a great many movements around him like leaves in a night forest as the women drew closer he backed against the door he tried to make the movement seem natural but he did it to block the escape route of anyone who panicked his father and rachel jansen stood closest to him the other faces were a mixture of young and old a human map of europe listen to me he said in yiddish i must speak to you and we have very little time what i told you before was not completely true i came here from palestine but not to verify reports of nazi atrocities i came here to help prepare for a great strike against hitler you all know what the nazis are making here at this camp they have tested it on people you knew perhaps even family members you know how deadly this gas is i dont need to tell any of you how devastating it would be to the troops who will soon land in france to liberate europe it is for that reason that the allies intend to kill herr doktor brandt and destroy his laboratory there was a sudden wind of whispers stern gazed into the shocked faces as much as he wanted to he could not tell these women the truth in approximately forty minutes he said totenhausen camp is going be attacked from the air several women gasped the shells that fall will be chemical shells filled with a gas much like the one made here stern took a step closer to the women he realized that he had been silently counting them there were fortyfour plus his father anyone unprotected from this gas will probably be killed during the attack i have come here to suggest a way that many of you might be able to survive it why have you really come here asked a woman from the back the allies dont care if we live or die stern turned up his palms i am a jew not an allied soldier i fight for haganah in palestine i fight for israel i have risked my life to come here will you listen we will listen rachel said the only protection from this gas is complete isolation the bombs will fall at eight oclock ten minutes before that you must move from here to the eblock and lock yourselves inside it is imperative the eblock someone said there are more than two hundred prisoners in this camp the eblock would not even hold all of us here i realize that stern said carefully the women looked at each other in puzzlement what are you saying my son avram asked i am saying that not everyone can be saved there was a long silence what about the bomb shelter someone asked all prisoners could fit in there jonas shook his head the ss are trained to run for the shelter during an emergency prisoners trying to take shelter there would be shot out of hand he did not say that if things were working out properly the ss shelter was already boobytrapped a middleaged woman stood up in the center of the group who claims the right that is gods alone she asked who would say who shall live and who shall die stern closed his hand around the schmeisser this would be the mad minute as each woman grasped exactly what he was suggesting im glad there are no rabbis here said a very old woman from the floor what an endless argument we would have to listen to sometimes one must follow the heart and common sense and what does common sense say here asked the woman who had stood it is simple said the old woman speaking with calm certainty this camp is like a sinking ship the eblock is the lifeboat there is a law for that unwritten perhaps but sacred everyone knows it women and children first and the young women before the old the ones still able to bear children these words silenced the block you speak wisely avram said to the old woman it is not an easy thing to do but necessary another woman stood up suddenly what are you saying she asked in a french accent that we should save ourselves but ignore the gentile women theyve ignored us long enough said a bitter voice and the children do we let the christian children die and what of the men they have no right to live of course they do said the old woman but they do not have the duty to choose that has fallen on us we cannot take the opinion of every prisoner in camp the secret could not be kept it was wise of this young man to wait until the last minute to tell us you knew about this attack two nights ago asked the frenchwoman of course he did said another avram raised his hands let me speak please with only minutes we would only cause a general riot by telling the other blocks the fact is that the eblock is the only shelter and it will only hold a few one of the women rachel called the new widows stood hesitantly my daughter is in the childrens block she said in an almost inaudible voice if we are going to die i want to be with her we can save the children jonas said and some of you but we must hurry and decide the issue some of us it was the frenchwoman again you cant even save all the children now youre going to condemn some of us keep your voice down jonas said sharply how many asked a familiar voice it was rachel jansen how many people can be saved in the eblock i have been inside it and it is very small the eblock was designed to conduct tests on ten men jonas said the number that can be saved is determined by space and oxygen theyll need at least two hours of air how many rachel asked again thats all we need to know stern nodded grateful for her pragmatism fifty children he said every child in the jewish childrens block and women he hesitated thirtyfive in the tomblike silence that followed he looked at his watch it was taking too long he removed the british silencer from his boot and screwed it onto the schmeissers barrel talk among yourselves he said i must speak to my father alone but i warn you if anyone tries to go through that door i will have no choice but to shoot he took his fathers hand and led him into the darkness beyond the circle of women mother will not believe it he said sitting on one of the narrow bunks everyone tried to convince her that you were dead to carry on i told her that myself i was dead avram said taking a seat beside him it doesnt matter now god has given us a second chance no matter what the women decide i am taking you out when i go you will pretend to be my prisoner in five minutes you will be outside that fence avram stern looked into his sons face jonas i told you before i cannot go out with you please listen i cannot leave women and children here to die jonas took his fathers arm youre not responsible for their deaths its the nazis the british and the americans i would be responsible for one death jonas one whose the child you could take out in my place what are you talking about how many people can you take out with you out of germany stern heard sibilant voices rising and falling as the women argued in whispers im not supposed to bring anyone out were going out by british submarine then from sweden to england by plane the plane is small in the worst case id planned to send you on from sweden in my place and find another way back myself or we could both try to reach palestine by an illegal route i know some people avram was shaking his head stop worrying youre going out just as you were supposed to ive lived a long life jonas my old friends are dead i am not destined to go with you but someone else is you can take one jewish child stern opened his mouth to argue but his father clenched his arm with the iron grip of a man who has labored a lifetime with his hands listen to your father even those who survive in the eblock may die in reprisals thats how things work here jonas the person that goes with you has the best chance for life it must be a child small enough for you to carry in your arms to smuggle into your submarine to hold on your lap in the airplane one child to live for all the thousands who have died in this insane country avram held up his right hand and closed it slowly as if around some precious treasure one seed jonas one little seed for palestine you expect me to leave you to die again stern said seething with frustration what could i say to mother she would hate me forever avram shook his head no your mother is a practical woman when i refused to leave germany did she stay behind to die no she carried you as far as she could from danger my son it is the fulfillment of my life to know both of you reached palestine i was wrong in but this time i am right you must do as i tell you he looked up and motioned to someone in the darkness rachel jansen appeared and knelt beside the bunk her eyes wide with fear and hope you remember her avram asked jonas nodded the bright black eyes were not easily forgotten avram reached out and squeezed rachels hand both nights since then she has smuggled her children here on the chance that you might come back she knew you must have told me to wait here in case you returned she is a brave girl jonas she is like the daughter of levi who put moses into the ark of bulrushes and you are her ark my son rachels lips quivered as she watched avrams face is it as i suspected avram said firmly one child rachel one can go one must stay with you you must decide jonas saw the young woman sway slightly on her knees when she spoke again her voice was barely a whisper how long do i have jonas looked at his watch father he whispered i beg you my decision is made jonas turned to rachel two minutes he said rachel hesitated as if he might say something else might somehow offer more hope but he didnt she stood up slowly and walked over to the corner bunk where her children slept avram laid his hand on his sons knee come he said let us see what the women have decided wait a moment jonas said we have a problem the women cant move to the eblock with that sentry at the block gate avram squeezed his sons knee i know what must be done let us see what they have decided one hundred and fifty miles west of rostock the raf pathfinder force turned southeast toward magdeburg but as the last of the lancasters of the bomber main force moved into position behind them the twelve mosquitoes of the special duties squadron continued eastward in the cockpit of the lead mosquito squadron leader harry sumner spoke to his navigator who was crowded into the seat behind his right shoulder going to max speed jacobs strict radio silence from here out make a visual check to be sure everyones with us right sumner put his hand affectionately on the throttles the de havilland mosquito had turned out to be the miracle bomber of the war built wholly of plywood for peacetime air racing the mossy carried no defensive armament relying on its tremendous speed to avoid confrontation it could cruise to germany at miles per hour with a full bombload then accelerate to to evade even the best luftwaffe night fighters when harry sumner went to max speed the merlin engines roared like lions loosed from cages everyone still there jacobs right with us sir said the navigator hs radar working so far lets find that bloody river rachel jansen knelt beside the prison bunk and looked down at her two sleeping children they lay side by side impossibly small and vulnerable their faces placid above the tatty prison blanket for two days and nights she had prayed for and dreaded this moment there was no way to make a just choice or even a logical one it was like being asked which eye one would prefer to have plucked out she tried in vain to block out the memories that tortured her marcuss face after seeing the babies for the first time especially hannah who had been born in the attic in amsterdam the hours rachel had simply stared at the tops of their little heads while they suckled at her breasts weeping with a rapturous awareness of mortality that closed the throat and made the skin prickle with heat stop she told herself you must choose her first instinct was to send jan with the shoemakers son it was him she had feared for most these last two weeks but now it appeared that klaus brandt was going to die the danger would be equal for both children after that rachel thought briefly of marcus if her husband were still alive he would choose jan continuation of the family name he would say sternly yet rachel felt little obligation to the jansen name marcus was dead a blade of guilt pierced her when she thought of his father dying beside her in the eblock but she drove the image from her mind gazing down at the childrens faces rachel simply stopped trying to decide she laid a hand on jans forehead three years old three years old and already one of the last survivors of his generation it was impossible to comprehend yet it was reality hannahs second birthday had passed while she rode in a stifling cattle car full of sick and dying jews rachel remembered wrapping the little dreidl in straw and giving it to her like a present hannah instantly recognized the old toy but everyone had pretended it was a new and priceless treasure rachel felt gooseflesh rise under her burlap shift she had always felt a preternatural sense of peace when she looked at her daughter it was almost like looking at herself not a mirror image but rather a reflection in water as if an imaginative and flattering artist had rendered rachel as a child widening her eyes making her mouth fuller her forehead a little higher and every word hannah said each question she asked bespoke rachels own curiosity jan was like marcus reserved a little gentleman rachel started as the voice of avram stern cut through the dark her time was running out for an instant she actually considered taking the dreidl from her pocket and spinning the top on the rough floorboards she could assign two of its four hebrew letters to jan two to hannah and let god decide but she did not do this even god had no place in this decision with that thought rachel suddenly understood exactly who and where she was she was not like the mother of moses who had set her infant son adrift in an ark of bulrushes to save him from the soldiers of pharaoh she was a woman trapped on an island inhabited by a doomed race an island sinking rapidly into the sea she had the chance to send one child out upon that sea an unfinished message in a bottle her only message to the world she pulled back the prison blanket and lifted her baby to her breast ariel weitz was very pleased with himself he had made a great deal of mischief in the last forty minutes and every second had given him a warm and wicked satisfaction during his years at totenhausen weitz had managed to acquire keys to nearly every door in the camp some had been given to him by the ss to facilitate his daily tasks others he had stolen one key opened a storeroom at the back of the headquarters building which housed the overflow from the main camp arsenal from this storeroom he had removed six potatomasher grenades two land mines and a submachine gun all of which he packed into a crate marked sulfadiazine he carried this crate to the morgue in the hospital basement and with another key opened the ss bomb shelter a long string of hanging light bulbs revealed a ramp descending at a shallow angle into a tunnel that ran fifty meters underground and then up to a second entrance in one of the ss barracks the tunnel was lined with musty shelves and benches with a mine in one hand and two grenades in the other weitz had scampered along the tunnel until he reached the barracks entrance just inside the door square in the middle of the tunnel he set the land mine on the floor and armed it then he took the two grenades and using some string from his pockets stretched tripwires across the tunnel and anchored them to the shelves when pulled taut by panicked legs they would detonate the potatomashers and fill the tunnel with a hurricane of shrapnel on the way back to the morgue weitz unscrewed every light bulb in the tunnel cackling softly while he did it he had boobytrapped the morgue entrance in exactly the same way as the barracks entrance and as a final touch unscrewed every light bulb in the morgue any ss men who managed to find their way to the bomb shelter entrance would have little chance of seeing the explosives that were about to kill them yes he was quite pleased with himself your time is up avram told the women he stood with his back to the barracks door his son beside him you cannot decide not to decide to do that is to condemn everyone once again the frenchwoman stood up and gestured fiercely i say it again no one here can choose fairly avram took a step toward her i can choose fairly he said you she cried your own son is the one who has come to kill us of course you will be saved am i not a man the eblock will be full of women and children i will be with the other men during the attack thus i alone among you can choose fairly the frenchwoman looked incredulous you will die with the others if that is our fate now please listen to me the old woman who had likened the eblock to a lifeboat got to her feet and pointed at the frenchwoman youve sung your song long enough little bird the shoemaker knows what must be done sit down and hold your tongue the other women nodded in agreement jonas wondered if it was his fathers promise of selfsacrifice that had silenced them or merely the fact that hed volunteered to lift from their shoulders the responsibility of choosing here is my decision avram said places in the eblock will be given to jewish women and children no one outside this block will be told anything there was a sudden buzz of conversation but it died quickly any woman among you who has a child will be given a place if you have a child please raise your hand fifteen women raised their hands from the floor keep your hands raised how many of those left are thirty years old or younger eight more women raised their hands thats twentyfive adults said avram including rachel jansen and the sephardic woman who sleeps in the childrens block how many women left are between thirtyone years and forty fourteen women raised their hands avram counted silently thats thirtynine there is room for only thirtyfive adults please keep your hands raised for gods sake snapped a woman with her hand in the air do four extra matter so much four extra could kill everyone jonas said depending on how long you must stay inside to survive i was told to allow only twentyfive adults im stretching it as it is avram looked at the women who had not raised their hands some of them were staring at the floor others weeping openly the old woman who had spoken about the lifeboat tried to comfort them jonas blinked as he saw a hand drop a woman who looked to be in her late twenties stood up where the hand had been i will stay here she said but you are young protested an older woman you will have children someday you deserve a place the volunteer looked at the floor and shook her head i will never have children i was sterilized at auschwitz the other girls died and i was sent here i dont know why it doesnt matter i will stay god bless you said the old woman thats thirtyeight avram said stoically two more hands dropped i lost my children long ago said a voice and my husband in the last selection the same said the other woman i dont think it matters much where we are anyway ive been under bombs before if one bomb fell on the eblock it would kill everyone inside i will take my chances here stern felt a stab of guilt because of his lie but there was no help for it he glanced toward the rear of the block no sign of rachel jansen he was about to call her name when a bald woman jumped up and pointed at someone seated on the floor shes lying shes fortytwo how can you do it shoshana the woman being pointed at kept her hand rigidly in the air im thirtynine she said the accuser shook her head violently i know her from lublin shes fortytwo the accused woman stood up her face working in terror yes im fortytwo is that so old why shouldnt i have a chance to live look at my hips i can still bear children she turned around in place in an almost lewd exhibition of her surviving sexual charms jonas saw that some of the other women who had been excluded were becoming upset he stepped forward ready to restrain the overwrought woman if you want to keep living so badly go in my place another woman had stood up she was emaciated and nearly bald with skin like parchment but certainly not older than thirty i lived in warsaw she said there is no one left in my family take my place no protested several women you deserve your place the young woman raised her hands palms up in a haunting gesture of resignation please she said i am so tired jonas stepped in front of his father hands down he said it is decided he called to the back of the barracks frau jansen it is time how will we reach the eblock without the germans seeing us asked a young woman i plan to short out the electricity just before the attack you only have to cross fifteen meters of open ground to reach the alley each woman must take at least one child to the eblock some two once inside do whatever you must to fit everyone in the ceiling is low but you can hold the small children on your shoulders what about the sentry they posted at our gate we cant get out that way and many of the children cant climb the fence im going to kill the sentry jonas said my father will put on his uniform and stand in his place until it is time for you to move i suggest you begin moving them at ten minutes until eight use your own judgment but no matter what happens the eblock door must be sealed shut before eight how will we get out asked a worried voice from the floor there is no door handle inside the eblock i will leave my machine gun one of you will have to shoot out a window its the only way how long do we wait two hours if you can stand it there should be two hours of air plus a small oxygen bottle as a reserve after that you must get away from here quickly take a truck and try to reach the polish border there are partisans there in the forest jonass chest felt suddenly hollow rachel jansen was walking toward him like a specter out of the darkness she held a small bundle in her arms wrapped in one of the prison blankets when she reached him she immediately handed it over there were tears on her face take care of her herr stern she said she wont make any trouble for you jonas pulled back the blanket he saw the ravenhaired head of hannah jansen the little girl was fast asleep he passed the child back to rachel just a little longer he said i have something to do before i go he handed the silenced schmeisser to his father and drew the ss dagger from the black sheath at his belt its gleaming nineinch blade was engraved with the motto my honor is loyalty he closed his hand around the nazi eagle on the black haft of the dagger and held it up before his fathers face lets go i need your assistance rottenführer the sentry standing at the block gate turned and peered through the darkness at jonas stern who stood just inside the wire fence jawohl standartenführer the sentry opened the gate stepped inside and closed it behind him jonas led him toward the jewish womens block i need to remove one of the jews for further questioning rottenführer some of her friends may try to stop me allow me standartenführer the sentry shouldered his way in front of stern and marched up the steps stern stayed close behind him the moment the guard passed through the barracks door jonas clapped his left hand around the mans forehead jerked back his neck and dragged the doubleedged dagger across his throat with his right hand there was no cry only a rush of air and warm blood stern held onto the head long enough to guide the body down to the barracks floor then sheathed his knife and darted out of the block to stand at the gate while his father put on the sentrys clothes within seconds the women stripped the dead corporal of clothes boots and weapons and gave all to avram who immediately put them on and went out to change places with his son jonas opened the gate for avram to pass out then slipped back inside and stood just behind his father father i beg you he whispered please come out with me get away from this place avram reached back through the gateposts and clenched his sons arm no more talk of that then at least go into the eblock you can lead the women into poland no more jonas avram looked back over his sons shoulder and whispered rachel jonas turned and saw the young woman standing behind him tears glittering in her dark eyes hannah was in her arms open your hand my son avram commanded puzzled jonas slipped his hand between the gateposts he felt something small and hard like seeds pressed into it those are diamonds said avram finding rachels eyes yes i kept two for myself but i give them now to your daughter give yours to jonas as well rachel he will need them to buy passage to palestine rachel had all her diamonds ready but when she saw the shoemaker give up his stones for hannah she pressed only two into jonass hand after pocketing the diamonds jonas drew the bloody ss dagger from the sheath at his belt and held it out to rachel if anyone tries to stop you in the alley he said use this move close to them and strike quickly aim for the upper stomach rachel took the dagger and held it beneath the bundle that was hannah avram turned his back to the fence again listen to me jonas he whispered when you get to palestine take this child to your mother tell leah to raise her as if she were your sister you understand jonas struggled to gain control of his voice yes he was about to take the little girl from rachel when he saw three ss men standing at the back gate of the camp they were in easy sight of the open ground the women would have to cross to reach the eblock look he whispered my god said avram what are they doing jonas couldnt make out faces or rank badges only two men standing inside the gate smoking cigarettes and talking to the sentry who stood outside he checked his watch he should be driving out of the front gate now do you think theyll go away in time avram asked i dont know father walk with me to my car with you in that uniform we can drive right out of here rachel grabbed jonass arm you cant do that you cant leave hannah behind well take her with us awakened by her mothers panic the child whimpered softly in the darkness avram touched rachels arm have no fear he said jonas forget the men at the gate take this child and go the eblock was a long chance anyway jonas stared at the three ss men his mind whirling avram held up the dead corporals machine gun if they dont move i will try to kill them as avram spoke these words jonas spied two more ss men they were standing in the shadow of the hospital wall examining the polished black mercedes that had mysteriously appeared in camp in that moment jonas knew he would not reach the gas cylinders in time it would be mcconnell or no one he slipped through the gate and hugged his father as tightly as he could as if to cling to the moment for the rest of his life i will never forget you he said in a choked voice then he snatched away the dead sentrys gun and threw it onto the snow that weapon isnt silenced he said take this he handed avram his schmeisser avram made as if to speak but his voice failed him a brief light flickered in his eyes something very much like second thoughts but he pushed his son away go he said have the child ready jonas told him if im alive in five minutes ill be back for her jonas stern marched across the frozen appellplatz like erwin rommel inspecting the afrika korps his only weapon was his walther ppk hed given his silenced schmeisser to his father and his ss dagger to rachel jansen whenever one of the ss men smoking at the back gate inhaled an orange glow lit the upper half of his face by this light stern saw that two of the guards were privates the other a sergeant major the men still had not noticed him hauptscharführer he snapped singling out the senior man you are not in the habit of saluting superior officers sergeant gunther sturm looked up in amazement at the graygreen uniform and iron cross first class an angry sd colonel was the last thing he expected to encounter at totenhausens back gate standartenführer he cried heil hitler the privates quickly followed his example stern raised his chin and looked down his nose at the bullnecked sergeant you are hauptscharführer sturm sturms eyes widened jawohl standartenführer dont look so frightened i have bigger fish to fry than you i am here to arrest major wolfgang schörner for conspiring to reveal state secrets i shall require your assistance hauptscharführer and that of these men as well obergruppenführer kaltenbrunner in berlin will appreciate your help sturms stubbled face went slack then brightened with malicious glee standartenführer he said unctuously im not one to complain about a superior but i have had suspicions of my own about the sturmbannführer why did you not report these suspicions sturm was momentarily at a loss ive been searching for proof standartenführer one does not accuse a holder of the knights cross lightly herr schörner will not wear the knights cross much longer hauptscharführer sturm looked at the two privates astonished by his good luck what do you want us to do standartenführer stern glanced at his watch the women would begin moving in thirteen minutes now he regretted giving up the silenced schmeisser here is the situation hauptscharführer we believe allied commandos intend to attack this camp tonight to assassinate herr doktor brandt and destroy his laboratory we believe schörner arranged this attack through contacts with the polish resistance gunther sturm could barely contain his excitement the herr doktor was right sd reinforcements will arrive from berlin within thirty minutes stern went on but with your help i will immediately arrest schörner and remove him from the camp to prevent him from assisting these commandos in any way are you ready sturm jerked a luger from his belt and shook it in the air i know how to deal with traitors standartenführer if schörner resists ill blow his head off stern nodded bring these men as well schörner is a dangerous man sturm looked suddenly uncertain i must leave one behind standartenführer the commandant could have me shot if i left this gate unguarded stern glared at the private who stood on the other side of the wire this is your last smoke break he said dont take your eyes off of those trees the commandos will almost certainly attack from the hills is that clear jawohl standartenführer the grayfaced private whipped around instantly his eyes on the dark trees that had seemed benign only a moment ago to the headquarters hauptscharführer stern walked a step ahead of the two ss men as they crossed the appellplatz perhaps i should have my dogs patrol the back fence sturm suggested no need for that yet said stern the last thing he needed was attack dogs prowling the area of the eblock we will deploy the dogs only at the last moment we want them fresh very good standartenführer they passed the rear of the cinema annex which was contiguous to the headquarters building as they reached the front door of the headquarters it opened and a tall officer wearing a waffen ss uniform and a black eyepatch stepped through it wolfgang schörner froze in midstep when he saw the sd uniform stern calmly drew his walther and aimed it at the astonished major sturmbannführer wolfgang schörner by order of the führer i place you under arrest major schörner stared in amazement at sergeant sturm who had drawn his luger then looked back at stern i beg your pardon standartenführer you heard me relieve him of his pistol hauptscharführer schörner made no move to resist as sturm yanked his luger from its holster who is this man hauptscharführer stern held up his hand i am standartenführer ritter stern from the sicherheitsdienst in berlin as you can plainly see i received no communication about your arrival of course you didnt all will become clear in berlin berlin schörners eyes moved up and down sterns uniform taking in each button patch badge crease and stain hauptscharführer he said the standartenführer seems to be missing his dagger dont you find that interesting stern waved his pistol toward the hospital where the mercedes waited to my car hauptscharführer he said tersely but gunther sturm was looking at schörner sturm knew the face of guilt and as much as he hated the major schörner was not acting guilty of anything i am perfectly willing to go to berlin schörner said equably but shouldnt we at least ask to see this mans papers first an sd officer who loses his dagger is subject to arrest himself sturm looked uncertainly at stern standartenführer stern glanced impatiently at his watch an officer in a hurry you will regret this he said he brought out his wallet and handed it to sturm who passed it straight to schörner these papers give you authority to inspect security arrangements at totenhausen schörner looked up not to place me under arrest by statute the sd has complete powers of examination and arrest over the ss stern said i do not need a written order to arrest a traitor he lowered his voice to a menacing pitch now move to my car these orders are dated four days ago schörner observed not moving an inch did it take you four days to drive up from berlin before stern could respond schörner said the suntan interests me as well has the sun begun shining in the tiergarten in the dead of winter stern raised his pistol to schörners face the major showed no sign of fear stern wanted to pull the trigger but he knew it would be the worst possible mistake he could make where is your dagger standartenführer schörner asked stern forced himself not to look down at the empty sheath on his belt this showed considerable nerve considering that his mind had gone blank a bemused look crossed schörners face with all respect standartenführer on what day did you receive your dagger it was funny in a way thought stern he was replaying the scene in the jewish womens block when he had been questioned to prove he was a jew only major schörner had not asked him what year it was on the hebrew calendar i have not come here to answer your questions he snapped you will answer mine schörner glanced at sturm what do you think hauptscharführer a simple enough question dont you think even you could answer that one gunther sturm wore the expression of an attack dog being given commands by two masters he hated schörner viciously but those very qualities he hated most made the idea of schörner betraying germany an impossibility with agonizing slowness he turned until his luger was aimed just to the right of sterns belly if the standartenführer could answer the question he said in an apologetic tone when did you receive your dagger stern had always known this moment would come someday a moment without options a truly impossible situation he had simply overestimated his abilities while underestimating those of a combat veteran named wolfgang schörner he thought of the cyanide capsule he had earlier transferred from his star of david medallion into his pocket but he felt no inclination to try to swallow it no matter what the bastards did to him they would not break him before the gas descended on the camp i dont recall the exact day he said it was thats interesting said schörner since all ceremonial daggers are awarded only on november ninth stern looked at his watch his only thought was to give the women time to get the children to the eblock and he knew he could do that there is only one solution he said call obergruppenführer kaltenbrunner at sd headquarters in berlin stern reversed the walther in his hand and handed it butt first to sergeant sturm bewildered the ss man accepted the weapon a faint smile touched schörners mouth where did you meet this man hauptscharführer he asked at the back gate sturmbannführer you have someone guarding the gate now ja how many technicians are in the factory the full shift thirtyfour men theyre taking the place apart schörner nodded while he thought i want every one of the technicians moved into the cinema immediately and placed under guard then bolt every door on the factory clear zu befehl sturmbannführer one call to berlin will tell me if the major here is fish or fowl i want those technicians locked in the cinema by the time im off the phone the civilian nurses as well every one of them get moving sergeant sturm hurried into the headquarters building schörner turned back to stern this has been most entertaining if you are who you say you are i will soon be without a dagger myself if not well schörner looked over sterns shoulder youd better come with us schütze with the barrel of a privates rifle between his shoulder blades stern followed schörner into the headquarters building he stole one last glance at his watch as he passed through the door ive heard no explosion yet hes still got nine minutes said mcconnell from the kitchen table he turned to the stove where anna stood warming herself would we definitely hear a grenade on the hill yes i think we should go now something feels wrong to me thats just nerves its not time yet mcconnell was feeling butterflies himself as if he were waiting to run the biggest race of his life he had just gulped a large glass of water to make up for the fluid loss from a half hour inside his antigas suit his air cylinder stood on the floor the corrugated hose wrapped around it anna turned from the stove i think theyve caught him she said mcconnell angrily slapped the table then why havent we heard shooting an alarm something you think he would let them take him without a fight he might his father is there remember mcconnell took a deep breath and tried to stay calm arranged in front of him were his toggle rope his clear vinyl head mask the mauser rifle hed traded from stan wojik and the bright swatch of tartan that sir donald cameron had given him on the bridge at achnacarry the note from churchill was folded in annas diary which hed hidden in the leg of his oilskin suit sterns gas suit was folded in the backseat of gretas volkswagen but where was stern anna touched his arm hes relying on us to send down the gas she said i think we should wait on the hill im doing what he told me mcconnell said doggedly he took another long drink of water eight more minutes well make it to the hill in time she reached out and took his hand all right whatever happens im glad for last night it will make everything easier mcconnell started to ask what she meant but he didnt he had a feeling he knew when avram stern saw his son walking back across the appellplatz ahead of sergeant sturm and an ss private he almost panicked instead he tried to think like his son jonas had come this far without getting caught he must know what he was doing the three men walked around the cinema and disappeared could jonas be trying to reach the main gate it was fifty meters away and difficult to see clearly in the darkness but avram would know if a man passed through it no one did two minutes after jonas disappeared avram saw sergeant sturm burst from the rear door of the headquarters and sprint toward the factory with five ss men behind him had jonas made a break for freedom had he concocted some diversion to draw the ss away from the eblock avram felt a flash of fear as whitecoated lab technicians began streaming out of the factory gate with sergeant sturms men prodding them along the soft crunch of footsteps on the snow behind him told him rachel and the other chosen women were slipping into the jewish childrens block in preparation for the move to the eblock he looked down at his wristwatch an illegal item he had accepted as payment for a repair job on a pair of ss knee boots the wristwatch of a dead jew jonas had planned to short out the electricity prior to the attack that would not happen now without the cover of absolute darkness the women and children would have to cross open ground in plain view of the sentry standing at the back gate they would never make it with quivering hands the shoemaker unslung the silenced schmeisser and started for the back gate berlin never heard of you major schörner put down the telephone and smiled stern stared impassively into the black barrel of his own walther i talked to kaltenbrunner himself schörner said he wants me to send you to berlin for questioning but i have a few questions of my own for you first a door banged open behind stern he did not turn but the clatter of boots told him at least three men had entered the office sturmbannführer the technicians are locked in the cinema said sergeant sturm the factory is sealed and the nurses schörner asked the three who were on duty are in the cinema with the technicians greta müller is dead of course i sent a rider for frau jaspers thats five and the sixth fraulein kaas sturmbannführer it seems she left the hospital early today schörner sighed impatiently and i just found out she was driving greta müllers car in the confusion after finding the bodies in the sewer in the confusion no one noticed schörner finished in fact i did notice that but because fraulein kaas is the sister of a gauleiters wife i did not consider her a likely candidate for treason how foolish of me now that i think of it she was quite a friend of the müller girl stern stole a glance at his watch he prayed mcconnell would leave the cottage on schedule schörner tapped his right hand on his desk do you know what i think hauptscharführer i think our ersatz standartenführer looks much too clean to have been hiding in the forest for the past few days he looks like hes been enjoying local hospitality eating well by the look of him where does fraulein kaas live sturm a old farmers cottage on the southern edge of dornow schörner nodded i know that cottage he stood up suddenly and pocketed sterns walther im going to take a detachment of men and search it but herr doktor brandt ordered the camp sealed schörners jaw tightened i am in charge of security here not brandt this man is no longer a threat his comrades are the allies might well be planning to kidnap brandt i want you to place the herr doktor under guard schörner took an extra clip of ammunition from his desk drawer and retrieved his luger from sergeant sturm if theres any trouble while im gone hauptscharführer do whatever you must to prevent the herr doktor from falling into enemy hands he looked up pointedly do you understand sturm cleared his throat does the sturmbannführer mean that i should kill him precisely sturm nodded soberly schörners sudden transformation from altar boy to ruthless commander had stunned him what about this one he asked pointing at stern i need to know everything he knows who sent him how many men in his unit what their plans are everything i believe youre up to the task hauptscharführer gunther sturm knew he was up to the task but after killing the polish giant by mistake he was a little hesitant to take on another important interrogation exactly how far may i go sturmbannführer schörner pulled on a greatcoat and marched to the door of the office dont kill him is that clear enough sturm saluted zu befehl sturmbannführer good hunting schörner went out sturm lifted the phone and said karl tell glaub and becker to guard the herr doktor until they hear otherwise from me he hung up and motioned to two ss privates standing at the back of the office hold him in the chair he said stern tensed as four hands took him by the upper arms and squeezed tight enough to close off his circulation sergeant sturm quickly searched the sd uniform laughing at the cyanide capsule and pocketing the keys to sabines mercedes then he smiled and drew his ss dagger from the black sheath at his belt it was identical to the one stern had used to slash the throat of the sentry the one he had in his ignorance given to rachel jansen sergeant sturm casually cut the buttons off of the sd tunic then sliced the undershirt beneath it down the middle ach he cried staring at sterns naked torso look at this the two ss privates leaned down and gaped at the livid scars that covered sterns chest and abdomen it was sturm who first noticed that the scars extended down into the trousers stand him up he said when stern was on his feet sturm cut his belt in half and jerked the sd trousers down to his knees hes missing his last inch sturm crowed ill be damned hes a jew a stinking jew in an sd uniform stern stopped breathing when the sergeant lifted his scrotum with the cold dagger blade look at him sturm said laughing shrinking like a wilted radish how long do you think it will take me to make this one sing felix one of the privates looked appraisingly at sterns scarred chest twenty marks says he holds out for two hours thats a good bet jonas said in a soft voice he looked straight into gunther sturms eyes i hope youre a patient man if the two privates had not been holding him up sturms fist would have doubled him over on the floor as it was he could not draw breath for nearly ten seconds put him back in the chair sturm said in an hour hell be begging us to kill him ariel weitz stood motionless at the window of klaus brandts office door brandts back was to the door he was reading some medical charts but weitz knew he was actually waiting for a telephone call an hour earlier the commandant had placed a longdistance call to reichsführer himmler in berlin even the mighty waited like servants on the whim of the former chicken farmer who ruled the ss weitzs hands tingled as he stared at brandts whitejacketed back every gray hair sprouting from the thick prussian neck made him want to scream with hatred and disgust he saw the shining dome of brandts balding head as a perfect spot in which to drive a dozen roofing nails a hundred times he had thought of slamming the famous hands in the steel door of the isolation ward a thousand times of injecting the meningococcus bacillus into his spine as brandt had done so many times to his children but tonight tonight would pay for all at the sound of boots in the main corridor weitz moved away from the door two ss men hurried past him and took up station on either side of brandts door a complication weitz walked up the hall to a small examining room off the main corridor here he had cached the remainder of his weapons and also his prize hanging in a narrow closet was one of the raubhammer gas suits tested in the afternoon now thoroughly decontaminated weighing less than half of what previous models did it utilized a filter canister and a breathing bag which contained a small cylinder of pure oxygen one of the other raubhammer suits was hanging in brandts office but weitz didnt care about that he would only need the one he wondered what the two ss guards would think when they saw brandts pet jew rounding the corner with a submachine gun in his hand whatever it was would be the last thoughts they ever had but why had they so suddenly appeared had schörner finally comprehended the danger facing the camp a minute ago weitz had noticed sergeant sturm rushing a long line of factory technicians across the appellplatz toward the cinema but he saw no real problem in that no matter what schörner might have learned he was way behind the game at this point too far behind to catch up weitz was reaching for the raubhammer suit when he heard the roar of a troop truck avram stern had taken three steps toward totenhausens back gate when shouted orders and the rumble of motors stopped him in his tracks he turned to see major schörners gray field car speeding out of totenhausens front gate followed closely by an open truck full of ss troops all armed to the teeth avram felt his last hope wither away he closed his hand around the schmeisser and started back toward the sentry only to be stopped again by the sound of a slamming door ariel weitz was standing on the front steps of the hospital staring after the disappearing vehicles with a puzzled look on his face weitz cocked his head back almost as if he sensed a human gaze upon him when he finally looked toward the inmate blocks the shoemaker made the fastest and riskiest decision of his life he would never know why he did it if someone had asked him at the time he might have said something about the tears he had seen on weitzs face on the night of the big selection he had thought about weitz many times since that night how the hated informer had free run of the camp how he was so trusted by the ss that they occasionally let him go into dornow alone to run errands for them and how to mount an operation like the one jonas was involved in the british would need a good source of information inside totenhausen and the conclusion avram had come to was that no jew could be so thoroughly corrupted by the nazis as ariel weitz seemed to be and so when weitz looked from the hospital steps toward the blocks avram motioned for him to come over to the block gate weitz hesitated when he saw the sentry beckoning from the inmate blocks he did not want to cross the appellplatz but the man signaling to him was ss even so close to his moment of triumph he could not very well refuse he hurried across the snow and stopped before the sentry looking up with his usual obsequious mask you he blurted what are you doing in that uniform avram reached out and closed his left hand around the back of weitzs neck with his right he drew the ss dagger from his belt and held its point under weitzs chin if you cry out he whispered ill cut your throat like a piece of scrap leather weitz shook his head violently no you dont understand he stared at the ss uniform i dont understand either avram pricked the knifepoint into weitzs skin tell me one thing are you involved in what is about to happen the little mans eyes grew wide i know what is going to happen but i have my own plans i knew it you little bootlicker youve been pretending all the time listen to me my son has been taken by the ss unless he is freed the attack will not take place your son your son is the jewish standartenführer yes my god where is he now in the cinema with the workers i dont know theyre probably interrogating him somewhere avram shook weitzs neck you must free him you know everything about this camp weitz looked furious at this interruption of his plans but he nodded ill see what i can do what are you going to do stand here and wait to die avram let go you just free my son the moment weitz turned back toward the hospital rachel jansen stepped out of the shadows behind avram why were you talking to him she whispered he works for the ss never mind are all the women in the childrens block yes she held up the bundle in her arms and here is hannah where is your son avram shook his head taken youll have to carry hannah to the eblock with you rachel moaned softly avram heard a tiny frightened voice in the bundled blanket rachel comforted the child in dutch then switched back to german what are we to do shoemaker i cannot move the children with that sentry at the back gate he will surely see us and raise the alarm go back inside but the gas is coming be ready to move quickly ill be back here in one minute to get you if im not youre on your own do what you think is best rachel grabbed his arm through the gateposts if you see your son anywhere tell him to come and get hannah i beg you herr stern ill tell him avram jerked back the bolt on the schmeisser and started toward the back gate jonas stern tried to keep himself conscious as sergeant sturm worked on him the man showed an aptitude for his job he had enthusiasm which was important physical torture was tiring work the blows to the side of the head were the worst sterns ears were ringing so loudly he could hardly think he wanted to let go to give in to unconsciousness but he forced himself to keep awake because he had one advantage over his tormentor he knew exactly what was about to happen to totenhausen camp and perhaps just perhaps when the plastic explosive he had molded around the heads of the buried cylinders detonated he would still be physically able to make a run for the main gate but to do that he would have to be conscious not an easy thing when someone was trying to pound your brain into jelly when sergeant sturm switched to the knife he was almost grateful avram stern had not killed a human being since but he did not pause to debate the issue with himself as he moved across the snow toward the sentry he wondered how loud the report of the silenced schmeisser would be as a veteran of world war one he found it difficult to believe anything could completely silence the report of a machine gun he decided to use the dagger he tried to walk confidently arrogantly swaggering the way the ss guards did he concentrated on the sentrys back the man was standing just inside the gate facing the trees avram thought of calling out softly so as not to startle him but the man seemed oblivious avram looked down at the silver dagger in his hand it would take a powerful stroke to penetrate a greatcoat and winter tunic jonas had made a great point of cutting the other sentrys throat but avram had no training in such things he fleetingly wished for a bayonet like the one he had carried in the great war or better yet a trusty sharpened spade the weapon of choice for trench combat but this was a different war kamerad he called in a surprisingly natural voice do you have a match the sentry was startled but when he saw the brown uniform he relaxed and reached into his greatcoat i could use a smoke myself he said with a nervous laugh that sd bastard scared the life out of me as the match flared the young sentrys eyes played over avrams face there was an instant of shared recognition avram stern saw a boy for whom he had crafted a pair of soft slippers as a gift for a girlfriend the sentry saw the middleaged face of the shoemaker avrams arm seemed alive with rage as he drove the dagger straight up into the soft skin beneath the sentrys chin he felt a sudden shock in his wrist the dagger point had driven cleanly through palate sinuses and brain and hit the roof of the sentrys skull stopping his thrust with the daggers hilt still three centimeters below the jaw looking straight into the wide blue eyes avram yanked the haft of the dagger once to the left then let the body fall onto the snow he tried to dislodge the blade from the sentrys head but it was beyond his power he sat the boy up against the fence as if he had fallen asleep on guard duty the haft of the dagger kept the head in a semiupright position avram wiped his bloody hands on the sentrys coat and started back toward the inmate blocks his watch read he almost fired his schmeisser in panic when a group of silent shadows brushed past him in the darkness then he realized what was happening rachel jansen had started the migration to the eblock the cameron tartan flew like a bright flag from the strap of mcconnells air tank harness as he carried it through the cottage door anna close on his heels wait he said its stern a half mile away a pair of headlights was moving across the flat stretch of road that led from the hills to dornow a second pair appeared out of the darkness at the foot of the hills following the first are they chasing him mcconnell asked anxiously its not stern anna said in a flat voice its ten till eight now if he was free hed be on the pylon look at the difference in those lights thats a field car out front with a troop truck behind my god theyre coming schörner must have caught stern and broken him she jerked the air cylinder off of mcconnells shoulder and pulled him toward gretas volkswagen there she dropped the cylinder in the rear seat and took four grenades from sterns leather bag get into the car she cried get down on the floor hurry what the hell are you going to do mcconnell asked theres only one road to the power station and theyre on it we cant drive past them im going to have to stand in the cottage door so that when they get here theyll come straight for me when they do you he grabbed her arms and shook her im not leaving you here to be killed then well both die for nothing he could feel the rumble of the approaching vehicles theres got to be another way anna glanced back at the oncoming headlights all right she said she dropped the grenades back into the front seat follow me she raced into the cottage and switched on every light then pulled open the cellar door and shouted keep quiet sabine theres going to be shooting you could be killed by mistake while mcconnell stared in bewilderment she slammed the cellar door and pulled open a kitchen drawer from which she took a revolver he had never seen stan wojik gave it to me she said pulling him into the bedroom a small door led onto the empty field behind the cottage anna went first racing around the side of the building and dropping to her knees at the corner mcconnell followed more slowly under the weight of his suit and the mauser rifle as he reached the corner she made a dash for the volkswagen he went after her and was surprised to see her go for the drivers seat before she could open the door he pushed her aside smashed the window with his rifle butt and shattered the interior light then he opened the door and shoved her all the way across the front seat get down he said all the way on the floor anna obeyed mcconnell stretched flat on his back on the seat his head just beneath the passenger window inches from her face his feet angled down beneath the steering wheel he held the rifle tight along his body right forefinger on the trigger why the lights he asked theyll assume anyone breaking blackout regulations so flagrantly must be inside but if they do check the cars first she held up her revolver the squeal of automobile brakes mingled with the groan of a heavy truck gearing down mcconnell tensed and tried to decipher the sounds the truck stopped between the car and the cottage but kept its engine idling four doors opened and closed heavy boots crunched on the snow mcconnell raised his head to peek out but his and annas breath had already fogged the window glass he heard a loud rapping on the cottage door fräulein kaas shouted a male voice fräulein kaas open the door schörner anna hissed the sound of the submachine gun hit mcconnell like an electric shock schörner had shot the lock off the door a muffled female voice shouted help me in the name of the führer help me christ sabine got loose mcconnell heard boots clattering on the floorboards of the cottage anna gripped his arm what can you see she asked he sat up slowly and rubbed a small clear circle in the fogged window on the drivers side a half dozen soldiers by the cottage door maybe a dozen more in the troop truck get ready when you hear me shout start the car mcconnell had barely got his feet on the pedals when he saw anna pull the pins out of two grenades she opened the volkswagens door and stepped out as casually as if she were getting out at a restaurant then turned toward the troop truck and tossed the grenades she was firing her pistol into the knot of soldiers by the door even before the grenades exploded for gods sake move she screamed with only one foot in the car the volkswagens engine roared to life mcconnell floored the accelerator but the tires spun in vain on the ice two grenades detonated a split second apart in blinding white flashes anna kept shooting mcconnell saw an ss man charge through the cottage door then fly backward like a dog jerked on a leash anna dove back into the car and pulled the door shut and he eased up on the gas and the tires caught the volkswagen fishtailed onto the road he thanked god for the winters he had spent in england most georgia natives couldnt drive a car half a mile on ice like this anna reloaded her pistol and aimed it back over the seat toward the cottage as they sped away theyre not following she cried what are they doing questioning your sister mcconnell kept his eyes focused on the road put on sterns gas suit put it on wolfgang schörner picked himself up off the cottage floor and walked calmly to the door he watched the taillights of the volkswagen racing back up the hill road the ss corporal who had been driving the troop truck stumbled up to him his face white with horror five men dead sturmbannführer eight wounded what do we do first you calm down schörner took a deep satisfied breath the war has finally come to totenhausen rottenführer people die in wars do we go after them not yet the fools are running straight toward the camp he turned and looked back into the kitchen sabine hoffman was being helped off of the floor by an ss private i apologize for the interruption madam as i was saying i met you several months ago in berlin your husband is gauleiter hoffman yes sturmbannführer can you tell me who left in that car my sister shes gone mad there were two men with her most of the day one american the other a jew he was dressed as an sd officer we have that man in custody schörner said in a reassuring voice do you know what your sister and this american planned to do tonight i heard the jew saying something about an electrical station schörner felt a prick of anxiety anything else anna was asking the american something about poison gas he seemed to know quite a lot about it the color drained from schörners face is there a telephone here sabine shook her head rottenführer i want four men in my car the rest follow in the truck what about the wounded sturmbannführer some of them cant walk leave them in the road twentytwo miles north of totenhausen the navigator in the lead bomber of general sherman sighted the mouth of the recknitz river below him thats it sir time to turn squadron leader harry sumner banked the mosquito to the south everyone with us jacobs right on our tail sumner checked his fuel gauge a headwind had put them slightly behind schedule but they would benefit by the same wind on the ride home they had lost one plane already forced to turn back due to mechanical failure that was the way of it but they still had more than enough bombload and target indicators to carry out the mission think you can find this place jacobs its supposed to be almost covered with trees the navigator was holding a pensized torch in his teeth and studying a map just stay over the river he said in a garbled voice the hs will show me the bends if this map is accurate we can use dornow village and the river as brackets flares will give us a visual on the power station and the camp sumner peered through the dark windscreen the silver line of the river led them southward like a magic road a rum mission this even by special duties squadron standards all the way into germany to bomb a tiny prison camp for soe the air marshals constantly fought duff smith tooth and nail to keep their precious planes out of his clutches how had he managed to divert a mosquito squadron for this sumner had mentioned it to his superior at wick but all hed got in reply was a sour look and a mumbled if we want to fight this one well have to go all the way to downing street he hadnt known what to make of that but he did know one thing from one thousand feet without ackack his squadron could hit an outdoor privy dead center and leave nothing but a crater for a square mile around eight minutes out the navigator said theyre still not following mcconnell said keeping his eyes on the rearview mirror and pushing the volkswagen as fast as he dared they will anna thrust her arms into the sleeves of the oilskin jumpsuit and started to zip up its front he caught her hand you have to put on the mask first then zip the suit over the part that drapes over your shoulders its the only way to get an airtight seal anna reached back for both masks put yours on now he said ill be able to hear you if you need to talk the road climbed sharply mcconnell reduced speed just ahead he saw the first curve of the switchback road that wound across the hills as he took the turn he caught sight of lights in the distance behind them there they are he said you know anything about compressed air bottles ive administered oxygen a hundred times same principle open the valve attach the air hose to your mask and breathe normally he wrenched the wheel to avoid colliding with a bank of birch trees jesus this is like a logging road anna had her mask on now it blurred her facial features and dulled her eyes she looked like an extra in a flash gordon feature the boots are too big she said her voice buzzing through the speech transmission diaphragm near her mouthpiece put them on anyway and zip the legs down around them he braked for another curve how far to the power station not far ill drive the car into the trees schörner and his men should drive right past us anna nodded and pointed to the left slow down he let the vw drift past the transformer station he saw a wooden watchmans hut inside the dark jungle of metal struts a faint light glowing in its window thirty meters past the station he turned off the road and rolled forward until tree trunks forced him to stop he pulled on his mask and zipped his suit then climbed out the silence was eerie after the frantic skirmish at the cottage anna helped him strap on his air tank he felt like a draft horse wearing blinders before he attached his air hose he leaned forward and said i guess wed better take the guns with us she shook her head and handed him the mauser rifle what are you doing im staying here she said schörner may stop at the power station he might even turn in here we cant take the chance but you couldnt stop them if they did ive got sterns grenades she said and my pistol you keep your rifle as a last resort anna go he started to say something else but she slung the mauser over his shoulder and pushed him farther into the trees he turned back and looked at her she was standing motionless in the dark beside the car a finefigured woman wrapped in heavy black oilskin and wearing a clear vinyl bag over her head ludicrous tragic he thought of the diary she had labored over so long that was now wedged into the left leg of his gas suit he hoped she would be alive to make a final entry when this night was over he raised his hand then turned and trudged across the snow toward the pylon major schörner raced up the hills at nearly twice the speed mcconnell had the excitable corporal occupied the field cars passenger seat while three more ss men were scrunched into the back each armed with a submachine gun somehow the troop truck was managing to keep up probably because its driver was as angry and bent on revenge as the storm troopers in back schörner issued a quick volley of orders to the corporal well split at the transformer station you take two men and go back to totenhausen in the car tell sturm to expect a commando attack the electricity may go off at any time that means the electric fences will be off thank god i ordered those mines laid tell sturm to put half his men around the gas storage tanks and the other half around the factory tell him the field car nearly skated off the road as schörner took a dogleg curve but he held it under control tell him ill be there as soon as i can ill use the men from the truck to surround the power station the american must be trying to detonate explosives laid earlier in the week the detonator will probably be somewhere in the trees outside the station ach what i would give for sturms dogs the corporals face lit up but we have a dog sturmbannführer in the cab of the truck at last a little luck schörner slung the car around another curve and jammed the gas pedal to the floor the strange thing he thought gripping the wheel like a grand prix champion was that as bad as the situation was he felt better than he had in months mcconnell stumbled the last few meters to the pylon his throat stinging from the dry air in the cylinder on his back the climbing spikes and harness lay at the foot of the nearest support pole as stern had promised hed never worn anything like them before but the principle was simple enough one sharp iron spike for the instep of each foot affixed to fishhookshaped pieces of iron that fit beneath the feet and rose along the inner calves with leather straps to hold them on the safety harness was basically a broad heavy belt with a steel ring in front which clipped to a second belt sized to fit around the pole mcconnell dropped his rifle sat down and strapped on the spikes that done he slung the mauser over his shoulder fastened his safety belt around the support pole and drove his right spike into the wood he expected it to break loose when he put his weight on it but the spike held he bearhugged the pole and raised himself on the spike then he slid the belt up leaned back to steady himself and drove his left spike into the pole two feet up in this manner he began to ascend the pole at a surprising speed although he seemed to be circling it as he went up like a snake climbing a tree he couldnt see much in the darkness but he knew from sterns quick briefing that the double pylons marched down a narrow swath that had been cleared through the forested hills their crossarms taller than all but the largest trees a straight run of two thousand feet descending at a thirty degree angle or so stern had told him he cried out as his right spike broke free he slid four feet down the icy pole before managing to hug it tightly enough to stop the safety belt had done almost nothing to retard his fall he prayed that no splinters had torn holes in his gas suit three quarters of the way to the top he saw the lights of the pursuing vehicles racing up the winding hill road they seemed to flicker on and off as he stared down through the trees he dug his spikes into the wood and forced himself higher thinking of anna waiting in the trees below he had almost reached the crossarm when he heard an engine roar to life at first he thought the watchman from the power station had started a vehicle but the sound had come from almost directly beneath the pylon when he realized what was actually happening he almost started back down the pole but of course he would be too late anna had planned it that way there was nothing he could do she had decided to die for the mission ariel weitz stepped out of the front door of the hospital and hurried down the steps wearing herr doktor brandts ss greatcoat which he had pilfered from a closet brandts bulky coat was the only garment that minimized the odd hump at the small of weitzs back caused by the breathing bag of the raubhammer gas suit in his left hand he carried the accompanying gas mask in his right a machine pistol he moved across the appellplatz at a fast walk his eyes on the headquarters building personally he didnt care much what happened to the shoemakers son but the shoemaker had said that without him the gas attack would not take place and having met the young commando weitz believed this might be true he brought out a key to the back door of the headquarters unlocked it and walked inside he heard muffled screaming from the front of the building mentally he ran through the possibilities quartermasters office wireless officers room brandts administrative office schörners office down the corridor to his right from the direction of the cinema he heard a low buzz of voices the factory technicians and their guards he pulled the greatcoat close around him and moved quickly up the hallway he saw the brownjacketed back of the wireless operator at his console the quartermasters office was empty he kept moving brandts administrative office empty the screams grew louder now he heard the sound of a blow men laughing he heard gunther sturms voice braying something about losing a bet he laid the raubhammer gas mask on the floor and held the machine pistol in both hands jonas stern strained against the ropes that held him to the chair his eyes bulging from pain his face and torso were covered with blood sergeant sturm had opened several long shallow cuts on his chest one of sturms assistants had brought salt from the mess and the sergeant had rubbed it into the wounds he had also broken one of the fingers on sterns left hand not by bending it backward but by snapping it at a right angle like a dry twig for a man of sturms strength the effort expended was minimal compared to the expected return yet hed gotten no return the jew masquerading as an sd officer had done nothing but scream and hed done damn little of that considering sturm was beginning to worry that he might indeed lose his twenty marks for sterns part the searing fire of the dagger blade and the caustic burning of the salt had finally merged into a general agony his head and neck throbbed mightily from the blows and his left eye was swollen almost shut but he was conscious it would all be over soon they had taken away his watch but hed stolen a glance at the sergeants only a moment ago it read he hoped he would survive the gas long enough to see sturm shitting his pants as he danced across the floor like a spastic and choked on his own vomit he thought he could hold his breath long enough to see that what are you thinking you smug bastard sturm bellowed ill tell you what im thinking he glanced at his two comrades who leaned against the wall smoking cigarettes im thinking its time to boil some water its not a pretty sight seeing a man scalded a little splash from the soup pot is enough to make a man yell i wonder how youll sound when we dump a steaming kettlefull down the front of your pants one of the ss men dropped his cigarette and stubbed it out with his boot ill get it from the mess stern craned his neck to see if the private was really going to get the water what he saw was the brown back of the mans tunic explode into scarlet and he was lifted off his feet to the accompaniment of gunfire a smallish man wearing an ss greatcoat walked through the doorway a second later stern recognized the man from annas cottage it was brigadier smiths agent scarlett things seemed to happen very slowly after that the other ss private fumbled for his gun sergeant sturm shouted put down that gun weitz have you gone mad but the little man just kept walking forward until the barrel of his machine pistol touched the privates belly and he pulled the trigger the muffled burst eviscerated the private and chewed a hole in the wall behind him sergeant sturm reached for the latch on schörners office window but weitz fired a burst into the wall beside him sturm looked up his face white with panic and confusion weitz he screamed what madness is this the little man began to laugh switching the gun from hand to hand he slipped off the greatcoat and let it fall to the floor stern saw then that he was wearing a rubber suit very much like the ones mcconnell had brought from oxford what the hell is that sturm asked why are you wearing that a brief flash lit the window followed instantly by a muffled explosion that rattled the window in its frame what sturm grunted a second explosion followed the first now weitz looked puzzled as well thats the gas stern shouted from the chair british sarin i buried two cylinders by the dog kennels weitz smiled with sudden understanding you wanted to go outside hauptscharführer go ahead right through the window where i can watch you sergeant sturm conjured a conspiratorial smile how about a deal weitz weve done business before eh what do you want i want to see your eyes popping out of your head while you breathe sarin men were yelling in another part of the building sturm bent over and flipped the latch and jerked up the window when he hesitated weitz shot out the panes over his head wait stern shouted from the chair he has my keys sergeant sturm cut his eyes at jonas then turned and jumped through the window stop him stern shouted hurry weitz went to the window sturm was running toward the hospital and he didnt seem to be suffering the effects of any gas weitz knelt and fired at the retreating figure until the chamber of his gun clicked empty he saw sturm fall but the sergeant picked himself up and continued on toward the hospital theres no gas out there weitz said not sarin anyway untie me stern screamed did you hit him yes weitz picked up the ss dagger and slashed the ropes binding stern to the chair can you walk stern jumped to his feet weve got to get away from here i have a car but no keys weitz picked up the raubhammer gas mask from the hall floor and put it on just before he snapped the air hose into place he shouted through the hole in his face mask theres another suit in the hospital in brandts office follow me stern had tried to shape the plastic explosive so that it would blow the cylinder heads straight off of the buried tanks when the first pencil fuse fired the charge blasted the cylinder head outward like an artillery shell straight through the wall of one of the ss barracks the sixpound piece of metal decapitated private otto huth and before his stunned friends could even take in what had happened the second cylinder head tore through the wall shattered the hip of a lance corporal and lodged in the opposite wall fifty ss men at once scrambled for their weapons and charged the barracks door the bottleneck created there forced them to regain some semblance of discipline twenty seconds later three dozen nervous storm troopers were crouching outside trying to pinpoint a threat that seemed to have vanished look said one pointing past the dog kennels toward the woods smoke theyre bombing us from the air dont be an idiot said a strapping soldier named heinrich krebs the snow must have detonated some of the mines we laid around the perimeter today i dont remember putting any mines on this side but krebs was already walking around the kennels toward the fence whats wrong with the dogs asked a puzzled voice maybe they were killed by shrapnel someone suggested several men stepped up to the kennel fence theyre not all down said one look mein gott theyre sick what the other ss barracks had also emptied at the sound of the explosions now more than seventy men were strung out along the narrow alley between the barracks and the dog kennels see anything krebs called a sergeant there was no answer heini shhh someone said listen it was a soft sound like the hissing of a venomous snake but almost immediately the hissing was drowned out by the sound of men gibbering defecating striking each other and choking on their own tongues a dozen storm troopers fell to the ground convulsing like epileptics in seizure heinrich krebs was already dead six miles north of totenhausen ten mosquitoes of the general sherman flight assumed a tandem bombing formation a half mile south of them squadronleader harry sumner reached for his microphone to break radio silence leader approaching target he said in a mechanical voice i will mark with flares from one thousand feet then go to fifteen hundred to act as master bomber number two will drop red repeat red target indicators i will verify aiming point then give the goahead high explosive followed by incendiaries lets put one down görings bunghole eh sumner hung up the mike well jacobs he said the navigator remained bent over the fuzzy image on the screen of his airtoground radar eighty percent sure sir it would help if we slowed a bit sumner keyed his mike leader reducing speed holding at one thousand two drop target indicators on my mark out out schörner shouted as the troop truck wheeled into the driveway of the power station and stopped behind his car ten men out now he slammed his gloved hand down on the roof of his field car tell sturm everything i said at that moment a grenade landed just behind the troop truck and exploded with an earsplitting boom shrieks of agony filled the air schörner ran around the truck just in time to see the taillights of the volkswagen flick on at the next curve snow kicked up into the air as the car raced away down the hill the driver of the troop truck revved his engine and shifted into gear preparing to turn and pursue the fleeing car but schörner leaped up onto the running board and grabbed the wheel stop you imbecile youre staying here let that dog out he jumped down and told the driver of his field car to chase the vw only if it headed toward totenhausen the corporal saluted and sped away were looking for an american and a bomb detonator schörner yelled to the confused mass of ss troopers hes wearing a waffen ss uniform i want four men inside the station everyone else into the trees anna pumped the brakes of the volkswagen waiting to be sure schörner was following after a few moments she saw a pair of headlights skid around the curve behind her the lights were low to the ground the field car she kept pumping the brakes but no other lights appeared why wasnt the troop truck following she didnt think one grenade could have put it out of commission when the field car closed to within four car lengths she jammed the accelerator to the floor the volkswagen glanced off a hard snow bank but she maintained control and fought the car around the next switchback curve below her lay totenhausen she wondered briefly what was happening inside the camp but thoughts of mcconnell quickly returned would he be able to climb the pylon would he have the will to release the gas cylinders if he did how odd it would be never to see him again the man who had awakened her sleeping heart after so many years she pumped the brake preparing to take the next curve but the car lurched forward shuddering under the impact of machine gun bullets anna momentarily lost control of the car then righted it and hit the gas she looked down on the seat beside her she had saved the last two grenades for a reason major schörner had once told her a story about a wounded ss officer left behind by his unit during a retreat on the eastern front the man had sat calmly against a burning tank as the russian infantry approached when they came within five meters of him he smiled pulled the pins on the grenades and blew a half dozen russians to pieces with him anna had endured many nightmares in which she was tortured by gunther sturm she had no intention of enduring the reality if they managed to stop gretas vw with gunfire she would surrender like the man on the russian front with a smile on her face and live grenades in her hands dark as a bloody coal chute down there the navigator complained what about your radar all i see is the river bend it looks like the right one squadronleader harry sumner expelled air from his cheeks with a sound that betrayed the tripwire tension beneath his calm voice how sure are you well eightyfive percent thats not good enough jacobs if we bomb the wrong target theyll just send us back sumner paused im going to drop a single flare youll have to verify our location visually the navigator looked up from his radar one flare sir everyone down there will know were here and well still have to do a full marking run theyll know soon enough anyway sumner reached for a lever theres no known ackack between here and rostock and weve got to be sure yes sir i cant risk wasting the lot on the wrong bend in the river no sir here we go mcconnell perched on the crossarm of the pylon like a man in the crows nest of a clipper ship he blinked stinging sweat out of his eyes and looked around above him hung the inverted black bowl of sky and stars a cold sliver of moon below him to the north shone the faint lights of dornow village to the south curved the silver line of the recknitz river sheltering totenhausen camp on its near bank he recognized the spot by the bluish glow of spotlights his nerves thrummed a staggering amount of effort had gone into putting one man on top of this pylon with the gas cylinders under his control he was not that man but he was the man who had made it here and if the british nerve gas worked he could doom every ss man in totenhausen as surely as jonas stern could have if the gas worked if the cylinders stayed on track during their run down to the camp if if if he could hear schörners men beating the bushes below him flashlight beams ricocheted off the snow in all directions he heard a dog barking wildly someone encouraging the dog they were trying to track his scent over the snow he didnt see how they could as hed been wearing a rubber suit while he walked but the torches were getting closer he didnt feel particularly nervous they would capture him eventually of course but too late right now he was untouchable the drama that caught his attention was closer on the south face of the hills two sets of headlights careened down the switchback road through the trees anna was in front the ss car behind the field car was slowly closing the gap the outcome a foregone conclusion anna would be overtaken and killed within minutes he tried to focus his mind on the task at hand but he couldnt tear his eyes away from the swerving lights below and then it hit him in thirty seconds both cars would break out onto the flat stretch that led from the base of the hill around to totenhausens front gate by road they might be a third of a mile away but as the crow flew or the bullet the distance was probably more like three hundred meters with the shouts of schörners men ringing up from the woods below mcconnell swung down off the crossarm and drove his spikes into the support pole beneath it clipping his safety belt around the pole he jerked stan wojiks boltaction mauser off his shoulder and laid it over the crossarm aiming south he chambered a round from the magazine and waited as he stared he realized that the shot was damn near impossible the problem was not the rifle but the darkness he was staring across open sights into a wall of night even when the cars appeared beneath him he would have no way to accurately judge distance it would be like aiming at stars annas car burst out of the trees at the foot of the hill her red taillights accelerating away from him almost directly in line with the descending pylons she had opened up a lead but her flight was leading her headlong toward totenhausen straight into death he stuck his gloved forefinger into the trigger guard of the mauser and began tracking her lights he almost threw the rifle down in frustration he would be lucky if his bullet struck within fifty yards of the car he heard the dog barking in the trees below him closer now a voice in his brain told him to drop the rifle to climb back onto the crossarm and release the cylinders he was about to do just that when he heard the rumble of powerful engines had schörner brought more trucks into the forest the ss field car broke out of the trees mcconnell sighted in on the dim taillights and shook the sweat from his eyes his heart pounding with the futility of his effort but as his finger touched the trigger he heard something pop in the sky high above him the hillside came alive with light as surely as if god had thrown a switch in heaven he had no idea who had fired the flare but his eye instantly oriented him to distance by pylons treetops the stretch of road he led the field car high and pulled the trigger rifle fire major schörner shouted his eyes turned skyward in an attempt to locate the flare rifle fire in the trees move south led by the dog schörner and his men crashed through the trees toward the sound of the gunfire mcconnells second bullet tore through the canvas roof of the field car and into the neck of an ss man in the backseat the storm trooper squealed like a dying pig blood sprayed over his comrades who immediately ducked below the windows assuming they were being fired on from the sides four seconds later another slug knocked off the cars wing mirror the driver had hardly registered the impact when mcconnells fifth bullet drilled down through the trunk panel and punctured the fuel tank gasoline funneled onto the road behind the car and the sparks from the overheated exhaust quickly ignited the mixture the tank blew with a dull crump like a mortar shot breaking the rear axle and dropping the back of the car onto the road with a metallic screech the ss men who were still alive dove through the doors before it stopped leaving their wounded comrades behind in the burning vehicle anna shut her eyes and swerved stunned by the flash behind her she had no idea what could have destroyed the field car could it have hit a land mine she skidded back onto the road and took her foot off the accelerator realizing that her diversionary sacrifice was no longer required what should she do what could she do go back to the pylon it was too late to help mcconnell now what about the camp if all went as planned it would soon be saturated with gas she let the vw coast forward her mind spinning with confusion and then she remembered the children she had the gas suit she had the pistol and she had a debt to pay what the bloody hell was that harry sumner asked no idea sir small explosion well damn it is this the place the navigator took his eyes off the swirl of flame and scanned the land below as the lone parachute flare drifted away on the wind he caught sight of something like a metal cage on a hilltop to the northwest there it is harry the power station this is it one hundred percent sure squadron leader sumner pressed his back into the seat and banked the mosquito second pass he said into his mike leader marking with all flares mcconnell pulled himself back up onto the crossarm and turned his attention to the business at hand in the dying light of the flare the top of the pylon looked just as stern had described it the twentyfoot crossarm spanned two thick support legs and jutted out a few feet on either side six wires passed over the crossarm in three pairs one pair at each end of the arm and one pair in the middle three porcelain insulators shaped like upsidedown dinner plates kept the wires from coming into direct contact with the crossarm according to stern one wire in each pair was live and one merely an auxiliary the gas cylinders themselves had been suspended from the auxiliary wire at the end of the crossarm nearest mcconnell about five feet away the questionmarkshaped suspension bars curved up and out from the rollerwheels then back under the wire and down to the cylinders mcconnell saw that stern had removed the two cylinders nearest the crossarm for use on the ss bomb shelter but the rubber rope that would pull the cotter pins from the six remaining rollers was just within reach stern had wrapped it around the head of the cylinder nearest the pylon mcconnell shinnied out to the end of the crossarm trying not to tear the crotch of his gas suit he stopped just short of the porcelain insulator following the rubber rope with his eyes he realized that when he pulled it the cotter pins that held the rollerwheels in position would be jerked out in reverse sequence releasing the cylinder farthest from the pylon first and so on until the cylinder nearest him had been freed the shouts below were getting closer as darkness settled over the hillside again mcconnell fastened his safety belt around the crossarm leaned out took hold of the rubber rope and gave one sharp tug the rope stretched but nothing came loose he yanked harder and almost lost his balance when the cotter pin pulled free the rubber rope sang like a plucked bass string as the cylinder farthest from him began to roll mcconnell blinked in disbelief there were two cylinders rolling down the wire and they were quickly gathering speed keep some space between them stern had told him he had pulled too hard he began counting slowly meaning to count to fifteen but before he even reached five he noticed red taillights nearing the recknitz river anna she was still driving toward totenhausen what the hell was she doing hadnt she seen the ss car explode she must have what did she think she could do in the camp staring down the hill in a panic mcconnell realized that stern might still be alive somewhere down there was that it was anna trying to rescue stern if so she wouldnt even get past the gate guards unless with the courage of despair mcconnell dropped the rubber rope and shinnied back toward the support pole he had climbed passing it he continued toward the center of the crossarm and stopped just short of the middle insulator five inches from his crotch ran the center auxiliary wire just beyond that the live one he felt a strong vibration in the crossarm caused by the current in the live wire he was too close he scooted backward until he was two feet from the center pair of wires unslinging the rifle from his shoulder he took the muzzle of the barrel in his right hand leaned forward and extended the stock away from him until it hovered six inches above the pylons far support pole his right arm quivered from the weight of the old rifle he let the stock down until the breech end of the barrel rested on the crossarm just a few inches from the far support pole very carefully he lowered the muzzle in his hand to within four inches of the live center wire then he shut his eyes and dropped the metal barrel onto the wire mein gott screamed one of schörners soldiers the bomb wolfgang schörner stood motionless in the snow stunned by the bluewhite flash that had strobed in the forest ahead of him he had heard many bombs in the past but the explosion hed just heard was like none he had ever known the flash had burst high and in front of him but the sound had come from behind from the direction of the transformer station just after the flash he had sensed more than seen a blazing white light pass high over his head moving rapidly toward the transformer station then hed heard a brassy whooom and then at least a full second later the detonation four distinct events then he understood there was no bomb somehow someone had faulted one of the power lines above them and they had done it in such a way that the main transformers had exploded totenhausen would be without electricity for a few seconds but the backup transformers and lines would automatically kick on schörner waited to hear some telltale sound that this had happened what he heard was a sharp crack farther down the hill staring high into the darkness of the trees he saw a bluewhite fireball rolling up the hill like a manmade comet he was marveling at the impossible vision of something rolling uphill when the fireball flashed over his head and hurled itself into the power station the second explosion dwarfed the first when mcconnell dropped the rifle barrel onto the live wire volts of electricity instantly sought the shortest route to earth the heat of the flash charred the surface of his oilskin suit and knocked him off the crossarm a sound like a lions roar split the night as the current discharged itself into the ground sixty feet below him hanging from his safety belt mcconnell thanked god that his basic knowledge of electricity had proved accurate the shortest route from the live wire to earth had been through the rifle barrel and down through the far support pole allowing him to remain outside the lethal circuit he had created relays in the station instantly attempted to open the circuit breakers but the poorly maintained batteries that controlled this function had expended their last energy correcting the mishap of colin munro four night earlier the tremendous electrical load placed on the lines by contact with the earth drew a massive overcurrent from the volt transmission lines that fed into the station allowing thousands of amps to heat the faulted line to an extreme temperature at the pylon where mcconnell hung suspended like a fallen mountainclimber the current flashed across all three live wires ionizing the air between them and creating an arc like a welders flame it was this arc that rolled up the wires and over schörners head toward the source of the current it flashed onto the copper bus bars of the station ionizing the available air and crackling across the metal struts like something from a frankenstein picture heated far beyond the tolerance they had been built to withstand the contacts inside the circuit breakers instantly boiled the insulating oil they were submerged in and blasted apart their steeldrum containers like giant shrapnel bombs spraying oil across the snow the sensors in the station responsible for rerouting the voltage to the auxiliary system did function but they too failed in the end the first poisongas cylinder had already smashed two insulators putting the auxiliary wire into direct contact with two crossarms when the rerouted voltage reached the first damaged insulator the previous event repeated itself almost exactly as the second explosion reverberated through the hills mcconnell still blinking his eyes from the passage of the second fireball looked down toward totenhausen every light in the camp had gone out while schörners men stared dumbfounded at the transformer station the major aimed his flashlight along the boot tracks they had been following toward the bluewhite flash he had seen standing squarely in the middle of the tracks was a smooth thick tree trunk schörner had shone his flashlight ten feet up the tree before he realized it was one leg of a power pylon bring your torches he shouted running toward the pole hurry by the time schörners shout echoed up from below mcconnell had righted himself on the crossarm and gotten his hand around the rubber rope three flashlights converged on one leg of the pylon stern had told him put space between the cylinders but there was no more time he yanked the third cotter pin loose waited two beats then jerked out the fourth and fifth simultaneously a flashlight flicked over the crossarm the last cylinder hung three feet down the wire from the crossarm swaying gently in the darkness as he tightened his grip on the rope to pull the final pin mcconnell realized something that sent spasms of fear along his spine he was going to die in a matter of seconds four torch beams would fix his position like london searchlights pinning a luftwaffe bomber to the clouds and machine gun bullets would follow with this certainty came something unexpected something quite different from what he had been feeling only moments ago a flood of pure animal terror he wanted to live there schörner shouted holding his beam steady on the top of the pylon do you see something nothing sturmbannführer the tracks end right here maybe he doubled back look at this cried an ss private who had bent over something in the snow he screamed suddenly and fell backward schörner whirled and shone his flashlight onto the snow a boltaction mauser rifle scorched black and smoking lay in a shallow well of melting snow it took him only seconds to put together what had happened he aimed his flashlight toward the top of the pylon lights he shouted sturmbannführer screamed one of the men the power station is burning schörner cursed as three torch beams disappeared the pylon you stupid swine put your lights on the pole mcconnell stretched out his legs hooked both feet around the fourfoot suspension bar that held up the last cylinder and yanked out the cotter pin the rubber rope fell sixty feet onto the snow only his butt and his hands on the crossarm resisted the downhill tug of the cylinder hanging beneath him twice already a flashlight beam had played over his black oilskin suit but he forced himself to look down wire netting covered the dark cylinder and from the netting protruded six pressuretriggers any one of which could blow the cap out of the cylinder head and release the gas within there was no time for caution if the triggers tripped and the british gas worked he would have to rely on the gas suit and mask he had modified in oxford he would live or die by his own hands three torch beams stabbed the darkness around him with fire in his stomach he leaped off the crossarm there schörner shouted theres someone up there where sturmbannführer schörner threw down his flashlight and snatched a submachine gun from the startled ss man then turned it skyward and fired a long burst up along the length of the support pole mcconnells breath went out of his lungs when his crotch crashed onto the cylinder head he felt as if hed been kicked in the balls by a mule it was all he could do to hang onto the suspension bar but the cylinder was rolling it was rolling fast he was already twenty feet from the pylon when schörners fusillade of bullets ripped into the crossarm behind him he looked down frantically to see if his legs had tripped any of the triggers he couldnt tell more shouts and gunfire sounded behind him but suddenly it was all meaningless no one below understood yet what had happened mcconnell did and he knew his problems had only just begun somewhere out ahead of him five cylinders of nerve gas were shunting along a length of steel winch cable toward totenhausen and he was almost certainly overtaking them he was trying to work out just how quickly when the rollerwheel above his head jumped the shattered insulator on the second pylon he closed his eyes in terror until the wheel settled back onto the wire on the other side it was a lot like riding a cable car he thought a very fast cable car with no operator he would almost certainly reach totenhausen alive the problem was how to get off of the cylinder before it dropped sixty feet to the ground he was squinting down the wire trying to answer that question when the whole night sky burst into flame like the fourth of july stern was right behind ariel weitz as the rubbersuited figure burst out of the back corridor of the headquarters building and into the appellplatz weitz ran straight toward the hospital but stern swung out to his left he had no intention of running unprotected through the invisible cloud of nerve gas that might be drifting across the yard from the ss barracks and dog kennels on his right as he ran he saw a white flash burst above the hills behind the camp a flare was schörner signaling for assistance had he trapped mcconnell on the road herr stern please stop stern looked left a woman was running toward him with a child in her arms rachel jansen he could scarcely believe it but she was there with a crowd of confused prisoners streaming out of the inmate blocks behind her its after eight he shouted get to the eblock my son is already there you promised to take hannah stern heard a distant peal of thunder like artillery in the hills the entire camp seemed to freeze and listen a second explosion followed then every light in the camp went out transformers thought stern remembering the sound from his guerrilla days in palestine my god hes done it he said he grabbed rachels shoulders the gas is coming come on rachel held out the bundled blanket for gods sake take her with you stern took the little girl like a sack under his right arm and seized rachels hand with his left paralyzing pain shot up from his broken finger as he sprinted toward the hospital with hannah screaming for her mother and rachel following behind where is my father he asked taking children to the eblock he raced up the front steps of the hospital and crashed through the front door into the darkness of the main corridor weitz he screamed no answer rachel slammed into his back where is hannah did you put her down i have her now go to the eblock go to your son straight through this corridor while stern pointed down the hall toward the back door the window in the door lit up like a cinema screen white light poured over his shoulders from the window in the door behind him my god whats happening rachel asked what is that spotlights stern thought though why anyone would be shining spotlights on the hospital doors made no sense to him weitz where are you he heard a crash off to his right then a bloodcurdling scream he handed the child to rachel and stumbled down the hall to his right into darkness feeling his way along his finger burning at the slightest contact he heard more crashes another scream someone was begging in german but the words were slurred confused a beam of light sliced across the corridor in its brief flash he caught sight of at least two dead ss men outside the doorway he moved cautiously forward he heard a sound like a rotten melon dropped onto concrete then the shuffle of feet on tile weitz he whispered a blast of gunfire poured out of a doorway scarlett im the man you just saved a pause in here said a muffled voice stern smelled blood when he passed through the door weitz shined the flashlight into his eyes then moved it away sterns eyes tracked the yellow beam until it came to rest on what once had been a human face the skull was grossly misshapen now a mass of gore and blood the white coat beneath it a riot of scarlet and black on the desk before this mess lay a short iron bar guten abend standartenführer weitz said in a hushed tone this isnt what i wanted you know who is that weitz clicked his heels together and gave the corpse a fascist salute the distinguished herr doktor klaus brandt i wanted it to take longer stern took the torch from weitzs hand the little man made no effort to resist one sweep of the walls revealed a nauseating mural of blood and tissue stern shined the light on the killers face where is the other gas suit herr weitz weitz pointed to the floor behind the desk he was trying to put it on trying to get away stern picked up the suit mask and the boots that lay beside them is there a vinyl sheet anywhere close he asked this is a hospital get me one then in the main corridor youll find a little girl i want you to wrap her in the sheet can you do that for the gas you mean shell need oxygen then get me a fucking bottle a powerful explosion rocked the foundations of the hospital shattering some kind of glassware in the dark office weitz cocked his head to one side as if listening to a particularly fine piece of music what the hell was that asked stern little rats trying to leave the ship but they went the wrong way you told me to booby trap the bomb shelter remember stern turned away from the grisly scene and moved toward the door the telephone on brandts desk rang he heard weitz pick it up and say yes after a short pause weitz began to laugh the sound chilled sterns blood who is that he asked aiming the torch at the desk berlin weitz smiled eerily reichsführer himmler is holding for the herr doktor weitz held the phone against klaus brandts shattered skull and looked up at stern the flashlight reflected the whites of his eyes and the teeth of his grin stern leaped forward and snatched the phone away before weitz could say anything more he held the receiver to his ear and heard an irritated voice brandt brandt confounded telephone lines the allies have knocked them out again a chill raced across sterns arms and shoulders brandt himmler said again what the devil is going on up there stern touched his lips to the bloody mouthpiece very slowly and clearly he said listen to me chicken farmer you lost the war tonight keep your cyanide pill close we are coming back for you in the spring he set the phone gently in its cradle picked up the raubhammer suit and walked out of the office weitz followed with his machine pistol before they reached the main hall the telephone was ringing again rachel waited in the corridor with hannah in her arms for gods sake woman yelled stern rachel shook her head and clung desperately to her daughter stern saw in her eyes that she was close to collapse he had seen it happen to men in the desert a kind of cumulative shock that could make a man lie down to sleep in the middle of a blazing battlefield if he took the time to put on the raubhammer suit rachel jansen would not cross the alley to the eblock alive he dropped the suit and the flashlight on the floor took weitzs machine pistol and pulled her toward the back door as he crashed through it he saw the rear of the camp trees fence the roof of the eblock the alley illuminated as if by daylight what was happening halfway across the alley he heard a babble of voices to his left a tall figure wearing a brown ss uniform was running toward him pulling two children along behind one by each hand father jonas shouted the figure stopped dead jonas my son stern threw his left arm around his father the blood cried avram what have they done to you a pistol shot cracked at the far end of the alley jonas turned to his right just beyond the alley stood the huge barn that held the laboratory and gas factory when the second crack sounded he realized what he was hearing the detonation of the trigger mechanisms on the gas cylinders into the eblock he yelled now everyone he pushed the two children down the concrete steps that led to the gas chamber rachel and hannah already waited by the hatchway they saw me avram said as they shoved the children through the hatch who saw you the men its a mob they know something is happening jonas the eblock wont hold another soul every jewish child and some of the gentile children are inside the women are holding them on their shoulders squeezing them into every corner its a nightmare stern pulled hannah from her mothers arms you are the last rachel say farewell rachel took her daughters face between her hands remember what i told you little one do whatever herr stern tells you never her voice cracked never forget me she kissed the terrified child hard on the forehead and then backed away i am going to live she told stern her black eyes bright with tears one day i will come to palestine i will want her back dont ever leave her as jonas pushed her through the hatch rachel reached into her shift and pressed something into his hand it was too large to be another diamond he looked down a dreidl he stuffed the little top into the trouser pocket of the sd uniform she wont remember rachel cried backing hard against the wall of bodies behind her so you must tell her it is all she will have of her parents with that she turned and hurled herself into the mass of bodies seeking refuge in the gas chamber another crack sounded from behind the factory jonas wrapped the blanket around hannahs head and set her on a step then he took his father by the shoulders and shook him get your ass through that door now avram looked confused jonas his face was working through stages of incomprehension things had not turned out as they were supposed to he should have been dead before now i cant be the only man left alive not after for the first time in his life jonas stern struck his father he hit him so hard that avram doubled over and fell as surely as if he had taken a bullet in the belly jonas dragged him to his feet and stood him up beside the hatch he saw only blackness inside the heat in the chamber was already stifling a cacophony of wailing women and children filled his ears he called for rachel but she had already been swallowed by the tangle of limbs he grabbed the nearest arm to the door and pulled can you hear me he asked in yiddish yes sir answered a shaky male voice how old are you thirteen sir help me pull him in hes not ss you know the shoemaker yes stern heard the crack of another detonator when theyd got his father inside he shoved weitzs machine pistol into the boys clammy hands hold tight to that dont let anyone take it from you stay in here until theres no more air to breathe then shoot out a window crawl out and open the hatch thats the only way out do you understand i think so the voice sounded frightened but resolute stern squeezed the boys arm then backed up took hold of the heavy steel door and forced it shut as he cranked the great wheel into the closed position he felt he was sealing people into a tomb not a lifeboat only time would tell which coming up the steps with hannah in his arms he saw a group of men enter the alley from the factory end they wore prison stripes not ss uniforms panic seized him even if hed still had the machine pistol he could not keep them away from the eblock for long several men began throwing their arms about like puppets controlled by a madman two fell to their knees retching in the snow god forgive me jonas said he raced across the alley and up the hospital steps without looking back mcconnell clung desperately to the suspension bar as the rollerwheel jumped over the shattered transformer on the seventh pylon and raced down the wire he was three quarters of the way down the hill with no sign of slowing and no idea how to get off of the cylinder alive the parachute flares floated down through the blackness like white stars illuminating the landscape from the hillside to the river with a hypnotic light what did they mean had some emergency signal been triggered if so it was a hell of a show he tore his eyes away from the flares and forced himself to think he was moving too fast to catch hold of a crossarm and he was too high to hope to drop into the snow and survive he did not realize he had the means to save his life until he caught sight of the cylinder ahead of him the image of it hurtling down the power line tripped a memory in his mind the deathride at achnacarry when he and stern had been ordered to leap from a tree and slide across the arkaig river on a taut wire using only their toggle ropes toggle ropes anna felt a sense of peace when she saw the lights of totenhausen wink out alarmed towergunners began firing on the volkswagen when they realized it was not going to stop but they were too late she steamrollered the gate at sixty miles per hour and roared across the parade ground bullets shredded her rear tires but she drove on a lone ss man caught in her highbeams fired at her she ran him down she swerved around the headquarters and headed toward the inmate blocks had the jewish women and children reached the eblock had stern even reached the block to warn them about the attack and what of the christian children they had nowhere to go perhaps she could lead them to safety somewhere she gasped and hit the brakes as her headlights revealed the block area a frantic mob of ghostly figures was milling around like patients set free from a lunatic asylum some clung to the fence wires others writhed in the snow their backs arched in spasm like human bows anna saw children among them unconsciously she touched her air hose to make sure it was secured to her mask as the vw slowed a group of men noticed the car and charged with suicidal recklessness she yanked the wheel to the right and gunned the motor to get out of the car here would be like leaping into the sea to save a hundred drowning people better to go to the eblock by running through the hospital corridor she skidded to a stop beside the hospital steps there were corpses here too her gas suit had no pockets so she left the keys in the car with shredded tires the volkswagen was useless anyway she reloaded her pistol then hoisted the heavy air tank onto her back and struggled up the hospital steps looks like someone already had a go at the power station sir said the navigator its burning squadron leader harry sumner started the climb to fifteen hundred feet from there he would act as master bomber using his radio to guide and correct the delivery of bombs by the other aircraft were going to hit it anyway jacobs following orders right down the line they must want the whole hill flattened to send the two cookies with us jacobs nodded his squadron leader was referring to the two lb high explosive bombs carried in the bays of two mosquitos which had been specially modified to carry the huge concretebusting bombs to berlin dropping those on the tiny power station and camp below would be like squashing ants with a mace nothing would remain but holes in the ground but just in case it did the additional pounds of incendiaries carried by the remaining mosquitoes would burn off anything left above ground overdoing it a bit wouldnt you say sir commented the navigator well never know sumner replied god only knows whats down there could be the devils own furnace buried where we cant see it could be sir verify placement of target indicators i only want to do this once and pray jerry doesnt have any decoys down there ready sir the squadron leader keyed his mike twice then began transmitting orders to one of the ten bombers wheeling in the sky below him mcconnell watched in mute terror as the cylinder ahead of him rocketed off the tenth pylon like a skier from a cliff and smashed into the rear of a huge barnlike structure then fell the remaining distance to the ground looking down he saw that the power lines dropped almost perpendicularly from the tenth pylon to a distribution shed at the base of the factory there would be no gradual descent he had to stop now he gripped the loopend of his toggle rope in his left hand and focused on the rollerwheel above him if he tangled the rope in that wheel he would probably die there was only one way to make the throw he slipped his right wrist through the loopend of the short rope and with the same hand gripped the wooden handle at the other end a throwing weight he leaned back as far as he could the rollerwheel above him whirred like a fishing reel spinning under a sharks pull cocking his right arm he threw the handleend of the rope up and over the power line aiming just behind the pulleyroller and grabbed for the falling handle with his left hand he caught it glancing down he saw the crossarm of the tenth pylon rushing up to meet him thirty yards twenty had the british sarin killed even a single ss man fifteen yards he twisted one end of the rope around each wrist and heaved himself up off the cylinder the heavy tank shot out from under him like a wild bronco that had finally thrown its rider the horsehair toggle rope sang as it raked against the power line slowing his descent was the friction enough with all his strength he clenched the rope in his vibrating hands the toggle rope hit the crossarm with enough speed to snap mcconnells whole body out ahead of the pylon parallel to the wires momentum tore at his air tank the harness on his back his shoulders and wrists but everything held rope tank harness bones and ligaments two seconds after the impact he was hanging suspended from the tenth pylon like a parachutist caught in a tree his arms felt as if they had been yanked from their sockets so he swung his legs up over the crossarm and in the upsidedown position so common to twelve year old treeclimbers worked his way along to the nearest support leg of the pylon then he looked down sixty feet below six gas cylinders lay on the snow beside the factory wall they looked harmless used up like scrap metal fallen off a junk truck for all he knew they might be harmless but they might not he looked to his right down into the camp proper black stick figures of varying sizes sprawled on the snow at crazy angles many concentrated in the area of the inmate blocks god in heaven he said his voice alien inside the vinyl mask it works he struggled to hold down the wave of nausea rising from his stomach vomiting in the mask might be fatal since he could not risk removing it had any of the women and children reached the eblock had he released the gas too early where was anna stern stern had no gas suit he looked down at his waist christ hed left his safety belt clipped to the top pylon the goddamn thing was useless anyway he took two massive breaths from his air tank then jammed his spikes into wood bearhugged the pole and started down did you get the oxygen bottle stern shouted running toward the flashlight beam at the opposite end of the hospital corridor the beam moved down and illuminated a green bottle lying on a dark reflective sheet stern set the kicking bundle that was hannah jansen on the sheet took it from a pneumonia case came weitzs muffled reply youd better put on that suit stern lost no time doing that but as he tried to work the recessed zipper he realized something was wrong weitz could not be holding the flashlight to help him see and at the same time be taping the little girl into the vinyl sheet which the sounds stern had been hearing indicated he was doing who else is here stern cried throwing himself out of the beam of the flashlight its all right weitz said shining the torch onto another blacksuited figure wearing an air tank on its back the figure looked up from its work in the glow of the flashlight stern first saw only a reflection then through the clear vinyl mask mcconnell had brought from oxford he saw the blond hair and dark eyes of anna kaas she stared back at him for a moment obviously stunned by the blood and bruising on his face then pointed at his gas suit and went back to her work stern lost no time zipping up the raubhammer suit suddenly the hospital lights blinked on faded then stayed on the bright light paralyzed stern the emergency generator said weitz theres someone in the basement he jabbed stern on the shoulder what did you do with my gun i gave it to someone weitz cursed and raced around the corner toward brandts office anna held up her revolver and called out but the buzz produced by the speech diaphragm of her mask died after a few feet she put down her gun and with sterns help sealed the vinyl sheet as completely as possible with the roll of tape weitz had provided stern picked up the bundle much heavier now with the oxygen bottle added to the childs weight and turned toward the hospital door sergeant gunther sturm stood beside the stairwell unsteady on his feet but holding an infantry rifle in his hands the left side of his tunic was soaked in blood as stern bent to set down the child sturm fired he missed the ss man jerked back the bolt for a second shot though years of conditioned reflexes told stern to attack the man something stronger surged through him he threw himself over hannah jansens body shielding her from the bullets even as the inner voice told him he would die for it he heard gunshots but too many too quickly to be the boltaction rifle in sturms hands he looked up to see ariel weitz barreling out of the side corridor firing klaus brandts luger sergeant sturm returned fire at pointblank range the boom of the rifle in the wide hallway had not even died when weitz hit the tile floor the sergeant staggered over to the fallen man pulling back the rifle bolt as he walked weitz struggled on the floor but could not rise or even crawl away sturms bullet had broken his back jonas started to lunge toward the ss man then a heavy caliber revolver exploded beside his right ear he threw up his hand to protect his eardrum watching in astonishment as anna kaas fired three more bullets spiking sturm to the hospital wall the sergeant hung there a moment his arms flung wide then dropped like a sack of sausage filling leaving scarlet streaks behind him anna knelt beside weitz the little man was fighting just to breathe she gently pulled off his mask and airhose weitz was unshaven as usual a faint smile lit his eyes remember what you said he whispered the lights in the corridor dimmed again but stayed on anna squeezed the rubber that covered his right hand im sorry herr weitz you said god sees how it really is he tried unsuccessfully to swallow i hope thats true he gasped and died anna bowed her head stern touched her shoulder do you have a car fräulein kaas as anna turned to answer the hospital lights went out and stayed out stern pulled her to her feet in the darkness gretas car wont take us far she said they shot the tires to pieces what about sabines mercedes no stern heard the muffled screaming of the child in the sealed sheet wait he dropped to his knees and felt his way across gunther sturms bloody corpse searching for pockets he almost shouted with relief when he felt his right hand close over car keys weve got it he said sliding his palms over the cold tiles in search of the ss mans rifle well pick up mcconnell at the pylon he found the rifle stood up and slung it over his shoulder at first he thought the frantic buzzing was some type of insect beside his ear then anna punched him and he realized it was the nurse screaming inside her gas mask he snapped straight and followed her pointing arm at the rear door of the hospital backlit by the dying white light of a parachute flare stood a tall blacksuited figure when it lifted an arm toward them sterns mind shouted gun so loudly that he had sturms rifle off his shoulder and aimed in an instant anna fired her pistol but missed twenty meters was well beyond her effective range stern pulled the rifles trigger nothing happened sergeant sturm had failed to fully chamber another round as he worked the bolt a brilliant red light bloomed in the window behind the silhouette it was the flash of multicolored cloth against the black suit that made stern pull his aim his bullet smashed the window of the door behind the figure he knocked annas arm wide then waved both arms wildly he had no idea how mcconnell had gotten down the hill so fast but he knew no german would be wearing a piece of scottish tartan in the heat of battle when mcconnell reached them he leaned in close and said weve got to get out of here the gas works the alley is full of dead sterns gas mask had no speech diaphragm so he took the risk of unclipping his air hose how the hell did you get here he asked immediately sealing the hole with his palm air mail mcconnell shouted his voice rendered cartoonish by the buzzing diaphragm what forget it what about the factory stern asked do we run or do we finish the job do we have a car the mercedes what about the camera and the sample canisters in gretas volkswagen anna said mcconnell saw something move on the floor what the hell is that a little girl stern told him theres an oxygen bottle in there with her but weve got to get her away from here what about the other children anna asked the eblock is full said stern the rest he shook his head this is the one we can still save put your air hose back on mcconnell yelled anna take the girl in the mercedes and wait for us by the river the wind blowing off the water will make that the safest place jonas and i are going to do what we came here to do well meet you at the river well use the mercedes to make a run for the coast he turned to stern good enough stern nodded any sign of schörner mcconnell asked no said anna stern shook his head find a dark spot to wait mcconnell told her theres a ferry down there anna said a onetruck ferry used for bringing supplies from the south if we used that we wouldnt have to risk meeting schörner on the main road stern nodded with an exaggerated motion then bent down and hoisted hannah jansen onto his right shoulder anna led the way through the front door with her revolver mcconnell suddenly slammed into the air tank on her back he squeezed past her and stood gaping at the appellplatz two blinding red fires lay burning in the snow like roman candle flares he could see two more burning in a straight line beyond the front gate probably near the river bank seeing the ruby flare burst behind him at the rear door of the hospital he had imagined a flare fired by a dying ss man this was something different there was almost a pattern to the fires as if they were comets cast down by an angry but methodical god mcconnell might have kept staring had stern not shoved him forward and run down the steps like a man with the devil at his heels anna pulled mcconnell down with her and grabbed a leather bag from the backseat of gretas car together they followed stern around the hospital to the mercedes they met him coming back mcconnell called out to ask what the hell was going on but stern had already passed him running across the appellplatz toward the headquarters building they found hannah on the passenger seat of the idling mercedes the oxygen bottle inside the vinyl sheet was slowly inflating it like a balloon mcconnell helped anna into the drivers seat the air tank on her back pressed her chest into the steering wheel but she managed to shift the car into gear see you at the river he shouted slamming the door the mercedes wheels began spinning on the ice on impulse mcconnell pulled open the back door jumped across the seat and yelled drop me at the front of the camp it took major schörner five minutes to cover the same distance mcconnell had covered in eighty seconds where mcconnell had crossed it in a straight line schörner had had to wrestle the troop truck down the tortuous hill road and around the wreckage of his field car just to get within a quarter mile of the camp counting the time it had taken him to regroup his men at the power station he was running very late with every red fire he passed the sense of urgency grew in him he knew what those fires meant he had seen them in russia as the troop truck roared toward the camp gate he leaned out of the window to shout at the gate guards he saw none slow down he shouted at the driver slower you swine he opened the door and stood on the trucks running board as the driver coasted forward schörner felt a sudden and powerful sense of dread he never knew the source of these intuitions but in russia he had learned not to question them stop the truck he ordered stop the truck skidded to a halt schörner jumped down onto the snow and took a couple of steps toward the gate peering into the darkness his eyes were drawn to three dark forms on the ground about five meters inside the twisted gate he looked up at the nearest watchtower the upper half of the towergunners body was hanging over the gun parapet schörner blinked in disbelief he backed blindly toward the troop truck then turned and scrambled up into the cab back up he screamed rolling up the window as fast as he could get us out of here the driver stared at him as if he were mad schörner drew his pistol and put it against the drivers head theres been a gas release i want this truck two hundred meters back up the road the panicked driver jammed the transmission into reverse and spun the tires for ten seconds before they finally caught on the icy gravel target indicators down sir the navigator said aiming point verified this is the master bomber squadron leader sumner said into the radio mike if there was any ackack down there theyd be coning us now take your time and do it properly the power station first then the camp bomb on red indicators bomb at will sumners mosquito continued to circle at fifteen hundred feet while the lead bomber went in the modified aircraft made its run south to north aiming for the red markers at the power station it dropped its load one half second too late causing the single pound highexplosive bomb it carried to drift just past the hilltop moments later the village of dornow ceased to exist mcconnell was halfway out of the mercedes when a shuddering blast wave shook the earth beneath his feet he looked back toward the hospital and saw a mushroomshaped fireball boiling into the night sky beyond the hills as he stared the crown of the highest hill disappeared in a daisy chain of starwhite explosions the flash arced over totenhausen freezeframing a field of corpses now he understood the red fires now he understood what stern had figured out the moment he saw the target indicators laid out like a grid over the camp but what the hell did stern think he could do about it he couldnt call th air force hq in england and ask them to cancel a bombing raid the roar of the fleeing mercedes brought him back to his senses he kicked open the door to the building he had seen stern disappear into and stopped dead yellow light was pouring into an empty corridor from a doorway up the hall where was the electricity coming from he stared in wonder at the empty corridor why were there no dead germans here had the gas not yet penetrated this building he closed the door behind him and concentrated on sounds it was difficult to hear through the vinyl mask but there was no mistaking the sound of the diesel generator he moved quickly up the hall toward the source of the light which turned out to be the wireless operators room stern was already seated at the console searching for a frequency on the dial another chain of explosions rattled the floorboards stern pounded the desk in fury mcconnell immediately saw his problem stern wanted to use the radio but couldnt risk removing his air hose to speak he had no idea who stern wanted to talk to but the scientist in him knew instantly that there was only one solution he grabbed a pen by the radio console and scrawled three words on a codebook beside sterns hand coal mine canary stern looked up through the bulging eyepieces of his gas mask then he grabbed the infantry rifle he had taken from sergeant sturm and bolted from the room mcconnell heard another drumfire of explosions much nearer this time the blast waves jolted the radio sets on the shelf shit how bad could their luck be to be on the verge of success and have it all blown to hell because of poor organization duff smith should have known bomber command or the th air force might unilaterally decide to wipe out a power station like the one on the hill above dornow he should have taken steps mcconnell jumped as stern shoved a young ss man into the room and slammed the door the brownclad soldier was not wearing a gas mask but he was alive stern handed his rifle to mcconnell and shoved the ss man down until his mouth and nose were at the crack between door and floor theres our canary stern said stand on his back and if he tries to run shoot him he jumped into the radiooperators chair and yelled into the mike atlanta atlanta this is butler and wilkes repeat butler and wilkes calling atlanta mcconnell planted a boot between the germans shoulder blades and rested the muzzle of the rifle on his kidneys what the hell are you doing stern butler repeat butler calling atlanta stern said again waving at mcconnell to shut up may day may day mcconnell expected at any moment to hear the deafening blast of bombs landing inside the camp perimeter try to raise the planes themselves he shouted brigadier smith cant stop the damn things stern whirled around and screamed smith sent those planes you idiot hes the only one who can stop them mcconnell felt suddenly dizzy he was an idiot brigadier smith had taken steps and those steps demonstrated a degree of ruthless professionalism that left mcconnell dazed he could only watch speechless as stern bent back over the console this is butler repeat butler calling atlanta ach du lieber sturmbannführer what was that wolfgang schörner watched with businesslike appreciation as the first incendiaries obliterated the dornow power station he shook his head in wonder i believe that last stick was phosphorous bombs koerber perhaps some thermite as well be glad youre not under them but what are they doing schörner rubbed his chin thoughtfully they are preparing to flatten totenhausen with their own agents inside the question is why the incendiary bombs were what anna kaas had been waiting for not them specifically but something like them something that would draw the attention of major schörner and his men long enough for her to drive the black mercedes out of totenhausens front gate without being seen she had watched the troop truck race up to the gate even recognized schörners movements as he climbed down from the running board turned and jumped back into the truck she thanked god shed had the sense to keep her headlights off as she drove across the camp the troop truck had retreated two hundred meters up the access road that curved around the camp toward the hills but schörner was no fool the truck still blocked the main route of escape and maintained an oblique view of the front gate anna needed to cross the forty meters of downwardsloping open ground between the gate and the river where the singletruck ferry that led to totenhausens secondary access road waited in the icy water without a diversion she would never reach it unnoticed general sherman provided that diversion when she saw the orange flash reflected in her windshield from the enormous blast of flame on the hills behind the camp she lifted her foot from the brake and idled forward between the smashed gateposts and dead ss men the rubber bundle in the backseat was still jerking and fighting muffled screams pierced the silence anna knew the little girl inside must be nearly mad with terror but she would have to wait the dead sentries meant the nerve gas had drifted south at least as far as the gate she fed the mercedes a little gas all the while watching the twin beams of schörners troop truck and praying his eyes were on the hills twenty meters to the river ten she took her eyes off schörners truck long enough to aim the mercedes at the little ramp that led up onto the ferry as the cars nose drifted down a bolt of terror hit her would the brake lights betray her position to schörner yes with a prayer on her lips she shut off the engine and let the mercedes coast up the ramp when she felt the wheels bump onto the wooden deck she threw the car into low gear slammed her foot down on the brake pedal and set the parking brake the mercedes skated across the icy deck with a hiss if the front bumper had not struck an iron post jutting up from the edge of the deck near the wheelhouse the car would have slid right off and crashed into the river when it jolted to a stop anna glanced back at the troop truck it had not moved she spoke comfortingly to the halfinflated vinyl bundle in the backseat and peered through the front windshield the river was frozen along most of its length this time of year but the ferry ran frequently enough to keep a narrow channel open during the day the channel froze again each night only to be broken open again in the morning how quickly did it freeze she could not risk opening the door to find out she squinted into the darkness directly ahead of the cars hood there was ice but it looked black compared to the white sheet that spread east and west along the river the black ice ran in a straight line to the opposite bank that blackness was river water there was ice there but it was thin she hoped it was thin enough brigadier duff smith was monitoring the frequency of general sherman when airman bottomley burst through the door of the little hut beside the runway switch to threeonefourzero sir hurry duff smith had been in too many tight places to stand on form when he heard the strain of action in a mans voice he obeyed his subordinate without question static filled the hut as he spun through the frequencies i was in the junkers sir bottomley panted i was switching through the bands when i heard it heard what them sir transmitting in the clear suddenly a muffled voice with a german accent very like jonas sterns crackled repeat butler calling atlanta may day may day smith blanched he pressed the transmitter key and barked this is atlanta come in butler come in butler wed written you off what is your situation the radio crackled again mission accomplished repeat mission accomplished abort bombers abort bombers damn me smith gasped his highland accent breaking through the english veneer as it always did in stressful situations say again butler did you say mission accomplished mission accomplished stop those bombers you onearmed bastard with shaking fingers duff smith dialed in the emergency frequency of general sherman squadron leader harry sumners hands jumped on the controls when he heard the scottish accent blare out of the mosquitos high frequency radio general sherman general sherman attention navigator jacobss head popped up from his radar screen with confusion and suspicion clouding his face who the hell is that harry id like to know myself sumner said in a deadpan voice i order you to abort your mission i say again abort your mission sumner blinked in puzzlement theres no abort code for this leg of the mission is there jacobs not after we left the main force sir strict radio silence how does this bleeder know our frequency then and our code name jacobs shrugged and looked out of the cockpit its too late anyway sir the power station is gone theyre forming up for the run on the camp now attention general sherman you are at fiftyfourpointohfour degrees north twelvepointthreeone degrees east your target code is tara i wrote the order authorizing this raid and i am now countermanding that order i know you are observing radio silence i also know you can hear me break off your raid immediately and verify same action by verbal response break off raid immediately or face the consequences when you return to skitten harry sumners hands tingled at the controls sounds kosher peter what do you think its your call harry youve got about ten seconds to stop the run i never heard a jerry who could mimic a highlander like that sumner keyed the mike this is general sherman he said tersely what year was the battle of harlaw fought there was silence then the radio crackled fourteeneleven bless you laddie it was fourteeneleven sumner snatched up the vhf mike this is the master bomber abort bomb run abort bomb run this is your squadron leader return to base abort abort return to base navigator jacobs sank back in his seat and sighed heavily i hope you know what youre doing harry so do i sumner said so do i walking across the dark appellplatz after the bombs stopped falling mcconnell sensed for the first time the magnitude of what he had done sealed from head to toe in black oilskin breathing air that had been compressed in an oxford laboratory he moved through the corpses like a ghost on a battlefield the dead lay everywhere ss and prisoners together men and women and children with their arms and legs thrown out at haphazard angles mouths and eyes open to a sky scorched red by the sizzling target indicators as horrifying as it was mcconnell knew this was but a shadow of the devastation that lay in store if twentiethcentury science were completely harnessed to the engine of warfare he looked over at stern the eyeholes in the young zionists gas mask were pointed at the factory not the ground but even stern could not ignore the obvious they had saved some but they had killed more yet as they approached the factory gate one thought filled mcconnells mind if a mere british copy of sarin could accomplish this silent bloodless slaughter then in soman the germans possessed a weapon of truly apocalyptic power he had understood that intellectually in oxford but to see a nerve agent used against human beings brought home to him in a way nothing else could how impossible were the dilemmas men like duff smith and churchill faced their bluff had to work the alternative was armageddon stern was molding a charge of plastic explosive around the lock on the factory door mcconnell thought of all that had been done to bring him to this spot to put him inside this german gas plant for fifteen minutes stern backed quickly away from the door and pulled mcconnell with him a moment later the plastic explosive blasted the doorknob into twisted fragments and the door fell gaping to one side when mcconnell raised the powerful flashlight stern had found in the wireless operators room and shone it around the interior of the dark factory he knew that duff smith had been right to send him he was the best man for the job the production area was smaller than hed expected but it contained industrial equipment without equal in the world the closest thing he had seen to it was a classified dupont researchanddevelopment lab that one of his professors had walked him through the production room was two stories high packed with copper utubes and compressors and shallow closed vats every few feet along the wall signs with letters three feet tall read rauchen verboten no smoking the floor was covered with wooden crates some open some sealed without electricity for the factory lights the camera was of little value but stern had it out anyway mcconnell felt like a london tour guide leading stern through the maze of apparatus aiming the flashlight here and there while stern tried longexposure shots he found the aerosols vecteurs device chained to a pallet in the center of the room using tools taken from a workbench he tore at the heart of the machine until he found the secret it contained filter discs he marveled at the sequence of ten superfine droplet traps arranged in order of decreasing tolerance by the time a war gas had passed from one end to the other it would exist only as charged ions in suspension rendering it not only invisible but also unstoppable by conventional gas masks he slipped five of the filters into sterns bag then moved on it was only when stern used up the first roll of film that they realized they could not change the film cartridge without removing their gas suits their oilskin gloves provided enough mobility to fire a gun but not to thread film onto the tiny spool inside a camera mcconnell motioned for stern to put the camera away he wanted only two things from the building a sample of soman and klaus brandts laboratory logs he found both in a onestory room in the rear of the factory the equipment here was made of glass not metal this was where the real work was done one wall of the lab was lined with rubber suits hanging from pegs on the wall mcconnell pointed at a heavy steel door stern shot off the lock with a pistol he had taken off a corpse on the way to the factory behind the door they found a treasure trove that would keep the scientists at porton down busy for a year there were small metal gas cylinders marked ga gb and with other letters mcconnell did not recognize the cylinders marked gb had strips of adhesive tape fixed to them with handwritten letters on the tape sarin ii sarin iii tabun vii soman i soman iv at the bottom of the storage closet was an empty wooden box like an ammunition crate but with vertical slots sized to take the eightinchlong cylinders mcconnell assumed brandt had used the box to transport gas samples to other testing facilities while he filled the crate with samples stern explored a higher shelf pulling down a variety of paraphernalia including a small metal sphere with a stem at the top it too was marked with adhesive tape that read soman iv it took stern a moment to realize what it was an experimental grenade containing nerve gas he slipped three into his bag mcconnell found brandts principal laboratory log lying open on a desk sergeant sturm had apparently evacuated the chemists in the midst of dismantling their equipment for transport everything had been left as it was like a table set for dinner in a burnedout house mcconnell thumbed quickly through the thick notebook there were passages written in several different hands many with detailed chemical formulas most based on organic phosphates each entry had been carefully initialed after completion several bore the letters kb beneath them mcconnell stuffed the log into sterns bag then picked up the cylindertransport crate and motioned for stern to follow him they had got what they came for it was time to run rottenführer major schörner shouted by the gate what do you see the young corporal stared through the windshield he had idled the truck forward fifty meters in the last minute but he still saw nothing im sorry sturmbannführer by the gate fool look now crossing the road the corporal followed the beam of the trucks headlights at last he saw or thought he saw a brighter blackness moving against the general darkness what is that sturmbannführer schörner slapped his knee in frustration commandos he said theyre wearing chemical suits move the truck forward rottenführer very slowly as the truck edged forward its headlight beams caught two figures for an instant they ducked and ran flashing as if made of black foil schörner slammed his hand down on the dash theyre running for the ferry what should i do sturmbannführer schörner thought furiously when the answer came to him he felt a moment of doubt but then a second realization hit him like a spike through the heart if allied commandos had just released the soman stocks inside totenhausen rachel jansen was dead the men in the black suits had not only wiped out the installation he had been ordered to protect but they had also murdered the only woman he had felt anything for since the love of his life was killed by british bombs with the calm deliberation of a man under sentence of death he opened the door and climbed down from the cab he took one deep breath then another everyone all right he called to the men in the back of the truck hofer died from a shrapnel wound sturmbannführer but the rest of us are all right get down all of you ten ss men leaped to the ground and formed a line with their rifles and submachine guns at the ready schörner adjusted the patch over his eye and stood erect there are at least two allied commandos on the riverbank near the ferry possibly more the ferry is probably iced in but there may be poison gas between us and them bock fischer remain in the truck in case they try to flee this way in a vehicle the rest of us will advance to the ferry on foot schörner moved up the line as he spoke finding the eye of every man at least once i want five men to form a line in front of me spaced at tenmeter intervals i want one man on each side of me twenty meters away and one man behind fifteen meters back fire on anything that moves if any of us fall to gas the rest will move in the opposite direction but continue firing clear schörner had seen a few faces whiten when he mentioned gas and the rest when they realized he meant to use them as human gas alarms but situations like this were what the ss had been created for would sturms concentration camp scum live up to the tradition of their corps they might be scum but they were german scum he swept his eyes once more up the line remember your oath to the führer gentlemen i vow to thee and to the superiors whom thou shalt appoint obedience unto death so help me god heil hitler as one ten pairs of jackboots cracked and ten arms lifted to the cold night sky heil hitler came the answer rifle bolts clicked in the darkness the troops assumed the exact formation schörner had ordered and moved quickly toward the ferry anna nearly fired her pistol when the blacksuited figure hammered on the window of the mercedes she had been watching the headlights of the troop truck and had not seen anyone cross the road the swatch of tartan wedged into mcconnells tank harness registered in her brain before she pulled the trigger she got out of the mercedes closed the door and hugged him tightly there was a sudden deep rumbling and the ferry began to shudder in the water anna looked over the roof of the mercedes stern was in the wheelhouse giving the twin screws all the power they would take the ferry heaved itself away from the bank and smashed into the sheet of ice covering the ferry channel throwing anna and mcconnell to the deck stern shifted the engines into reverse backed up and rammed the sheet again nothing the third time he backed the stern of the ferry flush against the dock shearing off part of the access ramp with a screech of tearing metal then he shifted gears gunned the engine closed his eyes and prayed he heard the deep shivering crack of ice as the first bullets shattered the windows of the wheelhouse faster schörner shouted theyve started the ferry the majors formation had been advancing steadily parallel to the river firing as they closed on the dock while the men shot at the spot they thought the ferry should be schörner had kept his eye on the line in front of him watching for signs of gas but when the ferry motor roared to life he knew the time had come to risk all eighty meters away the flat craft nosed out into the river a clear target now against the white ice sheet schörner opened his mouth to order his men to charge the dock at a full run then he realized that the man he had posted on his left side was no longer there gas he shouted move right schnell the line of men broke toward the water still moving forward still firing at the ferry schörner slammed into the back of the man in front of him losing his balance furious he got to his feet and shoved the halted trooper forward the man would not budge then schörner saw why two soldiers lay squirming on the ground thirty meters ahead his fiveman frontal screen had been reduced to three plus the right wingman who had been forced up to schörners side when the squad pressed against the river he glanced behind him the rear guard was still on his feet hold here and give them everything youve got stern crouched low in the wheelhouse trying to guide the heavy ferry without standing up inside the glass cube that enclosed the upper wheelhouse three sides of the enclosure had already been shattered by bullets anna and mcconnell were hunkered down behind the mercedes at the edge of the deck there was no railing and with stern pushing the engines to the maximum plus the giveandtake jolting of the bow smashing the ice there was a real danger of falling into the river anna motioned for mcconnell to get the little girl out of the backseat but he thought the child was safer where she was anna didnt using the door handle to steady herself she pulled herself into a half crouch and opened the door the mercedes interior light clicked on one second later a rifle bullet tore through the opposite window and drilled through annas right shoulder all mcconnell saw was her body flying backward then she was gone screaming for stern to stop he closed the car door and jumped after her into the swirling black water weve hit the pilot schörner shouted seeing the ferry slow three quarters of the way across the river pour it in as the volume of fire increased he heard a choked cry behind him he whirled the man he had posted behind him seemed to be trying to grab his face with his left hand then he suddenly bent double vomited snapped back up and fired his submachine gun skyward in an uncontrolled burst schörner stared in horror as the man fell backward on the snow and ceased all movement his nostrils filled with the nauseating odor of feces and urine the stench of death he held his breath and kept firing at the ferry mcconnell fought his way toward the gas mask he saw bobbing in the black water the current was pulling anna toward the shelf of white ice that covered the rest of the river if she passed under that she would be lost his arms seemed suddenly made of lead even in the oilskin suit the water chilled him to the bone and his heavy rubber boots were pulling him down he drove his gloved hands against the water and reached out two fingers hooked under the leather harness of annas air tank he looked back the ferry was twenty yards away he got a firmer grip on annas harness then began swimming he knew he would never reach the ferry under his own power at some point he had torn his gas suit its oilskin legs were filling with freezing water dragging him toward the bottom only the buoyancy of their air tanks was keeping him and anna from sinking like boulders he had actually stopped swimming when he saw the ferry moving slowly back toward them wolfgang schörner had not felt real fear since the retreat from kursk but when he saw two of the three riflemen in front of him begin jerking spasmodically a film of cold sweat broke out over his whole body was he breathing the gas now was it entering his skin even as he knelt on the ground with a last roar of anger and courage he stood erect and charged down the riverbank toward the dock mcconnell shoved his right arm through a halfsubmerged tire on the side of the ferry and pulled anna close to him go go he shouted gasping for air ive got her go stern firewalled the throttles the ferrys twin screws lifted the foredeck right out of the water as it closed the last few yards to the far bank smashing ice as it went stern looked back at the dock theyd left behind a barrelmelting burst of yellow muzzle flashes strobed in the darkness throwing a hail of bullets across the water stern dove out of the wheelhouse as the slugs shattered the remaining glass and riddled the side of the mercedes the ferry would have to land itself he prayed that none of the tires on the mercedes had been punctured wolfgang schörner was dying on his feet even as the bullets poured out of his weapon a deadly poison was shutting down his central nervous system the invisible nerve gas had entered his body through every exposed surface but quickest through the mucus membranes of his mouth and nose and through the moist sclera of his eyes his machine gun clicked empty he wanted to throw it down but his hand would not open he felt a strange embarrassment as his bladder involuntarily voided then his bowels let go he saw the ferry collide with the opposite bank almost immediately the taillights of the car clicked on schörner was nodding his head violently up and down but could not understand why at the last moment he realized that the river itself might afford him protection from the gas with tremendous concentration he forced his right leg to take a step then he lurched forward and fell flat on his face at the end of the pier the last thing he felt was the icy water of the river tugging at his right hand racing southwest on the hard gravel road that followed the river stern had left totenhausen far behind but mcconnell knew the mercedes had sat inside the camp too long not to have been contaminated he leaned back over the passenger seat and cranked down the rear window beside annas stillmasked head he wanted to apply pressure to her shoulder wound but if there was gas residue on his glove he might kill her by doing it he reached across the inflated vinyl bundle that held hannah jansen and rolled down the other window cold air blasted through the car after a full minute he ripped the air hose out of his mask and breathed deeply he had never tasted air so sweet he waited thirty seconds more then removed sterns mask sterns face was badly bruised and covered with dried blood and one of his eyes nearly swollen shut how far to the coast mcconnell asked unzipping his suit and pulling his hands out of the oilskin sleeves forty kilometers in a plane probably an hour by road something jabbed mcconnell in the crotch he reached into his suit for the offending object it was annas diary soaked by river water churchills note hung out of the top like a soggy bookmark he dropped the diary into sterns leather bag then climbed into the back seat to attend to anna after she managed to follow his orders and unzip her own suit he tore out a section of her blouse and stuffed it into the hole in her shoulder being careful to touch only the inner surfaces he gently lifted the transparent gas mask off her head and threw it out of the window were about to cross the river again stern said over the seat this is tessin stay down mcconnell leaned across annas lap as they rolled through the blacked out village is the little girl alive stern asked shes still moving using a british commando knife from sterns bag mcconnell carefully cut away the rapidly deflating vinyl sheet that held the little girl and the oxygen bottle i doubt this thing was completely airtight he said but the pressure of the escaping oxygen should have kept the nerve gas from getting inside a highpitched shriek announced the reentry of twoyearold hannah jansen into the land of the living mcconnell dropped the sheet out of the window and hugged the darkhaired child close trying to comfort her as best he could it would be a long time he knew before she purged the horror of this night from her mind you know where were supposed to go he asked stern nodded his eyes on the dark road you think anybody knows what happened i mean do you think theyll have troops out looking for us stern looked back across the seat his swollen eye sockets crusted with dried blood just take care of the women doctor leave the rest to standartenführer stern mcconnell kept pressure on annas wound as the mercedes rolled through the night whenever they came to a village stern would slow down and coast through at moderate speed mcconnell remembered the names for a long time after tessin sanitz gresenhorst ribnitz not long after ribnitz he smelled sea air stern didnt slow down as he expected but instead accelerated what are you doing mcconnell asked stern leaned forward and stared through the windshield our inflatable dinghy is supposed to be hidden in the rocks beneath a certain jetty near dierhagen a twoman job but im not about to take an inflatable out into a shipping channel cut by an icebreaker not with a wounded woman and a child it would probably take us two hours just to find the damned thing and inflate it mcconnell saw they had entered another village what are you going to do then stern hunched over the wheel be ready to move fast doctor ill carry the child you take the woman no matter what happens dont get separated mcconnell had no intention of doing that im ready he said stern drove right down the main street of the village it looked deserted but at the end of the street mcconnell saw the faint silhouette of masts against the night sky a light burned in a shack at the entrance to the jetty stern stopped long enough to wriggle out of his oilskin suit then pulled up beside the shack and gave a loud blast on the horn are you crazy mcconnell asked stern pulled his sd cap out of his bag set it on his head at an angle and got out of the car leaving the engine running a uniformed officer of the coastal police stumbled out of the shack with a flashlight in his hand he was about to curse to high heaven whomever had disturbed his sleep when the beam of his torch fell upon the bloodsoaked uniform the iron cross first class and the rank badge of a colonel in the sd get that light out of my face idiot stern barked stand at attention the policeman a fiftyyearold veteran of world war one snapped instantly erect his thumbs at the seams of his trousers what can i do for you standartenführer who are you feldwebel kurt voss well feldwebel i need a boat the policemans face was gray with fright but he was not stupid enough to mention the blood and bruises on the face of the nazi apparition before him there are many boats here standartenführer what type of boat do you require a motor launch a seaworthy vessel the fastest on the dock the policeman swallowed most of the boats here are for fishing standartenführer and with the ice this time of year well few go out at all there must be something there is the kriegsmarine patrol boat its crew put in earlier tonight for well i understand perfectly feldwebel stern smiled coldly lead the way to this craft i will follow in my car but you must speak to the captain first standartenführer he will certainly the policeman fell silent under sterns withering glare stern cocked his chin and enunciated each word separately in the gestapo fashion like whiplashes the captain will do what feldwebel report to berlin that he was unavailable to assist an sd officer on reich security business because he was lying drunk in a brothel the policeman shook his head violently you are right standartenführer follow me ill have the boat running before you get aboard there was some confusion at the boat when anna and little hannah appeared the wideeyed policeman could not convince himself that a wounded woman and a child were involved in official sd business but he was trying hard stern carried hannah into the cabin and laid her in a berth mcconnell and anna sat down opposite her ill be on the bridge stern told them he squeezed annas good arm were almost there he found the policeman standing at the wheel how much fuel do we have feldwebel the tanks are full standartenführer theres also an extra can in the hold enough to get us to sweden sweden the policemans terror of the sd battled with his fear of being charged in some treasonous scheme standartenführer if your business is that important im sure captain leber would be glad to ferry you across let me call him for you i know exactly where he is im sure you do stern revved the engines of the schnellboot and was rewarded with a powerful rumble he motioned the policeman closer feldwebel he said softly what i am about to say you will repeat on pain of death the woman and child you just saw are the mistress and child of reichsführer himmler i am their bodyguard two hours ago they were nearly kidnapped by officers disloyal to the führer we barely escaped with our lives the reichsführer personally instructed me to get them to sweden by dawn now do i have enough fuel the policeman nodded hopelessly how far to open water six kilometers that is all i require feldwebel return to your post the policeman climbed onto the dock without a word running up the jetty he heard the thunder of the patrol boats twin inboard engines as stern sped north through the black channel that led through the ice sheet to the open waters of the baltic once inside his hut the feldwebel reached for his telephone then pulled his hand back into his lap sterns scandalous story was sufficient to stay his hand for several minutes but in the end he snatched up the phone again and called a certain wellknown house in dierhagen to inform kriegsmarine captain leber that a son of a whore from the sd had hijacked his patrol boat to go to sweden after one hour and twenty minutes inside the eblock avram stern knew the women and children could stand no more there was no light children perching on their mothers shoulders blocked all four porthole windows the heat was stifling almost unbearable several women had already fainted and there was nowhere for them to fall the noise was unbearable the ceaseless shrieks and wails of hysterical women and children hammered at the shoemakers eardrums raising the specter of panic in his own mind hed shouted a dozen times for them to be silent but to no avail he felt the dead weight of an unconscious woman sag against him the child who had been sitting on her shoulders screamed and toppled the other way into the clawing shoving mass avram tried to take a deep calming breath but the air that entered his lungs tasted like acid he took the machine pistol from the boy jonas had given it to and began climbing over the heads of the women fingernails raked his face and neck but he struck back fighting toward the only window whose position he was sure of relative to the door the window from which heinrich himmler had observed the last selection he saw a glimmer of moonlight when he finally reached the window he had to fight the urge to immediately shoot it out no matter how bad things were inside the gas chamber death might wait without he pressed his face to the doublepaned glass bodies lay strewn across the alley as if they had fallen off a plague wagon bile rose into his chest avram knew he would recognize every dead face in the alley what had jonas done and why where was the benefit as he stared at the hellish scene something moved slowly into his field of vision a dog it wasnt one of sturms german shepherds with powerful haunches and a glowing coat but a mongrel from the hills a scavenger that survived on the refuse of dornow the mongrel moved from one corpse to another with boldness driven by hunger it lingered at the corpse of a woman tugged at her shift then licked her face and backed up to gauge the response avram counted to sixty warding off angry blows from below the dog was still alive avram pressed the barrel of the machine pistol to the window and pulled the trigger opening the hatch of the eblock wasnt half as difficult as climbing through the jagged porthole had been the moment he pulled back the steel door limp bodies cascaded through it like corpses hed once seen at a rail siding in eastern germany he backed up the cement stairs and waited for the hysterical mass of women and children to empty from the gas chamber when the alley was full of milling prisoners he climbed to the top of the hospital steps and fired the machine pistol into the air listen to me he shouted we have survived but we are not yet saved ss reinforcements are bound to arrive soon a ripple of fear passed through the crowd we must get away immediately the best hope for all of you is the forests of poland i want the two largest germanspeakers among you to go to the ss barracks and put on uniforms like mine do not try to strip the dead gas on their clothing could kill you look for spare uniforms in closets or chests i want ten others to search the camp for the troop truck the trucks by the factory will be badly contaminated touch nothing unless absolutely necessary there could be lethal gas on any surface as the frightened women spoke among themselves avram turned and reached through the shattered window in the hospitals back door and pushed down the handle with the butt of the machine pistol walking through he felt a tug on his belt he turned and looked into the eyes of rachel jansen who carried her threeyearold son on her left hip the boys eyes were glazed with shock where are you going shoemaker rachel asked to look for money i want to come with you avram nodded and led her into the dark building in an office on the second floor he found a hundred reichmarks but it was not even a quarter of what he would need will money help us in poland rachel asked still ransacking drawers avram did not answer do you really believe we can cross the border and contact a friendly resistance group theres a fair chance avram slammed a door shut and turned to face her but i dont think its the best chance you dont have to go to poland if you dont want to what do you mean if you have the courage you can come with me i have a friend in rostock a gentile he worked ten years in my shop he offered to help me many years ago but i was too stupid to understand the danger i am going to try to reach him now you mean go into the city itself rachel asked fearfully it will be dangerous he conceded if we had money it would be better we could try to buy our way across to sweden ive found a little but not enough and we dont have time to search the whole camp rachel was silent in the darkness at length she said do you really think rostock is the best chance for me yes for you and the child yes but no more i have money shoemaker what how much three more diamonds i found them the night you caught me outside the night marcus died avram seized her arms with joy i thank god you are a devious woman hurry youll need an ss uniform i saw one in the closet here it belonged to one of the assistant doctors rauch i think they heard the bellow of the troop truck before rachel finished dressing when she had avram carried jan down the stairs and they joined the crowd outside into the truck avram said everyone hurry while mothers passed children up into the bed of the truck avram sought out the two women hed sent to the ss barracks to find uniforms he found them by the cab theyd taken it upon themselves to procure rifles as well as uniforms perhaps they have a chance after all avram thought with their shortcropped hair they could certainly pass for ss men at a distance we found it idling on the road with its headlights burning said the larger of the pair you can drive a truck he asked she nodded curtly you are not coming no listen to me drive eastward by as straight a route as you can but stick to the back roads it shouldnt take more than three hours stop for nothing if anyone does manage to stop you tell them youre taking typhusinfected prisoners into the forest to shoot them by order of ss lieutenantgeneral herr doktor klaus brandt do you understand the women nodded when you get close to the border drive the truck into the trees cross on foot through the forest if you are being chased dont make a fight of it and dont stop to try to save any wounded run for your lives your only hope is contacting a friendly resistance group in the forest he turned up his palms that is all i know to tell you youd better get moving the two women climbed up into the cab and shifted the truck into gear avram helped lift the last of the children into the back then signaled to the driver as the truck trundled past the dead and out of the alley he thought of the old woman who had compared the eblock to a lifeboat she was dead now but she had been right now the truck was the lifeboat he lifted jan from rachels arms and began walking out of the alley where are we going rachel asked they keep a kubelwagen parked behind the gas storage tanks thats perfect for us small but official rachel had to hurry to keep up with his long strides are you sure about rostock youll have to get us through checkpoints speak to policemen im sure can you fool them avram laughed softly frau jansen i was once a german soldier i had a medal from the kaiser i can convince those bastards were on a mission for hitler himself if it will get us a step closer to freedom rachel took his free hand in hers and squeezed hard to palestine she said one mile north of dierhagen jonas stern extinguished the running lights of the patrol boat and let it idle in the open water at least the dangerous run through the narrow ice channel was over he assumed the kriegsmarine had been alerted by now but hoped that his emphasis on reaching sweden would cause them to establish a blockade line farther out to sea he blinked the running lights on and off three times in quick succession waited thirty seconds then repeated the signal he saw nothing three hundred and sixty degrees of darkness he wondered if there had ever been a submarine at all had smith ever believed he and mcconnell would get this far why have we stopped mcconnell had poked his head up from the cabin hows the nurse stern asked okay for now there was no morphine in the first aid kit i gave her some schnapps i found in a bag i need real medical supplies jonas stern nodded this is where were supposed to meet the submarine but theres no sub here but smith knows were coming right i mean he knows we succeeded stern rubbed the stubble on his chin did you ever consider the possibility that brigadier smith never meant for us to get out alive doctor that the attack was the only real point of all this mcconnell said nothing sterns suggestion was more than a possibility a man who would send bombers to wipe out all trace of their mission would not hesitate to leave them stranded in a black ocean between the ss and the german navy my god stern murmured look forty meters off the bow the massive conning tower of a submarine rose out of the waves like the biblical leviathan they must have been watching us through their periscope stern cried they were looking for a raft not a german patrol boat get anna and the girl ready by the time stem brought the patrol boat alongside the submarine its captain first officer two ratings and a man not in uniform but wearing a black turtleneck sweater were waiting for them the first officer carried a submachine gun stern saw hms sword painted on the submarines hull the ratings caught hold of the patrol boat with long hooks code names called the man in the black sweater butler and wilkes stern replied come aboard stern went below and brought hannah jansen out of the cabin mcconnell followed supporting anna as they approached the rail the man in the black sweater pointed at them and said something to the captain hold the captain shouted we can only take the two of you aboard no refugees mcconnell saw that this order had not surprised stern at all captain im a medical doctor he shouted this woman has a gunshot wound the other is a child they need immediate medical attention the captains resolve seemed to waver the man in the black turtleneck spoke angrily in his ear the captain brushed him away and said im sorry doctor but the normal rules do not apply i have specific orders only the two of you youve got ten seconds to get aboard this ship anna pulled mcconnells face close to hers go she said i can drive the boat ill point it north and try to reach sweden thank you for everything youve done not a chance in hell he said its a hundred miles to sweden straight through the german navy well scuttle her stern threatened he reached into his bag and brought out a british grenade then youll have to rescue them its the law of the sea i wont have that the captain shouted i will not have it he looked from stern to the man in the black sweater mcconnell sensed the honor of a sea captain struggling with his sense of duty to an authority he wasnt sure he trusted the captain leaned over and said something to his first officer mcconnell could scarcely believe it when the first officer turned and pointed the submachine gun at the man in the sweater come aboard the captain called quickly mcconnell went below to retrieve the crate containing the sample gas cylinders he stared at the lid thinking he did not like what he had seen of their rescue party so far he opened the crate quickly then sealed it again and carried it topside the ratings were holding the patrol boat steady for the transfer mcconnell handed the crate up to the first officer but the man in the sweater thrust himself forward and took it the first officer took aboard sterns leather bag and his explosives even before he took hannah jansen as stern climbed past mcconnell he whispered the black sweater is intelligence probably soe as they stood freezing in the darkness beside the conning tower the captain said well use the radio to call sweden i cant disobey a direct order brigadier smith must give me approval mcconnell felt fury rising in his chest im sorry doctor but ive no choice theres nowhere else i can put them off wed better hurry sir said the first officer the kriegsmarine has been alerted it wont take them long to find us the first officer escorted the soe man up the ladder and into the sub not exactly at gunpoint but with a clear understanding of who was in charge stern carried hannah up with ease but both ratings had to help mcconnell get anna up the ladder and through the hatch her arm was stiffening the pain and blood loss taking their toll the captain ordered that anna and hannah be held at the foot of the ladder while he used the radio mcconnell didnt want to leave them but stern shoved him along a claustrophobic passage toward the radio room a halfdozen young faces gaped at the german uniforms as they passed while the wireless operator raised atlanta and verified the codes the captain a rather short man with tired eyes said dont like irregular operations dirty business our job is sinking ships not ferrying joes all over the seven seas still got him sir said the wireless operator better make it quick were transmitting en clair and the kriegsmarine has df gear all over the place right the captain took the mike tickell here ive got a sticky situation a wounded woman and a child in dire circumstances ive brought them aboard for medical attention request permission to ferry them to you will you take them off there the only answer was a highpitched electronic whine and intermittent static the captain was standing half in and half out of the wireless station pressed against his back mcconnell had to turn his head only two inches to look into sterns eyes stern did not look confident at last the voice of brigadier smith cut through the static tickell theres more at stake here than you will ever know i will only say this once put those refugees back into whatever craft they arrived on and make for your destination straightaway confirm the captain leaned farther into the wireless room and said in a strained voice youre condemning them to death smith i wont have that on my conscience mcconnell felt stern jab him in the side looking back over his shoulder he saw the intelligence man standing about two yards behind stern with the first officer behind him there would be no getting past them to help anna and the child nothings on your precious conscience crackled smiths voice you saw my authority if you wont put them off my man will confirm mcconnell heard a long sigh then the voice of the captain saying message received and understood proceeding with all speed captain tickell looked back over his shoulder put them back in the patrol boat deevers he called to his first officer show the woman how to work the throttle and compass then point her towards sweden he turned and shouted toward the other end of the corridor prepare to dive mcconnell couldnt believe the man would really put off a wounded woman and a child he laid a hand on tickells shoulder captain the captain shoved roughly past him then stopped and looked back his face full of disgust im sorry doctor he said but theres nothing i can do its out of my hands he turned and made his way along the passage toward the control room mcconnell slipped a hand into his pocket duff smith had left him no choice and this would be his only chance just as captain tickell reached the control room mcconnell stepped away from the door to the radio room and brought out the eightinch metal cylinder marked soman iv captain he shouted your ship is in grave danger tickell turned slowly and peered back up the passage mcconnell held up the cylinder in his left hand and clenched the valve key between his right thumb and forefinger this canister contains the deadliest war gas known to man this is what we were sent into germany to get no one knows better than you that this submarine is nothing but a sealed tin can with a motor mcconnell heard the sound of running feet behind him he glanced over his shoulder in time to see stern shatter the nose of the soe man with his right hand and flatten the first officer with his left elbow the first officer tried to use his machine pistol but he was no match for stern in close quarters a burst of gunfire ricocheted though the passage ringing the steel hull like a mammoth bell then stern was holding the weapon over two dazed and bleeding men did you shoot them mcconnell asked in a shaky voice no watch the captain mcconnell whirled brandishing the cylinder tickell had already covered half the distance to him dont let this go any further captain he shouted he felt his control over the situation disintegrating fast if i release this gas in this submarine every man on board will be dead within five minutes either close the hatch and dive or preside over the death of your ship his eyes bore into the british officers so help me god captain i will do it hes bluffing groaned the soe man from the floor the captain stared wideeyed at the cylinder how long will it take us to get to sweden stern submerged about six hours mcconnell shook the cylinder again six hours captain i could keep my hand on this valve for twice that long if i had to you have two choices you know which is right which will it be captain tickell gazed into mcconnells eyes with the coldblooded assessment of a man accustomed to balancing lethal risks as he did mcconnell felt a strange calm settle in his soul he was not bluffing that realization gave him a sense of power he had never known in his life tickells eyes narrowed slightly then widened like those of a hunter who has followed a wounded lion too far into the bush let my first officer up he said deevers close the bloody hatch duff smith can sort out his own mess a dizzying wave of relief washed over mcconnell prepare to dive tickell shouted to the control room well torpedo the patrol boat before we go thank you captain mcconnell said you did the right thing tickells jaw muscles clenched with cold fury ill see you both hanged for this he said youll probably have to watch them pin medals on us first stern said over mcconnells shoulder lets get this stinking tub to sweden six hours later hms sword surfaced one mile off the southern swedish coast the voyage had been a test of nerves with mcconnell treating annas wound while stern stood guard with the revolver and the canister of soman theyd shut the door long enough for mcconnell to set and splint sterns broken finger but the lacerations on his chest had had to wait hannah jansen had drunk some powdered milk and vomited it up immediately by the time they crawled out of the submarines conning tower to be taken ashore they were near to exhaustion airman bottomley had rented a motor launch to meet the sub the sleek wooden craft rose and fell gently on the swell beside the subs sail when bottomley refused to take anna and the child aboard captain tickell told him he would take them or be blown out of the water bottomley took them the soe man remained on the sword apparently there was other dirty business still to be done in the baltic the launch reached the swedish coast after a tenminute run homing on a blinking green signal lantern when bottomley cut the engine and drifted into the small dock mcconnell spied the two silhouettes waiting for them one was duff smith the other was a little taller but bundled in a heavy coat and muffler for a wild moment he thought winston churchill himself might reach down out of the gloom to pull them onto the dock in the event he was even more stunned the face at the other end of the assisting arm belonged to his brother mcconnell froze for a moment watched stern hand the child up to david before he had time to think stern had helped anna out of the launch like a sleepwalker he climbed out of the boat and faced them all on the jetty david broke into a huge grin and said goddamn it boy you made it mcconnell could not speak despite the evidence before him his mind tried to deny the reality then david passed hannah jansen to stern reached into his flight jacket and brought out a pewter flask how about a shot of kentuckys finest mac he asked its cold as a welldiggers ass up here mcconnell turned to brigadier smith does he know what i thought duff smith shook his head very slightly then pointed at the wooden crate is that the gas sample doctor mcconnell nodded dully soman four fluoromethylpinacolyloxyphosphine oxide he gestured at sterns bag brandts lab log is in there he brought out the cylinder he had used to blackmail the sub captain but im going to hang onto this one until we reach england if you dont mind maybe even longer think of it as insurance dear boy smith said theres no need for histrionics youre the hero of the hour when are we going back to england right now your brother will fly us in the junkers he flew you over from england four nights ago though neither of you knew it i did david said ill be damned it was david who fixed the lysander engine made the whole jaunt possible i daresay smith allowed himself a smile a credit to the eighth air force this lad i hate to give him back and he loves my jua thats a fact david chimed in but by now he had sensed the tension between his brother and the brigadier all mcconnell could think of was the transatlantic call he had made to his mother three weeks before i wasnt counting on any refugees doctor smith said tetchily im afraid youve caused a spot of bother there mcconnell looked at david again then he handed the cylinder to stern and before anyone could stop him punched the brigadier in the belly with all his strength smith doubled over gasping for air airman bottomley leaped for mcconnell but he didnt get past david seconds later he was hanging by his throat from the crook of the pilots elbow take it easy now pardner david drawled duff smith straightened up with some difficulty its all right bottomley he croaked i suppose i deserved that one damn right you did said mcconnell now lets get the hell out of here all of us brigadier smith waved his agreement mcconnell saw stern staring at him in astonishment he slipped under annas good arm and braced her for a walk can you make it he asked quietly her eyes were only half open but she nodded as they moved along the jetty david leaned over and said what did you punch that old coot for hes okay once you get to know him mark hugged anna to his side and shook his head ask me in twenty years he said its a hell of a war story epilogue a hell of a story i said thats not the end of it rabbi leibovitz looked at me a little strangely dawn was creeping around the edges of the drapes wed moved into the kitchen sometime during the night where he told his tale over a pot of coffee later wed come back to the study what do you want to know he asked well everything but first my uncle david i thought he was killed in the war but according to you he was killed mark five months after macs mission he was shot down over germany it happened to a lot of good boys too many im afraid they had a little time together though brigadier smith managed to keep david four extra days before returning him to the eighth air force hed used churchills note and some valuable soe intelligence to get davids superiors to go along with the deception anyway mac and david spent the four days following the mission in london mac remembered them as some of the best days of his life i shook my head what about the others who got out alive you left me hanging at the camp did the shoemaker and rachel get to rostock with jan did they reach sweden miraculously enough they did they hid in the house of avrams old employee for three weeks it took that long to arrange passage on a smugglers boat it cost them all three diamonds but they reached sweden alive they were interned there for the duration of the war what did rachel do after the war she went to palestine to find her daughter palestine i figured hannah wound up in some british orphanage you underestimate jonas stern said leibovitz with the diamonds rachel and his father had given him stern arranged to have hannah cared for by a jewish family in london he fought with the british in france then with the jewish brigade later he won a hatful of medals then went back to palestine to drive out the british and the arabs he took hannah with him ill be damned and rachel found them with avrams help the two of them traveled from sweden to palestine in the winter of hannah was living with jonas and his mother in tel aviv my god were rachel and stern lovers then leibovitz smiled i dont know the two of them raised hannah under the same roof for some years they never married though from what i gathered sterns work kept him traveling around the world for longer and longer periods he was a born fighter he spent his whole life in one branch or another of israeli intelligence eventually rachel married another man hannah is a grown woman now well into middle age jan is a lawyer like his father was in tel aviv i shook my head and avram avram died twenty years ago he was eightysix i felt a disturbing dislocation of time in my mind avram stern was a man of fiftyfive hannah jansen a child of two how do you know all this i asked my grandfather kept up with everyone a little not so often but enough to know the big things every two or three years he got a letter from stern postmarked from the ends of the earth usually i sat quietly trying to take it all in the man who raised me the grandfather i thought i had known all my life was really someone entirely different leibovitz was right i felt different for hearing the story how many gray heads had i passed in the street or spoken to in the emergency room never imagining they had once hunched over the controls of a shattered bomber in the darkness over germany or lain in an icy ditch while ss troops combed a forest for them the rest of the story is not so happy leibovitz said fewer than half of the women and children who got away on the truck survived the war ive spent several years trying to track them down life in the forests of occupied poland was hard some ran into the wrong kind of resistance groups others died of sickness even hunger thats the way it was the most dramatic escape from a death camp in world war two was from sobibor three hundred escaped through the fence yet only a handful survived the mines and the machine guns of the ss christ i could see now why my grandfather felt confused about what he had done was it worth it rabbi how much of what my grandfather guessed was true how much of what brigadier smith told them was the truth leibovitz straightened in the chair as costly as that mission was i believe it was worth every life lost heinrich himmler had been trying to persuade hitler to utilize nerve gas to stave off the invasion but after the raid on totenhausen he had little choice but to buy brigadier smiths bluff the evidence was before his eyes the allies possessed nerve gas and they had used it they had used it to destroy himmlers pet project one day before his demonstration for the führer that left him two choices tell hitler about the devastating raid and accept the shame of being proved wrong not to mention admitting that allied saboteurs had penetrated a topsecret ss facility or cover it up yes how did he do it he simply exaggerated the effects of the bombs delivered by the mosquito flight who would argue with him what had been the village of dornow was hardly more than a crater in the snow the power station was obliterated the day after your grandfather left totenhausen himmler ordered the camp demolished and the debris plowed under the ground jesus i went there mark four years ago i was on a trip with some other rabbis to see the concentration camps i took a side trip to dornow i went down to the spot between the hills and the river and there was nothing there just a rough uneven field with the river flowing past it i said kaddish and drove away leibovitz touched a finger to his chin some justice did come out of it annas diary was used as evidence in the infamous nazi medical trials one of brandts assistant physicians had been away from totenhausen at the time of the attack he was hanged largely on the evidence of the diary what about the record kept by the jewish women did rachel take that out leibovitz smiled sadly how symmetrical it would be to think she did but when that last night of horror came no one thought of it they thought only of survival perhaps if frau hagan had still been alive perhaps but in any case they were not the only prisoners who kept records after the war similar journals were found buried in jars cans under barrack floorboards some of them for the first time i saw moisture in the rabbis eyes he leaned his head back and blinked then fell silent i picked up the victoria cross from the floor i think im beginning to understand i said what happened at totenhausen had nothing to do with glory not in any conventional sense winston churchill thought so though he awarded mac the medal in a private meeting near the end of the war the old man squeezed his hands together then reached out and took a sip of brandy ive sometimes wondered whether or not that vc is real as i told you the only other american ever to receive it was the unknown soldier technically its not supposed to be awarded to civilians the highest british medal that can be is the george cross and jonas stern received that for the totenhausen mission i believe the vc is real though i believe churchill liked your grandfather mark i think he deeply respected him and his ideals i think churchill saw in mac the best part of america and mac had given a great deal to england hed been working for them since remember long before pearl harbor leibovitz set down his glass mac respected churchill as well churchill asked him as a favor to preserve the secret of black cross and as you know too well mac did so until his dying day he once told me churchills note meant far more to him than the vc the rabbi got up from the chair and walked over to my grandfathers bookshelves we had a bit of a shock in he said moving slowly along the row of books mac and i were in my home watching cnn the desert storm deadline was near to expiring we saw a clip of american soldiers being briefed on how to inject themselves with atropine in response to poison gas attacks the announcer specifically mentioned sarin as the most feared weapon in the iraqi arsenal my god leibovitz turned from the shelves its true to this day sarin and soman remain the deadliest poison gases in the world the rabbis revelations were shocking but the truth was that my mind was no longer on weapons and military medals i picked up the old wooden box and took out the blackandwhite photograph the one showing the blond womans face against dark wood she really was beautiful this woman is anna kaas isnt she leibovitz nodded that was the real secret of your grandfathers life mark what happened to her she lived in britain until the end of the war i dont know whether she and mac lived together there or not but when the war ended he came back to america alone she stayed behind yes and he never told my grandmother about her never two years after the war anna kaas emigrated to new york she graduated from the cornell medical school in wow did my grandfather ever see her after that the rabbi seemed hesitant to answer two or three times he said finally over all those years medical meetings in new york boston what does it matter now he shared something with anna that no one but jonas stern could understand and probably not even him stern was made of different stuff i think i stood up tired from lack of sleep yet alive with a strange energy its difficult to take in i said i dont really know what to say or do i guess theres nothing i can do rabbi leibovitz gave me a meaningful glance what is it i asked wait a minute do these people know my grandfather is dead he smiled wistfully jonas stern is dead himself mark what he died in one day a telegram came to macs office it was from hannah jansen under her married name of course it said that sterns will had instructed her to notify mac of his death nothing else though we never found out how he died i contacted some friends in israel but israel is obsessive about security what about rachel does she know she knows i called her the day of the crash i was pacing the room growing inexplicably more nervous with each passing minute anna doesnt know however said leibovitz and i think you should be the one to tell her i stopped me why me he cocked his head to one side i think it would be fitting where did you say she was new york yes westchester her name is anna hastings now she got married of course she wasnt one to pine away the rest of her life her husband died some years ago though well its an hour later in new york i guess i could call her in a couple of hours leibovitz looked shocked you dont handle something like that over the phone boy you mean i should go to new york is it so difficult would it take so much time out of your life there and back in a day drive to atlanta get on a plane youre there i tried to remember my hospital schedule then realized with some embarrassment that i had taken the next three days off after all the man and woman who raised me had just died i knew id need some time to clear up any final legal business make arrangements about the estate and so on but the simple fact was that all of that could wait a few days if not months what the hell i said okay id like to hear what shes been doing all these years maybe get her side of this story leibovitz smiled i think youll be glad you did in the end i was glad i flew into newark on monday rented a car and after a onehanded wrestling match with a cheap servicestation map navigated the rented ford tempo up to westchester the house was smaller than id expected anna was supposedly a physician after all and shed had the good fortune to practice medicine before the advent of socalled healthcare reform hell shed probably started practicing before they even established medicaid i parked the ford and walked up a flowerlined sidewalk right out of fairplay georgia to the modest suburban house i felt a little overdressed id worn a nice suit in case the former anna kaas turned out to own the biggest palace in suburban new york i pushed the bell twice assuming as i had learned to do in medical practice that anyone over the age of sixty had some degree of hearing loss i wondered if anna would have a strong german accent when the door opened i was struck dumb i stood face to face with a mirror image of the woman from the photograph in my grandfathers box there was only one difference annas eyes had been dark this womans eyes were blue she looked at me strangely as if trying to decide whether or not i was dangerous the armani suit and gold montblanc fountain pen finally tipped the scales in my favor can i help you she asked in a perfectly american voice i fished a daytimer notebook out of my inside coat pocket and took out the weathered photograph from my grandfathers box i handed it to the woman she looked at it for what seemed like a long time then she took my hand and pulled me inside she led me to a carpeted living room that held a sofa two queen anne chairs and a set of tall glassfronted bookcases which displayed a menagerie of porcelain figurines and heavy ornamental picture frames the figurines looked like hummels wait here she instructed ill only be a moment i walked over to the window and looked out at the wellkept lawn had nurse anna kaas ever dreamed she would wind up here i was still standing like that when i heard someone catch a breath my god said a deeper almost rasping voice i turned standing in the foyer outside the living room was a woman of at least seventyfive with silver hair and dark brown eyes she leaned on the younger womans arm for support she stared at me for some moments then said hes dead isnt he are you doctor anna hastings i asked though i knew she had to be formerly anna kaas is mac dead yes maam he died three days ago it was an accident a helicopter crash my grandmother died with him the old woman nodded slowly then stepped away from her support and walked across the carpet in measured steps she stopped in front of me i wanted to be polite but my gaze kept wandering to the eyes of the younger woman who was staring at me with a strange intensity anna hastings reached out and laid her hand against my cheek you could be him she said softly i almost cant bear to look at you she could be you i said nodding toward the young woman although now that i had had time to study her i saw subtle differences the younger woman was more slender than anna had ever been and her cheekbones a bit higher katarina said anna hastings my granddaughter i smiled at her im mark mcconnell the third i added quickly that never really seemed relevant but now you would have finished your training by now of course anna said you are a doctor i nodded emergency medicine she laughed softly at that fighterpilot mentality her german accent was hardly noticeable in fact she probably spoke better english than i did sit down sit down the old woman insisted katarina will make some coffee well i really just came to to give you the news all the way from the back of beyond and already you want to leave sit down doctor it was on my way to the sofa that i noticed the picture when i first looked at the shelves id lost it among the others now it stood out like a beacon it was blackandwhite with almost the same tint as the photo i had brought with me it showed a man in his early thirties standing against a dark wooden beam his intense countenance and lanky body could have been my own it was all so clear now in the dark of that last night in the cottage they had taken turns standing against the beam and taking each others picture probably thinking that their images on film would be all that survived i felt a hard lump in my throat id like to ask you some questions if you dont mind i said are you married doctor the old woman asked what married no people wait too long nowadays katarina is the same oma her granddaughter said with embarrassment anna hastings laughed too picky too shy no one is good enough go make us some coffee girl anna used one agespotted hand to shoo me away from the shelves you go too doctor help her find the sugar nutrasweet for her of course go on both of you but i really do have some questions the former anna kaas put her hand over her mouth it was then that i saw the great effort it was taking to maintain her composure your grandfather was a great man she said a brave and a loyal man what else does anyone need to know theres plenty of time to talk about the past go make the coffee please katarina took my hand and pulled me out of the room she led me into a spotless white kitchen opened the refrigerator and took out a can of coffee for some reason i couldnt take my eyes off her i told myself it was some kind of transference that after hearing the story of the brave german nurse who was actually the elderly lady in the next room i had invested her granddaughter with her personality but there was no denying the young womans beauty or the intelligence behind her bright eyes ive never seen her that upset katarina said as she poured bottled water into the coffeemaker i think it might help her to talk to you even though she tries to pretend the past is dead it haunts her were you planning to stay the night in new york you have a hotel no id really planned to fly back tonight tonight but thats crazy you can stay here with us suddenly she blushed as if realizing she had overstepped some invisible line im sorry she said i know how it is in medicine im sure youve got to get back right away katarina i said softly im not really sure why i came up here i really dont have any plans at all she looked at me very openly then directly into my eyes call me kat she said thats what everyone calls me kat i said testing the name on my tongue kat i would really love to stay if you have room of course she smiled afterword black cross is a novel of historical fiction in certain instances i have taken small liberties with facts or time frames for dramatic purposes but not in such a way as to distort essential historical truths there was no concentration camp called totenhausen in mecklenburg however there were far too many camps like it throughout germany and poland the medical experiments described in the book involving dr clauberg are documented facts those involving meningitis are fictional but do not approach in horror and effect some of the actual experiments carried out by the nazis the victoria cross britains highest military award has been awarded to only one nonbritish citizen an unknown american warrior so far as i know there is no secret list as described in chapter one the actual medal that would have been received by a nonbritish civilian for the type of mission described in the book would be the george cross which is relatively unknown to most americans achnacarry castle is a real place and during the second world war produced some of the greatest unsung heroes in history colonel charles vaughan was the real co of the commando depot there and much of the credit for the exploits of its graduates including the us army rangers goes to him sir donald walter cameron was the real laird of achnacarry during the war and also the father of the present laird sir donald hamish cameron who served with distinction with the lovat scouts during wwii i fictionalized both colonel vaughan and the elder sir donald with the utmost respect and admiration the nerve gases described in black cross were and are real tabun was discovered by the germans in sarin in and soman in sarin and soman are still the most feared war gases in the world the nazis produced over tons of sarin by the end of the war according to official accounts soman never reached the mass production stage however as a curtain of secrecy descended over all these captured compounds after the nazi surrender we cannot be certain that all facts are known i believe that adolf hitler a man willing to destroy germany rather than surrender would have required powerful reasons to stay his hand from a weapon as potentially decisive as sarin i like to think that the allies particularly winston churchill possessed the nerve and the guts to order a mission like the one described in black cross a similar suicide mission was carried out by norwegians with the assistance of soe against a heavy water plant in norway in this costly raid ensured that adolf hitler was denied nuclear weapons the allied reaction or lack thereof to the news of what was occurring in the nazi concentration camps remains one of the darkest chapters of wwii it is expertly detailed in auschwitz and the allies by martin gilbert all of us owe our freedom to men and women we shall never know some of their stories are told in skis against the atom by knut haukelid the holocaust and churchill by martin gilbert castle commando by donald gilchrist moon squadron by jerrard tickell a man called intrepid by william stevenson and the glory and the dream by william manchester finally i would ask young readers to realize that fifty years is not a long time
