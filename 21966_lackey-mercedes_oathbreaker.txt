oathbreaker one it was a dark and stormy night pah warrl said with disgust so thick tarma could taste it must you even think in cliches tarma took her bearings during another flash of lightning tried and failed to make out warrls shaggy bulk against watery blackness then thought back at him well it is danmit tarma shena talesedrin who was shinain nomad kalenedral or to outclansmen a swordsworn and most currently scoutmaster for the mercenary company called idras sunhawks was not particularly happy at this moment she was sleetdrenched cold and numb and mired to her armpits as was her companion the lupine kyree warrl the sunhawks camp was black as the inside of a box at midnight for all it was scarcely an hour past sunset her hair was plastered flat to her skull and trickles of icy water kept running into her eyes she couldnt even feel the ends of her ringers anymore her feet hurt her joints ached her nose felt so frozen it was like to fall off and her teeth were chattering hard enough to splinter she was not pleased having to stumble around in the dark and freezing rain to find the tent she shared with her partner and oathbound sister the white winds sorceress kethry the camp was dark out of necessity even in a downpour sheltered fires would normally burn in the firepits in front of each tent or a slowburning torch would be staked out in the lee of every fourth but that was impossible tonight you simply couldnt keep a fire lit when the wind howled at you from directions that changed moment by moment driving the rain before it and torches under canvas were a danger even the most foolhardy would forgo a few of the sunhawks had lanterns or candles going in their tents but the weather was foul enough that most preferred to go straight to sleep when not on duty it was too plaguey cold and wet to be sociable for heat most stuck to the tiny charcoal braziers idra had insisted they each pack at the beginning of this campaign the sunhawks had known their captain too well to argue about what had seemed at the time a silly burden now they were grateful for her foresight but with the rain coming down first in cascades then in waterways tarma couldnt see the faint glow of candles or lanterns shining through the canvas walls that would have told her where the tents were so she slogged her way through the camp mostly by memory and was herself grateful to idra for insisting on an orderly camp laid out neatly in proper rows and not the huggermugger arrangement some of the other mere officers were allowing at least she wasnt tripping over tent ropes or falling into firepits i can smell keth and magic warrl said into her mind you should see the magelight soon thanks furball tarma replied a little more mollified she knew he wouldnt hear her over the howl of the wind but hed read the words in her mind she kept straining her eyes through the tempest for a sight of the witchlight keth had promised to leave at the frontto distinguish their tent from the two hundred odd just like it they were practically on top of it before she saw the light a blue glow outlining the door flap and brightening the fastenings she wrestled with the balky rawhide ties the cold made her fingers stiff and it took so long to get them unfastened that she was swearing enough to warm the whole camp before she had the tent flaps open having warrl pressed up against her like a sodden unhappy cat did not help the wind practically threw tarma into the tent and half the sleet that was knifing down on their camp tried to come in with her warrl remained plastered against her side not at all helpful smelling in the pungent penetrating way only a wet wolf can smell even if warrl only resembled a wolf superficially the kyree was not averse to reminding tarma several times a day as in fact he was doing now that they could have been curled up in a cozy inn if they hadnt signed on with this mercenary company she turned her back to the occupant of the tent as soon as she got past the tent flaps she needed all her attention to get them laced shut against the perverse pull of the wind gods of damnation she spat through stiff lips why did i ever think this was a good idea kethry only just now waking from a light doze refrained from replying she just waited until tarma got the tent closed up again then she spoke three guttural words activating the spell shed set there before drowsing off and a warm yellow glow raced around the tent walls meeting and spreading upward until the canvas was bathed in mellow light and the temperature within suddenly rose to that of a balmy spring day tarma sighed and sagged a little let me take that kethry said then unwinding herself from the thick wool blankets of her bedroll rising and pulling the woolen coat stiff with ice from tarmas angular shoulders get out of those soaked clothes the swordswornan shook water out of her shortcropped black hair and only just prevented warrl from trying the same maneuver dont you dare you fleabitten curl gods above and below youll soak every damned thing in the tent warrl hung his head and looked sheepish and waited for his mindmate to throw an old threadbare horse blanket over him tarma enveloped him in it head to tail held it in place while he shook himself then used it to towel off his coarse grayblack fur glad to see you greeneyes tarma continued stripping herself down to the skin occasionally wincing as she moved she rummaged in her pack finding new underclothing and finally pulling on dry breeches thick leggings and shirt of a dark brown lambswool i thought youd still be with your crew kethry gave an involuntary shudder of sympathy at the sight of her partners nearlyemaciated frame tarma was always thin but as this campaign had stretched on and on shed become nothing but whipcord over bone she hadnt an ounce of flesh to spare no wonder she complained of being cold so much and the scars lacing her golden skin only gave a faint indication of the places where shed taken deeper damage places that would ache demonically in foul weather kethry gave her spell another little mental nudge sending the temperature of the tent a notch upward i should have been doing this on a regular basis she told herself guiltily well thats soon mewled so theres not much more i can do the sweetfaced sorceress gathered strands of hair like suntouched amber into both hands twisting her curly mane into a knot at the back of her neck the light from the shaded lantern which hung on the tents crossbar augmented by the light of the shielding spell was strong enough that tarma noted the dark circles under her cloudy green eyes tresti is accomplishing more than i can at this point you know my magic isnt really the healing kind and on top of that right now we have more wounded men than women and needll do a man about as much good as a stick of wood kethry glanced at the plain shortsword slung on the tents centerpole and nodded to tell you the truth lately she wont heal anybody but you or me of anything but major wounds so she isnt really useful at all at this point i wonder sometimes if maybe shes saving herself anyway the last badly injured woman was your scout mala this morning we got her to you in time gods be thanked tarma felt the harpwiretaut muscles of her shoulders go lax with relief mala had intercepted an arrow when the scouts had been surprised by an enemy ambush tarma had felt personally responsible since shed sent warrl off in the opposite direction only moments before the scout had been barely conscious by the time theyd pounded up to the sunhawk camp only just an arrow in the gut is not something even for a masterhealer to trifle with and all we have is a journeyman teach me to steal eggs why dont you tell me something i dont know tarma snapped iceblue eyes narrowed in irritation harsh voice and craggyfeatured scowl making her look more like a hawk than ever oops a little too near the home i think temper kethry cautioned it had taken years of partnership for them to be able to say the right thing at the right time to each other but these days they seldom fouled the relationship whatever happened you cant undo it youd tell me that if the case were reversed and malas all right so theres no permanent harm done gah tarma shook her head again then continued the shake right down to her bare feet loosening all the muscles that had been tensed against cold and anger and frustration sorry my nerves have gone all to hell finish about mala so i can tell the others nothing much to tell i had need unsheathed and in her hands when they brought her inside the camp the arrows out the wounds purified and stitched and halfhealed or better shell be back dodging arrows with a little more success i hope in about a week after that all i could do that was at all useful was to set up a jestovath around the infirmary tent thats a shielding spell like the one i just put on ours after that i was useless so i came back here it was bad enough out there i figured a jestovath on owr tent was worth the energy expense and i waited for you to get in before putting it in place so i wouldnt have to cut it cant have the scoutmaster coming down with a fever she smiled and her wide green eyes sparkled with mischief listen to you though two years ago you wouldnt have touched a command position and now youre fretting over your scouts exactly the way idra fusses over the rest of us tarma chuckled feeling the tense muscles all over her body relaxing you know the saying only too well that was then this is now the moment is never the same twice youre learning gods having a mage as a partner is useful tarma threw herself onto her bedroll rolling over onto her back and putting her hands behind her head she stared at the canvas of the tent roof bright with yellow magelight and basked in the heat i pity the rest of the hawks with nobody to weatherproof their tents and nothing but an ittybitty brazier to keep it warm unless theyre twoing in which case i wish them well me too kethry replied with a tired smile sitting crosslegged on her own bedroll to fasten the knot of hair more securely though theres only a handful really twoing it i rather suspect even the ones that arent will bundle together for warmth though the way we used to when i wasnt capable of putting up a jestovath you must be about mastergrade yourself by now no tarma cracked her left eye open enough to see kethrys face the question obviously caught the mage by surprise beyond it uh thought so tarma closed her eyes again in satisfaction this job should do it then through idra well have contacts right up into the royal ranks if we cant wangle the property students and wherewithal for our schools after this well never get it wed have had it before this if it hadnt been for that damned minstrel now it was kethrys turn to snap with irritation must you remind me tarma groaned burying her face in the crook of her arm leslac leslac if it werent for bardic immunity id have killed you five times over youd have had to stand in line kethry countered with grim humor id have beat you to it bad enough that he sings songs about us worse that he gets the salient points all backwards but to give us the reputation that were shining warriors of the light is too damned muck they had discovered some four or five years ago that there was a particular bard one leslac by name who was making a specialty of creating ballads about their exploits that would have been all to the good for it was certainly spreading their name and reputation far and wide except that he was also leaving the impression that the pair of them were less interested in money than in just causes leslac had stressed and overstressed their habit of succoring women in distress and avenging those who were past distress so now anyone who had an ax to grind came looking for them most particularly women and usually they came with empty pockets or damned little in the way of payment to offer while the paying jobs they would rather have taken had been trickling away to others because those who might have offered those jobs couldnt believe theyd be interested in mere money and to add true insult to injury a good half of the time kethrys geasblade need would force them into taking those worthless just causes for needs geas was as written on her blade womans need calls meas womans need made meher need will i answeras my maker bade me by now kethry was so soulbonded to the sword that it would have taken a god to free her from it most of the time it was worth it the blade imparted absolute weapons expertise to kethry and would heal anything short of a death wound on any woman holding it and after the debacle with the demongodling thalhkarsh need had seemed to quiet down in her demands unless directly presented with a woman in dire trouble but with all those just causes showing up need had been rapidly turning into something more than a bit expensive to be associated with thanks to leslac theyd been at their wits ends and finally had gone to another couple of mercenaries old friends of theirs justin twoblade and ikan dryvale for advice they hadnt really hoped the pair would have any notions but they were the last resort and somewhat to tarmas surprise theyd had advice it was the offseason for the jewel merchants guild justin and ikans employers that meant no caravans and that meant that the paired mercenary guards were cosily holed up in their private quarters at the broken sword with the winter months to while away they certainly werent stinting themselves they had a pair of very decent rooms the broken swords excellent ale and as tarma discovered when she tapped at their door no lack of female companionship but the current pair of brighteyed lovelies was sent pouting away when strawhaired ikan answered their knock and discovered just who it was chat had chosen to descend upon himself and his partner one of the innkeepers quickfooted offspring was summoned then and sent off for food and ale for neither justin nor his shieldbrother would hear a word of serious talk until everyone was settled and comfortable at their hearth meat and drink at their elbows justin and ikan took their hospitality very seriously ive figured this was coming justin had said somewhat to tarmas shock and not just because of that idiot songster you two have very unique and specialized skills not like me and ikan youve gotten about as far as you can as an independent pairing now me and ikan we had the opposite problem were just ordinary fighting types a bit better than most but thats all that distinguishes us we had to join a company to get a reputation then we could live off that reputation as a pair but you youve got a reputation that will get you high fees from the right mercenary company tarma had shaken her head doubtfully at that but justin had fixed her with his mournful houndlike eyes and shed held her peace you tarma hed continued need much wider experience especially experience in commanding others and only a company will give you that kethry you need to exercise skills and spells you wouldnt use in a partnership and to leam how to delegate if your school is ever going to be successful and again youll learn that in a company long speech tarma had commented sardonically well ive got one too ikan had said winking a guileless blue eye at her you also need exposure to highborns so that they know your reputation isnt just minstrelsy and moonshine you havent a choice you truly need to join a company one with a reputation of their own one good enough that the highborns come to them for their contract then once you are ready to hang up your blades and start your schools youll have noble patrons and noble pupils panting in anticipation of your teaching and two notsonoble aging fighters panting in anticipation of easy teaching jobs kethry had laughed at ikans comic halfbow in their direction i take it that you already have a company in mind idras sunhawks justin had replied blandly the sunhawks warriors oath youd aim us bloody damned high wouldnt you tarma had been well taken aback for all that they were composed of specialisttroops skirmishers horsearchers and trackers the sunhawks repute was so high that kings and queens had been known to negotiate their contracts with idra in person good gods i should bloody well think highborns negotiate with them their leaders of the damned royal house of rethwellan and just how are we supposed to get a hearing with captain idra us ikan had replied stabbing a thumb at his chest were exhawks we started with her and probably would still be with her but idra was going more and more over to horsearchers and we were getting less useful so we decided to light out on our own but we left on good terms if we recommend that she give you a hearing idra will take our word on it and once she sees that youre what you claim to be youll be in never fear justin had finished for him shinain kalenedral gods youd fit in like a sword in a sheath hawkface and you keth idras always got use for another mage specially one nearly masterclass the best shes got now is a couple of selftaught hedgewizards add in furball there youll be a combination she wont be able to resist so it had proved with letters in their pouches from both ikan and his partner both could read and write a rarity among highborn much less mercenaries they had headed for the sunhawks winter quarters a tiny hill town called hawksnest the name was not an accident the town owed its existence to the sunhawks who wintered there and kept their dependents there those dependents that werent permanent parts of the company bivouac hawksnest was nestled in a mountain valley sheltered from the worst of the mountaintop weather and the fortified barracks complex of the sunhawks stood between it and the valley entrance when the hawks rode out a solid garrison and all the hawksintraining remained behind idra believed in creating an environment for her fighters in which the only worries they needed to have on campaign were associated with the campaign signing with idra was unlike signing with any other company most hawks stayed with idra for years she had led the company for nearly twenty years shed willingly renounced her position as third in line to the throne of rethwellan twentyfive years earlier preferring freedom over luxury shed hired on with a mercenary company herself then after five years of experience accompanied by her own steady rise within the ranks had formed the hawks tarma had been impressed with the quarters and the town the inhabitants were easy cheerful and friendly which spoke of good behavior on the part of the meres the hawks winter quarters were better than those of many standing armies and tarma had especially approved of the tall wooden palisade that stretched across the entrance to hawksnest a palisade guarded by both hawks and townsmen and the hawks themselves as rumor had painted them were a tight and disciplined group drilling even in the slack season and showing no sign of winterbom softness idra had sent for them herself after reading their letters they found her in her office within the hawks barracks she was a muscular athletic looking woman with the body of a born horsewoman mousegray hair a strong face that could have been used as the model for a heroic monument and the direct and challenging gaze of the professional soldier so shed said when they took their seats across the scratched worn table that served as her desk if im to trust twoblade and dryvale it should be me begging you to sign on kethry had blushed tarma had met that direct regard with an unwavering gaze of her own im kalenedral tarma said shortly if you know shinain that should tell you something swordsworn hmm the quick gray eyes took in tarmas brown clothing not on bloodfeud that was ended some time ago tarma told her levelly we ended it we two working together that was how we met shinain kalenedral and outclansman unlikely pairing even given a common cause so why are you still together for answer they both turned up their right palms so that she could see the silver crescentscars that decorated them one eyebrow lifted ever so slightly sa sheenedran that explains a bit seems ive heard of a pair like you if it was in songs tarma winced lets just say the stories are true in the main but false in the details and the author constantly left out the fact that weve always done our proper planning before we ever took on the main event luck plays wondrous small part in what we do if weve got any say in the matter and besides all that were a lot more interested in making a living than being somebodys savior idra had nodded her expression had settled into something very like satisfaction one last question for each of you whats your specialty shinain and whats your rank and school mage horseback skirmishing as you probably figured knowing me for shinain tarma had replied first im a damned good archer probably as good as any youve got i can fight afoot but id rather not weve both got battlesteeds and im sure you know what that means my secondary skill is tracking im white winds journeyman id say i lack a year or two of being masterclass kethry had given her answer hard on the heels of tarmas one other thing i think ikan and justin may have forgotten tarma is mindmate to a kyree and ive got a bespelled blade im soulbonded to it gives me weapons expertise so im pretty good at keeping myself in one piece on a battlefield thats damned useful in a fight you wont have to spare anybody to look after me and besides that it will heal most wounds for a woman and thats any woman not just me idra had not missed the implication but not a man eh peculiar but well im no mage cant fathom your ways about half my force is female so that would come in pretty useful regardless but white winds thats no healing school no its not kethry agreed i havent the greater healing magics just a few of the lesser but ive got the battlemagics and the defensive magics im not one to stand in the back of a fight shriek and look appalled for the first time idra smiled no i would guess not for all that you look better suited to a bower than a battlefield about the kyree were talking pelagir hills changeling here standard wolfshape hai overall hes built like a predator cat but hes got the coat and head of a wolf shoulder comes to about my waist he runs like a plains grasscat no stamina for a long march but hes used to riding pillion with me tarmas description made idra nod eyes narrowed in definite satisfaction hes got a certain ability at smelling out magic and a certain immunity to it given hes from the pelagirs he might have other tricks but he hasnt used them around me yet mindspeaks too mostly to me but he could probably make himself heard to anyone with a touch of the gift useful scout even more useful as an infiltrator but be aware that he eats a lot and if he cant hunt hell be wanting fresh meat daily thatll have to be part of any contract we sign well from what my boys say what i knew by reputation and what youve told me i dont think i need any more information only one thing i dont reckon idra had said broad brow creased with honest puzzlement if you dont mind my asking whats none of my business even if i do sign you whys the kyree mindmate to the fighter and not the mages familiar tarma groaned then and kethry laughed oh warrl has a mind of his own the mage had answered i had been the one doing the calling but he made the decision he decided that i didnt need him and tarma did so besides your formidable talents i get three recruits not two three used to teamworking no commander in her right mind would argue with that idra then stood up and pushed papers across her desk to them sign those my friends if youre still so minded and youll be sunhawks before the ink dries so it had been now tarma was subcommander of the scouts and keth was in charge of the motley crew concerned with healing and magery two hedgemages a fieldsurgeon and herbalist and his two apprentices and a healing priest of shayana priestess would have been a more accurate title but the shayanas devotees did not make any gender differences in their rankings which ofttimes confused someone who expected one sex and got the opposite tresti was handfasted to sewen idras second a weathered bigboned former trooper that sometimes caused keth sleepless nights she wondered what would happen if it was ever sewen carried in through the door flap of the infirmary but the possibility never seemed to bother tresti tarma and kethry had fought in two intense campaigns each lasting barely a season this was their third and it had been brutal from the start but then that was often the case with civil war and rebellion ten moons ago the king of jkatha had died declaring his queen sursha to be his successor and regent for their three children eight moons ago surshas brotherinlaw declin lord kelcrag had made a bid for the throne with his own armed might lord kelcrag was initially successful in his attempt actually driving sursha and her allies out of the throne city and into the provinces but he could not eliminate them and he had made the mistake of assuming that defeat meant that they would vanish queen sursha had talent and wisdom the talent to attract both loyal and capable people to her cause and the wisdom to know when to stand back and let them do what was needful however distasteful that might be to her gentle sensibilities that talent won half the kingdom to her side that wisdom allowed her to pick an otherwise roughhewn provincial noble havak lord leamount as her generalinchief and led her to give him her full and open support even when his decisions were personally repugnant to her general lord leamount levied or begged troops from every source he could and then hired specialists to till in the skill gaps his levies didnt have and one of the first mercenary captains he had approached was idra his troops were mostly foot with a generous leavening of heavy horse no skirmishers no scouts no light horse at all other than his own personal levy of hillclansmen the hillmen were mounted on rugged little ponies good in rough country but slow in open areas and useless as strikeandrun skirmishers and by now idras troops were second to none thanks in no small part to tarma the shinain had seen no reason why she could not benefit her presumptive clans coffers and her new comrades as well shed arranged for the sunhawks to get first pick of the salehorses of talesedrin these werent battlesteeds which were never let out of shinain hands but they werent culls either which was what the sunhawks had been seeing and when the hawks had snapped up every beast she offered she arranged for four more clans to bring in their firstpick horses as well so now the hawks were better mounted than most nobles on horses that could be counted as extra weapons in a closein fight that fact was not lost on lord leamount nor was he blind to idras canny grasp of strategy idra was made part of the high command and pretty much allowed to dictate how her hawks were used as a result although the fighting had been vicious the hawks were still at something like fourfifths strength their ranks were nowhere near as decimated as they might have been under a commander who threw them recklessly at the enemy rather than using them to their best advantage at midsummer lord leamounts combined forces had fallen on the throne city and driven lord kelcrag out every move kelcrag had made since then had been one of retreat his retreat had been hard fought and each acre of ground had been bitterly contested but it had been an inexorable series of losses but now autumn was half over he had made a breakandrun and at this point everyone in leamounts armies knew why he was choosing to make a last stand on ground he had picked both sides knew this next battle would have to bring the war to a conclusion in winter it would be impossible to continue any kind of real fight the best outcome would be stalemate as troops of both sides floundered through winter storms and prayed that illluck and hardship would keep their ranks from being thinned too much if kelcrag retreated to his own lands hed come under seige and ultimately lose if the besieging troops could be supplied and rotated if he fled into exile the queen would have to mount an everpresent vigil against his return an expensive proposition she and leamount had both wanted to invoke the mercenary code ritual of oathbreaking and outcasting on him but while he was undeniably a rebel he had actually broken no vows nor could sursha find the requisite triad for the full ceremony of priest mage and honest man all of whom must have suffered personal irreparable harm at his hands as a result of violation of sworn oaths so technically he could have been seen by some to be the injured party and as for kelcrag in such a situation exile would mean impoverishment and hardship circumstances he was not ready to face further it would bring the uncertainty of when or even if he could muster enough troops and allies to make a second try kelcrag had chosen his ground with care tarma had to give him that he had shale cliffs impossible to scale to his left scrub forest and rough broken ground to his right keeping leamount from charging from that direction his troops were on the high ground occupying a wide pass between the hills with a gradual rising slope between his army and the loyalists it was as close to being an ideal situation for the rebels as tarma could imagine there was no way to come at him except straight on and no way he could be flanked and now the autumnal rains were beginning of all of idras folk only the scouts had been deployed seeking in vain holes or weaknesses in kelcrags defenses for the rest it had been set up camp dig in and wait wait for better weather better information better luck gah tarma groaned again i hope kelcrags as miserable on his damned hill as we are down here anything out of the mages mine or in general both mine have been too busy fending off nuisancespells to bother with trying to see whats going on across the way ive been setting up wards on the camp protections on our commanders and things like the jestovatk on the healers tent i havent heard anything directly from leamounts greater mages but ive got some guesses which are tarma stretched then turned on her side the great battle magics were exhausted early on for both sides in this mess and none of the mages have had time to regather power that leaves the lesser which means theyre dueling like a pair of tired but equallymatched bladesmen neither can see what the other is doing neither can get anything through thats more than an annoyance and neither wants to let down their guards and their shields enough to recharge in a power circle or open up enough to try one of the greater magics they might have left so your people will be pretty much left alone except for physical material attacks well thats a blessing any scoutmaster came a plaintive call from outside the tent be ye awake yet who the bloody tarma scrambled for the lacings of the door flaps as kethry hastily cut the spell about the door with two slashes of her hands and a muttered word get in here child before you turn into an ice lump tarma hauled the halffrozen scout into their tent the girls brown eyes went round at the sight of the spell energy in the tent walls wide and no little frightened she looked like what she was a mountain peasant short stocky and brown round of face and eye but she could stick to the back of her horse like a burr on a sheep she was shrewd and quick and nobodys fool she was one of the hawks tarma had been thinking of when shed mentioned other ways of keeping warm kyra was shieldmated to rild a mountain of a man who somehow managed to sit a horse as lightly as thin tarma keth this is kyra shes one of the new ones replaced pawell when he went down tarma pushed the girl down onto her bedroll and stripped the sodden black cloak from her shoulders hanging it to dry beside her own coat kyra dont look so green youve seen keth in the healers tent this is just a bit of magic so we sleep more comfortable keths better than a brazier and i dont have to worry about her tipping over in the night the girl swallowed hard but looked a little less frightened beg pardon but i aint seen much magery i should think not out in these hills not much call for it nor money to pay for it so spit it out what brings you here instead of curled up with that monster you call a shieldmate the girl blushed brilliant red na scoutmaster dont na me my girl i may not play the game anymore but i know the rules and before the warrior put her oath on me i had my moments though you children probably wouldnt think it to look at me old stick that i am out with it something gone wrong with the pairing eh no naught like that i just been thinking couldnt get a look round before today now seems i know this pass like got kin a ways west useta summer wi cm cousins if im aright bout a days ride west o here and there was always this rumor see there was this path up their way tarma didnt bother to hide her excitement she leaned forward on her elbows feeling a growing internal certainty that what kyra was about to reveal was vital there was this story abaht the path dye ken the wild ones the ponies they used it at weanin time wed go for em to harvest the foals but some on em would allus get away well tales said they used that path that it went all the way through tother side dye take my meaning warrior bright you bet i do my girl tarma jumped lithely to her feet and pulled kyra up after her keth right kethry made the slashing motions again and the magic parted from the door flaps wait a hair i dont want you two finding our answer and then catching your deaths another pass of hands and a muttered verse sent water steaming up out of coat and cloak when tarma pulled both off the centerpole they were dry to the touch tarma flashed her partner a grin thanks milady if you get sleepy leave the door open for me hey kethry gave a most unladylike snort as if i could sleep after this bit of news i havent been working with you for this long not to see what you saw the end to the stalemate youve said it ill be awake for hours on this one kethry settled herself with her blankets around her then dismissed the magic altogether the tent went dark and cold again and kethry relit her brazier with another muttered word ill put that jestovath back up when you get back and make it fast or i may die of nerves instead of freezing to death two back out into the cold and wet and dark they went kyra trailing along behind tarma she stayed right at tarmas elbow more a presence felt than anything seen as warrl in mindtouch with tarma led both of them around washouts and the worst of the mud tarmas goal was the captains tent she knew full well it would be hours before sewen and idra saw their bedrolls shed given them the reports of her scouts just before rumbling her way to her own rest and she knew they would still be trying to extract some bit of advantage out of the bleak word shed left with them so warrl led them to idras quarters even in the stormblack it was the only tent not hard to find idra had her connections for some outoftheordinary items and after twenty years of leading the hawks there was no argument but that she had more than earned her little luxuries there was a bright yellow magelight shining like a miniature moon atop each of the poles that held up a canvas flap that served as a kind of sheltered porch for the sentry guarding the tent unlike keths dim little witchlight these were bright enough to be seen for several feet even through the rain if it had been reasonable weather and if there had been any likelihood that the camp would be attacked or that the commanders of the army would be sought out as targets idras quarters would be indistinguishable from the rest of the hawks but in weather like this idra felt that being able to find her quickly took precedence over her own personal safety idras tent was about the size of two of the bivouac tents the door flap was fastened down but tarma could see the front half of the tent glowing from more magelights within and the yellow light cast shadows of idra and sewen against the canvas as they bent over the maptable just as shed left them warrl was already moving into the wavering glow of the magelights he was a good couple of horselengths in front of them which was far enough that the sentry under that bit of sheltering canvas couldnt see kyra and tarma to challenge them at least not yet no matter and no matter dial warrls black fur couldnt be seen in the rain even with the glow of the magelights on him warrl barked three times out of the storm paused then barked twice more that was his password every man woman and noncombatant in the hawks knew warrl and warrls signal and knew that where warrl was tarma was following after so by the time tarma and kyra had slogged the last few feet to the tent the sentry was standing at ease the door flap was unlaced and sewen was ready to hold it open for them against the wind his muddy gray eyes were worried as he watched the two of them ease by him tarma knew what he was thinking at this hour any caller probably meant more trouble i trust this isnt a social call idra said dryly as they squeezed themselves inside and stood dripping and blinking in the glow of her magelights the magelights only made her plain leather armor and breeches look the more worn and mundane and i hope it isnt a disciplinary problem kyras autumnal eyes were even rounder than before tarma suppressed a chuckle kyra hadnt seen the captain except to sign with her and was patently in awe of her captain this is my new scout kyra replaced pawell didnt she aye to make it short she thinks she knows a way to come in behind kelcrag great good gods idra half rose off of her tall stool then sank down again with a look as though shed been startled out of a doze well that certainly got their attention tarma thought watching both idra and her second go from weary and discouraged to alert in the time it took to say the words cmere kid sewen rumbled he took kyras woolclad elbow with a hard and callused hand that looked fit to crush the bones of her arm and which tarma knew from experience could safely keep a dayold chick sheltered across a furlong of rough ground he pulled her over to the table in the center of the tent yread maps no good heres us heres him report kyra plainly forgot her awe and tear of magic and the diffidence with which she had regarded her leaders and became the professional scout beneath sewens prodding the tall bony second was idras right hand and more where her aristocratic bearing sometimes overawed her own people particularly new recruits sewen was as plain as a clod of earth and awed no one not that anyone ever thought of insubordination around him he was just as respected as idra it was just that he looked and sounded exactly like what he was a common fighter whod come up through the ranks on brains and ability he still dressed by preference in the same boiledleather armor and homespun hed always worn though he could more than afford the kind of expensive riveted brigandine and doeskin idra and tarma had chosen he understood everything about the hawks from the ground up because hed served the hawks since idras fifth year of commanding them idra and tarma just leaned over the maptable with him and let him handle the young scout so on the face of it it bears checking thats a task for the scouts idra said at last when kyra had finished her report she braced both hands on the table and turned to her scoutmaster tarma whats your plan that i take out kyra and hmm garth beaker and jodi tarma replied after a moment of thought we leave before dawn tomorrow and see what we can see if this trail still exists well follow it in and find out if the locals are right ill have beaker bring a pair of his birds one to let you know if we find the trail at all and one to tell you yea or nay on whether its usable that way youll have full information for lord leamount without waiting for us to get back good idra nodded in satisfaction as a bit of graybrown hair escaped to get into her eyes sewen what id do sewen affirmed pushing away from the table and sitting back onto his stool them birds dont like water but thats likely to mafce em want their coops more maybe fly a bit faster hey don wanta send a magemessage or kelcrags magickers might track it uhhuh that was my thought tarma agreed nodding that and the sad fact that other than keth our magickers might not be able to boost a magemessage that far i need keth here idra stated and none of leamounts mages are fit enough to travel over that kind of territory sewen emitted a bark of laughter weathered face crinkling up for a moment gah that lots as miserable as a buncha wet chickens in a leaky hennery right now they don know this weather an evry time they gotta move from their tent yd think it was gonna be a trip t th end of th earth idra looked thoughtful for a moment and rubbed the side of her nose with her finger this isnt wizard weather is it do you suppose both tarma and her scout shook their heads vigorously na capn kyra said cheerful light brightening her round face na is just a bit of a gentle fall storm yshould see a hard one now idras eyebrows shot upward she straightened and looked seriously alarmed until sewens guffaw told her shed been played for an ignorant flatlander seriously no tarma seconded i asked keth she says the only sign of wizard weather would be if this stopped that its got too much weight behind it whatever that means sewen lifted his own eyebrow and supplied the answer she meant its somethin comin in the proper season got all the weight of time an what should be behind it he grinned at tarmas loose jaw showing teeth a horse could envy useta study wizardry as a lad hadnt nough gift t be moren half a hedgewizard so gavet up good then were all agreed idra straightened her shoulders gave her head an unconscious toss to get that bit of her hair out of her face tarma see to it who will you put in to replace you tomorrow tamar next to garth and jodi hes my best and hes come in from the skirmishers good and tell him to tell the rest of your scouts not to give the enemy any slack tomorrow but not to get in as close as they did today i dont want them thinking weve maybe found something else to concentrate on but i dont want any more gutwounds either it was dawn or nearly and the rain had slackened some there was still lightning and growling thunder but at least you could see through the murk and it was finally possible to keep the shielded torches at the entrance to the guarded camp alight tarma saw her scouts assembled beneath one of those torches as she rode up to the sentry she felt like yawning but wouldnt she wouldnt be a bad example cold ye gods im halffrozen and we havent even gotten out of the camp yet she thought with resignation i havent been warm since summer and then you were complaining about heat warrl replied sardonically i was not that was keth she retorted i like the heat warrl did not deign to reply tarma was already feeling grateful for kethrys parting gift the waterrepelling cape keth had insisted on throwing over her coat its not magic keth had said i dont want a mage smelling you out just tightwoven oiled silk and bloody damned expensive i swapped a jestovath on his tent to gerroldfor it for as long as the rains last i hope you dont mind the fact that its looted goods not likely shed replied so today it was keth looking out for and worrying about her they seemed to take it turn and turn about these days being motherhen well that was what being partners was all about took you long enough to come to that conclusion warrl laughed now if youd just start motherhenning me youd bite me you furcovered fiend h probably ah youre hopeless tarma chided him smothering a grin lets look serious here this is business yes oh mistress tarma bit back another retort she never won in a contest of sharp tongues with the kyree instead of answering him she pondered her choice of scouts again and was satisfied all things considered that shed picked the best ones for the job first garth a tiny man and dark he looked like a dwarfish shadow on his tall shinain gelding he was one of tarmas first choices for closein night work since his dusky skin made it unnecessary for him to smear ash on himself but his most outstanding talents were that he could ride like a shinain and track like a hound his one fault was that he couldnt hit a haystack with more than two arrows out of ten he was walking his bay gelding back and forth between the two sentries at the sallypoint since his beast was the most nervous of the five that would be going out and the thunder was making it lay its ears back and show the whites of its eyes beaker average was the word for beaker size coloring habits average in everything except his nose that raptors bill rivaled tarmas his chestnut mare was as placid of disposition as garths beast was nervous and beakers temperament matched his mares as tarma rode up they both appeared to be dozing despite the cold rain coming down on their heads fastened to the cantle of beakers saddle were two cages each the size of two fists put together each holding a black bird with a green head beaker was a good tracker almost as good as garth but this was his specialty the training and deployment of his messenger birds jodi sleepyeyed and deceptively quiet this pale iceblonde child with evident aristocratic blood in her veins was their mapmaker besides that skill she was a vicious knife fighter and as good with a bow as garth was poor with one she rode a gray mare with battlesteed blood in her a beast impossible for anyone but her or tarma to ride who would only allow a select few to handle her jodi sat her as casually as some gentle palfrey and with jodi in her saddle the mare acted like one her only fault was that she avoided situations where she would have to command the way she would have avoided fouled water and kyra peasant blood and peasant stock shed trained herself in tracking bow and knife and hard riding intending to be something other than some stodgy fanners stolid wife when the war came grinding over her parents fields and her family had fled for their lives shed stayed shed coolly sized up both sides and chosen surshas then sized up the mercenary companies attached to surshas army and decided which ones she wanted to approach shed started first with the hawks though she hadnt really thought shed get in or so she had confessed to tarma after being signed on little had she guessed that scout pawell had coughed out his life pinned to a tree three days earlier and that the hawks had been down by two scouts before that had happened tarma had interviewed her and sent her to sewen whod sent her to idra whod sent her back to tarma with the curt order try her if she survives hire her tarma had sent her on the same errand that had killed pawell kyra had returned since pawell had had no relatives no leman and no shieldmate to claim his belongings tarma gave her pawells dun horse pawells gear and pawells tentmate kyra had quickly acquired something pawell hadnt tentmate had turned to shieldmate and lover the scouts altogether approved as pawell had been standoffish and his replacement was anything but the romance had amused and touched them kyra had begun to bloom under the approval to think for herself to make judgment calls the kyra that had joined them would never have come to tarma with an old tale and a rumor kyra of now had experience enough to know how important that rumor could be and enough guts to present the information herself she was tarmas personal pick to become a subcommander herself in a few years it was false dawn one hour to real dawn and there was a hint that the sky was getting lighter no words were needed they all knew what they had to do when tarma rode gray ironheart into the waiting knot of scouts and horses those dismounted swung back up into their saddles tarma didnt even slacken her pace all five of them left the camp in proper diamond formation as if theyd rehearsed the whole maneuver tarma had point since as commander she was the only one of the five with all the current passwords garth tail jodi right and kyra left beaker and his precious birds rode protected in the middle they rode along the back of the string of encampments dark tents against slowly graying sky to their right scrub forest and hills stark black against the sky to their left the camps were totally dark since just about everyone had encountered the same troubles as the hawks had with lights and fires in the pouring rain they were challenged almost as soon as they left their own camp a footsentry sodden but alert he belonged to staferds colddrakes this was the edge of their camp tarma nodded to herself with satisfaction at his readiness and gave him the countersign then came a heavy encampment of regular infantry whose sentry hailed warrl who was trotting at ironhearts flank by name and called out youre recognized sunhawks pass on tarma felt a little twitchy about that one but couldnt fault him you challenged those whom you didnt recognize you could let known quantities by and there were no kyree in kelcrags forces at the next encampment duke greyhames levy they were physically challenged a fullyarmed youth with an arrogant sneer on his lips mounted on a heavy wildeyed warhorse he blocked their path until tarma gave an elaborate countersign even then he wouldnt clear the path entirely he left only enough room for them to ride past in single file unless they wanted to desert the firm ground and ride on the mushy banks and he backed off with some show of reluctance and much induced rearing and prancing of his gelding scoutmaster garth eased his horse alongside tarmas and whispered angrily to her id like to feed that little son of a bitch his own damned gauntlet peace tarma said let me handle this give me rear for long enough to teach him a lesson garth passed the word wry grins appeared and vanished in an instant and the scout ranks opened and closed so that beaker had point and tarma had dropped back to tail the scouts squeezed past the arrogant sentry one by one tarma the last she didnt move only stared at him for a long moment letting ironheart feel her ground and set her feet then she dropped her hands and signaled the battlemare with her knees black as a nightmare in the rain the battlesteed reared up to her full height and stayed there as perfectly balanced as only a shinain trained warsteed could be another invisible command from tarma and she hopped forward on her hind hooves forefeet lashing out at the stranger gelding who not being the fool his rider was cleared off the path and up onto the mucky shoulder then ironheart settled to all four hooves again but only for as long as it took to get past the arrogant sentry as tarma had figured he would he spurred his beast down onto the path again as soon as they got by whatever hed thought to do then didnt much matter as soon as he was right behind them and just out of range of what was normally an attack move tarma gave her mare a final signal that sent her leaping into the air lashing out with her rear hooves in a wicked kick as she reached the top of her arc had the boy been within range of those hooves his face would have been smashed in as it was as tarma had carefully calculated the load of mud ironheart had picked up flicked oft her heels to splatter all over him his fancy panoply and his considerably cowed beast next time boy she called back over her shoulder as her scouts snickered best know whose tail it is you plan to twist and be prepared for consequences the edge of the camps was held by the freefighters little clots of scum no good company would take into itself they were one of the reasons each levy and company had its own set of sentries politics was the other tarma didnt much understand politics scum she knew it had been a band of this sort of flotsam that had wiped out her clan but a sword was a sword and leamount was not above paying them so long as someone he trusted could keep an eye on them that thank the warrior is not idras job tarma thought to herself wrinkling her nose at the stench of their huddle of makeshift shelters unwashed bodies rotting canvas garbage privy pits right in the camp the mix was hardly savory even the rain couldnt wash it out of the air they rode past this lot too sodden with drink or drug or just too damn lazy to set one of their own to sentry duty without a challenge but with one hand on their knives and shortswords at all times thered been trouble with this lot before and five were not too many for them to consider mobbing if they thought it worth their while once out of the camps they rearranged their order now it was kyra who had point and tarma who took tail this side of the mountains danger would be coming at them from the rear kelcrags scouts sniffing around the edges of the royalist army all of them had taken care long ago to replace metal harness pieces with leather where they could or even carved wood anything that wouldnt shine and wouldnt clink the metal they had to have was not brightwork it was dulled and tarnished and left that way shinain horses were trained to neck and knee so all they needed was a soft halter with no bit as for their own armor or lack of it their best protection would be speed on a mission like this stay out of the way if you can and never close for a fight unless you have no choice so they saved themselves and their horses the few extra pounds and dressed for the weather not for battle tarma kept her short shinain horsebow strung and under her cape if it came to a fight she would buy the rest time to string theirs warrl ranged all over their backtrail keeping in steady mindtouch with tarma he would buy them yet more advance warning if there was going to be trouble but the trek west was quiet the storm gradually slackened to drizzle as the sky grew lighter the landscape was dreary even without the devastations of warfare all about them the hills were dead and brown and lifeless the herds of sheep and gercattle that usually grazed them had gone to feed one or both armies the scrub trees displayed black leafless branches against the gray sky and the silence around them intensified the impression that this area was utterly deserted wet rotting leaves left their own signature on the breeze a melancholy bitter aroma more tasted than smelled that lingered in the back of the throat the track they followed was part rock part yellow mud a thick claylike stuff that clung to hooves and squelched when it let go all five of them rode in that peculiar halftrance of the scout on his way to something not looking for anything not yet not paying outward attention to surroundings but should anything however small move a crow flapping up to their right got exactly the appropriate reaction tarma readyarmed had already sighted on him before hed risen a foot jodi and beaker had their hands on their bowcases and their eyes to left and right wary for possible ambush garth had his sword out and was ready to back tarma and kyra was checking the road ahead for more trouble they all laughed shakily when they realized what their enemy was dont think even kelcrags taken up with the corbies tarma said shaking her head and tucking her bow back under the oiled silk still probably he hasnt got anyone dedicated enough to go mucking around in this weather but we cant count on it stay alert children at least until we get out of the war zone by midday they had done just that there were herds on the distant hills although the shepherds and herders quickly moved them out of sight when they saw the little band approaching tarma saw garth nodding in sympathy lips moving soundlessly in what she rather thought was a blessing his people had been all but wiped out when some war had trampled them into their earth somewhere down south tarma knew everything there was to know about her children she had made a point of getting drunk at least once with each of her scouts it was damned useful to know what made them twitch one of the reasons garth was with idra he was so good a tracker he could have served with any company or even as a pampered huntsman to royalty was because she allowed no looting of the peasantry nobles were another matter and insisted on the hawks paying in trade silver and pure copper ingots for what they needed like garth all the hawks tended to serve their ladycaptain for more than just coin by now they were all fairly well sodden except for tarma brown and black and gray cloaks all becoming a similar dark indeterminant shade even tarma was rather damp rain that was one scant point from being sleet still managed to get past her high collar to trickle down her neck and muddy water from every puddle they splashed through had soaked through her breeches long ago she was going numb with cold the rest of them must be in worse case kyra she called forward you in territory you know yet the girl turned in her saddle rain trickling down her nose hmmeh id say so think thiss domery lands theyre kin of my kin i dont want to stretch anybodys hospitably or honesty but we need to dry off a bit there any herders huts or caves or something around here something likely to be deserted this time of year ill think ont a few soggy furlongs later as kyra scanned her memory and the land around them scoutmaster she called back bout three hills over there be a cave used for lambin and shearin and never else that do room for all of us i mean horses too no sense in shouting our presence by tethering them out and plain cruel to make them endure more of this than we do kyras brow creased with thought if i dont misremember aye be a squeeze but aye kyra had misremembered but by underestimating the size of the cave there was enough room at the back for all five horses to stand shoulder to shoulder with enough space left over for one rider at a time to rub his beast down without getting trampled on an overhanging shelf of limestone made it possible to build a fire at the front of the cave without all of them eating smoke and there was wood stocked at the side dry enough that there wasnt much of that smoke in the first place more to the point where concealment was concerned the rain dissipated what trickled past the blackened overhang how much farther tarma asked chewing on a tasteless mouthful of trailbiscuit not much kyra replied we better be cuttin overland from here if m memry be still good look you she dipped a twig in muddy black water and drew on a flat rock near the caves entrance tarma got down on her knees beside her and studied her crude map carefully one maybe two candlemarks depending hmm aye depending kyra chewed on the other end of the twig for a moment we got to stick tridges what beaker exclaimed for every gossip in the hills to see us oh bad to be seen but worse to be bogged valleys they go boggy this time of year like stuff livin in the bogs is bad for a beasts feet y want yer laddys hooves t rot off fore we reach trails end y ride the valleys no middle way tarma asked well we wont be goin where theres hkely many an most of thosed be my kin they see me they know what i was abaht and they keep their tongues from clackin thatll have to do tarma got up from her knees and dusted the gravel off the knees of her breeches which were she was happy to find relatively dry all right children lets ride i dunno garth said dubiously peering up through the drizzle at what was little better than a worn track along the shale cliffside tarma studied the trail and chewed at the corner of her lip kyra she said finally your beasts the weakest of the lot give it a try if she can make it we all can aye kyra saluted and turned her mares head to the trail she let the mare take her time and pick her own places to set her feet along the track it seemed to take forever but eventually they could see that she was waving from the top send the first bird beaker tarma said heading ironheart after the way kyra had followed were going to see if this trail is a dead end or the answer to our prayers twice before sunset they lost the track on broad expanses of bare rock and spent precious time trying to pick it up again all of them combing the ground thumblength by thumblength sunset was fast approaching the second time they lost then found the trail again tarma scanned the sky warily trying to judge with the handicap of lowering clouds how much time they had before darkness fell they obviously werent going to make trails end by sunset so the choice was whether to camp here on this windswept slant of scoured stone or to press on in the hope of coming up with something better and maybe instead find themselves spending the night on a ledge two handspans wide she finally decided to press on allowing just enough time in reserve that they could double back if they had to the track led on through lichen and rubble treacherous stuff except where the wild ponies had pounded a thin line of solidity jodi was mapping as they went along and marking their backtrail with carefully inconspicuous cairns composed of no more than three or four pebbles the drizzle had stopped at least and the exertion that was warming them had driven most of the damp out of their clothing the ponytrack led down into a barren gulley tarma disliked that and kept watching for water marks on the rocks they passed if there was a cloudburst and this happened to be one of the local runoff sites they could be hockdeep in tumbling rock and fast water in the time it took to blink but the gulley stayed dry the track eased a bit and then like a gift from the gods just before tarma would have signaled a turnaround point they came upon a possible campsite sometime in the nottoorecent past part of the hill above them had come sliding down creating a horseshoe of boulders the size of a house there would be shelter from the wind there their fire would be out of sight of prying eyes and it would be easy to defend from predators garth eyed the site with the same interest tarma was feeling no place to get out of the rain if it decided to come down again he observed and nothing much to burn but that scrub up there on the wall wed have us a pot of hot tea but a cold camp huh the choice is this or the flat back there tarma told them me id take this kyra this is your land aye id take this weve slept wet afore kyra agreed this un isnt a runoff an dont look like any more of the hill is gonna slip while were here id say tis safe enough the others nodded lets get ourselves settled then while theres light the rain began again before dawn and they were glad enough to be on the move and getting chilled muscles stretched and warmed they lost the track once more this time spending a frustrating hour searching for it but that was the last of their hardships for noon saw them emerging from the hills and onto the plains on the other side tarma allowed herself a broad grin as the rest whooped and pounded each others backs send up that damned bird beaker we just earned ourselves one fat bonus from lord leamount returning was easier though it was plain that nothing but a goat a donkey a mountain pony or a shinainbred beast was ever going to make it up or down that trail without breaking a leg tarma reckoned it would take the full company about one day to traverse the trail that plus half a day to get to their end and half to get into striking distance of kelcrags forces meant two days traveling time in total not bad really theyd had a setup that had taken almost a week once knowing idra as she did tarma had a pretty good idea of what the captains suggested strategy was going to be and it would involve the hawks and no one else no bad thing that the hawks could count on their own to know what to do the rain had finally let up as they broke back out into the borders country they were dead tired and ready to drop but at least they werent wet anymore tarma saw an outrider a few furlongs beyond the camp he she or it was waving a scarf in the hawks colors of brown and golden yellow she waved back and the outrider vanished below the line of a hill they all relaxed at that they were watched for they need not guard their path and there would almost certainly be food and drink waiting for them in the camp that was exactly what theyd needed and hoped for they hadnt expected idra and sewen to be waiting for them at the entrance to the camp good work children things are heating up maps idra said curtly and jodi handed over the waterproof case with a halfsalute and a tired grin they were all achingly weary at this point horses and humans alike were wobbly at the knees only tarma and ironheart were in any kind of shape and tarma wasnt too certain how much of ironhearts apparent energy was bluff battlemares had a certain stubborn pride that sometimes made them as pigheaded about showing strain as certain kalenedral warrl said in her head shut up she thought back at him you should talk about being pigheaded good work damned fine work idra said lookng up from the maps and interrupting tarmas train of thought tarma if youre up to a little more captain tarma nodded and sketched a salute the rest of you theres hot wine and hot food waiting in my tent and a handful of hawks to give your mounts the good rubdown and treat they deserve tarma give ironheart to sewen and come with me warrl too if he wants the rest of you get under shelter well be seeing you all later with news i hope tarma had been too fatiguefogged to note where they were going except that they were working their way deeply into the heart of the encampments but after a while the size of the tents and the splendor of the banners outside of them began to penetrate her weariness what in the name on your best behavior mindmate warrl said for once his mindvoice sounded dead serious this is the camp of the lord commander before tarma had a chance to react idra was ushering her past a pair of massive sentries and into the interior of a tent big enough to hold a half dozen of the hawks little twoman bivouacs tarma blinked in the light and warmth and felt her muscles going to jelly in the pleasant heat magelights everywhere and a jestovath that made kethrys look like a simple shieldspell other than that though the tent was as plain as idras divided as hers was into a front and back half in the front half was a table some chairs and documentboxes a rack of wine bottles the curtain dividing it was half open on the other side tarma could see what looked like a chest some weapons and armor and a plain camp cot piled high with thick furs and equally thick blankets what i wouldnt give to climb into that right now she was thinking when her attention was pulled away by something more important leamount you old warhorse heres our miraclemaker idra was saying to a lean grizzled man in halfarmor standing by the maptable but in the shadows so that tarma hadnt really noticed him at first tarma had seen lord leamount once or twice at a distance she recognized him by his stance and his scarlet surcote with surshas rampant grasscat more than anything else although once he turned in her direction she saw the two signature braids he wore in front of each ear an affectation hed picked up among his hitlclans lord leamount may i present tarma shena talesedrin loteros shas tella kalenedral he replied much to tarmas surprise bowing making a fist and placing it over his heart as he bowed lie seth yatakar she replied returning his salute with intense curiosity and sharpened interest ge vede sakela shinain only a smattering i fear i learned it mostly in selfdefense he grinned and tarma found herself grinning back to keep from getting culls pushed off on me by your fellow clansmen ah wellcome to me and youll get the kind of horses the hawks mount ill do that idra has high praise for you the kyree and your sheenedra swordsworn he said meeting her intensely iceblue eyes as few others had been able i could only wish i had a few more of your kind with us so the bird returned that told us there was a path through but whats the track like somehow tarma wasnt overly surprised that he came directly to the point bad she said shortly as idra spread out jodis maps over the ones already on the table itll be brutal the only mounts that are going to be able to negotiate that terrain are the hawks maybe some of the ponies your mountainclan scouts have could make it but theyd be fair useless on the other side of those hills no running ability and on kelcrags side of the pass thats what theyll need anything else would break a leg on that track or break the path down past using terrain big hills baby mountains doesnt much matter shale most of the way through and sandstone bad footing huh he chewed a comer of his mustache and brooded over jodis tracings that lets out plan one then idra seems its going to be up to you hah up to me my rump if you cant get old shoveral to move his big fat arse in time youll get us slaughtered tarma glanced up out of the corner of her eye alarmed at those words only to see idra grinning hke warrl with a particularly juicy bone shoveral knows damned well hes my hidden card hell move when he needs to now swordsworn how long do you reckon it will take all the hawks to get from here his finger stabbed down at the location of their camp to here the second place he indicated was a spot about a candlemarks slow ride from the rear of kelcrags lines as tarma had figuredstriking distance about two days altogether huhn say you got to trails start at dawn by riding half the night think you could get that lot of yours up over that trail make trails end by dark camp cold for a bit of rest then be within this strike distance by say midmoming no problem damn well better have the rest though horsesll need it or we wont be able to count on em idra how do we keep the movement secret idra thought about that a while loan me those hillclan levies and their bivouac theyre honest enough to guard our camp well move out in groups of about twenty you move in an equal number of the clansmen camp stays full to the naked eye kelcrag cant tell one merc from another no more can his magickers the people that could tell the difference between them and us wont be able to see whats going on hah he smacked his fist down into his palm good let me send for shoveral well plan this out with just the three of usfour counting the kalenedral fewer that know fewer can leak the lord commander sent one of his pages out after lord shoveral then he and idra began planning in earnest from time to time he snapped out a question at tarma how far how many what about this or that she answered as best she could but she was tired far more weary than she had guessed she found her tongue feeling oddly clumsy and she had to think hard about each word before she could get it out finally leamount and idra began a lowvoiced colloquy she didnt bother to listen to she just hung on to the edge of the table and tried enforcing her alertness with kalenedral discipline exercises they didnt work overly well she was on her last wind for certain leamount caught tarmas wavering attention the maps on the table were beginning to go foggy to her eyes swordsworn he said looking a little concerned you look half dead but we may need you what say you go bed down over there in the comer he nodded in the direction of his own cot if theres a point you need to clarify for us well give you a shake he raised his voice jons one of the two sentries poked his head in through the tent flap sir stir up my squire would you have him find something for this starving warrior to eat and drink tarma had stumbled to the other side of the tent and was already collapsing onto the cot her weariness washing her under with a vengeance the blankets felt as welcoming and warm as they looked and she curled up in them without another thought feeling warrl heaving himself up to his usual position at her feet as the tent and the voices faded while the wave of exhaustion carried her into slumber she heard idra chuckling you might as well not bother jons the captain told leamount just before sleep shut tarmas ears i dont think she cares three kethry shifted her weight over her mounts shoulders halfstanding in her stirrups to ease hellsbanes balance as the mare scrambled up the treacherous shale of another slope they were slightly more than halfway across the hills it was cold and damp and the lowering gray clouds looked close enough to touch but at least it wasnt raining again she wasnt too cold under her wool cloak she wore her woolen sorceress robe the unornamented buff color showing her school was white winds and under thaty woolen breeches woolen leggings and the leather armor tarma had insisted she don the only time she was uncomfortable was when the wind cut in behind the hood of the robe she was a member of the last party to leave the camp and make the crossing theyd left their wounded to the care of leamounts hillclansmen and his own personal healer tresti the healerpriest had been in the second party to slip away from the camp riding by the side of her beloved sewen oreden and jiles the two hedgemages had gone two groups later the herbalist kethaire and his two young apprentices had left next kethry had stayed to the very last her superior abilities at sensing mageprobes making her the logical choice to deflect any attempts at spying until the full exchange of personnel was complete she felt a little at a loss without her partner riding at her left tarma had preceded her more than half a day ago leaving before midnight as the guide with idra and the first group of all the party that had made the first crossing only jodi had remained to ride with the tailguard group jodi was somewhere behind them checking on the backtrail that was not as comforting to kethry as it should have been kethry knew her fears were groundless that the frail appearance of the scout belied a tough interior but as if the thought had summoned her a gray shadow slipped up upon kethrys right with so little noise it might have been a shadow in truth hellsbane had been joined by a second gray mare so similar in appearance that only an expert could have told that one was a shinain fullblood battlesteed and the other was not that lack of sound was one clue there was mountainpony in lightfoots background somewhere jodis beast moved as silently as a wild goat on this shifting surface so quietly that the scout and her mount raised the hackles on anyone who didnt know them jodi wore her habitual garb of gray leather with her pale hair and pale eyes and ghostgray horse she looked unnervingly like an apparition of lady death herself or some mistspirit conjured out of the patches of fog that shrouded these hills as fragile and insubstantial as a thing of shadow and air and once again kethry had a twinge of misgiving any sign of probing the scout asked in a neutral voice kethry shook her head none i think we may have gotten away with it jodi sighed dont count your coins before theyre in the coffer theres a reason why we are running tail lady and its not just to do with magery though thats a good share of it the scout cast a doubtful look at kethry and for the first time kethry realized that the woman had serious qualms about her abilities to handle this mission if it came to something other than a simple trek on treacherous ground kethry didnt bother to hide an ironic grin jodi noted it and cocked her head to one side moving easily with her horse her saddle was hardly more than a light pad of leather it didnt even creak when she shifted unconsciously echoing the movements of her mare something funny lady very i think weve been thinking exactly the same thingsabout each other jodis answering slow grin proved that kethry hadnt been wrong ha and we should know better shouldnt we its a pity we didnt know each other well enough to trust without thinking and worryingespecially since neither of us look like fighters but we should have figured that idra knows what shes doing neither of us are hothouse plants or we wouldnt be hawks exactly so give me the reasons this particular lot is riding tail maybe i can do something about preventing a problem right enough one the scout freed her right hand from the reins to hold up a solemn finger is the trail shale shifts cracks were riding after all the rest and well be making the last few furlongs in early evening gloom this path has been getting some hard usage more than it usually gets if the trail is likely to give itll give under us youll notice were all of us the best riders and the ones with the best horses in the hawks kethry considered this as hellsbane topped the hill and picked her cautious way down the sloping trail hmmhmm all right can we halt at the next ridge theres a very tiny bit of magery i can work that might help us out with that jodi pursed her lips ts that wise kethry nodded slowly its a very lowlevel piece of earthwitchery something even a shepherd wisewoman might well know i dont think any of kelcrags mages is likely to take note of it assuming they can even see it and i doubt they will its witchery not sorcery and kelcrags magickers are all courtly mages greater and lesser my school is more eclectic we use whatever comes to hand and that can be damned useful somebody looking for high magick probably wont see low or think its worth investigating after all what does kelcrag need to fear from a peasant granny jodi considered that for a moment her head held slightly to one side tell me why is it that jiles and oreden have gotten so much better since youve been with us kethry chuckled but it was with a hint of sadness it had been very hard to convince the hedgewizards that their abilities did not match their dreams you want the truth their talents are all in line with low magick earthwitchery that sort of thing i convinced them that theres nothing wrong with that asked them which theyd rather ride a good steady trailhorse or your fireeater they arent stupid they saw right away what i was getting at she set hellsbane at the next slope her hooves dislodging bits of shale and sending them clattering down behind them so now that they arent trying to master spells they havent the talent to use properly theyre doing fine frankly i would rather have them with us than two of those courtly mages waterfinding is a lot more use than calling lightning and the firemaking spell does us more good than the ability to light up a ballroom you wont catch me arguing so whats this magic of yours going to do show me the weak spots in the trail if theres something ready to give ill know about it before it goes and i should be able to invoke a greater magic at that point and hold the pieces together long enough for us to get across wont that draw attention it would kethry replied slowly if i did what a court mage would do and draw on powers outside myself which causes ripples no i have just enough power of my own and thats what ill use there wont be any stir on the other planes but its going to cost me if i do things that way maybe high well ill handle that when the time conies you said one reason were riding tailmostthat implies theres more reasons two were tailguards in truth we could find ourselves fighting hand to hand with kelcrags scouts or his mages they havent detected us that we know of but theres no sense in assuming less than the worst so long as they dont outnumber us im not exactly as helpless in a fight as tresti she caught the cloud of uncertainty in jodis pale blue eyes and said surprised i thought everybody knew about this sword of mine theres stories but frankly lady keth i as tarma would tell you am no lady that brought a glimmer of smile keth then well none of us have ever seen that blade do anything but heal needs better at causing wounds than curing them at least in my hands kethry told her thats her gift to me in a fight she makes a mage the equal of any swordswoman born if it comes to magic though shes pretty well useless for my purposes its to a fighter she gives magic immunity but ill tell you what ive got a notion if it comes to battle by magery ill try and get her to you before i get involved in a duel arcane shell shield you from even a godlings magic tarma proved that once she may even be able to shield more than one if you all crowd together there was a hash of interest at that and a hint of relief then i think ill worry less about you welltheres a reason three that were riding tail if we find weve ridden straight into ambush at trails end were the lot thats got the best chance of getting one of us back to tell leamount gah grim reasons all of them can we stop here for a breath or two they had just topped a ridge with sufficient space between them and the next in line that a few moments spent halted wouldnt hamper his progress any jodi looked about her grimaced then nodded with reluctance a bit exposed to my mind but this wont take long kethry gathered the threads of earthmagic the subtlest and least detectable of all the mageenergies and whispered a command along those particular threads that traced their path across the hills there was an almost imperceptible shift in the energy flows then the spell settled into place and became invisible even to the one who had set it the difference was that kethry was now at one with the path she felt the path through the hills from end to end like a whisper of sand across the surface of her mental skin if the path was going to collapse the backlash would alert her lets go thats all there is to it jodi looked at her askance magery isnt all lightnings and thunders the best magery is as subtle as a tripwire and as hard to detect well jodi sent her mount picking a careful path down the hillside and looked back at kethry with an almostsmile i think i could get to appreciate magery kethry grinned outright remembering that jodis other specialty was subterfuge infiltration and assassination take my word for it the real difference between a masterclass mage and an apprentice is not in the amount of power its in the usage youve been over this trail already what do you thinkare we going to make trails end by dark jodi narrowed her eyes taking a moment no she said finally i dont think so thats when ill take point when it starts to get dark and thats when well have to be most alert kethry nodded absently and pulled her hood closer about her neck against a lick of wind if an attack comes its likely to be then and the same goes for accident aye it was growing dark far faster than kethry liked and there was still no end to the trail in sight but there had also been no sign that their movement was being followed suddenly her nerves twanged like an illtuned harpstring for one short disorienting moment she vibrated in backlash for that heartbeat or two of time completely helpless to think or act then nearly fifteen years of training and practice took over and without even being aware of it she gathered mageenergy from the core of her very being and formed a net of it a net to catch what was even now about to fall just in time up ahead in the darkness she heard the slide of rock a horses fearridden shriek and the harsh cry of a man seeing his own death looming in his face she felt the energynet sag strain then hold she clamped her knees around hellsbanes barrel and dropped her reins telling the horse mutely to stand the battlesteed obeyed bracing all four hooves far steadier than the rocks about her kethry firmed her concentration until it was adamantine and closed her eyes against distraction since she could not see what she was doing this would take every wisp of her attention gently this must be done as gently as tumbling a pemvyhird chick newhatched if she frightened the horse and it writhed out of her energynet horse and rider would plummet to their doom she cupped her hands before her echoing the form of the powernet and contemplated it broken lines of power showed her where the path had collapsed and the positioning of her net told her without her seeing the trail ahead just where her captives were cradled keth jodis voice came from the darkness ahead calm and steady no sign of panic there we lost a very short section of the path those of you behind us wont have any problem jumping the gap the immediate problem is the rider that went over its genold and vetch the horse is half over on his right side and gerrolds pinned under him but neither one of them is hurt and you caught both before they slid more than a few feet gerrolds got the beast barely calmed but hes not struggling can you do anything more for them other than just holding them kethry eased her concentration just enough to answer if i get them righted maybe raise them a bit can he get vetch back onto the path you can do that i can try hoof sounds going then returning kethry read the lines of energy cradling the man and beast slowly getting a picture of how they were lying by the shape of the energynet gerrolds got vetch gentled and behaving he says if you take it slow kethry did not answer needing all her focus on the task at hand slowly she moved her fingers as she did she lessened the pressure on one side of the net increased it on the other until the shape within began to tilt upright there was a lessening of tension within the net as horse and rider lost fear that helped now beneath the hooves of the trapped horse she firmed the net until it was as strong as the steadiest ground taking away some of the magethreads from the sides to do so when nothing untoward occurred she took more of those threads using them to raise the level of that surface slowly carefully so as not to startle the horse one by one she rewove those threads raising the platform thumblength by agonizing thumblength she was shaking and drenched with sweat by the time she got it high enough and just about at the end of her strength when a clatter of hooves on rock and an exultant shout told her that gerrold had gotten his mount back onto safe ground she had only enough energy left to cling to her saddle for the last few furlongs of the journey right now idra said quietly stretched out along a hill top next to tarma the old warhorse should be giving them a good imitation of a tired old warhorse the hilltop gave them a fairly tolerable view for furlongs in any direction they were just beyond the range of kelcrags sentries and kethry was shielding them in the way she had learned from the example of moonsong kvala the taleedras adept from the pelagiris forestmaking them seem a part of the landscapeto magesight just a thicket of brinlebushes in the far distance was the pass filling it was the dark blot of kelcrags forces at this moment as he had for the last two days leamount was giving a convincing imitation of a commander truly interested in coming to an agreement with his enemy heralds had been coming and going hour by hour with offers and counteroffersall of this false negotiation buying time for the hawks to get into place well its now or never idra said finally as she and tarma abandoned their height and squirmed down their side of the hill to join her company kethry kethry on foot like all the rest nodded and joined hands with her two magepartners shield your eyes she warned them itll go on a count of five tarma and the rest of the hawks averted their eyes and turned their horses heads away as kethry counted slowly when kethry reached five there was a flare of light so bright that it shone redly through tarmas eyelids even with her head turned it was followed by a second flash and then a third from a distance it would look like the lightning that flickered every day along the hillsides but leamounts mages were watching this particular spot for just that signal of three flickers of light and testing for energyauras to see if it was magelight and not natural lightning now leamount would break off his negotiations and resume his attacks on kelcrags army concentrating on the eastern edge that would seem reasonable kelcrag had stationed his foot there they might be vulnerable to a charge of heavy cavalry leamounts own western flank was commanded by lord shoveral whose standard was a badger and whose mode of battle matched his token he was implacable in defense but no one had yet seen him on the attack so kelcrag might well believe that he had no heart for it he was one hoped about to be surprised one also hoped fervently that kelcrags mages had not noticed that it was magelight and not lightning that had flickered to their rear theyve no reason to look for magelight mindmate warrl said soberly kelcrags wizards are all courtly types they very seldom think about hiding what theyre doing or trying to make it seem like something natural to them magelight is something to illuminate a room with not something to use for a signal if they wish to pass messages they make a sending i hope youre right furface tarma replied mounting the more surprised they are the more of us are going to survive this at idras signal the hawks moved into a disciplined canter no point in trying too hard to stay undercover now they urged their mounts over hills covered only with scraggy bushes and dead dry grass they would have been hard put to find any cover if theyd needed it but luck was with them they topped a final hilltop and only then encountered kelcrags few sentries they were all afoot the lead riders coldly picked them off with a few wellplaced arrows before they could sound an alert the sentries fell either pierced with arrows or stumbling over their wounded comrades and the fallen were trampled for the hawks horses were wartrained and a wartrained horse does not hesitate when given the signal to make certain of a fallen foe that left no chance that kelcrag could be warned ahead of the riders now stretching their canter into a gallop was the baggage train kethry and her two companions rode to the forefront for the moment each mage was haloed by one of kethrys glowing mageshields a shield that blurred the edges of vision around a mage and his mount as well it made tarmas eyes ache to look at them so she tried not to the shields wouldnt deflect missiles but not being able to look straight at your target made that target damned hard to hit the two hedgewizards growled guttural phrases made elaborate throwing motions and smoking flaming balls appeared in the air before their hands to fly at the wagons and supplies kethry simply locked her hands together and held them out in front of her and each wagon or tent she stared at burst into hot blue flame seemingly of its own accord this was noisy it was meant to be the noncombatants with the baggagedrovers cooks personal servants the odd whore were screaming in fear and fleeing in all directions adding to the noise there didnt seem to be anyone with enough authority back here to get so much as a fire brigade organized the hawks charged through the fires and the frightened milling civilians and headed straight for the rear of kelcrags lines now kethry and the mages had dropped back until they rode a bit more protected in the midst of the sunhawks they would be needed now only if one of kelcrags mages happened to be stationed on this flank for the rest it was time for bow work kelcrags men armored cavalry here for the most part nobles and retainers and mostly young were still trying to grasp the fact that theyd been hit from the rear the hawks swerved just out of bowshot riding their horses in a flanking move along the back of the lines they didnt stop that would make them stationary targets they just began swirling in and out at the very edge of the enemys range as tarma led the first sortie to engage about thirty of them peeled off from the main group galloping forward with what must look to kelcrags men like utter recklessness it wasnt they stayed barely within their range as they shot into the enemy lines this was what the hawks were famous for this horseback skirmishing most of them rode with reins in their teeth a few like tarma and jodi dropped their reins altogether relying entirely on their weight and knees to signal their mounts tarma loosed three arrows in the time it took most of the rest of her sortie group to launch one her short horsebow so much a part of her that she thought of nothing consciously but picking her targets she was aware only of ironhearts muscles laboring beneath her legs of the shifting smoke that stung eyes and carried a burnt flavor into the back of her throat of the sticky feel of sweat on her back of a kind of exultation in her skill and it was all over in heartbeats arrows away the entire group wheeled and galloped to the rear of the hawks already nocking more missiles for hard on their heels came a second group a third it made for a continuous rain of fire that was taking its toll even of heavily armored men and as they rode the hawks jeered at their enemies and shouted idras rallying call the hail of arrows that fell on the enemy wounded more horses than men a fact tarma was sorry about but the fire the hail of arrows and the catcalls inflamed their enemys tempers in a way that nothing else could have done and as leamount and idra had planned the young headstrong nobles let those tempers loose they broke ranks leaders included and charged their mocking foes all they thought of now was to engage the retreating hawks forgetful of their orders forgetful of everything but that this lot of commoners had pricked their vanity and was now getting away now the hawks scattered breaking into a hundred little groups their purpose accomplished tarma managed to get to kethrys side and the two of them plowed their way back through the burning wreckage of the baggage train ironshod hooves pounding their mounts raced as if theyd been harnessed side by side kethry clung grimly to the pommel of her saddle as her partner could see out of the corner of her eye she was not the horsewoman that the shinain was she well knew it and hellsbane was galloping erratically moving far too unpredictably for her to draw need at this point she was wellnigh helpless it would be up to tarma and the battlemares to protect her an overbrave pikeman rose up out of the smoke before them thinking to hook tarma from her seat she ducked beneath his pole arm and ironheart trampled him into the redstained mud another footman made a try for kethry but hellsbane snapped at him crushed his shoulder in her strong teeth shook him like a dog with a rag while he shrieked then dropped him again a rider who thought to intercept them had the trick tarma and ironheart had played on duke greyhames sentry performed on him and his steed only in deadly earnest ironheart reared screaming challenge and crowhopped forward the gelding the enemy rode backed in panic from the slashing hooves and as they passed him his riders head was kicked in before they could get out of range the battlesteeds kited through the smoke and flames of the burning camp with no more fear of either than of the scrubby shrubbery three times tarma turned in her saddle and let fly one of the lethal little arrows of the shinain as those pursuing found to their grief armor was of little use when an archer could find and target a helmet then shouting began behind them their pursuers pulled up looked back and began belatedly to return to their battleline too latefor lord shoveral had made his rare badgers charge and had taken full advantage of the hole that the work of the sunhawks had left in kelcrags lines kelcrags forces were trapped between shoveral and the shale cliffs with nowhere to retreat using her knees tarma signaled ironheart to slow and hellsbane followed her stablemates lead tarma couldnt make out much through the blowing smoke but what she could see told her all she needed to know kelcrags banner was down and there was a milling mass of men mostly wearing leamounts scarlet surcoats where it had once stood all over the field fighters in kelcrags blue were throwing down their weapons the civil war was over kethry touched the tip of her index finger to a spot directly between the sweating fighters eyebrows he promptly shuddered once his eyes rolled up into his head and he sagged into the waiting arms of his shieldbrother lay him out there thats right rethaire directed the disposition of the nowslumbering hawk his partner eased him down slowly stretching him out on his back on a horseblanket with his wounded arm practically in the herbalists lap rethaire nodded good keth kethry blinked coughed once and shook her head a little whos next she asked bluecoat kethry stared askance at him a bluecoat one of kelcrags people rethaire frowned no dont look at me that way hes under mercenarys truce hes all right or i wouldnt have let him in here hes one of devarils demons ah the demons had a good reputation among the companies even if most of devarils meetings with idra generally ended up as shouting matches too bad theyd been on opposite sides in this campaign rethaire finished dusting the long oozing slash in their companions arm with bluegreen powder and began carefully sewing it up with silk thread well are you going to sit there all day right im on it she replied getting herself to her feet whos with him my apprentice dee the short one kethry pushed sweatsoaked hair out of her eyesand tried once again to get it all confined in a tail while she glanced around the space outside the infirmary tent looking for the greenclad chubby figure of rethaires youngest apprentice she resolutely shut out the sounds of pain and the smell of sickness and blood she kept telling herself that this was not as bad as it could have been the worst casualties were under cover of the tent those out here were the ones that would be walking or limping back to their own quarters when they woke up from rethaires drugs or kethrys spell they were all just lucky that it was still only overcast and not raining sun would have baked them all into heatstroke rain best not think about fever and pneumonia with no prospect of further combat kethry was no longer hoarding her magical energies either personal or garnered from elsewhere but the only useful spell she had when it came to healing wounds like these was the one that induced instant slumber so that was her job put the patients out while rethaire or his assistants sewed and splinted them back together again poor jiles and oreden didnt even have that much to do although as low magick practitioners they did have healing abilities theyd long since exhausted their powers and now were acting as plain nonmagical attendants to tresti that was what was bad about a latefall campaign for them with most of the land going into winter slumber there was very little ambient energy for a user of low magick to pull on tarma was out with jodi and a few of leamounts farriers salvaging what horses they could and killing the ones too far gone to save and sometimes performing the same office for a human or two kethry shuddered and wiped the back of her hand across her damp forehead frowning when she looked at it and saw how filthy it was thank the gods that stuff of rethaires prevents infection or wed lose half the wounded weve lost too many as it is that last sortie had cost the sunhawks dearly they were down to two hundred fifty were dead three times that were wounded virtually everyone had lost a friend the uninjured were tending wounded companions but it could have been so much worse so very much worse she finally spotted apprentice dee and picked her way through the prone and sleeping bodies to get to his side great good gods why is he out here she exclaimed seeing the patient he was halfpropped on a saddle stretched out before him was his wounded leg kethry nearly gagged at the sight of the blooddrenched leg of his breeches the mangled muscles and the tourniquet practically at his groin looks worse than it is keth dee didnt even look up more torn up than anything didnt touch the big vein at all he dont need tresti just you and me his clever hands were busy cutting bits of the mans breeches away while the mercenary bit his lip until it too bled hoping to keep from crying out what in hell got you friend kethry asked kneeling down at the mans side she had to have his attention or the spell wouldnt work the man was white under his sunburn his black beard matted with dirt and sweat the pupils of his eyes wide with pain someshitbig wolf had m bow all trained on yer back mlady bastard come outa nowhere n took out mleg shoulda known bettern t sight on a hawk specially since i knew bout you havin that beast kethry started warrlwindborn no wonder you look like hacked meat let me tell you youre lucky he didnt go for your throat i hope youll forgive me but icant say fm sorry the man actually managed a bare hint of smile and patted her knee with a bloody hand thatsgahwar mlady no offense he clenched his other hand until the knuckles were white as dee picked pieces of fabric out of his wounds kethry sighed the three syllables that began the sleepspell and felt her hands begin to tingle with the gathering energy slow though she was coming to the end of her resources but why did you come to us for help dont trust them horseleeches they wanted to take the leg off i knew yer peopled save it them damn highborns they got no notion what is leg means to a merc kethry nodded grimacing without his leg this man would be out of a job and likely starve to death and th demons aint got no healers nor magickers never saw th need for em oh that was the root and branch of devarils constant arguments with idra well now you know why we have them dont you she still wasnt ready not quite yet the level wasnt high enough until she could touch him she had to keep his attention yeah well kinda reckon ol horseraces right now neat trick y pulled on us settin the camp afire wi the magickers an havin yer own healers beats hell outa hopin yer contract members hes supposed to keep ye patched up specially when es lost reckon well be lookin fer recruits after we get mustered out he grimaced again and nodded to her t yer innerested mlady well th offers open t not well pass th word eh kethry was a little amused at the certainty in his words youre so high up in the demons then that you can speak for them he bit off a curse of pain and grinned feebly just as she reached for his forehead should say im devaril kethry was wrung with weariness and her mageenergies were little more than flickers when tarma came looking for her she looked nearly transparent with exhaustion ready to float away on an errant wind the swordswornan knelt down in the dust beside where kethry was sitting she was obviously still trying to muster up energies all but depleted keth the mage looked up at her with a face streaked with dried blood thank the warrior none of it hers lady windborn i think i hate war hai tarma agreed grimly now that the battlehigh had worn off as always she was sick and sickened such a damned wasteall for the sake of one fool too proud to be ruled by a woman all that death men women good beasts innocent civilians hell of a way to make a living can you get loose if it isnt for magery im tapped out it isnt idra wants us in her tent tarma rose stiffly and gave her hand to her partner who frankly needed it to get to her feet the camp was quiet the quiet of utter exhaustion later would come the drinking bouts the boasts the counting of bonuses and loot now was just time to hurt and to heal to mourn the lost friends and help care for the injured and to sleep if one could with the coming of dusk fires were being kindled and torches and off in the distance pyres the hawks like most mercenary companies burned their dead tarma had already done her share of funeral duty she was not particularly unhappy to miss the next immolation two of the hawks not too flagged to stand watch were acting sentry of idras tent tarma nodded to both of them and pushed her way in past the flap kethry at her heels idra inclined her head in their direction and indicated a pile of blankets with a wave of her hand sewen already occupied her cot and geoffrey tamas and lethra his sergeants the equipment chest the stool and another pile of blankets respectively the fourth sergeant bevis was currently sleeping off one of kethrys spells wheres your kyree the captain asked as they lowered themselves down onto the pile sentrygo hes about the only one of us fit for it so he volunteered bless him i got him a young pig i figured hed earned it and i figured hed like to get the taste of man out of his mouth tarma grinned sounds like hes been hitching at you captain for a pig hed stand sentry all bloody night have him see the cook when hes hungry idra took the remaining stool lowering herself to it with a grimace of pain her horse had been shot out from under her and shed taken a fall that left her bruised from breast to ankle well she surveyed them all her most trusted assistants wearing a troubled look ive well ive had some unsettling news its nothing to do with the campaign she cut short the obvious question hurriedly no in fact geoffrey is sitting on our musteringout pay leamounts been damned generous above what he contracted for no this is personal im going to have to part company with you for a while tarma felt her jaw go slack the others stared at their captain with varying expressions of stunned amazement sewen was the first to recover idra whats the hell is that supposed tmean part company why idra sighed and rubbed her neck with one sunbrowned hand its duty of a sort you all know where im from well my father just died gods take his soul he and i never did agree on much but he had the grace to let me go my own way when it was obvious hed never keep me hobbled at home except by force mothers been dead oh twentyodd years that means ive got two brothers in line for the throne since i renounced any claim i had two kethry was looking a bit more alert now tarma noticed i thought the law in rethwellan was primogeniture sort of sort of thats where the problem is father favored my younger brother so do the priests and about half the nobles the merchants and the rest of the nobles favor following the law my older brother well he may have the law behind him but he was a wencher and a neerdowell when i left and i havent heard hes improved that sums up the problem the noble houses are split right down the middle and theres only one way to break the deadlock you geoffrey asked she grimaced aye its a duty i cant renounce and damned if i like it i thought id left politics behind the day i formed the sunhawks id have avoided it if i could but the ministers envoys went straight to leamount now theres no getting out of it and in all honesty theres a kind of duty to your people that goes with being born into a royal house i pretty much owe it to them to see that they get the best leader if i can so im going back to look the both of my brothers over and cast my vote ill be leaving within the hour but the panic on sewens face was almost funny sewen youre in charge she continued implacably i expect this wont take long ill meet you all in winter quarters as i said weve been paid we only need to wait until our wounded are mobile before you head back there any questions the weary resignation on her face told them all that she wasnt looking forward to this and that she wouldnt welcome protests what idra wanted from her commanders was the assurance that they would take care of things for her in her absence as they had always done in her presence with efficiency and dispatch it was the least they could give her they stood nearly as one and gave her drillfieldperfect salutes no questions captain sewen said for all of them well await you at hawksnest as ordered four kethry was in trouble a glittering ball of blinding white hurtled straight for her eyes kethry ducked behind the icecovered wall of the fortifications then launched a missile of her own at the enemy who was even now charging her fortress the leading warrior took her return volley squarely on the chest and went down with a bloodfreezing shriek of anguish tarma squealed the second of the enemy warriors skidding to a stop in the snow beside the fallen shmain no onward my brave ones tarma declaimed i am done for but you must regain our ancient homeland you must fight on and you must avenge me then she writhed into a sitting position clutched her snowspattered tunic pointed at the wall with an outflung arm and pitched backward into the drift shed used to break her fall the remaining fighters all four of them gathered their courage along with their snowballs and resumed their charge kethry and her two fellow defenders drove them ruthlessly back with a steady carefiilly coordinated barrage stand fast my friends kethry encouraged her forces as the enemy gathered just outside their range for another charge never shall we let the sacred palace ofofwhateveritis fall into the hands of these barbarians sacred my horses behind taunted tarma reclining at her ease in the snowbank head propped up on one arm you soft city types have mush for brains wouldnt know sacred if it walked up and bonked you with a blessing thats our sacred ground youre cluttering up with your filthy city my nomads are clear of eye and mind from all the healthy riding they do they know sacred when they see it youre dead kethry returned laughing you cant talk if youre dead oh i wouldnt bet on that tarma replied grinning widely well its not fair kethry began when one of tarmas nomads launched into a speech of her own it was very impassioned full of references to our fallen leader now with the stars and our duty to free our ancient homeland and it was just a little confused but it was a rather good speech for a twelve year old it certainly got her fellow fighters blood going this time there was no stopping them they stormed right over the walls of the snowfort and captured the flag despite the best efforts of kethry and her band of defenders kethry made a last stand on the heights next to the flag but to no avail she was hit with three snowballs at once and went down even more dramatically than tarma the barbarians howled for joy piled their other victims on top of kethry and did a victory dance around the bodies when tarma resurrected herself and came to join them kethry rose to her feet protesting at the top of her lungs no you dont dead is dead woman kethry had come up with one of her unthrown missiles in her hands now she launched it from pointblank range and got the surprised tarma right in the face with it the neverbroken rule decreed loose snowballs only tarma enforced that rule with a hand of iron and kethry would never even have thought of violating it this was a game and injuries had no part in it so tarma was unhurt but now wore a white mask covering her from forehead to chin only for a moment aaarrrg she howled scraping the snow off her face and springing at kethry fingers mimicking claws my disguise youve ruined my disguise run kethry cried in mock fear dodging its its the great and terrible snow demon tarma supplied making a grab at the children who screamed in excitement and fled i tricked you fools into fighting for me now i have all of you at my mercy and the city as well aaaaarrrg it was only when a more implacable enemy the childrens mothers came to fetch them away that the new game came to a halt thanks for minding them tarma said one of the mothers a former hawk herself she was collecting two little girls who looked and were the same age vamy and her shieldmate sania had met in the sunhawks and when an unlucky swordstroke had taken out varnys left eye theyd decided that since vamy was musteringout anyway because of the injury they might as well have the family they both wanted though how theyd managed to get pregnant almost simultaneously was a bit of a wonder somewhat to their disappointment neither child was interested in following the sword varnys wanted to be a scrivener and sanias a healer and the latter at least was already showing some evidence of that gift no problem tarma replied you know i enjoy it its nice to be around children who dont take warfare seriously in point of fact none of these children was being trained for fighting all had indicated to their parents that they wished more peaceful occupations so their playbattles were play and not more practice well we still appreciate having an afternoon to ourselves so i hope you dont ever get tired of them one of the other mothers replied with a broad smile not a chance tarma told her ill let you know next afternoon ive got free and ill kidnap them again bless you with that and similar expressions of gratitude the women and their weary offspring vanished into the streets of the snowcovered town whew tarma supported herself on the wall of the snowfort with both arms and looked over at kethry panting her eyes were shining and the grin she was still wearing reached and warmed them gods did we have that much energy at that age damned if i remember im just pleased i managed to keep up with them lady bless id never have believed you could get this overheated in midwinter you had it easy i was the one who had to keep leading the charges so thats why you let me take you out so easily kethry teased shame on you being in that poor a shape you know i rather liked that snow demon touch i was a little uneasy with jininans rhetoric cant teach a child too early that there are folks that will use him i just about had a foal when i found out there werent any grannystories up here on those lines we shinain must have at least a dozen about the youngling who takes things on face value and gets eaten for his stupidity come to think of it the snow demon is one of them he ate about half a clan before he was through nasty story kethry helped tarma beat some of the snow out of her clothing and the powdery stuff sparkled in the lateafternoon sunlight as it drifted down was there such a creature really and was that what it did there was and it did it showed up in an unusually cold winter one year oh about four generations ago a kalenedral finally took it out one of my teachers to tell the truth mutual kill very dramatic also he tells me damned painful ill croak you the song sometime tonight if you like kethry raised an eyebrow in surprise that meant tarma was in an extraordinarily good mood while time had brought a certain amount of healing to the ruined voice that had once been the pride of her clan tarmas singing was still not something she paraded in public her voice was still harsh and the tonalities were peculiar she sometimes sounded to kethry like someone who had been breathing smoke for fortyodd years she was very sensitive about it and didnt offer to sing very often what brought this on kethry asked as they crunched through the halftrampled snow heading back to their double room in the hawks barracks youre seeming more than usually pleased with yourself tarma grinned partly this afternoon kethry nodded understanding tarma adored children which often surprised the boots off their parents more she was very good with them and children universally loved her and her neverending patience with them she would play with them tell them stories listen to their woes if she hadnt been kalenedral shed have made an excellent mother as it was she was the willing child tender for any woman in hawksnest who had ties to the company when she had time which between drill and teaching duties wasnt nearly as often as she liked somewhere in the back of her mind kethry was rather looking forward to the nebulous day when she and tarma would retire to start their schools because then tarma would have younglings of her own by way of kethry more she would have the children that would form the core of her resurrected clan and bringing talesedrin back to life would make tarma happy enough that the smile she wore too seldom might become a permanent part of her expression so whats the other part kethry asked shaking herself out of her woolgathering when she nearly tripped on a clump of snow tarma snickered eyes narrowed against the snowglare and the westering sunlight her tone and her expression were both malicious leslacs cooling his heels in the jail as of last night oh really kethry was delighted what happened lets wait till we get inside its a long story since they were only a few steps from the entrance to their granitewalled barracks kethry was willing to wait as officers they could have taken more opulent quarters but frankly they didnt really want them tarma hardly had any need for privacy kethry had yet to find anyone in or out of the hawks that she wanted to dally with on any regular basis on the rare occasions where comradeship got physical she was more than willing to rent a room in an inn overnight so they shared the same kind of spartan quarters as the rest of the mercenaries a plain double room on the first floor of the barracks the walls were wood paneled over the stone of the building there were pegs for their weapons and stands for their armor a single wardrobe two beds one on each wall and three chairs and a small table that was about the extent of it the only concession to their rank was a woodfired stove tarma felt the winter cold too much otherwise they had a few luxuries besides thick fur coverlets and heavy wool blankets on the beds some fine silver goblets oil lamps and candles instead of rushdips but no few of the fighters had those paid for out of their earnings both of them felt that since they worked as closely as they did with their underlings there was no sense in having quarters that made subordinates uncomfortable and truth to tell neither of them would truly have felt at ease in more opulent surroundings they pulled off their snowcaked garments and changed quickly hanging the old on pegs by the stove to dry kethry noted as she pulled on a soft comfortable brown robe and breeches that tarma had donned black and frowned it was true that kalenedral only wore dark muted colors but black was for ritual combat or bloodfeud tarma didnt miss the frown faint as it was dont get your hackles up its all ive got left everything else is at the launderers or wet im not planning on calling anybody out not even that damned offkey songster much as he deserves it and much as id like to warrl raised his head from the shadows of the corner hed chosen for his own with a contemptuous snort the kyree liked the cold even less man tarma and spent much of his time in the warm corner by the stove curled up on a pad of old rugs you two have no taste i happen to think leslac is a fine musician and a very talented one tarma answered with a snort of her own all right then you go warm his bed im sure hed appreciate it warrl simply lowered his head back to his paws and closed his glowing golden eyes with dignity tell tell tell kethry urged having as little love for the feckless leslac as did her partner she threw herself down into her own leatherpadded hearthside chair and leaned forward in her eagerness to hear all right heres what i was told tarma lounged back in her chair and put her feet up on the black iron footrest near the stove to warm them evidently his bardship was singing that song in the falcon last night that song was the cause for tarmas latest grievance with the bard it seemed that leslac apparently out of willfulness or true ignorance had not the least notion of what being kalenedral meant he had decided that tarmas celibacy was the result of her own will not of the hand of her goddess the fact was that as kalenedral tarma was celibate because she had become effectively neuter kalenedral had no sexual desire and little sexual identity there was a perfectly logical reason for this kalenedral served first the goddess of the south wind the warrior who was as sexless as the blade she bore and they served next the clans as a whole and lastly they served their individual clans being sexless allowed them to keep a certain cool perspective that kept them free of feuding and allowed them to act as interclan arbitrators and mediators every shinain knew the cost of becoming kalenedral some in every generation felt the price was worth it tarma certainly had since she had the deaths of her entire clan to avenge and only kalenedral were permitted to swear to bloodfeud and kethry was mortally certain that having been gangraped by the brigands that slaughtered her clan had played no little part in the decision leslac didnt believe this he was certain without bothering to check into tarmas background or the customs of the shinain so far as kethry had been able to ascertain that tarmas vows were as simple as those of most other celibate orders and as easily broken he was convinced that she had taken those vows for some girlishly romantic reason he had just recently written a song in fact that hinted very broadlythat the right man could thaw the icy shinain that was the gist of that song and he evidently thought he was the right man hed certainly plagued them enough before theyd joined up with idra following behind them like a puppy that couldnt be discouraged hed lost track of them for two years after theyd joined the sunhawks and that had been a profound relief but much to their disappointment hed found them again and tracked them to hawksnest there he had remained singing in taverns to earn his keep and occasionally rendering tarmas nights sleepless by singing under her window that song was new the first time tarma had heard it was when theyd gotten back from the surshan campaign kethry had needed to practically tie her down to keep her from killing the musician thats not a wise place to sing that particular ballad kethry observed seeing as thats where your scouts tend to spend their pay hai but it wasnt my scouts that got him tarma chuckled which is why im surprised you hadnt heard it was tresti and sewen what it was lovely or so im told tresti and sewen sailed in just as he began the damned thing nobodys said but it wouldnt amaze me much to find out that sewen set the whole thing up though according to my spies trestis surprise looked real enough she knows what kalenedral means hellfire were technically equals if i wanted to claim the priestly aspects that go with the goddessbond she also knows how you and i feel about the little warbling bastard so she decided to have a very public and very priestly fit about blasphemy and sacrilegious mockery that was one of the few laws within hawksnest that every comrades gods deserved respect and to blaspheme anyones gods particularly those of a sunhawk of notable standing was an official offense punishable by the town judge she didnt she ruddy well did that was all sewen and my children had been waiting for they called civil arrest on him and bundled him off to jail and there he languishes for the next thirty days kethry applauded beaming thats thirty whole days we wont have to put up with his singing under our window and thirty whole days i can stroll into town for a drink without hiding my face tarma looked very pleased with herself warrl heaved a gigantic sigh look furface if you like him so much why dont you go keep him company tasteless barbarians tarmas retort died unuttered for at that moment there was a knock at their door come kethry called and the door opened to show one of the principals of tarmas story sewen are you two busy not particularly tarma replied as kethry rose from her chair to usher him in i was just telling keth about your part in gagging our songbird can i have an hour or two sewen was completely expressionless which to those that knew him meant that something was worrying him and badly sewen you can have all of our time you need kethry said immediately closing the door behind him whats the problem not tresti i hope no no ii have to talk to somebody and i figured it had better be you two i havent heard anything from idra in over a month bloody hell tarma sat bolt upright looking no little alarmed herself pull up the spare chair man and give us the details she got up and began lighting the oil lamps standing about the room then returned to her seat kethry broke out a bottle of wine and poured three generous goblets full before resuming her perch she left the bottle on the table within easy reach for she judged that this talk had a possibility of going on for a while sewen pulled the spare chair over to the stove and collapsed into it sitting slumped over with his elbows on his knees and his hands loosely clasped around the goblet its been a lot more than a month really more like two i was getting a message about every two weeks before then most of em hitching about one thing or another well that was fine that sounded like idra but then they started getting shorter and you know how the captain sounds when shes got her teeth on a secret hai tarma nodded like every word had to wiggle around that secret to get out eyah thats it hints was all i got that things were more complicated than she thought then a message saying shed made a vote and would be coming home then right after another saying she wouldnt that shed learned something important and had to do something then nothing sheka tarma spat kethry seconded the curse this sounded very bad its been nothing like i said for about two months damnit idra knows id be worried after a message like chat and no matter what had happened shed find some way to let me know she was all right if she could kethry said so im figuring she cant that shes either into something real deep too deep to break cover for a message or shes being prevented kethry felt a tug on her soulself from across the room need was hung on her pegs over there she let her inner self reach out to the blade sure enough she was calling as she did when there were women in danger it was very faint but then idra was very far away i dont dare let the rest of the hawks know sewen was saying tarma coughed you sure as hell dont weve got enough hotheads among us that youd likely getabout a hundred charging over there cutting right across rethwellan and stirring up the gods only know what trouble then luck would probably have it that theyd break right in on whatever the captains up to and blow it all to hell sewen she is in some sort of trouble need stirred up the moment you mentioned this i dont think its coincidence kethry shook her head a little in resignation if need calls its got to be more than just a little difficulty needs muted down since she nearly got us both killed i hardly even feel her on a battlefield with women fighting and dying all around i dont talk about her much but i think shes been changing i think shes managed to become a little more capable of distinguishing real troubles that only tarma and i can take care of so i think idra requires help i agree with you all right what do you want us to do track her down and see whats wrong just remember though if we go she forced a smile tresti loses her babytender and you lose your masterclass mage sewen just looked relieved to the point of tears look i hate to roust you two out like this and i know how tarma feels about traveling in cold weather but youre the only two id feel safe about sending most of the kids are what you said hotheads the rest cept for jodi theyre mostly like me commonborn keth youre highborn you can deal with highborns get stuff out of em i couldnt and tarma can give you two a reason for hauling up there which is what you know your people hauled in the fall lot of horses just before we got back from the last campaign well since we werent here ersala went ahead and bought the whole string figuring she couldnt know how many mounts wed lost and figuring it would be no big job to resell the ones we didnt want weve still got a nice string of about thirty nobodys bespoken and i was going to go ahead and keep them here till spring then sell em rethwellan dont see shinainbreds much those they do are crossbred to culls i doubt theyve seen purebloods much less good purebloods we play merchant princes hmm kethry asked seeing the outlines of his plan it could work with rare beasts like that wed be welcome in the palace itself thats it once you get in keth you can puff up your lineage and move around in the court or something you talk highborn and youre sneaky you could learn a lot while i see what the kitchen and stable talk is tarma interrupted him hai good plan specially if i make out like i dont know much of the lingo i could pick up a lot that way you arent just doing this to ease your conscience are you kethry asked knowing there would be others who would ask the same question sewen had been idras second for years now playing second to a woman had let him in for a certain amount of twitting from his peers in other companies notwithstanding the fact that one quarter to one third of all mercenary fighters were female female company captains were few and of all of them only idra led a mixedsex company and idra had been showing no signs of retiring nor had sewen made any moves indicating that he was contemplating starting his own company i wont deny that i want the hawks he said slowly but not like this i want the company fair and square either cause idra goes down or cause she hands em over to me this its too damn iffy thats what it is its eating at me and whats worse its eating at me that idra might be in something deep and you have to do something to get her out of it if you can thats it keth and its for a lot of reasons shes my friend shes my captain shes the one who took me out of the ranks and taught me i cant just sit here for a year and then announce shes gone missing and im taking over i owe her too damned much even if she keeps tellin me i dont owe her a thing how can i act like nothins wrong an not try t help her sewen if every merc had your ethics tarma began he interrupted her with a nonlaugh if every merc had my ethics thered be a lot more work for freefighters face it swordsworn i can afford to have ethics just because of what idra built the sunhawks into so im not going to let those ethics or her down this is an almighty cold trail youre sending us on kethry muttered by the rime we get to petras itll be past midsummer what are you and the hawks going to do in the meantime were on twoyear retainer from sursha we do spring and summer patrol under old leamount around the borders to keep any of her neighbors from getting bright ideas easy work idra set it up before she left i can handle it without making myself captain all right ive got some ideas our people can keep their lips laced over a secret so you wait one week after weve left then you tell them all whats happened and that weve been sent out under the ivy bush why sewen asked bluntly mostly so rumors dont start then you and ersala concoct some story about idra coming back but fevered tresti can tell you what kind of fever would need a twoyear rest cure that gives you a strawidra to leave behind while you take the hawks out to patrol the hawks will know the real story and tell them it might cost the captain her life if they let it slip you think it might he said soberly i dont know what to think so i have to cover every possibility huh he thought about that for a long time contemplating his wine finally he swallowed the last of it in a single gulp all right ill go with it now should i replace you two i think youd better tarma said i suggest promoting either garth or jodi garth is my preference i dont think jodi would be comfortable in a command position shes avoided being in command too many times ill do a sending there are white winds sorcerers everywhere you should be getting one or more up here within a couple of months kethry bit her lip a bit trying to do a rough calculation on how far her sending would reach i cant promise that youll get anything higher than a joumeymanclass but you never know i wont tell them more than that theres a position open with you you can let whoever you hire in on the whole thing after you take them on remember white winds school has no edicts against using magic for fighting and ill make it plain in the sending that this is a position with a merc company that it means killing as well as healing that should keep the squeamish away have tresti look them over first then oreden and jiles tresti will be able to sense whether theyll fit in i know she checked you two out while idra was waiting to interview you kethry nodded wryly figures i cant imagine idra leaving anything to chance all right does that pretty much take care of things i think so well as cold as the trail is going to be there is no sense in stirring up a lot of rumors by having us light out of here with our tails on fire tarma said bluntly we might just as well take our time about this say our goodbyes get equipment put together act like this was going to be an ordinary sort of errand were running for you until weve been gone for about a week you just make out like im running the string out to sell and keths coming with me for company sewen nodded that sounds good to me ill raid the coffers for you two youll be needing stuff to make you look good in the court i expect he rose and started for the doorthen turned back and awkwardly held out his arms ii dont know what id have done without you two he said stiffly his eyes bright with what kethry suspected might be incipient tears youre more than shieldbrothers youre friends i thanks they both embraced him trying to give him a little comfort kethry knew that idra had been in that more than shieldbrother category too and that sewen must be thinking what she was thinking that the captains odds werent very good right now tesorthene dadera big man tarma murmured when we come across someone special like you like tresti like idra well you help your friends thats all i can say thats what friends are there for heryr if anybody can help her out itll be you two well do our best and you know you can do us a favor kethry almost smiled at the sudden inspiration what anything you want leslac i want you to teach him a lesson i dont care what you do to him just get him off tarmas back the weatherbeaten countenance went quiet with thought thats a pretty tall ord wait a moment he began to smile the first smile hed worn since he walked in their door i think ive got it course it all hinges on whether hes really as pigignorant about shinain as he seems to be go on i think after that damned song we can count on that being true sewens arms tightened about both their shoulders as he looked down at them theres this sect of spiderpriestesses down south they sort of dress like tarma deal is they didnt start out life as girls tarma nearly choked with laughter you mean convince the little bastard that im really a eunuched boy sewen thats priceless i rather like that kethry grinned i rather like that ill get on it he promised giving them a last hug and closing the door to their room behind him tarma went immediately to her armorstand surveying the brigandine for any sign of weakness or strain kethry put another log in the stove then approached the wall where need hung reaching out to touch the blade with one finger yes the calls still there and i cant tell anything its so faint but it is idra the call gets perceptibly stronger when i think about her get anything tarma asked quietly nothing definite other than that idras in trouble how long do you think it will take us to get to petras with a string of thirty horses about a month to cross the passes then another two maybe three like you said itll be midsummer at the earliest kethry sighed if i were an adept i could get us both there in an hour but not the horses and how would we explain ourselves wed make a lot more stir than we should if we did that and stir is not what we want right tarma stood with a sigh and stretched then came back to her chair and flung herself down into it i seem to recall one contact we might well want to make the captain didnt talk about her past much but she did mention somebody a time or two the court archivist her brows knitted in thought javreck jervase no jadrek thats it jadrek seems like his father used to keep idra and her older brother in tales paid attention to them when nobody else had time for them jadrek was evidently a little copy of him shed mention him when something happened to bring one of those tales to her mind and more important tarma pointed a long finger at kethry she also never failed to preface those recollections by calling him the only completely honest man in the court just as his father was that sounds promising if hes still there seems to me she said something about him being at odds with her father and her younger brother when he took over the archivist position he did that pretty young since he was younger than idra or her brother and she left the court before she was twenty she also said something about his being crippled which could cut down on the amount he sees yes and no kethry replied more than grateful for tarmas remarkable memory people who are overlooked often see more that way need i tell you that im glad you have a mind like a trap what shut tarma jibed now you know ive got a singers memory if id forgotten one verse of any of the most obscure ballads id have been laughed out of camp keth youre worrying yourself i can tell youre wasting energy i know i know take it one week at a time worry about getting us through the passes safely ill get you the avalanche map tomorrow see what you can scry out with it and speaking of snow do you still want to hear that business about the snow demon well yes she replied surprised but i hardly thought youd be in the mood for it now im just taking some of my own prescribed medicine tarma grinned crookedly and went to fetch the battered little handdrum she used on those rare occasions when she chanted you couldnt call it singing anymore one of the shinain historysongs trying to remember all fiftytwo verses will keep me from fretting into a sweat and hoping she looked down at her black sleeve the black of vengeancetaking that this outfit doesnt turn out to be an omen five jaivetha kele kele kele tarma wheeled ironheart about on the mares heels in a piece of horsemanship that drew a spattering of impromptu applause from those watching and chivied the last of the tired horses into the corral assigned to them by the master of the petras stock market she controlled them with voice only not hand nor whip she didnt even call for any encouraging nips at their heels from warrl another fact which impressed the spectators no end they were already impressed by the horses they were not the kind of beasts that the inhabitants of petras were used to seeing these were shinain purebreds and the only reason any of them had been passed over by the sunhawks was that they were mostly saddlebreds not trailbreds the shinain horses bred for trail work were a little rougher looking and a bit hardier than the saddlebreds in the main there were always exceptions like tarmas beloved kessira but the shinain kept the exceptions for their own use and further breeding as kessira was being bred pampered queen mare of the talesedrin herds no these horses were not what the inhabitants of petras were used to seeing in their beastmarket their heads broad in the forehead small in the muzzle and with large doesoft eyes were carried high and proudly on their long elegant necks pride showed in every line of them despite their weariness their bodies were compact and muscular the hindquarters being a trifle higher than these people were accustomed to their legs were wellmuscled and slim they were no longer shaggy with winter growth as they had been when the trek started now their coats were silky despite the dust and their manes and tails the pride of a shinain mount were flowing in the wind like manycolored waterfalls and they moved like dancers like birds on the wind like music made visible in short they were beautiful good enough to suit a king eh sheenedra tarma asked in her own tongue feeling rather proud of her charges i should think kethry began when one of the onlookers a man possessed of more than a little wealth by the cut of his gray and green clothing interrupted her what are these beauties he asked in tones that bordered on veneration where on earth did they spring from valdemar id heard companions were magnificent but id never heard of anyone other than heralds owning them and id never heard that companions were anything but white no mlord kethry replied as tarma privately wondered what on earth a companion could be these are shinain purebred saddlemares and geldings from the dhorisha plains shinain the man stepped back a pace lord and lady how did you ever get shinain to part with them id have thought theyd have shown you their swordedge rather than their horses easily enough im bloodsister to the handler there i thought to bring a string up here and try our luck shesshinain the man gulped and eased another footstep or two away putting kethry between himself and tarma tarma wasnt certain whether to laugh or continue to look as if she didnt understand the man acted like she was some kind of demon oh yes kethry answered and kalenedral she must have noted his look of blank nonrecognition because she added swordsworn he turned completely white i hope excuse me lady but i trust shes under control warriors oath sheenedra what in hell have they heard about us tarma kept to her own tongue as per the plan and was keeping her face utterly still and impassive but she knew kethry could hear the suppressed laughter in her voice probably that you eat raw meat for breakfast and raw babies for dinner kethry replied and tarma could see the struggle to keep her expression guileless in the laughter sparkling in her eyes pardon but whats she saying the man eyed tarma as if he expected her to unsheathe her blade and behead him at any moment that she noticed how much you admire the horses and thanks you for the compliment of your attention tarma took care to nod graciously at him and he relaxed visibly she then turned her attention back to the horses the corral seemed sizable enough to hold them comfortably shed been a little worried about that lets see pump or well for the watering trough and where would it beah she spotted a pump after a bit of looking good one good thing about socalled civilization pumps think maybe i might see if the clans would agree to having a couple installed on the artesian wells stand she told ironheart the battlemare obediently locked her legs in position it would take an earthquake to move her now tarma unslung the sword from her back and looped the baldric over the pommel of the saddle guard she ordered that blade was a sweet one and had been dearly paid for in her own blood she didnt intend to lose it ironheart would see that she didnt youd better tell your friend to stay clear of heart or hell lose a hand she called to kethry then dismounted and vaulted over the fence into the stockade to water her other charges that bit of bravado cost too but it was worth a bit of strain to put on a proper show tarma meant to leave these folks with their mouths gaping for that meant that the highborns would hear of them that much sooner youre going to hurt in the morning warrl observed thus far the crowds attention had been so taken up with the horses that they hadnt paid much heed to him hed stayed in the shadow of ironheart who was so tall that he didnt stand out as the monster he truly was and she couldnt tell but he might well be exercising a bit of his own magic to look more like an ordinary herd dog hed hinted that he could do just that on the way here which was no bad idea tarma felt the strain of the muscles shed used and privately agreed with his critical remark about hurting for every scar she bore on her hide there was twice the scar tissue under it where it didnt show but it certainly made itself felt particularly when she started showing off but they were drawing a bigger crowd by the moment the onlookers murmured as the loose horses crowded around her shoving their heads under her hands for a scratch or lipping playfully at her hair she laughed at them pushed them out of the way and got to the pump as she began to fill the trough they pushed in to get at the water and she rebuked them with a single sharp nest they shied and danced a bit then behaved themselves tarma had been doing some serious training with them on the trail knowing that once they were in rethwellan she would have to be able to command them by voice for if they spooked she kethry and warrl would not be enough to keep them under control her ability to keep them in une seemed to impress their audience no end she decided to go all out to impress them she picked out one of the herd mares shed been working with far more than the others and called her the chestnut mare pricked her ears and came to the summons eagerly she knew what this meant first a trick from her and then a treat was in store tarma ordered the others out of her way then raised her hand high over her head the mare stepped out away from her about fifteen paces then as tarma began to turn followed her turn as if she was being lunged except there was no lungingrein on her at a command from tarma she picked up to a trot then a canter after traveling all day tarma was not going to ask her to gallop at a third command she stopped dead in her tracks at the fourth she reared the fifth command was come and meant a piece of dried apple and a good scratch behind the ears she obeyed that one with eager promptitude the spectators now thick on the fence applauded the horses flickered their ears nervously but when nothing came of the noise went back to watching tarma hoping for treats themselves tarma was pleased more than pleased everything was going according to the plan theyd mapped out patience children she told the rest dinner should be here soon their ears flickered forward nearly as one at that welcome word and they continued to watch her with expectation in their soft sweet eyes and within moments the beastmarket attendants did appear with the hay and sweetfeed tarma had tofd kethry to order and more than that she saw carrots poking out of more than one pocket hmm this was gratifying if it was evidence of the fact that the attendants were taken with the looks of the string but it could also be an attempt on the part of some other horsebreeder to poison her stock im checking mindmate the voice in her head told her keth tell the younglings over there to hold absolutely still i think they just want to treat the children but warrls going to check for drugging just in case kethry called out the warning and the attendants froze the whole crowd froze when they saw warrls great gray body moving toward them now they could see just how huge he was his shoulder came nearly to tarmas waist and how much like a wolf he looked tarma took advantage of the situation to vault the fence again and begin relieving the attendants of their burdens warrl sniffed the feed over then checked the youngsters themselves and the treats theyd brought theyre fine mindmate warrl told her cheerfully and about ready to soil themselves if i sneeze tarma laughed and patted the one next to her on the head as she took his bale of hay away from him theyre all right keth urn tell them to wait until ive finished then they can give the children their treats so long as they stay out of the corral i dont want anybody in there they get spooked and itll take half a day to calm them down again and tell them we wont need any nightwatchers that warrl will be guarding them when im not here that should prevent anybody even thinking about drugging them warrl sprang over the fence with a single graceful leap the horses of course were so used to his presence that they totally ignored him being far more interested in their dinner with a fence between themselves and warrl the attendants calmed down a bit tarma completed her task and with an inward wince vaulted the fence a third time to return to where ironheart still stood statuefirm rest she said and the battlemare unlocked her legs and reached around to nuzzle at her riders arm the others were getting fed she wanted her dinner hungry jelewdra tarma murmured letting her have the handful of sweetfeed shed brought with her patience well be at the inn soon enough she cast a glance over at kethrys companion his eyes were taking up half of his head warrl would you mind staying if you send me a nice haunch of pig as soon as you get there and a halfdozen marrowbones already cracked you deserve it she swung up into her saddle and turned to kethry who was smiling broadly enough to split her face in two so much for the barbarian dog and pony show sheenedra she said stifling a chuckle tell these nice people they can go home and lets find our inn shall we so how barbarian do you want me to look tarma asked her partner as they strolled down the creaking wooden stairs of the inn to the dimly lit common room and what kind the aloof desert princeling the snarling beastthing what better stick with the aloof desert princeling we dont want these people afraid to have you near the court kethry chuckled tarma was plainly enjoying herself willing to act any part to the hilt brood that always looks impressive and youve certainly got the face for it oh have i now they were continuing to speak in shinain between themselves it was better than a code the likelihood of anyone knowing tarmas tongue here in a country where tales of shinain were obviously so outlandish that they feared the swordsworn was nil the common room went absolutely silent as they entered tarma stepped in first looking around sharply as if she expected enemies to emerge from beneath the tables finally she gave a quick nod as if to herself stepped aside and motioned kethry to precede her she kept a casual hand on the hilt of the larger of her daggers the entire time shed wanted to wear her sword but kethry had argued against the idea now she was glad shed won if tarma had worn anything larger than a dagger she might well have caused a panicked exodus as it was the impression she left was a complicated one that she was very dangerous and suspicious of everyone and everything that she and kethry were equal but that she also considered herself in charge of kethrys safety it was a masterful performance carefully planned and choreographed to avoid a problem before it could come up the people of the primary religious sect of rethwellan took a dim view of samesex lovers and the partners were doing their best to make that notion which was inevitably going to occur to someone seem a total absurdity this touchmenot bodyguarding act tarma was putting on was hopefully going to do just that among other things they took a table with seats for two in a far corner tarma motioned for kethry to take the seat actually in the corner then took the outer seat so that she would stand or rather sit between kethry and the rest of the world kethry signaled the waiter while her partner turned her own chair so that the back was up against the wall and finally sat down tarma continued to watch the room from that vantage broodingly while kethry placed orders for both of them conversation started back up again once they were seated but kethry noted that it was a trifle uneasy and most of the diners kept one eye on tarma at all times they think youre going to start a holy war any second sheenedra kethry said finally good her partner replied folding her arms leaning back against the wall beside their table and continuing to watch the room with icy hooded eyes i hope this act of mine gets us prompt service im about to eat the candle now now i thought you were being princely i am but im a hungry prince at just that moment a serving wench shaking in her shoes brought their orders tarma looked at the cutlery sniffed disdainfully and drew the smaller of her daggers cutting neat bits with it and eating them off the point after a look of her own at the state of the implements theyd been given kethry rather wished the part she was playing allowed her to do the same they were nearly finished when the innkeeper himself sidling carefully around tarma came to stand obsequiously at kethrys elbow she allowed him to wait a moment before deigning to notice his presence this was in keeping with the rest of the parts they were playing for although they had arrived in dusty wellwom traveling leathers tarmas being alltooplainly armor kethrys bearing no hint of her magestatus they were now dressed in silks kethry wore a kneelength robe of an exotic cut and a deep green and breeches of a deeper green tarma wore shinainstyle wrapped jacket shirt and breeches in black with them she wore a black sweatband of matching silk confining her shortcropped hair and a wrapped sash holding her two daggers of differing sizes a black silk baldric for the sword that she had left in the room above and black quilted silk boots her choice of outfitting had stirred uneasy feelings in kethry but tarma had pointed out with irrefutable logic that if the captain was to hear of two strangers in petras and have that outfit described to her she would know who those strangers were and she would know by the sable hue that tarma was expecting her captain to be in trouble possibly in need of avenging their clothing was clearly the most costly and certainly the most outre in the room and this was dubious eating utensils notwithstanding not an inexpensive inn they wanted their presence to be known and commented on they wanted word to spread ideally it would spread to idra wherever she was if not to the ear of the king my lady the innkeeper said in tones both frightened and fawning tones that made kethry long for their old friend hadell of the broken sword or plain genial oskar of the bottomless barrel my lady there is a gentleman who wishes to speak with you so she raised an elegant eyebrow on what subject he did not confide in me my lady but he wears the livery of the king does he then well ill hear him out if you have somewhere a bit more private than this of a certainty if my lady would follow he bowed and groveled and at length brought them to a small but comfortably appointed chamber equipped with one table four chairs and a door chat shut quite firmly he bowed himself out wine appeared in cleaner vessels than they had been favored with before this and finally the visitor himself kethry chose to receive him seated tarma stood leaning against the wall with her arms folded in the shadows at her right hand their visitor gave the shinain a fairly nervous glance before accosting kethry my lady he said bowing over her hand kethry was having a hard time keeping from laughing herself sick the right corner of tarmas mouth kept twitching sure sign that she was holding herself in only by the exertion of a formidable amount of willpower this liveried fop was precisely the degree of lackey they had hoped to lure in personal servant to the king and probably a minor noble himself he was languishing and vapid and quite thoroughly full of himself his absurd court dress of pale yellow and green with the scarlet and gold badge of the kings household on the right shoulder was exceedingly expensive as well as in appallingly bad taste there was more than a little trace of a more careful toilette than kethry ever bothered with in his appearance his carefully pointed mousebrown mustaches alone must have taken him an hour to tease into shape my lord wishes to know the identity of two such fascinating strangers to our realm he said when hed completed his oozing over kethrys hand and what brings them here i shall answer the second question first my lord kethry replied with just a hint of cool hauteur what brings us is trade purely and simply but not just any trade i do assure you no what we have are the mounts of princes princes of the shinain and we intend them to grace the stables of the princes of other realms the horses we have brought are princes and princesses themselves as i am certain you are aware word had reached my noble lord that your beasts were extraordinary they are creatures whose like no one here has ever seen it is only through my friendship with the noble tarma shena talesedrin the talesedrin of talesedrin that i was able to obtain them his glance lit again upon tarma who was still standing in the shadows behind kethry she moved forward into the light inclined her head graciously at the sound of her name and said in shinain i also happen to be the only talesedrin other than you but we wont go into that will we my companion tells me she is pleased to make the acquaintance of so goodly a gentleman kethry said smoothly as tarma allowed the shadows to obscure her again as for myself i am kethryveris scion of house pheregul of moumedealth a house of ancient and honorable lineage from the blankness of his gaze kethry knew hed never even heard of moumedealth much less her house which so far as she was concerned was all to the good a house of renown indeed he said covering his ignorance then let me now tender my lords words i come from king raschar himself he paused to allow kethry to voice the expected murmurs of amazement and gratification he heard of your wondrous beasts and wishes to have his master of horse view them himself more than view them if what rumor says of them is even half the truth and since you prove to be more than merely common merchants he would like to tender you an invitation to extend your visit to petras in his court that he may learn of you and you of him and you may end up in the bastards bed if he likes your looks murmured tarma from the darkness tell your lord that we are gratified and that we shall await his master of horse with eagerness and will be more than pleased to take advantage of the hospitality of his court more smooth nonsense was exchanged and finally the man bowed himself out they waited holding their breaths until they were certain he was out of earshot then collapsed into each others arms helpless with stifled laughter goddess talesedrin of talesedrin indeedthat great booby didnt even know it was a clan name and not a title tarma choked isda wtrekotk you know what my people say dont you proud is the clanchief prideful is the clanchief of a twomember clan laid it on good and thick didnt i kethry replied wiping tears out of her eyes goddess bless i didnt know i had that much manure in me oh you could have fertilized half a farm my lady tarma gasped imitating his obsequious bow bright stareyed here she handed kethry one of the goblets and poured it full of wine then took a second for herself wed better get ourselves under control if were going to get from here to our room without giving the game away youre right kethry said taking a long sip and exerting control to sober herself theres more at stake than just this little game hai sheli this is just the tail of the beastie were going to have to get into its lair to see if its a grasscat or a treehare and if its got idra in its mouth and i just realized something kethry told her all thought of laughter gone we know the new kings name but we dont know which of the brothers he is and that could make a deal of difference indeed vestacha tarma replied her eyes gone brooding in truth in very deed at dawn tarma relieved warrl of his watch on the horses and amused herself by first going through a few sword drills then working them much to the titillation of the gawkers toward noon kethry who had been playing the aristo rising late and demanding breakfast in bed put in her appearance with her was a pale stranger as expensively dressed as their visitor of the previous evening but in much better taste he too wore the badge of the kings household on his right shoulder by his walk tarma would have known him for a horseman by the clothing and the badge she knew him for the master of the kings horse and by the appreciation in his eyes tarma knew him for a man who knew his business she heaved a mental sigh of relief at that shed half feared he might turn out to be as big a booby as the courtier of the night before it would have cut her to the heart to sell these lovelies to an ignoramus but if she refused to sell theyd lose their cover story she had been taking the horses out of the corral one at a time and working them in a smaller pen most of them she did work on a lunge there were only a handful among the thirty she could work loose the way she had the chestnut she had a particularly skittish young buckskin gelding out when kethry and her escort arrived one she needed to devote most of her attention to so after taking a few mental notes on the man she went back to work he spent a long time looking over the herd as a whole and all in complete silence this is a good one mindmate warrl said from his resting place under the horse trough he smells of soap and leather not perfume and theres noear in him nor on him kathal desteredre she told the buckskin who kept wanting to break into a canter what else can you pick up from him lots of horsescent and not a trace of horsefear forshava after a time the master of horse left his post at the corral and took up a nearly identical stance at the fence of the pen where she was working the buckskin she watched him out of the corner of her eye appraisingly he was older than shed first thought medium height dark eyes dark hair beard and mustache his complexion would be very white if not for his suntanmuscles in his shoulders that made his tunic leather stretch when he moved his sole vanity seemed to be a set of matching silver jewelry fillet torque bracelets all inset with a single moonstone apiece he leaned comfortably on the fence missing nothing she did finally he spoke to kethry who was standing at his side dressed for the day in a cleaner and far more expensive set of the leathers shed worn to ride in yesterday sewen had not spared the company coffers when it had come time to outfit them for their ruse i understood that your companion was working the horses yesterday without a lunge only a few of the horses are schooled enough to work that way at the moment kehry said smoothly although eventually all of them could be trained so do you wish to see her work one of them now if you would both be so kind kethry leaned over the fence you heard him sheenedra is master flutterby there ready to pause the buckskin was obeying now having tried to fret himself into a froth tarma halted him then gave him a quick rubdown and led him out this time she called up a gentle dappled gelding one she was rather glad hadnt been chosen by a sunhawk he was so goodnatured he really wasnt suited to a battlefield but he was so earnest hed have broken his heart or a leg trying to do what was asked of him she didnt even bother to take him into the pen she worked him in the open then mounted him bareback and put him through a bit of easy dressage when she slid off the horsemaster approached she kept one hand on the dapples neck and watched as he examined the animal almost exactly as she would have the dapple curious craned his head around and whuffed the mans hair as he ran his hands gently down the horses legs rear then front then picked up a forefoot at that the man grinned a most unexpected expression on so solemn a face and held out his hand for the dapple to smell then rubbed his nose gently lady he spoke directly to tarma though he must have been told she didnt speak the language a courtesy as delicate as any shed ever been given i would cheerfully sell the palace to purchase these horses for once rumor has understated fact i think hes rather well hooked sheenedra kethry said pretending to translate how is he as a horseman can you feel happy letting them go to his care tarma gave that slight bow of respect to him and allowed a hint of a smile to cross her face im pleased warrls pleased and have a look at dust if you would the dapples eyes were halfclosed in pleasure as the horsemaster continued to scratch under his loose halter i think its safe to say that theyll be in good hands see if you can wangle a deal with him that will include me as a temporary trainer that will give us another excuse to linger my companion is gratified by your praise my lord kethry said to him and impressed with your knowledge she says she believes she could not find one to whose care she would be more willing to entrust her beasts again that unexpected smile then if you would care to return with me i believe we can agree to something mutually pleasing since you will be selling into the kings household there will be no merchant taxes and i think he gave the dapples forehead a last scratch i think perhaps that i shall keep this one out of his majestys sight i have my pick of the kings stables but only after he has taken his choice it is a pity a mount this intelligent is also so beautiful do you suppose you can come up with a distractor tarma do i i think so she led the dapple back into the pen and walked into the center of the herd to bring out the one horse of the lot that was mostly show and little substance a lovely gelding with a coat of gold a mane and tail of molten silver and without a jot of brains in that beautiful head fortunately he was reasonably even of temper as well as being utterly gentle or thered have been no handling him hed been included in the lot sent to the sunhawks although if hed had a bit less in the way of good looks hed have been counted a cull tarma had gotten the notion that idra might like a parademount and had asked her people to be on the lookout for a truly impressive beast of good temper for parade brains didnt matter you couldnt have told his beauty though except by his lines and the way he carried himself that was because he was filthy from rolling in the dust which he insisted on doing when any opportunity presented itself tarma went to work on him with brushes as he sighed and leaned into the strokes he was dreadfully vain and he loved being groomed tarma almost suspected him of dustrolling on purpose just so hed get groomed more often as the silver and gold began to emerge from under the dirt the horsemaster exclaimed in surprise when tarma was done and paraded the horse before him he smacked his fist into his palm in glee by the gods one look at him and his majesty wont give a bean for the gray i thank you my ladies he bowed slightly to both kethry and her partner and let us conclude this business as quickly as may be i wont be easy until these beauties are safely in the royal stables as he and kethry returned the way they had come tarma turned the gold loose in the stockade where he promptly went to his knees and wallowed in the dirt you she laughed at him are hopeless by twilight they were installed bag and baggage in the palace in one of the suites reserved for minor foreign dignitaries it had all happened so fast that tarma was still looking a little bemused kethry who knew just how quickly highranking courtiers could get things accomplished when they wanted to exert themselves had been a bit less surprised she and the master of horse had concluded their bargain in fairly short order and to her satisfaction it had been at his suggestion that tarma was retained for continued training no sooner had a price been settled on and a writ made out to a reputable goldsmith than a stream of thirty grooms and stable hands had been sent to walk the horses from the corral at the stockyard to the royal stables each horse to have its own handler the horsemaster was taking no chances on accident or injury when kethry returned to the inn there were already three porters waiting for her orders all in the royal livery they were none too sure of themselves tarma still in her barbarian persona had refused them entrance to the suite and was guarding the door as much with her scowl as her drawn sword they allowed the porters to carry away most of their belongings the ones that didnt matter like some of that elaborate clothing tarmas armor and weaponry including a few nasty little surprises she definitely did not want anyone to know about need their trail gear and the few physical supplies kethry needed for her magecraft they brought themselves in sealed saddlebags they rode hellsbane and ironheart kethry had no intention of chancing accidents with a trained battlemare accidents involving a shinain warsteed generally ended up in broken bones and not the horses more obsequious servants met them once the mares were safely stabled and again kethry made it plain to the stable crew that only tarma was to handle their personal horses to enforce that they left warrl with the mounts provided with his own stall between the ones supplied to the two mares one look at the kyree was all it took to convince the stablehands that they did not wish to rouse the beasts ire that was where tarma and kethry left their real gear the things they would truly need if they had to cut and run and between warrl and the horses it would be worth a persons life to touch it but as they crossed the threshold of the palace a curious chill had settled over kethry a chill that had nothing to do with temperature her good humor and faint amusement had vanished the palace seemed built of secrets dark secrets their mission suddenly took on an ominous feeling the suite consisting of a private bathing room two bedrooms and an outer public room all opulently furnished in dark wood and amber velvet had been a good indication that their putative status was fairly high the two personal servants assigned to them in addition to the regular staff had told them that they ranked somewhere in the minor envoy range this was close to perfect kethry would be able to move about the court fairly freely now tarma was immersed to her neck in a hot bath kethry had already had hers and was dressing in her most impressive outfit for there would be a formal reception for them in an hour tarma did not look at all relaxed kethry didnt blame her shed been increasingly uneasy herself there was no sign of gray in the stables and i looked for him tarma called abruptly from the bathing room gray was idras gelding a palfrey and not the shinain stallion she rode on campaign no sign of hawk tack either its like shes been long gone or was never here at all kethry heard splashing as her partner stood and shortly thereafter the shinain emerged from the bathing room with a huge towel wrapped about herself theyd turned down an offer of bath attendants after one look at tarmas arsenal the attendants had seemed just as glad if shes been here we should find out about it tonight especially after the wine begins to flow do i look impressive or seducabie kethry glided into tarmas room and turned so that her partner could survey her from all angles impressive tarma judged vigorously toweling her hair good i dont want to have to slap royal fingers and get strung up for my pains kethrys loose robes were of dark amber silk about three shades darker than her hair and highnecked bound at the waist with a silkandgold cord at her throat she wore a cabochon piece of amber the size of an egg she had confined her hair into a severe knot only allowing two decorous tendrils in front of her ears the robes had full scallopededged sleeves that were bound with gold thread she looked beautiful and incredibly dignified tarma was dressing in a more elaborate version of her black silk outfit this one piped at every seam and hem with silver she had a silver mesh belt instead of a silk sash and a silver fillet with a black moonstone instead of a headband confining her midnight hair you look fairly impressive yourself i dont like the feel of this place ill tell you that now tarma replied bluntly ive got my kalenedral chainmail on under my shirt and im bloody well armed to the teeth im going to stay that way until were out of here kethry rubbed her neck nervously you too me too you know the drill you talk and mingle i lurk behind you if i hear anything interesting i cough twice and we get somewhere where we can discuss it all their good humor had vanished into the shadows of the palace and all that was left them was foreboding i dont suppose that need not a hint just the same as back at hawksnest which could mean about anything most likely is that the captain is out of the edge of her range i hope youre right tarma sighed well shall we get on with it closing the door on the dubious shelter of their suite they moved side by side deeper into the web of intrigue six perfume wine and wiretight nerves musk hot wax and dying flowers the air in the great hall was so thick with scent that tarma felt overpowered by all the warrlng odors the buttercolored marble of the very walls and floor seemed warm rather than cool lighted candles were everywhere from massed groupings of thin tapers to pillars as thick as tarmas wrist the pale polished marble reflected the light until the great hall glowed fully as bright as daylight the hundreds of jewels the softly gleaming gold on brow and neck and arm the winking golden bullion weighing down hems sparkled like a panoply of stars it was not precisely noisy here but the murmuring of dozens hundreds of conversations the underlying current of the music of a score of minstrels the sound of twenty pairs of feet weaving through an intricate dance the combination added up to an effect as dizzying as the light heat or scent carved wooden doors along one wall opened up onto a courtyard garden also illuminated for the evening but by magic not candles but few moved to take advantage of the quiet and cool garden not when the real power in this land was here if power had possessed a scent it would have overwhelmed all the others in the hall the scarletandgoldclad man lounging on the gilded wooden throne at the far end of the great hall was young younger than tarma but very obviously the sole agent of control here no matter what they were doing nearly everyone in this room kept one eye on him at all times if he leaned forward the better to listen to one of the minstrels all conversation hushed if he nodded to a lady peacockbright gallants thronged about her but if he smiled upon her even her escort deserted her not to return until their monarchs interest wandered elsewhere he was not particularly imposing physically brown hair brown eyes medium build long lanternjawed face with a hard mouth and eyebrows like rulerdrawn lines over his eyes his was not the body of a warrior but not the body of a weakling either then he looks at you tarma thought and you see the predator the king of his territory the strongest beast of the pack and you want to crawl to him on your belly and present your throat in submission unless the thin tendril of warrls mindvoice insinuated itself into her preoccupation just unless you happen to be a pair of rogue bitches like yourself and your sister you bow to your chosen packleader and no one else and you never grovel the brilliantlybedecked courtiers werent entirely certain how to treat kethry and her blackclad shadow probably because the king himself hadnt been all that certain wherever they walked conversation faltered and died there was veiled fright in the courtiers eyesreal fright tarma wondered if she hadnt overdone her act a bit on the other hand king raschar had kept his hands off the sorceress it had looked for a moment as if he was considering chancing her protectors wrath but one look into tarmas coldly impassive eyes eyes shed often been told that marked her as a born killer seemed to make him decide that it might not be worth it tarma would have laid money down on the odds she knew exactly what he was thinking when he gave her that measuring look he could well have reckoned that she might be barbarian enough to act if she took ofrense and quick enough to do him harm before his guards could do anything about her maybe even quick enough to kill him the predator recognizes another of his kind tarma nodded to herself warrl wasnt far wrong if this was highborn life tarma was just as glad shed been born a shinain nomad the candlelight that winked from exquisite jewels also reflected from hollow hungry eyes voices were shrill with artificial gaiety there was no peace to be found here and no real enjoyment just a neverending round of competition competition in which the smallest of gestures took on worlds of meaning and in which they as unknown elements were a very disturbing pair of unexpected variables the only members of this gathering that seemed to be enjoying themselves in any way were a scant handful of folks who by the look of them were not important enough to worry the powerplayers a few courting couples some elderly nobles and merchants and a pair of men over in one corner conversing quietly in the shadows garbed so as to seem almost shadows themselves who stood together with winecups in hand they were well out of the swirl of the main action ignored for the most part by the players of this frenetic game when one of the two shifted the one wearing the darkest clothing tarma caught a good look at the face and recognized him for the horsemaster he had donned that impassive mask hed worn when he first looked the horses over and he was dressed more for comfort than to impress like tarma he was dressed mainly in black in his case with touches of scarlet his only ornaments were the silverandmoonstone pieces hed worn earlier the other man was all in gray and tarma could not manage to catch a glimpse of his face whoever he was tarma was beginning to wish she was with him and the horsemaster she was already tired to the teeth of this reception although tarma usually enjoyed warmth the air in the great hall was stiflingly hot even to her as she watched the men out of the corner of her eye they evidently decided the same for they began moving in the direction of one of the doors that led out into the gardens as they began to walk tarma saw with a start that the second man limped markedly keth dyou see our friend from this afternoon she said in a conversational tone will you lay me odds that the fellow with him is that archivist i dont think id care to i believe that youd win kethry nodded to one of the suddenlytonguetied courtiers as they passed the very essence of gracious calm the man nodded back but his eyes were fixed on tarma care for a breath of fresh air i thought youd never ask they made their own way across the room without hurrying and not directly simply drifting gradually as the ebb and flow of the crowd permitted they stopped once to accept fresh wine from a servant and again to exchange words with one of the few nobles a frail alerteyed old woman swathed in white fur who didnt seem terrified of them it seemed to take forever and was rather like treading the measures of an intricate dance but eventually they reached the open door with its carvings and panels of bronze and escaped into the cool duskiness of the illuminated gardens tarma had been prepared to fade into the shadows and stalk until she found their quarry but the two men were in plain sight beside one of the magelight decorated fountains they were clearly silhouetted against the sparkling blueglowing waters the archivist was seated on a white marble bench holding his winecup in both hands the horsemaster stood beside him leaning over to speak to him with one booted foot on the stone slab his own cup dangling perilously from loose fingers the partners strolled unhurriedly to the fountain pretending that kethry was admiring it the horsemaster saw them approaching as tarma watched his mouth tightened and he made a little negating motion with his free hand to his companion as the two women came within earshot but when they continued to close he suddenly became resignedly affable placing his cup on the stone bench he prepared to approach them my lady kethryveris i would not have recognized you he said leaving his associates side taking her hand in his and bowing over it you surprise me i would have thought you could not be more attractive than you were this afternoon i trust the gathering pleases you a remarkable assemblage kethry replied allowing a hint of irony to creep into her voice but i do not believe anyone introduced me to your friend then you must allow me to rectify the mistake at once he led her around the bench tarma following silently as if she truly was kethrys shadow so that they faced the man seated there the fountain pattered behind them masking their conversation from anyone outside their immediate vicinity lady kethryveris may i present jadrek the rethwellan archivist for some reason tarma liked this man even more than she had the horsemaster liked him immediately the magelight behind them lit his features clearly he was a man of middle years sandy hair going slightly to silver his face was thin and ascetic and his forehead broad his gray eyes held an echo of pain and there were answering lines of pain about his generous mouth that was an odd mouth it looked as if it had been made expressly to smile widely and often but something had caused it to set in an expression of permanent cynicism his gray tunic and breeches were of soft moleskin and it almost seemed to tarma that he wore them with the intent to fade into the background of wherever he might be this is a man the clans would hold in high esteem in the greatest of honor there is wisdom in him as well as learning so why is he unregarded and ignored here no matter what idra said i find it hard to understand people who do not honor wisdom when they see it i am most pleased to make your acquaintance master jadrek kethry said softly and sweetly as she gave him her hand i am more pleased because i had heard good things of you from captain idra tarma felt for the hilts of her knives as inconspicuously as she could as both men jerked as if theyd been shot this had not been part of the plans she and kethry had discussed earlier the archivist recovered first are you then something other than you seem lady kethryveris that you call the lady idra captain kethry smiled as tarma loosened the knife hidden in her sleeve and wished she could get at the one at the nape of her neck without giving herself away damn i cant get them both keth what the hell are you doing in no way her partner replied smoothly i am all that i claim to be i simply have not claimed all that i am we hoped to find the lady here but strangely enough weve seen no sign other keth tarma thought waiting for one or both of the men to make some kind of move you bloody idiot i hope you have a reason for this the horsemaster continued to stare in taut wariness and tarma had a suspicion that he too had a blade concealed somewhere about him maybe in his boot the archivist was eyeing them with suspicion but also as if he was trying to recall something you could be the chief mage of the sunhawks you seem to match the description he said finally then turned slightly to stare at tarma and that would make you the scoutmaster tindel these may well be two of idras fighters they certainly correspond with what ive been told the horsemaster pondered them and tarma noted a very slight relaxation of his muscles might be might be he replied but there are ways to make certain why does idra ride gray rather than her warhorse when not in battle he spoke directly to tarma who gave up pretending not to understand him because black enjoys using his teeth she said enjoying his start of shock at her harsh voice and if he cant take a piece out of anything else hell go for his riders legs shes tried kicking him from here to valdemar for it and still hasnt broken him of it so she never rides him except in a fight and if you know about black youll also know that we almost lost him in the last campaign he took a crossbow bolt and went down with idra on his back but he was just too damned mean to die now you tell me one why wont she let me give her a shinain saddlebred to ride when shes not on black because she wont start negotiations with clients on a bad footing by being bettermounted than they are the archivist said quietly i taught her that the horsemaster added i told her that the day she first rode out of here on her own and wanted to take the bestlooking horse in the stable when she rode out it was on a karsite cob that had been roughtrained to fight it was as ugly as a mud brick when did she lose it uh long before we joined i think when she was in randels raiders kethry replied to the lightningquick question after a bit of thought i think perhaps we have verified each other as genuine tindel asked with a twisted smile jadrek continued to watch them measuringly and warily still has idra been here kethry countered yes been and gone again keth we both know theres something going on around here that nobodys talking about tarma glanced at the two men and tindel nodded slightly if we dont want to raise questions wed rather not answer i think wed better either rejoin the rest of the world or drift around the garden then retire your instincts are correct as strangers youre automatically under observation its safe enough to mention idra so long as you dont call her captain tindel offered but i should warn you that we two are not entirely in good odor with his majesty jadrek in particular i might be in better case after tomorrow when he sees those horses nevertheless it wont do you any good to be seen with us i think you might do well to check with other information sources before you come to one of us again tarma looked him squarely in the eyes trying to read him every bit of experience she had told her he was telling the truth and that now that the approach had been made it would take a deal of courting before they would confide anything she looked down at jadrek if eyes were the windows of the soul his had the storm shutters up he had identified them that didnt mean he trusted them finally she nodded well do that gods tindel swore softly of all the rabbitbrainedwomen he didnt pace but by the clenching of his hand on his goblet jadrek knew that he badly wanted to if anybody had been close enough to hear her if theyre what they say they are they wouldnt have pulled this with anyone close enough to hear them jadrek retorted closing his eyes and gritting his teeth as his left knee shot a spasm of pain up his leg on the other hand if they arent they might well have wanted witnesses if if if jadrek tindels face was stormy i still havent made up my mind about them the archivist interrupted his friend if they are idras friends theyre going about this intelligently if theyre raschars creatures theyre being very canny they could be either we havent seen or heard of the pretty one so much as lighting a candle but if shes really idras prime mage she wouldnt char surely knows as much about the hawks as we do and having two women one of them shinain swordsworn show up here after idras gone off into the unknown must certainly have alerted his suspicions if the other did something proving herself to be a mage he wouldnt be suspicious anymore hed be certain so what do we do jadrek smiled wearily at his only friend we do what weve been doing all along we wait and watch we see what they do then maybe we recruit them to our side tindel snorted and meanwhile idra idra is either perfectly safe or beyond help and in either case nothing we do or dont do in the next few days is going to make any difference at all next time just stop my heart why dont you tarma asked crossly when they reached their suite she shut the door tightly behind them and set her back against it slumping weakkneed at having safely attained their haven i acted on a hunch im sorry kethry paused for a fraction of a second then headed for her bedroom the soft soles of her shoes making scarcely a sound on the marble floor her partner followed staggering just slightly as she pushed off from the door you could have gotten us killed tarma continued following the mage into the gilded splendor of her bedroom kethry turned tarma took a good look at her partners utterly still and sober expression then sighed na forget i yelled im a woolbrain there were signs you were reading that i couldnt see is that it kethry nodded eyes dark with thought i cant even tell you exactly what it was she said apologetically never mind tarma replied reversing a chair to sit straddlelegged on it with her arms folded over the back and her head resting on her arms forcing her tense shoulder muscles to relax its like trailreading for me i dont even think about it anymore first question can you find other sources maybe some of the older nobles like that old lady who talked to us the ones who werent afraid of you most older courtiers love to talk have seen everything and nobody will listen to them so kethry shrugged then glided over to the bed slipping out of the amber robe and draping it over another chair that stood next to it fire and candle light glinted from her hair and softened the hard muscles other body i use a little kindness risk being bored and maybe learn a lot i guess ill stick to the original plan then work the horses play that i dont understand the local tongue and keep my ears open tarma wasnt sure anymore that this was such a good plan certainly not as certain as she had been when they first rode in this place seemed full of invisible pitfalls one other thing theres more than a handful of mages around here and i dont dare use my powers much if i do theyll know me for what i am some of them felt pretty strong and none of them were in magerobes is that a good sign or a bad i dont know kethry unpinned her hair and shook it loose then slipped on a wisp of shift supplied by their host and climbed into her bed the mattress sighed under her weight as she settled under the blankets in the middle then she sat up gazing forlornly at her partner she looked like a child in the enormous expanse of featherbed and she looked uncomfortable and unhappy as well tarma knew that lost expression this place was far too like the luxurious abode of wethes goldmarchant the man to whom kethrys brother had sold her when she was barely nubile kethry plainly didnt want to be left alone in here they also didnt dare share the bed without arousing very unwelcome gossip but there was a third solution i dont trust our host any farther than i could toss ironheart she said standing up abruptly and shoving the chair away with a grating across the stone floor and im bloody damned barbarian enough that nothing i do is going to surprise people provided its weird and warlike with that she stalked into her bedroom stripped the velvet coverlet featherbed and downy blankets from the bedstead and wrestled the lot into kethrys room cursing under her breath the whole time tarma what im bedding down in here at the foot of your bed so the servants dont gossip theyve been watching me bodyguard you all day so this isnt going to be out of character she stripped to the skin glad enough to be out of those overfine garments and pulled on a wornout pair of breeches and another of those flimsy shifts tossing her clothes on the chair next to kethrys but you dont have to make yourself miserable kethry protested feebly her gratitude for tarmas company overpowering her misgivings great good gods this is a damn sight better than the tent tarma laughed and laid her weapons dagger and sword both unsheathed on the floor next to the mattress besides when the servants come in to wake us up ill rise with steel in hand that ought to give em something to talk about and distract them from who we were associating with last night and and well i dont entirely trust raschars good sense if his lusts involved for all we know hes got hidden passages in the walls that would let him in here when im not around hmm a good point kethry conceded with such relief that it was obvious to tarma that she had been thinking something along the same lines are you sure youll be all right tarma tried her improvised bed and found it better than shed expected best doss ive had in my life she replied wriggling luxuriously into the soft blankets and grinning youd better find out what happened to idra pretty quick sheenedra otherwise i may not want to leave kethry sighed reached up for the sconce beside her and blew out the candle leaving the room in darkness the following day tarma managed to frighten the maids half to death rising from the pile of bedding on the floor with sword in hand at the first sound of anyone stirring the younger of the two fainted dead away at the sight of her the other squeaked and ran for the door they didnt see that maid again so tarma figured she had refused to go back into their suite defying any and all punishments the other girl vanished as soon as kethry revived her and they didnt see her again either so she probably had done the same the next servants to enter the suite were a pair of haglike old crones with faces fit to frighten fish out of water they attended to the cleaning and picking up of the suite and took themselves out again with an admirable efficiency and haste that was more like what tarma wanted out of servants the giggly girls fussing about drove her to distraction at the best of times and now well now she wasnt going to take anything or anyone at face value those giggly girls were probably spies maybe more kethry heaved a sigh or two of relief when they saw the last of the new set of servitors hell shes an old campaigner she knows it too gods i hate this place after wolfing down some bread and fruit from the overgenerous breakfast the second set of servants had brought tarma headed off to oversee the further training of the horses concentrating on the gold and the dapple the gold she wanted schooled enough that he wouldnt cause his rider any problems the dapple she wanted trained to the limits of his understanding she hoped that might sweeten the horsemasters attitude toward them she kept her ears open and as shed hoped the stable folk were fairly free with their tongues while they thought she couldnt understand them besides several unflattering comments about her own looks she managed to pick up that idra had gone off rather abruptly but that her disappearance had not been entirely unexpected her name was coupled on more than one occasion with the words that wildgoose quest she learned little more than that of the other brother prince stefansen she learned a bit more hed run off on his brothers coronation day and hed done something worse than just run according to rumor though what it was no one really seemed to know whatever it had been enough to goad the new king into declaring him an outlaw if raschar caught him his head was forfeit and that was fair interesting indeed and was more than tarma had expected to leam that doesnt much surprise me given what ive heard kethry remarked that evening when they settled into their suite after another one of those stifling evening gatherings this one had been only a little less formal than their reception it seemed this sort of thing took place every night and attendance was expected even of visitors id gathered something like that from countess lyris it was about the only useful thing to come out of this evening i think i may die of the boredom provided the perfume doesnt kill me off first tarma yawned she was sprawled on the floor of kethrys room on her featherbed which the maids had not dared move her eyes were sleepy her posture wasnt kethry knew from years of partnering her that no one and nothing would move inside or near the suite without her knowing it she was operating on sentry reflexes and it showed in a subtle tenseness of her muscles the perfume may i dont think boredom is going to be a problem kethry replied slowly she leaned back into the pillows heaped at the head of the bed and combed her hair while she spoke in tones hardly louder than a whisper the candlelight from the sconce in the headboard behind her made a kind of amber aura around her head there is one hell of a lot more going on here than meets the eye this is what ive gotten so far when idra got here she supported raschar over stefansen the whole idea was that stefansen was going to be allowed to exile himself off to one of the estates and indulge himself in whatever way he wanted presumably he was going to fade away into quiet debauchery raschar was crowned and suddenly stefansen was gone with a price on his head nobody knows where he went but the best guess is north tarma looked a good deal more alert at that and leaned up against the bedside propping her head on her hands oh really and what came of the original plan especially if stefansen had agreed to it kethry shrugged and frowned it was a puzzle and one that left a prickle between her shoulderblades as if someone were aiming a weapon for that spot no one seems to know no one knows what it was stefansen did to warrant a death sentence but raschar was and is still according to one of my sources very nervous about proving that he is the rightful claimant to the throne theres a tale that the royal line used to have a sword in raschars grandfathers time that was able to choose the rightful heir or the best king the stories arent very clear on the subject at least not the ones i heard it was stolen forty or fifty years ago idra apparently volunteered to see if she could find it for raschar the assumption being that the sword would pick him they say he was very eager for her to find it and at the moment everyone seems convinced that she took off to go looking for it tarma shook her head slowly her mouth was twisted a little in a skeptical frown that doesnt sound much like the captain to me sure she might well say she was going off looking for it but to really do it personally alone when the hawks are waiting for her to join them and its nearly fighting season and why not rope in one of raschars tame mages to help smell out the magic its not likely not bloody likely kethry agreed i could see it as an excuse to get back to us but not anything else have you made any moves at old jadrek kethry sighed jadrek had been exceptionally hard to get at for a lame man he could vanish with remarkable dexterity im courting him cautiously he doesnt seem to trust anyone except tindel i did find out why neither raschar nor his father cared for jadrek or his the hereditary archivists or rethwellan both suffered from an overdose of honesty lets not get abstruse shall we kethry grinned this part at least did have a certain ironic humor to it both jadrek and his father before him insisted on putting events in the archives exactly as they happened instead of tailoring them to suit the monarchs sensibilities so whats to stop the king from having the archives altered at his pleasure they cant kethry replied still amused in spite of her feelings that they were both treading an invisible knife edge of danger the archive books are bespelled they have to be kept up to date or and i quote something nasty happens the archives once written in are protected magically and cant be altered and raschar doesnt have a mage knowledgeable enough to break the spell once something is in the archives its there forever tarma choked on a laugh and stuffed the back of her hand into her mouth to keep it from being overheard in the corridor outside they had infrequent eavesdroppers out there who was responsible for this little pickle one of the first kings predictably called the honest he was also an adept of the leverand school so he could easily enforce his honesty i gather he wasnt terribly popular i also gather that he didnt much care tarma made a wry face hair shirts and dry bread and weekly fasts with the whole of his court included but this isnt getting us anywhere tarma nodded and buried one hand in her short hair leaning her head on it too true ideas kethry sighed and shook her head not a one you to her mild surprise tarma nodded thought fully biting her lip maybe just maybe but try the indirect approach first my way is either going to earn us our information or scare the bird into cover so deep well never get him to fly him again tarma nodded uhhuh jadrek three days later with not much more information than theyd gotten in the first two days tarma decided it was time to try her plan it involved a fair amount of risk although they planned to be as careful as they could they were undoubtedly going to be seen at some point or other since skulking about would raise suspicions tarma only hoped that no one would guess that their goal was jadreks rooms she waited for a long while with her ear pressed up against the edge of the door listening to the sounds of servants and guests out in the hall the hour following the mandatory evening gathering was a busy one the nightlife of the court of rethwellan continued sometimes until dawn and the hour of dismissal was followed by what kethry called the hour of scurrying as nobles and notables found their own various entertainments finally its been quiet for a while now tarma said when the last of the footsteps had faded and the last giggling servant departed i think this is a lull lets head out before we get another influx of dicers or something as usual kethry sailed through the door first with tarma her sinister shadow there was no one in the gilded hallway tarma was pleased to note in fact at least half the polished bronze lamps were out indicating that there would be no major entertainments tonight in this end of the palace i hope warrrs ready to come out of hiding tarma thought to herself a little worriedly this whole notion of mine rests on him must you think of me as if i couldnt hear you warrl snapped in exasperation qf course im ready just get the old savants window open and ill be in through it before you can blink sorry tarma replied sheepishly i keep forgetting damnit furface im still not used to mindtalking with youl its just not something shinain do warrl did not answer at once l know he said finally and i shouldnt eavesdrop but its the mindmate bond i sometimes have to force myself not to listen to you weve got so much in common youre kalenedral and im neuter and were both fighters you knowthere are times when i wonder if your lady might not take me along with you in the end i think id like that tarma was astonished so surprised that she stopped dead for a moment you you would really not if you start acting like a fool about it he snapped jolting her back to sense great homed moon will you keep your mind on your work to traverse the guests section they wore clothing that suggested they might be paying a social call but once they got into the plainer hallways of the quarters belonging to those who were not quite nobility but not exactly servants like the archivist and the master of horse they stepped into a granitewalled alcove long enough to strip off their outer garments to reveal their wellworn traveling leathers in the dim light of the infrequent candles they looked enough like servants that tarma hoped no one would look at them too carefully they covered their hair with scarves and folded their clothing into bulky bundles they carried those bundles conspicuously so that they were unlikely tarma hoped to be levied into some task or other as extra hands the corridor had changed gone were the soft heavy hangings the frequent lanterns the passage here was bare stone polished granite floor and wall and the lighting was by cheap clay lanterns or cheaper tallow candles placed in holders along the walls at long intervals it was chilly here and damp and the tallow candles smoked well this explains one thing about that sour old bastard tarma muttered under her breath while kethry counted doors seven eight who what jadrek why hes such a meddlarface mans obviously got bones as stiff as im going to have in a few years living in this section must make him as creaky as a pair of new boots ten never thought of that remind me to stay on the right side of royal displeasure this should be it kethry stopped at a wooden door set into the corridor wall a door no different from any of the others and knocked softly tarma listened as hard as she could heard limping footsteps then the door creaked open a crack showing a line of light at its edge she rammed her shoulder into it without giving jadrek a chance to see who was on the other side of it and shoved it open before the archivist had time to react kethry was less than half a step behind her they were inside and had the door shut tightly behind them before jadrek had a chance to go from shock to outrage at their intrusion tarma put her back to the rough wood of the door and braced herself against it no halfcripple like jadrek was going to be able to move her away from the door until she was good and ready the rest was up to kethrys silver tongue jadrek glared his whole attitude one of affronted dignity but did not call for help or gibber in helpless anger as tarma had half expected instead every word he spoke was forceful but deadly cold controlled and quiet what pray is this supposed to mean the gray eyes were shadowed with considerable pain at the moment tarma hoped it was not because of something shed done to him in getting the door open i have come to expect a certain amount of cavalier treatment but not in my own quarters my lord kethry began i he said bitterly am no ones lord you may abandon that pretense kethry sighed jadrek i humbly beg your pardon but we were trying to find a way to speak with you without drawing undue attention if you want us to leave this moment we will but damnitall we are trying to find out whats become of our captain and you seem to be the only source of reliable information he raised one eyebrow in surprise at her outspokenness and looked at her steadily and you might well be the instrument of my execution for treason tarma whistled softly through her teeth causing both of their heads to swivel in her direction that bad is it his jaw tightened but he did not answer believe or not ive got an answer for you look i would assume you are probably the most wellread man in this city thats what the captain seemed to think kethry continued do you know what a kyree is he nodded warily do you know what it means to be mindmated to one a little i also know that they are reputedly incapable of lying mindtomind at kethrys hand signal tarma stood away from the door crossed the room at a sprint and flung open the casement window that looked out over the stableyard she had seen jadrek at this window the night before which was how she and kethry had figured out which set of rooms was his warrl was ready in the yard below tarma could see him bulking dark in the thin moonlight before jadrek could react to tarmas sudden movement warrl launched himself through the open window and landed lightly in the middle of the rather small room it seemed that much smaller for his being there the kyree looked at jadrek seemed to look through himhis eyes glowing like topaz in the sun then he bowed his head once in respect to the archivist and mindspoke to all three of them i am warrl we are captain idras friends we want to kelp her but we cannot if we do not know what has happened to her wise one you are one of the few honest men in this place will you not help ms jadrek stared at the kyree his jaw slack with astonishment but but you wonder how i can speak with you and how i managed to remain concealed i have certain small powers of magic the kyree said nearly grinning you may have heard that the barbarian brought her herd dog with her i chose to appear somewhat smaller than i am the stahlehands think me a rather large wolfdog cross the archivist reached for the back of a chair beside him to steady himself he was pale and there was marked confusion in his eyes iplease ladies sit down or as a gentleman i cannot and i feel the need of something other than my legs to support me there were only two chairs in the room tarma solved the problem of who was to take them by sinking crosslegged to the floor warrl curled behind her as a kind of backrest which made the room look much less crowded while kethry took the second chair and jadrek the one he had obviously by the book on the table beside it vacated at their knock tarma took a quick assessing look around her there were old threadbare hangings on most of the stone walls probably put up in a rather futile attempt to ward off the damp chill there was a small fire on the hearth to her right probably for the same reason beside the hearth was a chair or rather a small bench with a back to it with shabby brown cushions this was the seat jadrek had resumed his own brown robes blending with the cushions beside this chair stood a table with a single lamp a book that seemed to have been put down rather hastily and a halfempty wineglass across from this was a second identical seat to tarmas left stood a set of shelves full of books odd bits of rock and pieces of statuary and things not readily identifiable in the poor light at the sight of the books tarma felt a longsuppressed desire to get one of them in her hands she hadnt had a good read in months and her soul thirsted for the new knowledge contained within those dusty volumes in the wall with the bookcase was another door presumably to jadreks bedchamber in the wall directly opposite the one they had entered was the window pretty barren place this time tarma was thinking directly at the kyree he has less far less respect than he deserves warrl said with some heat this man has knowledge many would die for and he is looked upon as some kind of fool i had rather be considered a fool jadrek said slowly the kyree raised his head off his paws sharply and looked at the man in total astonishment you hear me yes wasnt i supposed to tarma and the kyree exchanged a measured glance and did not answer him directly why would you rather be considered a fool tarma asked after a moment of consideration because a fool hears a great deal and a fool is not worth killing i think kethry said leaning forward you had better begin at the beginning some hours later they had a full picture and it was not a pleasant one so the story is that stefansen intended some unspecified harm to his brother and when caught fled in actuality tindel and i overheard some things that made us think raschar might be considering assuring that there would be no other male claimants to the throne and we warned stefansen where did he go kethry asked i dont know i dont want to know the less i know the less i can betray his eyes had gone shadowy and full of secrets good point all right what then have you had a good look around you raschars pretty free with his money tarma observed freer than you think he supports most of the hangerson here hes also indulging in some expensive habits tran dust its said certainly some very expensive liquors dainties and ladies nice lad wheres the money coming from jadrek sighed thats the main reason why i and my father before me are not in favor king destillion began taxing the peasantry and the merchant class far too heavily to my mind about twenty years ago raschar is continuing the tradition about half of our peasants have been turned into serfs more follow every year opposing that was a point stefansen agreed with me on and one of the reasons why destillion intended to cut him out of the succession but didnt kethry asked jadrek shook his head not for lack of trying but the priests kept him from doing so idra tarma reminded them she saw what raschar was doing and began to think that despite stefansens habit of hopping into bed with anything that wiggled its hips at him he might well have been a better choice after all he certainly had more understanding of the peasantry and how the kingdoms strength depends on them jadrek almost managed a smile granted he spent a great deal of time with them and pretty much with rowdies but im not certain now that his experience with the rougher classes was a bad thing well idra wanted an excuse to go after him i unearthed the old story of the sword that sings raschar has one chink in his armor hes desperate to prove hes the rightful monarch idra took raschar the old archive books and got permission to look for the sword then she vanished the fire crackled while they absorbed this but shed intended to go after stefansen kethry asked finally jadrek nodded it might well be that she decided to just go before raschar could change his mind tarma finished the sentence but you arent entirely certain that something didnt happen to her or that something didnt happen right after she set out he nodded unhappily twisting his hands together in his lap she would have said goodbye weve been good friends for a long time we used to exchange letters as often as her commissions permitted i saw the world through her eyes there was a flash of longing in his face there for only a instant then shuttered down but it made tarma wonder what it must be like to have dreams of adventuring and be confined to the body of a halflame scholar she stood up suddenly uncomfortable with the insight the tiny room felt far far too confining jadrek well talk with you more later right now youve given us plenty to think on youll try and find out whats happened to her he started to stand but kethry gently pushed him back down into his chair as tarma turned abruptly not wanting to see any more of this mans pain she turned the latch silently cracked the door open and checked for watchers in the corridor beyond looks clear kethry and warrl slipped out ahead of her and tarma glanced back over her shoulder soberly the archivist was watching them from his chair and there was a peculiar painful mixture of hope and fear on his face jadrek that was why we came here in the first place and be warned if anything has happened to idra there might not be a town here once the hawks find out about it and with that she followed her partner back into the corridor seven jadrek tried to return to his book but it was fairly obvious that he was going to be unable to concentrate on the page in front of him he finally gave up and sat staring at the flickering shadows on the farther wall his left shoulder ached abominably it had been wrenched when the door had been jerked out of his hands this would be a night for a doubledose of medicine or hed never get to sleep sleep would not have come easily anyway not after this evenings conversation tindel had been after him for the past several days to talk to the women but jadrek had been reluctant and suspicious now tindel would probably refrain from saying i told you so only by a strong exercise of will what did decide me anyway he wondered trying to find a comfortable position as he rubbed his aching shoulder the dull throb interfering with his train of thought was it the presence of the kyree no i dont think so i think i had made up my mind before they brought him in i think it was the pretty one that made up my mind kethry shes honest in a way i dont think could be counterfeited i cant read the shinain but if you know what to look for kethrys an open book he sighed and lets not be fooling ourselves its the first time in years that a pretty woman looked at you with anything but contempt jadrek youre as susceptible to that as the next man more he resolutely killed halfwisps of wistful mighthes and daydreams and got up to find his medicines tarma left warrl watching the archivists door from the corridor just in case his positioning was not nearly as good as shed have wished in order to keep out of sight hed had to lairup in a table nook some distance away from jadreks rooms and not in direct line of sight still it would have to do she had some serious misgivings about the archivists safety especially if it should prove that he was being watched creeping along the corridors with every sense alert was unnervingly like being back with the hawks on a scouting mission kethry had hesitantly and reluctantly tendered the notion of using her powers to spy out the situation ahead of them tarma had vetoed the idea to her partners obvious relief if there was any kind of magetalented spy keeping an eye on jadrek use of magic would not only put alerts on the archivist but on them as well their own senses must be enough but it was tense work tarma was sweating before they made it to the relative safety of the guesting section they slipped their more ornate outfits back on in the shelter of the same alcove where theyd doffed them and continued on their way now was the likeliest time for them to be caught but they got back to their rooms without a sign that they had been noticed or so tarma thought she was rather rudely disabused of that notion as soon as they opened the door to their suite moonlight poured down through one of the windows in the righthand wall of the outer room making a silver puddle on a square of the pale marble floor as tarma closed the door and locked it she caught movement in that moonlight out of the corner of her eye she jerked her head around and pulled a dagger with the hand not still on the latch in the automatically defensive reaction to seeing motion where none should be the moonlight shivered and wavered sending erratic reflections across the room and acting altogether unlike natural light tarma snatched her other hand away from the latch and whirled away from the door she had just locked her entire body tingled from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet with an energy she was intimately familiar with the only time she ever felt like this was when her teachers were about to manifest physically for over the years she had grown as sensitive to the energies of the stareyed as kethry was to mageenergies but the spirit kalenedral her teachers never came to her when she was within four walls and doubly never when she was in walls that were as alien to them as this palace was she sheathed her blade little good it would do against magic and spirits set sweating palms against the cool wood of the door she stared dumbfounded at the evidence of all shed been told being violated the shadow and moonlight was hardening into a manshaped figure flowing before her eyes into the form of a shinain garbed and armed in black and veiled only the kalenedral wore black and only the spiritkalenedral went veiled and here where no one knew that it was wildly unlikely that this could be an illusion even if there were such a thing as a mage skilled enough to counterfeit the warriors powers well enough to fool a living kalenedral and there was another check her partner who had over the years seen tarmas teachers manifesting at least a score or times beside her kethry stared and smothered a gasp with the back of her hand tarma didnt think it likely that any illusion could deceive the mage for long to top it all this was not just any shinain not just any spiritkalenedral for as the features became recognizable what could be seen above his veil tarma knew him to be no less than the chief of all her teachers he seemed to be fighting against something his form wavered in and out of visibility as he held out frantic empty hands to her and he seemed to be laboring to speak kethry stared at the spiritkalenedral in absolute shock this this could not be happening but it was and there was no mistaking the flavor of the energy the spirit brought with him this was a true leshyae kalenedral and he was violating every precept to manifest here and now within sight of nonshinain which could only mean that he was sent directly by tarmas own aspect of the fourfaced goddess the warrior then she saw with magesight the veil of sickly white power that was encasing him like a filthy web keeping him from full manifestation theresgoddess theres a counterspell kethry started out of her entrancement its preventing any magic from entering this room he cant manifest ii have to break it or dont tarma hissed catching her hands as she brought them up you break a counterspell and theyll know one of us is a mage kethry turned her head away unable to bear the sight of the kalenedral struggling vainly against the evil power containing him tarma turned back to her teacher to see that he had given up the effort to speak and she saw that his hands were moving in the same shinain handsigns she had taught kethry and her scouts keth his hands as kethrys eyes were again drawn to the leshyaes figure tarma read his message deathdanger she read and assassins wise one warrior its jadrek hes going to be killed she reached behind her for the door certain that they were never going to make it to jadreks rooms in time but warrl had been watching her thoughts probably alerted through the bond they shared to her agitation mindmate i go rang through her head at the same moment as if he had heard the kyrees reply the leshyae kalenedral made a motion of triumph and dissolved back into moonlight and shadow while kethry was still staring at the place where the spirit had stood tarma was clawing the door open all thought of subterfuge gone she headed down the corridor at a dead run and she could hear kethry right behind her this time there would be no attempt at concealment warrls voice was sharp in her mind angry and tasting of battlehunger mindmate one comes he smells of seeking death keep him away from jadrek there was no answer to that as she put on a burst of speed down the corridor at least not an answer in words but there was a surge of great anger a rage such as she had seldom sensed in the kyree even under battlefire then tarma had evidence of her own of how strong the mindmate bonding between herself and the kyree had become because she began to get imageflashes carried on that rage a man an armed man with a long wicked dagger in his hand standing outside jadreks door the man turning to face warrl even as jadrek opened the door jadrek stepping back a pace with fear stark across his features then turning and stumbling back into his room the man ignoring him meeting the threat of warrl unsheathing a sword to match the knife he carried tarma felt the growl the kyree vented rumbling in her own throat as she ran felt him leap now they were in the older section running down jadreks corridor kethry was scarcely a step behind her as they skidded to a halt at jadreks open door there was blood everywhere spilling out over the doorsill splashed on the wall of the corridor the kyree stood over a body sprawled halfin halfout of the room growling under his breath his eyes literally glowing with rage warrl had taken care of the intruder less than seconds before their arrival for the body at his feet was still twitching and the kyrees mind was seething with aggression and the aftermath of the kill his hackles were up but he was unmarked of the blood splashed so liberally everywhere none of it seemed to be warrls goddess tarma caught at the edge of the doorframe and panted her knees weak with relief that the kyree had gotten there in time jadrek kethry snapped out of shock first she slid past the slowly calming kyree into the room beyond tarma was right behind her expecting to find the archivist in a dead faint or worse hurt or collapsed with shock she was amazed to find him still on his feet he had his back to the wall standing next to the fireplace behind his chair a dagger in one hand a fireplace poker in the other he was pale and looked as if he was likely to be sick at any moment but he also looked as if he was quite ready to protect himself as best he could and was anything but immobilized with fear or shock for one moment he didnt seem to recognize them then he shook his head a little put the poker carefully down sheathed the dagger at his belt then groped for the back of his chair and pulled it toward himself the legs grating on the stone he all but fell into it jadrek are you all right tarma would have gone to his side but kethry was there before her jadrek was trembling in every nerve and muscle as he collapsed into his chair gods one breath more too close too close kethry took his wrist before he could wave her away and felt for his pulse he stared at her anxious face so close to his own and felt his heart skip for a reason other than fear damnit you fool shes just worried that youre going to die on her before you can help her with the information they need then he thought feeling a chill creep down his back gods i might if char has had a watcher on me all this time it means hes suspected me of warning stefan and if that watcher chose to strike tonight only because i spoke to a pair of strangers archivist your hours are numbered kethry checked jadreks heartbeat fearing to find it fluttering erratically to her intense relief it was strong though understandably racing i gods above i think i will be all right he managed pressing his free hand to his forehead but i would be dead if not for your kyree who was that kethry asked urgently who that was a member of the kings personal guard he replied thickly brightest goddess i knew i was under suspicion but i never guessed it went this far they must have had someone watching me watching to see who you talked to no doubt tarma said grimly her lips compressed into a thin line and the king must have left orders what was to happen to you if you talked to strangers hellfire and corruption now im a liability so far as raschar is concerned he was pale and with more than shock but there was determination in the set of his jaw as he looked to tarma char has only one way of dealing with liabilities as youve seen lord and lady help me im under a death sentence without trial or hearing ii havent got a chance unless i can escape woman youve got to help me if you want any more help with finding idra youve got kethry had angry words on her tongue annoyed that he should think them such cowards but tarma beat her to them what kind of gutless boobs do you think we are tarma snapped of course well help you damnit man it was us coming to you that triggered this attack in the first place keth clean up the mess go ahead and use magic were blown now anyway kethry nodded after the visitor i should say so even if there wasnt anyone watching hell have left residue in the trapspell did you pick up any eyes she let her magesenses extend no no not then and not now evidently they havent guessed our identity small piece of warriors fortune well im getting rid of the body before somebody falls over it its likely this bastard was the only watcher archivist or youd have been caught out before this she paused to think if i hide him they may wait to check things out until after he was due to report hell if they cant find him they may wait a bit longer to see if hes gone following after one of jadreks visitors that should buy us a couple more hours jadrek are there any empty rooms along here most of them are empty he said dully holding his hands up before his eyes and watching them shake with a kind of morbid fascination nobody is quartered along here who isnt in disgrace this is the oldest wing of the palace and its been poorly maintained and repaired but little gods no wonder nobody came piling out to see what the ruckus was tarmas lip curled in disgust bastard really gives you respect doesnt he well thats another piece of good luck weve had tonight and tarma turned back to deal with the corpse as kethry began mustering her energies for cleanup tarma bundled the body into its own cloak giving warrl mental congratulations over the relatively clean kill the kyree had only torn the mans throat out the man had been relatively small she figured she could handle the corpse alone she heaved the bundle over her shoulder with a grunt of effort trusting to the thick cloak to absorb whatever blood remained to be spilled and went out into the corridor picking a room at random the first one she chose didnt have its own fireplace so she left that one but the second did it was a matter of moments and a good bit of jointstraining effort to stuff the carcass up the chimney by the time she returned a little judicious use of magic had cleaned up every trace of a struggle around jadreks quarters and kethry and the archivist were in the little bedroom that lay beyond the closed door in his sitting room the mage was helping jadrek to make a pack of his belongings and jadrek was far calmer now than tarma had dared to hope warrl was stretched across the doorway still growling under his breath he gave her a gentle warnoff as she sent him a thought his bloodlust was up and he didnt want her in his mind until he had quieted himself jadrek had lit a half dozen candles and stuck them over every available surface the bedroom was as sparse as the outer room had been though smelling a little less of damp there was just a wardrobe a chest and the bed jadrek how well do you ride tarma asked taking over the bundle kethry was making and freeing her to start a new one not well he said shortly folding packets of herbs into a cloth its not my ability to ride its the pain i used to ride very well now i cant stand being in a saddle for more than an hour or so and if we drugged you he shrugged drugged arent i likely to fall off and youd have to lead my beast even if you tied me into the saddle that would slow you considerably not if i put you on heart or better yet keth youre light and you dont go armored how about if i take all the packs and bane carries double kethry examined the archivist carefully it should be all right jadrek doesnt look like he weighs much put him up in front of me and i can hold him on even if hes insensible the archivist managed a quirk of one corner of his mouth hardly the way i had hoped to begin my career of adventuring tarma raised an eyebrow at him you look surprised swordlady i did a great deal of my studying in hopes of one day being able to aid some heroic quester after all what better help could a hero have than a loremaster then he held out one hand and shoved the sleeve of his robe up so they could see the swollen wrists my body betrayed me and my dreams so goes life tarma winced in sympathy her own bones ached in the cold these days enough that rough camping left her stiff and limping these days for at least an hour after rising or until she finished her warming exercises she didnt like to think how much pain swollen joints meant have you any plan the archivist continued or are we just going to run for it tarma shook her head dont you think it running off blindly is likely to run us right into a trap we came out of the south the hawks are to the south and west id bet the kings menll expect us to run for familiar territory so we go opposite jadrek hazarded north then what tarma folded a shirt into a tight bundle and wedged it into the pack north is where stefansen went north is where idra likely went no so well track them north and hope to run into one or both of them i know where stefansen intended to go jadrek said slowly i did tell idra before she went missing but frankly its some of the worst country to travel in winter in all of rethwellan all the better to shake off pursuit cough it up man where are we going across the comb and into valdemar he looked seriously worried and winter storm season in the comb is deadly if were caught in an ice storm without shelter well let me just say that we probably wont be a problem for raschar anymore this is almost too easy tarma muttered surveying the empty court below jadreks window keth is there anything you cant live without back in the room the mage pursed her lips thoughtfully then shook her head good then well leave from here nobodys been alerted yet and evidently jadreks in poor enough condition that nobody has even considered he might slip out his window with good reason swordlady jadrek replied coming to tarmas side and looking down into the court himself i cant imagine how i could climb down alone you couldnt well help you kethry told him i can actually make you about half your real weight with magic then well manage well enough the archivist looked down again and shuddered but to his credit did not protest theyd sent warrl for a short coil of rope from the stables there were always leadropes and lunges lying around and any of those would be long enough he returned just as kethry completed her spellcasting they tied one end around jadreks waist then kethry scrambled out of the window and down the wall to steady him from below as tarma lowered him before they were finished tarma had a high respect for the mans courage climbing down from the window put him in such pain that when they untied him they found hed bitten his lip through to keep from crying out all their gear was still with the mares when theyd left hawksnest theyd chosen to use a different kind of saddle than they normally chose one meant for long rides and not pitched battles like the saddles jodi preferred these were little more than a pad with stirrups although the pad extended out over the horses rump when tarma carried warrl pillion he had a pad behind her battlesaddle to ride on there was just enough room on the extended body of this saddle for him to do the same so kethry had no trouble fitting jadrek in front of her which was just as well jadrek had mixed something with the last of his wine and gulped it down before attempting the window he was fine although still in pain when they started saddling up but by the time the mares were harnessed and all their gear was in place he was fairly intoxicated and not at all steady they did manage to get him into the saddle but it was obvious he wouldnt be staying there without kethrys help warrl tarma thought tentatively all is well mindmate came the reassuring reply there is no one in sight and i am distracting the gate guards if you go swiftly there will be no one to stop or question you lets move out now she told her partner while furface has the guards playing catchmeifyoucan with him kethry nodded they rode out of the palace grounds as quietly theyd signaled the mares for silence and now hellsbane and ironheart were moving as stealthily as only two shinain bredandtrained warsteeds could they managed to get out unchallenged and waited outside the palace for warrl to catch up with them then put ironheart and hellsbane to as fast a pace as they dared and by dawn were well clear of the city any sign of tracking tarma asked her partner reining ironheart in beside her as they slowed to a brisk walk kethry closed her eyes in concentration extended a little tendril of energy along the road behind them then shook her head my guess would be that they havent missed the spy yet but my guess would also be that with all the mages i sensed in raschars court theyll be sending at least one with each pursuit party anything you can do about that some she reformed that tendril of energy into a deceptionweb that might confuse their backtrail listen we need supplies how about if i lay an illusion on you and heart and you go buy us some at the next village we hit how about if you spell all three of us right now say old woman and her daughter and son nobody knows shinain battlemares out here and heart and bane are ugly enough to belong to peasants you neednt spell them huh not a bad thought what about warrl i can seem much smaller if i need to kethry started furface i wish you wouldnt just speak into my mind like that you never used to my pardon i grow forgetful of courtesy how does the wise one jadrek was threequarters asleep slumped forward in kethrys hold his head nodding to the rhythm of hellsbanes hooves kethry touched his neck below his ear lightly enough not to disturb him all right his pulse is strong if you would have my advice when the kyree tendered his opinion it was worth having go ahead rouse him up and make him speak with you he will do his body more harm by riding unconscious on that subject tarma interrupted how long can you keep our illusions going what kind of shape are you in kethry shrugged ive been mostly resting my powers so far i can keep the spell up indefinitely why because i want to stay under roofs at night for as long as we can rough camping is going to be hard on our friend at best be a helluva note to save him from assassins and lose him to pneumonia kethry nodded thinking of how much pain the archivist was already in what kind of roofs in order of preference outoftheway barns the occasional friendly farmer and the cheapest inns in town sound i think pull up here i might as well cast this thing now and i cant do it on a moving horse here was a grove of trees beside the road they got the horses off and allowed them to browse while kethry concentrated warrl flung himself down into the dry grass and lay there panting he was not built for the long chase before too very long tarma would have to bring him up to ride pillion behind her for a rest kethry got jadrek leaning back against her then spread her hands wide palms facing out a shell of faint roseate light expanded from her hands outward to contain them and their horses tarma could see her lips moving silently in the words of the spell there was a tiny pop like a cork being pulled from a bottle then tarma felt an alltoofamiliar itching at the back of her eyes and when she looked down she saw that she was wearing a mans garb of rough brown homespun instead of her kalenedralstyled black silks so keth was going to disguise her as a young man good that should help to throw off nonmage spies jadrek was now an old grayhaired woman with a face like a wrinkled apple and a body stooped from years of hard work behind him kethry was a chunky freshfaced peasant wench browncheeked brownhaired and quite unremarkable huh tarma said thiss a new one for you you look like youd make some dirtgrubber a great wife kethry giggled good hips breed like cow strong like bull dumb like ox hitch to plow when horse dies as tarma stifled a chuckle she turned her attention to her passenger jadrek wake up theres a good fellow she shook his shoulder gently open your eyes slowly ive put an illusion on us all and it may make you dizzy at first huhnn i thought i heard you saying that the archivist raised his head with care and opened eyes that looked a bit dazed gods what am i a crippledup old peasant woman warrl says youll do yourself more harm than good by riding asleep he wants you to talk to me how odd i thought i heard him speaking in my head again i seem to remember him saying just that the partners exchanged a startled look evidently jadrek had a magegift no one had ever suspected for normally the only folk who heard warrls mindvoice were those he intended to speak to that talent might be useful if they all lived to reach the border lets get on with it tarma broke the silence before it went on too long and glanced at the rising sun to her right we need to get as far as we can before they figure out weve bolted back there they stopped at a goodsized village there was a market going on and tarma rode in alone and bought the supplies they were going to need by mercenarys custom theyd kept all their cash with them in moneybelts that they never let out of their sight so they werent short of funds at least tarma did well in her bargaining better than shed expected even more encouraging no one gave her a second glance poor jadrek had not exaggerated the amount of pain he was going to be in by nightfall his eyes were sunken deeply into their sockets and he looked more than half dead but they found a barn full of newcut hay dry and warm and softer than many beds tarma had slept in the dry warmth seemed to do jadrek a lot of good he was moving better the next morning and didnt take nearly as much of his drugs as he had the day before and oddly enough he seemed to get better as the trip progressed kethry was wearing need at her side again after having left the ensorcelled blade with her traveling gear in the stables tarma was just thanking her goddess that they hadnt ever brought the blade into their quarters no telling what would have happened had it met with the counterspell on their rooms of a certainty raschar would have known from that moment that they were not what they seemed fall weather struck with a vengeance on the sixth morning they ended up riding all day through rain rethwellans fall and early winter rains were notorious far and wide jadrek was alert and conversing quietly and animatedly with kethry he seemed in better shape despite the cold rain than hed been back at the palace now tarma wondered remembering the enigmatic words of moonsong kvala the taleedras adept if need was working some of her magic on jadrek because kethry was concerned for him it would be the first time in tarmas knowledge that a male for whom kethry cared had spent any length of time in physical contact with the mage while she was wearing the blade as for kethry caring for him they were certainly hitting it off fairly well tarma was growing used to the soft murmur of voices behind her as they talked for the endless hours of the days ride so maybe just maybe the sword was responding to that liking as the days passed keth she asked when theyd halted for the night in the seventh of a succession of haybams do you remember what the hawkbrother told you when we first met him about need you mean moonsong the adept kethry glanced over at jadrek but the witchlight she was creating showed the archivist already rolled up in a nest of blankets and hay and sound asleep he said a lot of things hai but im thinking theres something that might be pertinent to jadrek kethry nodded slowly about need extending her powers to those i care for uhhuh ive been wondering about that jadrek certainly seems to be in a lot less pain tarma snuggled into the soft hay sword and dagger within easy reach behind her warrl was keeping watch at the door and ironheart and hellsbane were drowsing having stuffed themselves with fresh hay hes not drugging himself as much either and kethry settled into her own bedroll and snuffed the witchlight and hes not the bitter suspicious man we met at the court she said quietly in the darkness i think were seeing the man idra knew tarma beard the hay rustle a bit then kethry continued very softly and i like that man sheenedra so much that i think your guess could be right krethes vestacth unadorned truth i like him he treats me as an intellectual equal and thats rare even among mages that im his physical superior doesnt seem to bother him its just what i am hell never ride bane the way i do or swing a sword ill never be half the linguist he is or beat him at chess sounds like dont go matchmaking on me woman kethry softened the rebuke with a dry chuckle weve got enough on our plate with tracking idra the damned weather and the mage weve got on our backtrail so we are being followed nothing you can do about it my hope is that when he hits the comb hell get discouraged and turn back tarma nodded in the dark this was keths province she wouldnt do either of them any good by fretting about it if it came to physical battle then shed be able to do some good and for whatever the reason jadrek was able to do with less of his drugs every day and that was all to the good they were making about as good a headway with him now as they would have been able to manage alone and maybe she fell asleep before she could finish the thought now they were getting into the comb and as jadrek had warned the comb was no place to be riding through with less than full control of ones senses the range of hills along the northern border called the comb was among some of the worst terrain tarma had ever encountered the hills themselves werent all that high but they were sheer rock faces for the most part with little more than goat tracks leading through them and not much in the way of vegetation just occasional stands of windwarped trees a bit of scrub brush rank grasses and some moss and lichen enough browse for the horses barely and tarma was supplementing the browse with grain just to he on the safe side it had been late spring still winter in the mountains where hawksnest lay when theyd headed down into rethwellan it had been early fall by the time theyd made it to the capital it had been late fall when they bolted now it was winter the worst possible time to be traveling the comb now that they were in the hills the rains had changed to sleet and snow and there were no friendly farmers and no inns to take shelter in when hostile weather made camping a grim prospect and they no longer had the luxury of pressing on when a suitable campsite presented itself they took it if there wasnt anything suitable they suffered theyd been three days with inadequate camps sleeping cold and wet and waking the same kethry had dropped the illusions two days ago there wasnt anybody to see them anymore and when they were on easy stretches of trail tarma could see kethry frowning with her eyes closed and knew she was doing something magical along the backtrail which probably meant she needed to hoard every scrap of personal energy she could jadrek predictably was in worst case tarma wasnt too far behind him in misery and sometimes it seemed to her that their progress was measured in handspans not furlongs the only comfort was in knowing that their pursuers if any were not likely to be making any better progress tarma looked up at the dead gray sky and swore at the scent of snow on the wind kethry urged hellsbane up beside her partner when the trail they were following dropped into a hollow between two of the hills and there was room enough to do so the mage was bundled up in every warm garment she owned on the saddle before her the archivist was an equally shapeless bundle he was nodding only kethrys arms clasped about him kept him in the saddle he had had a very bad night for theyd been forced to camp without any shelter and hed taken the full dosage of his drugs just so that he could mount this morning snow kethry asked unhappily hai damnitall how much more of this is he going to be able to take i dont know skeenedra i dont know how much more of this im going to be able to take im about ready to fall off myself tarma scanned the terrain around her hoping for someplace where they could get a sheltered fire going and maybe get warm again for the first time in four days nothing just crumbling hills overhangs she dared not trust and scrub not a tree not a cave not even a tumble of boulders to shelter in and even as she watched the first flakes of snow began she watched them hoping to see them melting when they hit the ground as so far had always been the case this time they didnt h hellfire keth this stuff is going to stick im afraid the mage sighed it would id witch the weather but id do more harm than good id rather you conjured up a sheltered camp ive tried kethry replied bleakly my energies are at absolute nadir i spent everything i had getting that mage off our trail id cast a jestovath but i need some kind of wall and ceiling to make it work tarma stifled a cough hunched her shoulders against the cold wind and sighed its not like you had any choice no more than we do now lets get on maybe something will turn up but nothing did and the flurries turned to a fullfledged snowstorm before theyd gone another furlong weve got to get a rest tarma said finally as they gave the horses a breather at the top of a hill jadrek how are you doing poorly he replied rousing himself the tone of his voice was dull i need to take more of my medicines and i dare not if i fell asleep in this cold right look theres a bit of a corner down there tarma pointed through the curtaining snow to a culdesac visible just off the main trail it might be sheltered enough to let us get a bit warner and the horses need more than a breather i wont argue kethry replied i can feel bane straining now unspoken was the very real danger that was in all of their minds it was obvious that the snow was falling more thickly with every candlemark it was equally obvious that unless they found a good campsite theyd be in danger of death by exposure if they fell asleep that meant pressing on through the night if they didnt find a secure site this little rest might be the closest to sleep that theyd get tonight and when they got to the culdesac they found evidence of how real the danger was huddled against the boulders of the back was what was left of a man rags and bones mostly the carcass was decades old at least there were no marks of violence on him except that done by scavengers and from the way the bones lay tarma judged hed died of cold poor bastard she said picking up a sword in a halfrotten sheath and turning it over looking for some trace of ownershipmarks helluva way to die kethry was tumbling stones down over the pitiful remains jadrek was doing his best to help is there any good way to die in your own bed in your own time here can you make anything of this jadrek dug into his packs while the women were occupying themselves with the grisly remains theyd found he was aching all over with pain even through the haze of drugs worse he was slowing them down but there was a solution of sorts they didnt need him now and if the weather worsened his presence or absence might mean the difference between life and death for the two partners so he was going to overdose that would put him to sleep if they did find shelter there would be no harm done and he would simply sleep the overdose off but if they didnt if they didnt the cold would kill him painlessly and theyd be rid of an unwieldy burden without him theyd be able to take paths and chances they werent taking now without him they could devote energy to saving themselves he swallowed the bitter herb pellets quickly before they could catch him at it and washed away the bitterness with a splash of icy water from his canteen then he pressed himself up against the sheltered side of kethrys mount trying to leech the heat from her body into his own kethry took the sword from her partner and turned it over the sheath looked as if it had once had metal fittings there were gaping sockets in the pommel and at the ends of the quillions of the sword that had undoubtedly once held gemstones there was no evidence of either now poor bastard might have been a merc down on his luck tarma said thats when you know youre hitting the downward slide when youre selling the decorations off your blade kethry slid the sword a little out of the sheath it resisted with a grating sound although there was no sign of rust on the dull gray blade tarma leaned over her shoulder and scratched the exposed metal with the point of her dagger then snorted at the shiny marks the steel left on the metal of the sword well i feel a little less sorry for him kethry retorted my guess is that he was a thief this was some kind of dress blade but the precious metal and the stones have been stripped from it have to be a dress sword the shinain said in disgust nobody in their right mind would depend on that thing it isnt steel or even crudeforged iron youre right he must have been a thief and probably the pretties were stripped by somebody that came across the body tarma turned back to her inspection of her mares condition and kethry nodded shoving the blade back into its sheath youre right about this thing she agreed metal that soft wouldnt hold an edge for five minutes damn thing is nearly useless that pretty much confirms it the departed wasnt dressed particularly well i doubt hed have much use for a dresssword she started to stick the thing pointdown into the cairn theyd built then moved by some impulse she didnt quite understand put it into her pack instead there was something about that sword something buried below the seeming of its surface something that tasted of magic and if there was magic involved kethry thought vaguely it might be worth saving to look into later neither tarma nor jadrek noticed tarma was checking ironhearts feet and jadrek was pressed up against hellsbanes side with his eyes closed trying to absorb some of the mares warmth into his own body tarma straightened up with a groan well people i hate to say this but kethry and jadrek sighed simultaneously i know kethry replied time to go darkness was falling swiftly and the snow was coming down thicker than ever theyd given up trying to find a campsite themselves tarma had sent warrl out instead that meant they had one less set of eyes to guard them but warrl was the only one who stood a chance of finding shelter for them tarma was leading both horses on a trail this uncertain she wanted it to be her that stumbled or fell not the mares she was cold to the point of numbness and every time hellsbane tripped on the uneven ground she could hear jadrek catching his breath in pain and kethry murmuring encouragement to him tarma was no longer thinking much beyond the next step and all her hopes were centered on the kyree if they didnt find shelter by dawn theyd be so weary that no amount of will could keep them from resting and once resting no amount of foreknowledge would keep them from falling asleep and they would die tarma wondered how many ghosts haunted the comb fools or the desperate lured into trying to thread the rocky hills and falling victim to no enemy but the murderous weather she halflistened to the wind wailing among the rocks above them it sounded like voices the voices of hungry ghosts vengeful ghosts jealous of the living the kinds of ghosts that showed up in the songs of her people now and again who sought only to lure others to their deaths so that they might have company how many fools how many ghosts a white shape loomed up out of the dusk before them blocking the path a vague ivory rider on an ethereal silver horse appearing suddenly and soundlessly out of the snow like a pallid harbinger of cold death lisaeer tarma croaked and dropped the reins of both horses pulling the sword slung at her back in the next instant and wondering wildly if goddessblessed steel could harm a hungry ghost mindmate no warrl jumped down from the hillside to her right to interpose his bulk between her and the spirit mindmate this is help peace upon you lady the voice of the one astride the strange white beast was not that of a spirit nor when tarma allowed a corner of herself to test the feel of him was there any of the tingle she associated with magic the mans voice was not hollow as a spirits normally sounded it was warm deep and held a tinge of amusement your fourfooted friend came looking for aid and we heard his calling i did not mean to startle you tarmas arms shook as she resheathed the blade goddess bless warn a body next time you just about ate six thumbs of steel again your pardon but we could not tell exactly where you were your presences seem rather blurred never mind that kethry interrupted from behind tarma her voice sharp who are you what are you why should we trust you the man did not seem to be taken aback by her words youre wise not to take anything on appearance lady you dont know me but i do know you ive talked to your friend mindtomind and i know who you are and what you wish you can trust me on three counts he and his horse moved in to stand nose to nose with ironheart tarma saw with no little surprise that even in the fading light the beasts eyes were plainly a bright and startling blue firstly that you are no longer in rethwellan you crossed the border some time back and you are in valdemar the enemy on your backtrail will not be able to pass the border nor would i give you to him secondly that the man you seek prince stefansen is valdemars most welcome guest and i will be taking you to him as quickly as your tired beasts can manage and thirdly you can trust me because of my office look were tired we dont know anything about your land and our friend who might is not even halfconscious so that was what was making keths voice sound like she was walking on glass i seem to be making a mess of this the man replied ruefully i am roald one of the heralds of valdemar and you may believe your large hairy friend there that any herald is to be trusted they are mindmate warrl confirmed with more than life there is no such creature as a treacherous herald all right tarma thought worn past exhaustion weve got no chance out here and youve never been wrong before this purface lead on herald roald she said aloud and wearily hoped warrl was right this time too eight tarma clasped her bluegray pottery mug in both her hands and sniffed the spicy rich aroma of the hot wine it contained a trifle warily the stuff was too hot to drink not that she minded the heat of it had warmed the thick clay of the mug and that in turn was warming her hands so that they no longer ached in each separate joint and the heat gave her an excuse to be cautious about drinking it she blinked sleepily at the flames in the fireplace before her trying to muster herself back up to full alertness but she was feeling the heat seeping into her bones and with the heat came relaxation the fire cast dancing patterns of light and shadow up into the exposed roughhewn beams of the square common room and made the various trophies of horns and antlers hung on the polished wooden walls seem to move she didnt want to stir not at all and that had the potential for danger she was wearing bizarrely enough some ofroaids spare clothing all of her own too thoroughly soaked even to bother with a kalenedral in white warrior bless now thats a strange thought roald was the only one of them near to her size off his horse he was scarcely more than a couple of thumblengths taller than tarma and was just as rangythin he was exceedingly handsome in a rugged way with a heavy shock of dark blond hair a neat little beard and eyes as blue as his horses i thought id never be warm again she settled a little more down into her chair and the eiderdown theyd given her to wrap around herself and blinked at the kyree stretched out between her and the flames warrl was fast asleep on the redtiled hearth at her feet having bolted a meal of three rabbits first he trusts them especially roald dare we her chair was set just to one side of the fireplace practically on the hearthstone directly across from her kethry was curled up in a second chair wrapped in eiderdown looking small and unwontediy serious shed been summarily stripped of her wet gear the same as tarma but opted for one of lady mertis soft green wool gowns jadrek had been spirited away as well and regarbed in stefansens warmestheavy brown wool breeches and tunic and knitted shirt if roald hadnt come when he did stareyed we came perilously close to losing him if id known hed taken enough of that painkilling stuff to put him out like that jadrek was pacing the floor beside the two chairs and within the arc of heat and light cast by the fire he limped very badly walking slowly haltingly trying to shake the fog of his medicines from his head so that he could talk coherently again he was moving so stiffly that tarma hurt just watching him i wonder he knew we were in bad trouble when we stopped that last time i wonder if he didnt dose himself on purpose figuring that wed either find shelter and hed be all right or that we wouldnt and while he was unconscious the cold would kill him painlessly and get him out of our hair thats something a clansman might do damnit i like this man and he has no reservations about stefansen and this herald but i do i must stefansens wife mertis that had come as a shock to jadrek that stefansen had actually wedded was seated in another chair a bit farther removed from the fire nursing their monthold son i like her too thats a sweet little one why do i have to distrust these people stefansen who resembled idra to a startling degree except that on a mans face the features that had been harsh for a woman were strong and those that had been handsome were breathtaking was talking quietly with roald the two of them sitting on a pair of chairs theyd pulled up near to mertis a most domestic and harmonious scene if you could ignore the worry in everyones eyes good thing we had jadrek to vouch for us or stefansen might have left us to freeze and be damned to his herald friend he did not like the fact that wed come looking for him out of rethwellan hes still watching me when he thinks im not paying any attention were both like wary wolves at first meeting neither one sure the other isnt going to bite this turned out to be roalds own hunting lodge which since it was not exactly a small dwelling told tarma that whatever else he was the herald was also a man of means it was now the humble abode of the princeinexile his bride of ten months and their infant son valdemar had given stefansen the sanctuary he needed but it was a secret sanctuary the king and queen of valdemar dared not compromise their countrys safety not with rethwellan sharing borders with both themselves and their hereditary enemy karse the wine was cool enough to drink now and tarma had decided she couldnt detect anything dangerous in it she sipped at it letting it soothe her raw throat and ease the cold in the pit of her stomach while she drank she scrutinized mertis again over the edge of the mug tarma watched the gentle woman rocking her son in her arms studying her with the same care shed have spent on the reconnoitering of an enemy camp mertis was not homely by any means but not a raving beauty either she had a sweet soft face frank brown eyes that seemed to demand truth of you wavy sablebrown hair not the land of woman one would expect to captivate an experienced rake like stefansen which meant there was more to her than showed on the surface then again tarma hid a smile with her mug as she thought of the moment when roald had brought them stumbling up to the door of the lodge mertis had been everywhere easing jadrek down from his grip on kethrys saddle helping him to stumble into the warm brightly lit lodge building up the fire with her own hands issuing crisp nononsense orders to her spouse the herald and the two servants of the lodge without regard for rank that just might have been her secret that she had been the only woman to treat stefansen like a simple man a person and not throw herself at his feet panting like a bitch in heat or it might have been a half dozen other things but one was a certainty tarma knew love well enough to recognize it when those two looked at each other and never mind that mertis was scarcely higher in birth than kethry jadrek stefansen called softly catching tarmas attention have you walked yourself out yet id rather you got a nights sleep but roald seems to think we need to talk now not just you two all of us the mercenaries included the herald corrected we all have bits of information that need to be put together into a whole stefansen is looking wary again ill warrant he didnt expect us to be included in this little talk ah well duty calls just for the record tarma said unwinding herself from the eiderdown id tend to agree and the sooner we get to it the less likely one of us will forget some triviality that turns out to be be vital my people say plans like eggs are best at the freshest kethry nodded and got up long enough to turn her chair in a quartercircle so that it faced the room rather than tarma tarma did the same as the men pulled theirs closer and roald brought in a third chair for jadrek mertis left hers where it was but put the baby back in the cradle and leaned forward to catch every word tarma watched the prince his spouse and the herald as covertly but as intently as she could warrl trusted them and shed never known the kyree to be wrong he trusted them enough that hed eaten without checking the food for tampering and was now sleeping as soundly as if he hadnt a worry in the world still there was a first time for everything even for the kyree being deceived theres no sign of the captain here either but that might not mean anything jadrek spoke first outlining what raschar had been doing since stefansens abrupt departure tarma was surprised by the princes reactions he showed a great deal more intelligence and thoughtfulness than rumor had given him credit for he seemed deeply disturbed by the information that raschar was continuing to tax the peasantry into serfdom he looks almost as if hes taking it personally huh for that matter so does mertis and i dont think its an act then tarma and kethry took up the thread telling the little conclave what theyd observed in their week or so at the court and what theyd noted as they passed through the southern grainlands of rethwellan the prince asked more earnest questions of them then and seemed even more disturbed by the answers he plainly did not like kethrys report of the mages lurking in the court and the tale of the attack on jadrek shocked him nearly white and that is not an act tarma decided hes more than shocked hes angry i wouldnt want to be raschar and in front of him right now and finally all three spoke of idra what jadrek knew and what the partners had heard before shed vanished that changed the anger to doubt and to apprehension if she headed here she didnt arrive stefansen said unhappily the firelight flaring up in time to catch his expression of profound disturbance damn it dree and i had our differences not the least of which was that she voted for char but shes the one person in this world that i would never wish any harm on where in hell could she have gotten to if she didnt come here tarma wished at that moment that she could have warrls thoughtreading abilities the prince seemed sincere but it would have been so very easy for idra to have met with an accident once shed crossed into valdemar particularly if stefansen hadnt known about her change of heart he could be using his surprise and dismay at learning that to cover his guilt at the same time all her instincts were saying he was speaking only truth if only i knew she turned her attention to roald he seemed to be both holding himself apart rrom the rest and yet at the same time vitally concerned about all of them goddess even us and he just met us a few hours ago tarma realized with a start and there was a knowledge coming from somewhere near where her goddessbond was seated that told her that this herald was as warrl put it someone to be trusted with more than ones life if stefansen murdered idra hed know she thought slowly i dont know how but somehow hed know and i bet he wouldnt be sharing hearth and home with him i cant see him giving hearthrights to a murderer of any kind much less a kinslayer now i wonderhow much of his worry is for us two and how much is about us after a long silence jadrek said this is not something i ever expected to hear myself saying but whatever has happened to idra i fear her fate is going to have to take second place to what is happening to the kingdom jadrek turned to the prince slowly and with evident pain stefan raschar is a leech on the body of rethwellan tarma could see his eyes now and the open challenge in them you never retracted your oath to your people as crown champion you still have the responsibility of the safety of the kingdom so what are you going to do about the situation jadrek you never were one to pull a blow were you the prince smiled thinly and youre still as blunt as ever you were well let me put it out for us all to stare at do you think i should try to overthrow char you know thats what i think jadrek replied eyes glinting in the firelight he looked alert and alive and a candlemark ago tarma would never have reckoned on his reviving so fast youd be a thousand times better as a king than your brother and i know that was the conclusion your sister came to after seeing him rule for six months roald youve matured youve truly matured a great deal in the time youve been here the herald said thoughtfully i dont know if it was fatherhood or my dubious example but youre not the witling rakehell you were stefan the careless fool you were would have been a worse king than your brother ultimately but the man you are now could be a very good ruler stefansen turned to mertis and stopped dead at a strange hairraising humming tarma felt the tingling of a power akin to the warriors along her spine she glanced sharply at kethry in startlement only to see that the mage wore an equally surprised expression the humming seemed to be coming from the heap of saddlepacks and weaponry theyd dumped just inside the door after mertis had extracted their soiled soaked clothing for cleaning stefansen rose as if in a dream as the rest of them remained frozen in their seats he walked slowly to the shadowed pile reached down and took something in his hands a long narrow something bits of enshrouding darkness began peeling from it and light gleamed where the pieces had fallen away the thing he held was a sword not hers not kethrys a sword in a halfdecayed sheath as the last of the rotten sheath flaked off of it tarma could see from the shape of it that it was the dead mans sword that theyd found and no longer the lifeless dull gray thing it had been in stefansens hands it was keening a wild song and glowing whitehot lighting up the entire room stefansen stood with it in both hands as frozen for a moment as the rest of them were then he dropped it and as it hit the wooden floor with a dull thud the light died and the song with it mother ofthegodsf he exclaimed staring at the blade at his feet what in hell is that jadrek shook his head this is just not to be believed idra pretends to go haring off after the sword that sings then we just happen to stumble on it on a remote trail and just happen to bring it with us archivist i hate to disagree tarma interrupted but its not so much of a coincidence as you might think idra wanted an excuse to go north if shed wanted one to go south i would bet youd have found a different legend but the swords legend says it was stolen and taken north so thats the one you chose theres only one real road through the comb no thief would take that and no fugitive well that left this goattrack we followed i know its the closest path to the real road and ill bet its one of the few that go all the way through no great coincidence there as for the coincidence of us finding the dead thief and of keth taking the sword ill bet he was found a good dozen times or why were the goldwork and the gems gone from the sheath and the pommel but nobody in their right mind would bother taking a blade that wouldnt cut butter and weve been stopping in every likely sheltered spot so its small wonder that we ran across him and his booty but i would be willing to stake ironheart that no mage ever ran across the body mages can sense energies even quiescent ones right keth thats true kethry corroborated i knew there was something about it but i didnt have the strength to spare to deal with it right then so i did what most mages would do i packed it up to look into it later if there was a later besides knowing how these magepurposed things work i would say that the sword might well have known where it was going it could well have told me to bring it here and the sword once it sensed you were wavering on making a bid for the throne made itself known mertis concluded wryly it appears stefansen said ruefully that i dont have any choice no more than i did my friend roald replied with a chuckle and a smile no more than i did but stefansen sagged and his face took on an expression of despair this is utterly hopeless you know he said just how am i supposed to get back the crown when my only allies are a baby an outlander three women a forgive me jadrek halfcrippled scholar an outsized beast and a sword thats likely to betray me by glowing and singing every time i touch it i really dont see why youre already giving up roald chided thrones have been overturned with less what do you really need for a successful rebellion for a start you need someone who knows where each and every secret lies jadrek said sitting up straighter his eyes shining with enthusiasm someone who knows which person can be bought and what his price is which person can be blackmailed and who will serve out of either love or duty i havent been sitting in the corners of the court being ignored all these years without learning more than a few of those things we could infiltrate the capital disguised kethry said surprising her partner magical disguises if we have to no one will know us then jadrek can tell me who are the ones he wants contacted if we can get one of us into the court itself we could pass messages arrange meetings i know tarma could go in as a man with an absolute minimum of disguising all physical so weve thrown in with this lot have we sheenedra is it the cause that attracts you or the fact that its jadreks cause but since kethry had added herself to the little conspiracy tarma added her own thought in spite of her better judgment huh yes if we can figure something that would put me into the court without suspicion challenge the current champion of the kings guard to combat mertis put in surprising tarma considerably thats anyones right if they want to get in the guard free swords do it all the time theres nothing out of the ordinary about it if you do well youve got a place if you beat him you automatically become head of the guard that would put you at raschars side every day you couldnt get any closer to the heart of the court than that stefansen looked doubtfully at the lean swordswoman challenge the champion has she got a chance still not sure you trust us hmm my lad i cant say as i blame you im still not entirely sure of you but mertis smiled and tarma sensed that the gentleseeming lady had a good set of claws beneath her velvet if half the tales ive heard about the shinain swordsworn are true shell have his place before he can blink and right at raschars side is the place we could best use you swordlady it became evident to tarma that guileless mertis was no stranger to intrigue as the evening wore on and the plan began to look more and more as if it had a strong chance of success in fact it was she who turned to roald and asked bluntly and what is valdemar prepared to grant us besides sanctuary roald blinked once and replied as swiftly what will valdemar get in return alliance in perpetuity if we succeed stefansen said my word on that and you know my word is more than good thank you for that you know very well that you could use an ally that shares a border with karse you also know weve stayed neutral in that fight and you know damned well that char would never change that policy i will ill ally with you unconditionally more ill pledge valdemar favor for favor should you ever choose to call it in and ill swear it on the sword that will bind every legal heir to the pledge for as long as the sword is used to choose rulers roald let out his breath slowly and raised his eyebrows well thats a lot more than i expected but you know we dont dare do anything openly so that means covert help his brow wrinkled in thought for a moment what about this every rebellion needs finances and arms those i think i can promise kethry looked rather outraged tarma was just perplexed who exactly was this herald kethry took the question right out of her mouth just what power is yours that you can fulfill those promises kethry asked with angry cynicism its damned easy to promise things you know you wont have to supply just to get us off your backs and out of your kingdom stefansen looked as if kethry had blasphemed the gods of his house mertis jaw dropped i think keth just put her foot in it tarma thought seeing their shocked reaction to what seemed to be a logical question something tells me that herald means more than royal mouthpiece around here he roald is the heir to the throne of valdemar mertis managed to stammer your highness i am sorry tarma nearly lost her own jaw and kethry turned pale insulting a member of a royal house like that had been known to end with a summary execution its i who should beg pardon kethry said shaken iive heard too many promises that werent fulfilled lately and i didnt want jad my friends i mean counting on something that wouldnt ever happen your highness oh bright havens roald interrupted her looking profoundly embarrassed highness my eye how could i have been insulted by honesty besides we arent all that much sticklers about rank in the heraldic circle half the time i get worse insults than that and how were you to know you dont even know what a herald of valdemar is he shrugged then grinned and i dont know what a swordsworn is so were even look the law of valdemar is that every monarch must also be a herald our companions choose us rather like that musical sword of stefans both father and mother are heralds which makes them coconsorts so until they seek the havens may that take decades im not all that important and i act pretty much as any other herald the only difference is that i have a few more powers like being able to make promises in the name of the throne to my friend and know my parents will see that those promises are met now about those arms tarma was profoundly troubled kethry had thrown herself in with these people as if she had known them all her life but it was the shinains way to be rather more suspicious than her oathsister or at least more than kethry was evidencing at the moment she needed to think alone and undisturbed and maybe ask for some advice she let the folds of the eiderdown fall to her sides and stood up four sets of eyes gave her startled glances kethrys included i need to clear my head she said shortly if youll excuse me i think id like to go outside for a little in the dark in a snowstorm jadrek blurted astounded are you he subsided at a sharp look from kethry swordlady the herald said quietly but looking distinctly troubled you and the others are guests in my home you are free to do whatever you wish you will find a number of cloaks hanging in the entry and i am certain an old campaigner like you needs no admonitions to take care in a storm she followed the direction of his nod to the darkened end of the hall past the door there she found herself in an entryway lit by a single small lantern as he had said there were several cloaks hanging like the shadows of great wings from pegs near the outer door she took the first one that came to her hand one made of some kind of heavy thick fur and went out into the dark and cold outside the storm was dying the snow was back to being a thin veil and she could see the gleaming of the new moon faintly through the clouds she was standing on some kind of sheltered raised wooden porch the snow had been swept from it and there was a open clearing beyond it she paced silently down the stairs and out into the untrampled snow her footsteps making it creak underfoot until she could no longer feel the lodge looming so closely at her back trees and bushes made black and white hummocks in front of her and to both sides fitful moonlight on the snow and reflected through the clouds gave just enough light to see by she felt unwatched alone this spot would do and by sheer stroke of fortune south lay directly before her she took three deep breaths of the icy sharpedged air and raised her head then still with her back to the building she lifted her eyes to the furtive glow of the moon and throwing the cloak back over her shoulders spread her arms wide her hands palm upward she felt a little uncomfortable this wasnt the sort of thing she usually did she was not accustomed to making use of the side of her that as kalenedral was also priestess but she needed answers from a source she knew she could trust and the leshyae kalenedral would not be coming to her here unless she called to them she fixed her gaze on that dimly gleaming spot among the clouds seeking but not walking the moonpaths within moments her trained will had brought her into trance in this exalted state all sensation of cold of weariness was gone she was no longer conscious of the passing of time nor truly of her body and once she had found the place where the moonpaths began she breathed the lesser of the warriors true names that murmur of meaning on the moonpaths should bring one of her teachers in short order from out of the cold night before her came a wind redolent of sunscorched grasslands or endless baking days and nights of breathless heat it circled tarma playfully as the moonglow wavered before her eyes the night grew lighter she tingled from head to toe as if lightning had taken the place of her blood she felt rather than heard the arrival of someone by the quickening of all life around her and the sudden surge of pure power she lowered her hands and her eyes expecting to see one of her hands the spiritkalenedral that were the teachers of all living kalenedral to see that the radiant figure before her glowing faintly within a nimbus of soft light appeared to be leshyae kalenedral but was unveiled her body that of a young almost sexless woman a woman of the shinain with golden skin sharp features and ravenblack hair a swordsworn garbed and armed from head to toe in unrelieved black and whose eyes were the featureless darkness of a starry night sky lacking pupil or iris the stareyed herself had answered to tarmas calling and was standing on the snow not five paces from her a faint smile on her lips at tarmas start of surprise my beloved jelenedra do you value yourself so little that you think i would not come to your summons especially when you call upon me so seldom her voice was as much inside tarmas head as falling upon her ears and it was so musical it went beyond song lady i tarma stammered peace sword of my forging i know that your failure to call upon me is not out of fear but out of love and out of the will to rely upon your own strength as much as you may that is as it should be for i desire that my children grow strong and wise and adult and not weakly dependent upon a strength outside their own and that is doubly true of my kalenedral who serve as my eyes and my hands tarma gazed directly into those otherworldly eyes into the deep and fathomless blackness flecked with tiny dancing diamondpoints of light and knew that she had been judged and not found wanting bright star i need advice she said after a pause to collect her thoughts as you know my mind and heart you know i cannot weigh these strangers i want to help them i want to trust them but how much of that is because my oathsister comes to their calling how much do i deceive myself to please her the warm wind stirred the black silk of her hair as she turned those depthless eyes to gaze at some point beyond tarmas shoulder for a moment then she smiled i think jelenedra that your answer comes on its own feet two and four two feet could mean kethry but four warrl snow crunched behind tarma but she did not remove her gaze from the warriors shining face only when the newcomers had arrived to stand shoulder to shoulder with her did she glance at them out of the tail of her eye and froze with shock on her right stood or rather knelt since he fell immediately to one knee and bowed his head the herald roald his white cloak flaring behind him in her wind like great wings of snow on tarmas left was the strange blueeyed horse tarma felt her breath catch in her throat with surprise but this was only to be the beginning of her astonishment the horse continued to pace slowly forward and as he did so he almost seemed to blur and shimmer much as tarmas spiritteachers sometimes did as if he were as they were not entirely of this world then he stopped and stood quietly when the warrior laid her hand gently upon his neck he gleamed with all the soft radiance of the hidden moon plainly surrounded by an aura of light that was dimmer but not at all unlike hers rise chosen it is not in me to be pleased with subservience she said to the herald who obeyed her at once rising to stand silently and worshipfiilly at tarmas shoulder vai datha so young princeling your land forges white swords that fit the same sheath as my black eh she laughed soundlessly looking from roald to tarma and back again such a pretty pair you make like moon and cloud day and night bright and dark how an artist would die for such a sight two such opposites and yet so much the same it was only then that tarma saw that the white clothing she had been wearing had been transmuted to the warriors own ebony as was proper for kalenedral and you my gentle child she continued caressing the white horses shining neck are ushyae kalenedral of another sort hmm like my hands and unlike perhaps to complete the set i should see if any of my children would become as you what think you should there be sable companions to match the silver the look the horse no companion bent upon her was one of reproach she laughed again not well it was but a thought but this is well met and well met again this is a good land yours it deserves good servants strong defenders vigilant champions to guard it and hold it safe as my hands hold mine do we not all serve to drive back the dark each in his own fashion so i cry well met children of my other self she turned that steady regard back to tarma are you answered my cautious one tarma bowed her head briefly rilled with such relief that she was nearly dizzy with it and filled as suddenly with an understanding of exactly what and who this herald and his companion were i am answered bright star then let white sword and black serve as they are meant to cleave the true darkness and not each other as you each feared might befall there was another breath of hot wind a surging of power that left tarmas eyes dazzled and she was gone the herald closed his eyes briefly and let out the breath he had been holding in a great sigh as the horse returned to stand beside him he opened his eyes again and turned to face tarma forgive me for doubting you even a little he said his voice and the hand he extended to her trembling slightly but i followed you out here because for the same reason i would have followed you had our positions been reversed tarma interrupted clasping the hand he stretched out i wasnt expecting her when i called but i think i know now why she came both of us have had our doubts settled havent we brother his hold on her hand was warm and steady and his smile was unwavering and equally warm i think more than settled sister she caught his other hand they stood facing each other with hands clasped in hands for a very long time savoring the moment there was nothing even remotely sexual about what they shared in that timeless space just the contentment and love of soulsib meeting soulsib something akin to what tarma had for kethry and she realized with all the knowledge that passed to her from her goddess in her moment of enlightenment what this herald shared with his companion for it was no horse that stood beside roald and she wondered now how she could have ever thought that it was another soulsib and how odd even the heralds dont know exactly what their companions are it was roald who finally sighed and let the moment pass i fear he said dropping her hands reluctantly that if we dont get back to the others soon theyll think weve either frozen to death or gotten lost or tarma laughed giving his shoulders a quick embrace before pulling her cloak back around herself murdered each other out here by the way she stretched out her arm showing him that the tunic she wore was still the black of a starless night i wonder how were going to explain what happened to the clothing i borrowed he laughed long and heartily be damned if i know maybe they wont notice right not likely oh well ill think of something but you owe me swordlady that was my secondbest set of whites before you witched it tarma joined his laughter as snow crunched under their boots come to the dhorisha plains when this is over and ill pay you in shinain horses and shinain gear it will break their artistic hearts but i think i can persuade some of my folk to make you a set of unadorned kalenedral white silks havens lady you tempt my wandering feet far too much to be denied you have a bargain he grinned taking the porch steps two at a time and flinging open the door for her with a flourish ill be at your tent flap someday when you least expect it waiting to collect and unlikely as it seemed she somehow had the feeling that he would one day manage to do just that nine it was difficult but by no means impossible to pull energies from the sleeping earth in midwinter all it took was the skill and time and patience and kethry had those in abundance and further she had serious need of any mote of mageenergy she could harbor against the future as well as any and all favors she could bank with the otherplanar allies she had acquired in her years as a white winds sorceress she had not had much chance to stockpile either after the end of the sunhawks last commission and the journey here had left her depleted down to her lowest ebb since she and tarma had first met so she was not in the least averse to spending as much time in the hidden lodge with stefansen and mertis as the winter weather made necessary she had a fair notion of the magnitude of the task awaiting them she and jadrek and tarma might well be unequal to it in fact she had come to the conclusion that they would need resources she did not have yet on a lighter note she was not at all displeased about being forced to spend so much time in jadreks company not in the least she was sitting crosslegged on the polished wooden floor next to the fireplace slowly waking her body up after being in trance for most of the day jadrek was conversing earnestly with roald both of them in chairs placed where the fire could warm him and she could study him through halfslitted eyes at her leisure jadrek seemed so much happier these days well small wonder stefansen respected him mertis admired him tarma allowed him to carry her off to interrogate in private at almost any hour she was willing to answer most of his questions about the mysterious at least to the folk of rethwellan nomad shinain roald did him like courtesy about the equally mysterious heralds of valdemar both of them accorded him the deference due a serious scholar warrl practically worshiped at his feet jadreks ability to hear the beast being in no wise abated and he seemed to share tarmas feeling of comradeship with the kyree being given the respect he was in all sober truth due had done wonders for his state of mind as the days passed the lines of bitterness around his mouth were easing into something more pleasant he smiled and often and there was no shadow of cynicism in it he laughed and there was no hint of mockery physically he was probably in less pain than he had been for years which kethry was quite sure was due to needs healing abilities need was exerting her magic for a man because he was important to kethry for kethry had no doubt as to how she felt about the archivist if there was ever going to be one man for her jadrek was that man all the men ive known she thought with a touch of wry humor and all the men ive been courted by boggles the mind mages fighters some of them damned good looking good lord if you were to count thalhkarsh ive even been propositioned by a godling and who is it that attracts me like no one else ever has a scholar half again my age who i could probably break in half if i put my mind to it with no recourse to need required like all those weirdling things out of the pelagirs roald finished except that this thing seems impossible to kill the pelagirs jadrek exclaimed perplexed but i thought you said this thing was seen north of lake evendim it was right in the heart of the pelagir hills wait a moment jadrek said rummaging in the pile of clutter under his chair and hunting up a piece of scraped vellum and a bit of charcoal all right heres the lake your pelagirs are where up here the herald took the charcoal from him and sketched huh jadrek studied the sketch thoughtfully we have a range of hills we call the pelagirs too here well i will be dipped for a sheep fairly obvious now that we have the information isnt it jadrek said with a grin your pelagirs and ours are the same except that your inland sea cuts off the tail of the range leaving it isolated from the rest up in your northwest corner and now that i know thats true i think i know what your manbeast is assuming ive got the description right four arms twice manheight face like a boar and taloned hands no sign of genitals nipples or navel and the color of clay thats it its a krashak a magemade construct virtually immortal and indestructible you can name it can you tell us how to get rid of it roald pleaded oddly enough yes its a funny thing but high magick seems curiously vulnerable to earth magick and with all the mages hanging about char i took to looking for spellbreakers it will take courage but if you can get in close to the thing without it seizing you and throw a mixture of salt moly and ladys star into its eyes and mouth it will literally fall apart he coughed coloring a little with embarrassment i know it sounds like a peasant superstition but it does work i found a mage i could trust and asked him now ii always carry some with me roald only looked impressed havens how long did you have to look before you found that out jadrek flushed this time with pleasure well i got the first hint of it from a translation of grindels discourses on unnatural history the orwind translation or the quenta the orwind their voices sank again and kethry lost the thread of their conversation it didnt much matter she was more interested in watching jadrek in an unguarded mood oh that mind i dont think anything ever escapes him and for all that hes been treated badly he so enjoys people such a vital spirit in that flawed body hes so alive and damn it i windbom he makes me so shameless that i feel like a cat in heat around him i want to purr and cuddle up against him gods i am bloody well infatuated if he so much as raised an eyebrow in invitation at me id warm his bed in a minute unfortunately he seemed blissfully unaware of that fact so far as she could tell oh well as for tarma from the moment she had reentered the hall arm in arm with roald stefansen and mertis accepted her without reservation and that meant that mertis was only too happy to let her play nursemaid to little megrarthon whenever she wished which was most of the time and which was precisely what she was doing at this very moment shes as happy as jadrek kethry mused for that matter so is the baby just look at her tarma was cuddling the happily cooing child in her blackclad arms her expression a soft and warm one that few besides kethry had ever seen the hands that had killed so often and without remorse were holding the little one as gently as if he were made of down and spun glass the harsh voice that had frightened many an errant fighter into instant obedience was crooning a monotonous lullaby shed be happiest surrounded by a dozen small ones or two or three dozen and they know it children know it somehow ive never seen one run from her not even in the midst of a housetohouse battle more often than not they run to her and rightly shed die to protect a child when this is over when this is over i swear well give this up win or lose well refound her clan for her and to the nether hells with my school if thats what it takes ill spend the rest of my life as a hedgewizard and shinain horsebreeaer if i have to while she watched tarma put the nowslumbering child back in his cradle rose stretching like a cat then began heading for the fire the two men at hearthside turned at the soft sound of her footstep and smiled as one she saw the smiles and returned their grins with a goodnatured shake of her head and what are you two smirking about she asked clasping her hands behind her and detouring slightly to stroll over to them her lithe thin body seeming almost to move fluidly bonelessly the rest has done her good too shes in better shape than shes been in months years trying to imagine you as a man darksib roald teased using the pet name hed invented for her put a youngling around you and youd give yourself away in a breath hah im a better actor than that but as to that she paused before them crossed her arms and frowned a little you know we really ought to be getting on with it raschar isnt sitting back not likely hes consolidating his power you can bet on it we had better be safely in place before he gets himself so ensconced on the throne that therell be no dislodging him without an army kethry felt the last of her muscles emerge into wakefulness and began uncoiling from her position in the hearthcomer the sleeper awakes roald noted not sleeper she corrected imitating tarmas long stretch ive been listening while i was coming out of trance and loath though i am to leave in agreement with tarma im at full power now tarma and jadrek have recovered its time to go she half expected jadrek to protest but he too nodded if we dont go now he opined gravely stefan wont have a kingdom to come back to but i do have one excellent question this plan of ours calls for tarma to replace the champion and you can bet that char wont let a shinain within a spears cast of him now so to truly ensure her safety that means a full magical disguise with all the mages in the court how are you going to hide the fact that tarmas bespelled they wont let anyone with a smell of magic on him compete with the kings champion you know tarma raised an interrogative eyebrow at her the thought had occurred to me too she said every trialbycombat that ive ever seen has specifically forbidden any kind of magic taint even lucky amulets well ill answer that in an hour kethry replied why in an hour because thats how long it will take me to try a full adept manifestation and see if it succeeds or fails kethry didnt want an audience not for this not even tarma so she took one of the fur cloaks and went out into the snowladen scrub forest until she found a little clearing that was far enough from the lodge that she couldnt see or sense the building or the people within it the weather was beautiful the air was utterly still the sky a deepening blue the sun beginning its downward journey into the west there would be no better time than now a mage of the white winds school was tested by no one except himself with a series of spells marking the rise in ability from apprentice to journeyman from journeyman to master and from master to adept a mage could attempt these spells whenever he chose and as many times as he chose they would only work when he was truly ready the series was constructed so that the power granted by each was used to fuel the spell for the next a little like priming a pump i suppose and if you dont have faith that youre ready you cant bear to waste the power i feel ready kethry decided well she initiated the journeyman spell gathering her own strictly personal power about her like a cloak and calling the lesser wind of fire and earth the stable elements it chose to come out of the south always a good omen and whirled about her three times leaving more power than it took to call it she fairly glowed with energy now even to normal eyes next the master spell and the greater wind of air and water the mutable elements the mutables were much harder to control than the stable elements she raised her hands high over her head and whispered the words of the spell as she formed the energy left by the first with her will into the mageshapes called the cup and the mill concentrating with all her soulcalling but not coercing this time the wind came from all four directions and melded into a gentle whirlwind around her a wind that sang and sparkled with unformed power when it too had circled her three times she was surrounded by a shell of light and force that shifted and changed moment by moment opalescing with every color that the mind could conceive she drew a deep breath and launched herself fearlessly into the spell of adept manifestation calling the white wind itself the wind of the five elements it required the uttermost of any mage that dared it she must take the power granted her by the first two spells and all of her own and weave it into an intricate new shape with her will and the power fought back resisting the change to itself twisting and twining in her mental hands simultaneously she must sing the words of the spell controlling tone tempo and cadence to within a hairsbreadth of perfection and she must keep her mind utterly empty of all other thought but the image of the form she strove to build she dared not even allow a moment to contemplate failure or fail she would one mistake and the power would vanish escaping with the agility of a live thing she finished she held her breath there was one moment of utter quietude as time and all time governed ceased and she wondered had she failed and then the white wind came it fountained up out of the ground at her feet as she spread her arms wide growing into a geyser of power and light and music that surrounded her and permeated her until all she could see and hear and feel was the light and the force she felt the power fill her mind and give her soul great wings of fire it was sundown when she stepped back through the door tarma had plainly expected her to be exhausted and was openly astonished to see that she wasnt it worked she said with quiet rapture still held by the lingering exaltation and just a little giddy with the intoxication of all that power flowing through her it did tarma asked eyebrows arching toward her hairline as jadrek and roald approached with avid curiosity plain on their faces ill prove it to you kethry cupped her hands together concentrating on the space enclosed there when the little wisp of roseate force she called into her hands had finished whirling and settled into a steady glow she began whispering to it telling it gently what she asked of it in the ancient language of the white winds sorcerers while she chanted stefansen and mertis joined the little group surrounding kethry on all sides she just smiled and nodded and continued whispering to her sorcerous captive then she let it go with joy as a child releases a butterfly and no longer with the wrench of effort the illusionspell used to cause her she was an adept now and forces that she had been incapable of reaching were hers to command from this moment on not carelessly no and not casually but never again unless she chose to would she need to exhaust her own strength to cast a spell with such energies at her command the illusionspell was as easy as lighting a candle the faintly glowing globe floated toward tarma who watched it with eyes gone round in surprise the shinains eyes followed it although the rest of her remained absolutely motionless as the powerglobe rose over her head then it thinned into a faint rosy mist and settled over the swordswornan like a veil the veil clung to her for a moment hiding everything but a vague shape within its glowing cloudy interior then it was gone and where tarma had been there stood a young man of no recognizable racial type he had a harsh stubborn unshaven face marked with two scars one running from his right cheek to his chin the other across his left cheek his nose had been broken in several places and had not healed straight at any time his hair was dirty brown shoulderlength and curled his eyes were muddy green he was at least a handsbreadth taller than tarma had been and correspondingly broader in the shoulders and that was a new thing indeed for before this kethry had never been abfe to change size or general shape in her illusion spells even tarmas clothing had changed from her shinain kalenedral silks to rough homespun and tattered leather the only similarity between tarma and this man was that both carried their swords slung across their backs bright havens breathed roald how did you do that tarma studied her hands and arms wonder in her untannalike eyes tiny scars made a lacework of white across the hands and as far up the arms as could be seen beneath the homespun sleeves they were broad strong hands and as dissimilar to tarmas fineboned long ones as could be imagined kethry smiled magic she said and how do you keep chars mages from seeing that magic stephansen asked kethry just smiled a little more what else more magic the spell only an adept can control the spell that makes magic undetectable and invisible even to the best magesight tarma was back to looking like herself again and feeling a good deal happier as a result as they rode out me next morning jadrek had his own horse now a gentle palfrey that had belonged to mertis a sweettempered bay gelding with a gait as comfortable as any beast tarma had ever encountered he also had some better medicines more effective and far less dangerous than his old courtesy of a valdemaren healer roald brought to the lodge himself after jadrek had had a particularly bad night kethry had augmented the protection of his traveling cloak with another spell she had not been able to cast until she reached adept level jadrek would ride warm now no matter what the weather tarma had turned down kethrys offer to do the same for her she wanted no spells on her that might betray her to a magicsniffing mage if she needed to go scouting but roald had managed to round up enough coldweather gear for all of them to keep them protected even without spellcasting they were far better prepared this time for their journey as they rode away from the lodge on a clear sparkling dawn just before midwinter they felt and to some extent acted like adolescents on holiday if the weather turned sour they simply put up their little tent kethry cast a jestovath on it and they whiled away the time talking when the weather was fair while they never completely dropped vigilance they tended to rely mostly on warrls senses while they enjoyed the view and the company beneath their ease was the knowledge that this holiday would be coming to an end once they broke out of the comb and there was a definite edge of cherish the moment while you have it to their cheer an ice storm had descended on them but youd never have known it inside their little tent outside the wind howled inside it was as warm as spring sunshine this was a far cry from the misery of their earlier journey on this same path jadrek was still not capable of sitting crosslegged on the tent floor the way the two women were doing but theyd given him more than enough room to stretch out and the bedrolls and packs to use as cushioning and props and he was reasonably comfortable better than ive been in ages he thought wonderingly better than than since i took that fever as a child and started having trouble with my poor bones afterward thats been twenty almost thirty years he watched his quest companions through slitted sleepy eyes marveling how close he had come to them in the space of a few short weeks tarma the strong arm so utterly without a conscience when it comes to certain choices brave lady bless braver than anyone i could have imagined as honorbound as anyone i know the outside so cold the inside so warm so caring im not surprised really that once she and roald got the measure of each other they hit it off so well that they began calling each other darksib and brightsib theres a great deal about her that is like the heralds ive known the kyree at tarmas back sighed and flicked his tail warrl if for no other reason than to have come to know something about his kind id treasure this quest if all kyree are like him i dont wonder that they have little to do with humankind there arent many around like tarma and i cant imagine warrl mindmating to anyone that didnt have her sense of honor and her profound compassion kethry was unbraidmg and combing out her amber hair it caught the light of the jestovath on the tent walls and glowed with the warmth of a young sun jadrek felt his heart squeeze keth kethry kethryveris lady lady how is it you make me feel like a stripling again and i have no hope no right to feel this way about you when this mad scheme of ours is over some stalwart young warrior will come and your eyes and heart will kindle and hell carry you off and ill never see you again why should you find a mind attractive enough to put up with a crippled aging body im half again your age why is it that when were talking you make me feel no age at all or every age how is it that you challenge my mind as well as my heart how did you make me come alive again he stifled a sigh enjoy it while it lasts old man he told himself trying not to be too bitter about it the end is coming all too soon as it happened the end came sooner than they had anticipated kethry frowned and broke off her teasing in midsentence keth tarma asked giving ironheart the signal to slow theres oh windborn i thought id thrown that bastard off kethry looked angry and frightened a gust of wind pulled her hood off and she didnt even bother to replace it the mage tarma guessed as jadrek brought his horse up alongside theirs the mage hes better than i thought hes waiting for us right where the path breaks out of the hills ambush kethry frowned again and closed her eyes searching the site with magesenses no she said finally no i dont think so hes just waiting in the open and hes got all his defenses up hes challenging me tarma swore and no way past him as he probably damn well knows kethry looked at her soberly reining in hellsbane sheenedra you arent going to like this probably not what if we charge him you mages seem to have a problem with physical opposition to magical defenses on that narrow path he could take us all and in no way are we going to be able to sneak past him not with jadrek im going to have to challenge him to a duel arcane what hes an adept i can tell that from here if i issue adepts challenge hell have to answer it or lose his status and youve been adept how long hell eat you for lunch better he eats me alone than all of us we cant just think of ourselves now stefan is depending on us if tarma he wont take me without a fight and if i go down it wont be alone you can find another mage to disguise you once we get into rethwellan i become the superfluous member of the party youre not going down tarma choked as jadrek tightened his mouth into a thin line i dont plan on it kethry said wryly im just telling you what to do if it happens contract my love tarmas face went cold and expressionless her heart stopped this is professional right they lived by the mercenary code and would die by it probably and by that code you didnt argue with the terms or the contract once youd agreed to it kethry nodded this is the job weve contracted for were not being paid in money but weve got to do our jobs tarma nodded you win i stopped trying to keep you wrapped in wool a long time ago im not going to start up again lets do it and she kicked ironheart into a canter with kethry warrl and jadrek following behind ive got to do this kethry thought countering her fear with determination if i dont hell kill them i might escape but i could never shield all four of us not even at adept level i havent tapped into enough of the shielding spells to know how yet but he doesnt know im adept and there arent that many white winds mages around i might well be able to surprise him with a trick or two she kicked hellsbane and sent her galloping past tarma up the slope of the barren hill before them knowing that she would have to reach the waiting magician first and issue her challenge before he caught sight of the others otherwise he would blast first and ask questions after her move took both tarma and the mage by surprise for she was able to top the rise and send up the challenge signal before either tarma or her foe had a chance to react the mage waiting below her was one of the ones shed seen wandering about raschars court a thin man dark of hair and eye he was cleanshaven which made it all the easier to note his sardonic expression and he wore his hair loose and shoulder length now he wore his magerobes whatever his school was it was one kethry didnt recognize the robes were a dull red and banded and embroidered in dark brown like hers they were split front and back for ease in riding the chestnut gelding he straddled appeared tired and drained and stood quietly with head down as he sat with his reins loose a challenge he called incredulously youd challenge me why in the names of the seven should i even bother with you girl as answer she called up her adept manifestation from her body rose the misty golden form of a hawk twenty feet tall with fiery wings a hawk that mantled at him and opened its beak in a silent screech of defiance i challenge you adept to adept she called coldly you will answer such a challenge you have no choice he called up his manifestation a winged snake with scales and wing membranes that glistened in shades of green and blue calling it was his formal answer to her formal challenge now they were both bound to the duel youre a fool you know that he said matteroffactly dismounting and letting his manifestation fade away you cant have been an adept for very long ive been one for ten years you cant hope to beat me by this time tarma jadrek and warrl had reached her on the crest of the hill kethry unbuckled need feeling strangely naked without the blade and passed her to tarma hold her for me nothings allowed in the circle but ourselves she said watching as the other mage took up a stand near the center of the tiny barren windswept valley and put up his half of the magical dome that would only be dispelled by the death or defeat of one of them then she allowed her manifestation to dissipate and leapt down from hellsbanes saddle striding purposefully to take her stand opposite him that remains to be seen she answered him locking all emotion down and replying with absolute calm so let it begin with those words the dome of magepower sealed leaving the others helpless witnesses outside for a long moment the combatants stood simply watching each other tarma took advantage of the lull to order jadrek to station himself and warrl on the dividing line between the two mages and on the side of the dome opposite hers warrl has some tricks i expect you might too she said distantly trying to think like a mage i dont trust this bastard not to cheat well keth wont either i dont doubt shes expecting something but if anything should happen ill do what i can jadrek promised anxiously taking out his little bag of herbs and salt from his pocket then replacing it itit isnt likely to be much but jadrek ive seen a slung stone bring down a king she frowned in thought we should split up if something does go bad you and warrl go for keth ill go for the mage he cant know how need works he cant know that in my hands she protects from sorcery ill be safe from anything he can throw and ill keep him off your tail now quick before they start to do anything he limped to the opposite side of the dome tarma could see him dimly through the red energyhaze warrl crouched beside him ready to spring in an instant tarma unsheathed the bespelled sword called need and took her own stance blade point down in the earth both of her hands resting on the pommel feet slightly apart she was ready just in time for within the dome of hazy red the battle was joined in earnest from the body of the stranger came a mansized version of his manifestation flying upward to the top of the dome kethrys met it halfway serpent struck at hawk and was deflected hawk tried to seize serpent in its talons but the serpent wriggled free then the snake tried to wrap itself around the hawks body and neck the hawk struck with beak and talon the serpent let go both buffeted each other with punishing wingblows the battle rained glowing scales feathers and droplets of fluid all of which vanished before they touched the ground both manifestations froze for an instant then plummeted groundward hawk with eyes glazing and fang marks in its chest serpent with one wing ripped from its body both thinned to mist and were gone before either struck the ground round one a draw tarma thought to herself shifting her weight to relieve muscles that had tensed and feeling a tiny pebble roll out from under her foot within the dome appeared two smaller domes each covering a mage then all the fury of all the lightning storms tarma had ever witnessed rolled into one broke loose within the greater dome lightning struck again and again on the two shields seeking weak spots it crawled over the surface of the little domes or rolled itself into balls that circled the perimeters without finding entrance and all in complete silence that was the truly frightening and eerie part tarmas eyes were dazzled to the point of having trouble seeing when the lightning finally died to nothing and the lesser domes vanished as tarma blinked away the spots interfering with her vision she tried to assess the condition of both kethry and her erstwhile rival they both seemed equally tired round two another draw kethry might have looked tired but she also looked slightly pleased maybe a draw is good warrior bless i hope so even more encouraging the other mage looked slightly worried kethry initiated the next round throwing literally daggers of light at the redrobed sorcerer daggers which he had to deflect dodge or absorb he returned in kind but he was not as good in this contest as kethry his blades tended to go awry hers never failed to reach their mark and frequently hit where they hit they left real wounds wounds that smoked and bled the red mage managed to keep from being hit anywhere vital but the daggers were taking a steady toll after being hit one too many times he suddenly threw up his hands and a wall of flame sprang up in front of him a wall that devoured the daggers when they reached it the fire grew until it reached the top of the dome cutting him off from kethry arms of flame began to lick from the wall reaching toward her fighting fire with fire might not work here keth tarma thought biting her lip a little you could both end up scorched by your own powers but kethry chose not to fight with fire but with air a whirlwind a manhigh tornado of milky white sprang up in front of her sucking in those reaching arms of flame and every time it ate one of those arms it grew a little larger finally it reached nearly to the top of the dome and it began to move on the redrobed mage and his fiery protective wall stareyed if it got bigger just by eating a couple of licks of flame whatll it do when it hits the firemother evidently the same thought occurred to the mage for his eyes had gone whiterimmed with panic he backed into the restraining wall of the protective dome then began shouting and waving his hands wildly and a twicemansized thing rose from the barren earth behind kethry no oh no that bastard he had that thing hidden there hes had this planned from the start tarma recognized the krakash the mageconstruct from jadreks descriptions she started to sprint for the edge of the dome even knowing she wouldnt be able to pass it kethry turned to meet it first making frantic motions with her hands then groping for a blade she did not have the thing reached for her with the two upper arms missing but raking her from neck to knee with its outsized talons she collapsed clutching herself with pain it seized her as she fell with the lower two of its four arms it lifted her as she fought to get free and broke her back across its knee as a man would break a dry branch no tarma heard her own voice crying the word in anguish but it didnt seem to belong to her the whirlwind died to a stirring of dust on the ground the dome thinned to red mist and vanished tarmas mind and heart were paralyzed but her body was not she reacted to the disaster as she had planned charging the mage at a dead run while jadrek sprinted fearlessly for the thing the startled wizard saw her coming and threw blasts of pure energy at her spheres of blinding balllightning which traveled unerringly toward her hit and did nothing leaving not even a tingle behind as they dissipated the mage had just enough time to realize that she was protected before she reached him while part of her sobbed with anguish another part of her coolly calculated and brought need about in a shining swift arc as she allowed her momentum to carry her past him she saw his eyes filled with fear saw his hands come up in a futile attempt to deflect the sword then felt the shock along the blade as she neatly beheaded him a tiny trail of blooddroplets streaming behind the point of the sword as it finished its arc before his body had hit the ground she whirled and made for jadrek cursing the fate that had placed mage and construct so many paces apart the old man hadnt a chance as she ran she could see that the archivist had something in his hands he ducked under the grasp of the horrid creatures upper two arms with an agility tarma never dreamed to see in him and with the courage she had known he possessed came up in the things face casting one handful of powder into its eyes and the second into its mouth the thing emitted a shriek that pierced tarmas ears then it crumbled into a heap of dry earth before she had made more than a dozen steps in its direction as it disintegrated it dropped kethry into the brown dust like a broken discarded toy tarma flung herself down on her knees at kethrys side and tried to stop the blood running from the gashes the things talons had left uselessly for kethry was dying even as she and the archivist knelt in the dust beside her jadrek made a choking sound and took kethry into his arms heedless of the blood and filth tarma rumbled the hilt of need into her hands but it only slowed the inevitable need could not mend a shattered spine nor could she heal such ghastly wounds all the blade could do was block the pain it was only a matter of time measured in moments before the end well the mage whispered as jadrek supported her head and shoulders in his arms silent tears pouring from his eyes and sobs shaking his shoulders i always figured id never die in bed tarma clenched both of her hands around the limp ones on needs hilt fiercely willing the blade to do what she knew in her heart it could not damn it keth you cant just walk out on us this way you cant just die on us we she could not say more for the tears that choked her own throat keth please dont ill do anything take my life only please dont die jadrek choked out frantically dont have much choice kethry breathed her eyes glazing with shock her life pumping out into the dust be brave sheenedra finish the contract then go home make talesedrin live without me no tarma cried her eyes halfblind with tears no she wrenched her hands away leaping to her feet its not going to end this way not while im kalenedral by the warrior i swear no thrusting a blooddrenched fist at the sky she summoned all the power that was hers as kalenedral as priestess as swordsworn warrior power she had never taken never used she flung back her head and screamed a name into the uncaring gray sky a name that tore her throat even as her heart was torn the warriors greater name the harsh syllables of the name echoed and reechoed driving her several paces backward then sending her to her knees in the dust then silence silence as broodingly powerful as that in the eye of the hurricane tarma looked up her heart cold within her for a moment nothing changed then everything ceased time stopped the very tears on jadreks cheeks froze in their tracks sound died the dust on the breeze hung suspended in little immobilized eddies tarma alone could move she got to her feet and waited for her to learn what price she would be asked to pay for the gift of kethrys life a single shaft of pure white light lanced into the ground practically at tarmas feet accompanied by an earsplitting shriek of tortured air tarma did not turn her eyes away though the light nearly blinded her and left her able to sec nothing but white mist for long moments when the mist cleared from her vision she was standing where the light had been her face utterly still and expressionless her eyes telling tarma nothing they faced one another in silence for long moments the goddess and her votary then she spoke her voice still melodious but this time the music was a lament that you call my name can mean only that you seek a life jelenedra she said the giving of a life not the taking as is my right as kalenedral tarma replied quietly as is your right she agreed as it is my right to ask a sacrifice of you for that life now tarma bowed her head and closed her eyes upon her tears for she could not bear to look upon that face nor to see the shattered wreck that had been her dearest friend lying beyond anything she whispered around the anguish your own life the future of talesedrin would you release kethry from her vow if i demanded it and have talesedrin become a dead clan anything tarma defiantly raised her head again and spoke directly to those starstrewn eyes pulling each of her words out of the pain that filled her heart kethshes worth more to me than anything ask anything of me take my body make me a cripple take my life even make talesedrin a dead clan it doesnt matter because without kethry to share it none of that has any meaning for me she was weeping now for the first time in years mostly when she hurt she just swallowed the tears and the pain and forced herself to show an impassive face to the world not now the tears scalded her cheeks like hot oil she let them do you kalenedral feel so deeply then tarma could only nod ltis well came the surprising answer and what price your obedience i put no price on obedience i will serve you faithfully lady as i always have only let kethry live and let her thrive and perhaps find love and most of all be free thats worth anything you could ask of me the warrior regarded her thoughtfully for an eternity measuring weighing then she laughed and as tarma stared in benumbed shock she held out her hands palm outward one palm facing tarma one kethry bolts of bunding white light like kethrys daggers of power leaped from her hands to tarma and to the mage still cradled in jadreks arms or possibly to the ensorcelled blade still clasped in the mages hands tarma did not have much chance to see which for the dagger of light hit her full in the chest and suddenly she couldnt hear couldnt see couldnt breathe she felt as if a giant hand had picked her up and was squeezing the life out other she was blind deaf dumb and made of nothing but excruciating pain only let keth live only let her live and its worth any price any pain then she was on her hands and knees panting with an agony that had left her in the blink of an eye halfsprawled in the cold dust of the valley while beside her a whitefaced jadrek cradled a dazed shocked and completely healed kethry only the tattered wreckage of her traveling leathers and the blood pooled beneath her showed that it had not all been some kind of nightmare as tarma stared still too numb to move she could hear the jubilant voice of the warrior singing in her mind lt is well that you have opened your heart to the world again my sword my kalenedral were meant to be without desire not without feeling remember this always to have something sometimes you must be willing to lose it love must live free jelenedra love must ever live free ten jadrek blinked trying to force what he had just witnessed into some semblance of sense he was mortally confused one moment kethry is dying there is no chance anyone other than a god could survive her injuries then tarma stands up and shrieks something in shinain and kethry stirred groggily in his arms he flushed released her and helped her to sit up trying not to stare at the flesh showing through the rents in her leather riding clothing flesh that had been lacerated a moment ago what happened she asked weakly eyes dazed i dont really know he confessed and thinking tarma was here and now shes over there and i didnt see her move i know i didnt am i going mad tarma got slowly to her feet wavering like a drunk and staggered over to them she looked drained to exhaustion her face was lined with pain and there were purplish circles beneath her eyes it looked to jadrek as if she was about to collapse at any moment for that matter keth looks the same if not worse what am i thinking anything is better than being a heartbeat away from death tarma fell heavily to her knees beside them scrubbing away the tears still marking her cheeks with the back of a dirty hand and leaving dirt smudges behind she reached out gently with the same hand and patted kethrys cheek the hand she used was shaking and with the other arm she was bracing herself upright its all right she sighed her voice sounding raw and worn to a thread its all right i did something and it worked dont ask what bright star i am tired to death she collapsed into something vaguely like a sitting position right there in the dust beside them head hanging she leaned on both arms breathing as heavily as if she had just run an endurance race kethry tried to move to get to her feet and fell right back into jadreks willing embrace again she held out her hand and watched with an expression of confused fascination as it shook so hard she wouldnt have been able to hold a cup of water without losing half the contents i feel awful but she said looking down at the shreds of her tunic with astonishment and utter bewilderment how did you i said dont ask tarma replied interrupting her i cant talk about it later maybe not now it put me through more than i expected jadrek my friend yes im about as much use as a weekold kitten and keths worse off than i am im afraid that for once youre going to get to play man of muscle she looked aside at him and managed to muster up a half grin there wasnt much of it and it was so tired it touched his heart with pity but it was real and that comforted him whatever has happened she knows exactly what shes doing and it will be all right tell me what you want me to do he said trying to sound just as confident theres still myself warrls dry voice echoed in their thoughts i have no hands but i can be of some help right you are furface oh gods tarma groaned as she got back up to her knees and took kethrys chin in her hand tilting it up into the light jadrek could see that kethrys pupils were dilated and that she wasnt truly seeing anything what i thought keth youre shocky fight it love jadrek and warrl are going to find some place for us to hole up for a while tarma transferred her hold to kethrys shoulder and shook her gently answer me keth gods kethry replied distantly and sleep as soon as we can fight sheenedra illtry warrl get the horses over here would you jadrek youre going to have to help keth mount shes got no more bones right now than a sponge he started to protest but she cut him off with a weary wave of her hand not to worry our ladies are battlemares and they know the drill ill get them to lie down you watch what i do then give keth a hand and steady her as they get up no lifting just balancing hai as long as im not going to have to fling her into the saddle he replied relieved i dont see any problem good man she approved next thing warrl will go looking for shelter i want something more substantial than the tent around us tonight youll have to stay with us keep keth in her seat ill be all right ive ridden semiconscious for miles when ive had to when warrl finds us a hole youll have to help us off and do all the usual camp duties no problem there either im a lot more trail wise than i was before this trip started aye and sounder in wind and limb too warrl appeared the reins of jadreks palfrey in his mouth the two battlemares following without needing to be led jadrek watched as tarma gave her ironheart a command in shinain and was astounded to see the mare carefully fold her long legs beneath her and sink to the dusty ground positioning herself so that she was lying within an arms length of the exhausted swordswornan tarma managed to clamber into the saddle winding up kneeling with her legs straddling the mares back she gave another command and the mare slowly lurched to her feet unbalanced by the weight of the rider but managing to compensate for it tarma glanced over at jadrek think you can deal with that i think so tarma repeated her command to hellsbane the second mare did exactly as her herdsister had jadrek helped kethry into the same position tarma had taken feeling her shaking from head to toe every time she had to move tarma gave the second command and the mare staggered erect with jadrek holding kethry in the saddle the whole time warrl flicked his tail and jadrek felt a wave of approval from the kyree i go packmates you go on it were best you removed yourselves from the scene of combat spies jadrek asked aloud possible also things that feed on magic and more ordinary carrion eaters shall we take the enemy beast tarma looked over her shoulder at the weary gelding which was still where the mage had left it off to one side of the trail i dont think so she replied after a moment its just short of foundering jadrek could you strip it leave the harness bring anything useful you find in the packs then let the poor thing run free he did as she asked once free of saddle and bridle the beast seemed to take a little more interest in life and moved off at a very slow walk heading deeper into the hills warrl trotted down the trail and vanished from sight once past the place where it exited the valley jadrek mounted his own palfrey with a grunt of effort and rode it in close beside kethry so that he could steady her from the side you ready wise brother tarma asked i think so and not feeling particularly wise take lead then my eyes keep fogging ironheart knows to follow her sister they headed out of the little valley and the trail became much easier the hills now rolling rather than craggy and covered with winterkilled grass but after a few hundred feet it became obvious that their original plan wasnt going to work kethry kept drifting in and out of awareness and sliding out of her saddle as she lost her hold on the world every time she started to fall jadrek had to rein in both hellsbane and his palfrey to keep her from falling over the gaits and sizes of the two horses just werent evenly matched enough that he could keep her steady while riding he finally pulled up and dismounted walking stiffly back toward the drooping shinain tarma jerked awake at the sound of his footsteps what jadrek she said shaking her head to clear it he looked measuringly at her she looked awake enough to think if i tethered vegas reins to the back of your saddle would that bother heart he asked no nott all tarma replied slurring her words a little shes led bfore why because this isnt going to work im going to put the packs on vega and ride double with keth the way you carried me up here only with me keeping her on tarma managed a tired chuckle dunno why i didn think of that too blamed tired she dozed off as jadrek made the transfer of the packs then put a long leadrein on vegas halter and fastened it to the back of tarmas saddle he approached hellsbane with a certain amount of trepidation but the mare gave him a long sniff then allowed him to mount in front of kethry with no interference although with his stiff joints swinging his leg over banes neck instead of her back wasnt something he wanted to repeat if he had any choice he would have tried to get up behind kethry but he wasnt sure he could get her to shift forward enough and he wasnt certain hed be able to stick on the battlemares back if she broke into anything other than a walk so instead he brought both of kethrys arms around his waist and loosely tied her wrists together she sighed and settled against his shoulder as comfortably as if it were a pillow in her own bed he rather enjoyed the feeling of her snuggled up against his back truth be told he nudged hellsbane into motion again and they continued on down the trail the sky stayed gray but showed no signs of breaking into rain or sleet and there was no hint of a change in the weather on the sterile dusty air the horses kept to a sedate walk tarma halfslept and kethry was so limp he was certain she was completely asleep it was a little frightening being the only one of the group still completely functional he wasnt used to having people rely on him it was exciting in an uneasy sort of way but he wasnt sure that he liked that kind of excitement warrl returned from time to time always with the disappointing news that he hadnt found anything jadrek began to resign himself to either riding all night and hoping that there wasnt going to be another storm or trying to put up the tent by himself but about an hour before sunset the kyree came trotting back with word that hed found a shepherds hut currently unused jadrek set hellsbane to following him off the track and ironheart followed her without tarma ever waking she did come to herself once theyd stopped and she seemed a bit less groggy she got herself dismounted without his help got their bedrolls off vega and carried them inside with her she actually managed to get their bedding set up while jadrek slid the halfconscious mage off her horse then assisted her to stagger inside and laid her down on the bedding with a bit of awkwardness at the unaccustomed tasks he got the horses bedded down in a shed at the side of the little building by the time hed finished kethry was sound asleep in her bedroll and tarma was crawling into her own cant keep my eyes open she apologized then dont try i can do whats left i think he added mentally but his trail skills had improved he managed to get a fire going in the firepit thought about making supper and decided against it opting for some dried beef and trail biscuit instead with the fire dimly illuminating their shelter he made a quick inspection of the place thinking it would he my luck to come upon a nest of hibernating snakes but he round nothing untoward in fact it was a very well built shelter with stone walls a clean dirt floor and a thatched roof it was a pity it didnt have a real fireplace a good half of the smoke from the fire was not finding the smokehole in the center of the roof and his eyes were watering a bit but it was clean and dry and now growing warm from the fire he watched the moving shadows cast by the fire onto the wall chewed the leathery strip of jerky and tried to sort himself out warrl came in once to tell him that hed hunted and eaten and was going to stand guard outside after that he was alone what kind of a fool have i shown myself to he he thought still confused by the events of the last few hours did anyone even notice he watched kethry as she slept feeling both pleasure and pain in the watching how much did tarma see gods above im afraid ive gone and fallen in love like a greensick fool at my age i should bloody well know better still given the state theyd all been in tarma probably hadnt been in a condition to notice much of anything except her oathsisters plight and i would give a great deal to know how she managed to bring kethry back from deaths own arms because shes as much as admitted it was all her doing and i can only wonder what it cost her besides strength and energy maybe thats why she didnt want to talk about it still and all she really isnt acting as if it cost her nearly as much as if whatever had happened shook her down to her soul i think perhaps she learned something she didnt expect to whatever it was i think perhaps the outcome is going to be a good one she almost seems warmer somehow more open would she ever have put all her safety and keths in my hands before ii dont think so he stretched taking pleasure in the feel of joints that werent popping and bones that didnt creak he was sore from the unaccustomed work but not unbearably so although lady of light ive been working like a porter all afternoon and not had so much as a twinge in the old bones now was that just because i was keyed up or was it something else well ill know tomorrow if i ache from head to toe ill know i was not privileged to be the recipient of a miracle and meanwhile the fire needs feeding so he watched kethry huddled in his own blankets while he fed the fire and waited for the morning carters lane in the capital city of petras was living up to its name even this close to the time for the evening meal the street was wide enough for four wagons moving two abreast in each direction and all four lanes were occupied by various vehicles now the steady rumbling of wheels on cobblestones did not drown out the equally steady hum of voices coming from all sides carters lane boasted several popular taverns and drinkshops not the least popular of which was the pig and potion this establishment not only had an excellent cook and an admirable brewmaster but in addition offered various forms of accommodation ranging from single cubbyholes with bed that rented by the hour to rooms and suites of rooms available by the week or month it was from the window of one of the latter sorts of lodging that a most attractive young wench was leaning her generous figure frequently taking the eyes of the cart drivers from their proper work she was in fact the inadvertent cause of several tangles of traffic she paid this no heed no more than she did the equally persistent calls of admiration or inquiries as to her price she was evidently watching for something or someone and to the great disappointment of her admirers she finally spotted what she watching for arton the brownhaired laughingeyed wench called from her secondfloor window ive waited days for you you ungrateful beast now janna the scarfaced fighter who emerged rrom the crowd to stand on the narrow walkway beneath her looked to be fully capable of cutting his way out of any fracas except perhaps this one dont you now janna me you brute she vanished from the window only to emerge from a door beside it the door let onto a balcony and the balcony gave onto a set of stairs that ran down the outside of the inn janna clattered down these stairs as fast as her feet could take her you leave me here all alone and you never come to see me and you never send me word and enough enough the warrior begged much to the amusement of the patrons of the inn janna ive been busy oh busy indeed i can guess how busy she confronted him with her eyes narrowed angrily standing on the last two stairs so that her eyes were level with his her hands were on her hips and she thrust her chin forward stubbornly not at all ready to make peace give im a rest lass called another fighter lounging at an outside table one wearing the same scarletandgold livery as arton kings nervy keeps im on and most of tti time e as been busy oh well then the girl said seeming a bit more mollified but you could have sent word im here now arent i he grinned with just a touch of arrogance and we ought to be making up for lost time not wrangling in the street ohofe she squealed in surprise as he picked her up threw her over his shoulder and carried her up the stairs he pulled the door open closed it behind him silence one of the serving girls paused in her distribution of ale mugs sighed and made calf eyes at the closed door such a man wisht i ad me one like him spring is aborning and young love with it intoned a street minstrel hoping that the buxom server would take notice of him young lust you mean rhymester laughed the second fighter artons no fool thats a nice little piece he brought with him out of the country and cheap at the price of a room a bit of feeding and a few gewgaws one of these days i may go see if shes got a sister who wants to leave the cowflops for the city if you can get any girl to look at your ugly face sneered a third the mutter of goodnatured wrangling carried as far as the secondfloor room where the young fighter had collapsed into a chair groaning the rooms furnishings were simple a bed a table a wardrobe and three chairs and an enormous wolflike creature on the hearth warriors oath keth you might make yourself lighter next time the warrior groaned my poor back if id known you were going to play borderbridegroom id have helped you out you idiot the brownhaired girl retorted closing the shutters of the rooms single window then snatching a second chair and plopping down into it tarma where the hell have you been these past few days a note of three words does not suffice to keep me from having nervous prostrations i told you she was all right the kyree sniffed but you wouldnt believe me warrls right keth i figured that hed tell you if anything was wrong so i wasnt going to jeopardize my chances by doing something marginally out of character and ive been busy as i said tarma replied rubbing her eyes damn cant you do something about the way these spells of yours make my eyes itch sorry not even an adept can manage that tarma sighed char has gotten the wind up about something maybe hes even getting some rumors about our work who knows anyway hes been keeping me with him day and night until i could find somebody he trusts as much as me to spell me out how is the conspiracy business going kethry smiled and ran her hands through her hair better than wed hoped in a lot of ways jadrek will be giving me the signal as soon as hes done with his latest client so why dont we save our news until were ail together fine by me i dont suppose youve got anything to eat around here why dont they feed you at the palace having gotten leave to go i wasnt about to stick around and maybe get called back just so i could feed my face tarma retorted kethry raised one eyebrow chars that nervy tarma spotted half a loaf of bread and a chunk of cheese on the table behind kethry and reached forward to seize both hes that nervy she agreed slicing bits off the cheese with her beltknife and alternating those tidbits with hearty bites of bread she would have said more but a gentle tapping came from the wall kethry jumped up out of her chair and faced the wall holding both palms at shoulder height and facing it the wall itself blurred for a little then the door that had been hidden by kethrys illusion swam into view jadrek pushed it open and stepped into the room there had not been a door there when theyd taken these two rooms jadreks suite opened only into the inn and kethrys had two doors the exterior and one like jadreks opening on the inn corridor but what could be done by hands could also be done by magic and within one day of kethrys taking possession of this room she had made then concealed the door in their common wall it was a real door and not a magic portal just in case jadrek ever needed to make use of it when kethry was not present for kethry had set the spell of concealment so that he controlled it on his side of the wall and how does the master astrologer asked tarma genially better than when he was master archivist jadrek chuckled i think i shall have stefan find a successor astrology is a more lucrative profession why am i not surprised tarma asked sardonically gentle lies always cost more than the truth i take it none of your clients have recognized you it wouldnt be likely he replied mildly taking the third unoccupied seat around the little table most of my clients are merchants wives when would say ct ave seen a court archivist or given your notable ability to fade into the background noticed him if theyd seen him added kethry all right tarma love you first right jadrek i managed to deliver all but one of your messages the one to count wulfres i left with yindel wulfres wouldnt let me get near him i cant say i blame him since i have been building quite a formidable reputation as chars chief bullyboy is that why he trusts you kethry asked partially dont worry though that reputation is actually doing me more good than harm if anyone notices when i take somebody aside for a little chat it doesnt do them any benefit to tell the king because char assumes im delivering threats she chuckle keth that adept we took out was the only oone he had the rest of his mages are master and journeyman class so dont worry about this disguise continuing to hold kethry heaved a sigh of profound relief thank the ep w tnat nat ave me y ow are you eet on wlt char you said far better than wed hoped thats a good summation he doesnt trust any or his native guards and he doesnt trust his nobles that leaves him with me a couple of other landless mercs and a handful of outland emissaries since im trying to give an imitation of a freefighter with a veff or civilization and a range of interests sliehtly beyond food fornication and fighting he seems to be gravitating more and more toward me and needless to say youre encouraging him id taught you well warrl commented you encourage familiarity with the king while never going over tfw iw f being social inferior that takes a delicate toucn i had not suspect you had mindmate having you coaching me in my head hasnt hurt furball thanks to you ive never once been even remotely disrespectful been pounding heads when some of the guards go over the line in fact and as a result chars slowly taking me as cupcompanion as well as bodyguard thats certainly far better than we hoped jadrek exclaimed tarma what about idra kethry asked both elbows on the table chin in her hands she looked unwontedly sober tarma sighed and rubbed one temple keth we both know by now shes got to be dead kethry nodded reluctantly as jadrek bit his lip i just didnt want to be the one to say it she replied sadly needs pull just hasnt been strong enough for her to have still been alive i too have suspected the same tarma sighed i think i realized it i mean really believed it a couple of days after she stopped for a moment and looked squarely at jadrek hes an outclansman she thought weighing him in her mind but why not no reason why he shouldnt know if keth has her way he wont be an outclansman for long after i called one of the ushyae and got the stareyed warrior instead that night in valdemar you know the evening when roald and i came back as best of friends he saw her too and she made it clear to both of us that we were all on the same side dyou remember how she turned the set of his whites i was wearing black kethry nodded slowly then real enlightenment dawned black is for vengeance and blood feud right tarma nodded she could have left my clothing alone she could have changed it to brown if she was truly offended at me being out of kalenedral colors which i think is rather unlikely she doesnt get that petty but she didnt leave the whites white and shed already convinced me that roald and stefansen were on the side of the righteous she can be very subtle when she chooses and she was trying to give me a subtle message that i was back on bloodtrail so who would be the logical one for me to avenge and who would be the logical target for vengeance idra and char right and right again my only questions now are was it accident or premeditated and how he did it she tightened her jaw and felt very nearly murderous at that moment and the closer i get to him the likelier i am to find the answers to both she let the sentence hang for a long moment then coughed slightly jadrek your turn ive been approached by three of those nobles you contacted for me via their wives he said visibly shaken by tarmas assertions and yet unsurprised by them as if her words had only confirmed something he had known but had not wished to acknowledge that he knew they were already planning some sort of action on their own which given their temperaments was something i had thought fairly likely in addition i have been approached by those i did not expect prelates of no less than five separate orders it seems they had already spoken quietly with my chosen highborn and went on to you logical tarma nodded thoughtfully and what prompted their dissatisfaction oh a variety of causes from the altruistic to the realistic he wrinkled his brow in thought mind you i dont personally know as much about the clergy as i do the court but they seem to be appropriate responses given the personalities of those i spoke with and the philosophies of their orders huh when we start to get clergy on our side tarma propped her feet up on the table ignoring kethrys frown of disapproval and sat in thoughtful silence for a long time all right she said when the silence had begun to seem unbreakable its time for some hard choices friends were getting the support and not only are we moving a bit ahead of schedule but were getting some unexpected help so which of the plans are we going to follow she tilted her head at jadrek who pursed his lips thoughtfully id rather not run a fullscale uprising frankly he said its too unwieldy for this situation i think your commanders really have to be in the field for it to succeed tarma you are the most militant of us and we need you here so that would leave me or kethry not me kethry objected fighters dont like following a mage and i dont blame them im no strategist either and i am neither fighter nor strategist jadrek replied stalemate tarma observed flexing her shoulders to try and relax the tense muscles there not that i dont agree with you both warrl i also it is too easy to lose a civil war all right were agreed that rousing the countryside is out then the other two nodded slowly assassination that i favor warrl replied raising his head from his paws lt would be an easy thing for me wait until he is in the garden with a wench over the wall he snapped his jaws together suggestively lt would give me great pleasure and i could easily be gone before alarm could be effective not clearcut enough jadrek asserted there will always be those wanting to make a martyr out of char its amazing how saintly a tyrant becomes after hes dead we want stefan firmly on the throne or this country will be having as many problems as it already has just different ones warrl sighed and put his head back down sorry mindmate i sympathize that leaves the smallscale uprising here in the city can we pull that off maybe by midsummer well have the working people solidly behind us those that arent losing half their incomes to chars taxes are losing half their incomes because the others have less to spend kethry said nibbling at her thumbnail what ive been working with are the merchants and they are vastly discontent with the way things are going if theres an uprising they will be on our side of the riot the problem is that these are not people used to righting maybe not but ill bet most of them have a few hired fighters each either as guards for themselves or for their goods tarma pointed out if there were some way that we could promise that their property would stay safe ill bet theyd turn those fighters over to us for say two days assuming that they are professional enough to fight together as a force instead of a gaggle of individuals ill work on that kethry replied i suspect well have most of the clergy too by midsummer jadrek offered and for many of the same reasons and i know of at least two militant orders within the city walls those warriors will fight as a single unit good what about the highborn dont they have retinues jadrek shook his head with regret no not inside the city walls that was one of destillions edicts no noble can have more than four armed retainers when at court and you know the size of chars guard force hes got a small army not even counting his personal guard tarma agreed ruefully still maybe i can come up with a notion i might be able to work a bit of subversion in chars forces who knows lets stick with the local uprising plan i think were all agreed its got the best chance of success she swung her feet down off the table and noticed with surprise that the light coming through the closed shutters was red damn sunset already ive got to be getting back chars got another drunken orgy hes holding tonight and wants his back safe kethry mussed herself artistically pulling one sleeve of her blouse so far down that a generous portion of breast was exposed she stood up at the same moment as tarma followed her to the door and let her out for the benefit of anyone watching they gave a wellacted imitation of a passionate farewell when kethry finished locking the door behind tarma she turned to see that jadrek was still sitting at the table looking broodingly at a stain in the wood she was not at all unhappy about that because she had just about decided that certain other things were going to have to come to a head one way or another still worried she asked returning to her seat and reaching out to touch her index finger to the wick of the candle standing in the middle of the table it promptly ignited jadrek had looked up as she had taken her chair and watched her light the candle with rapt fascination i never get tired of seeing you do things like that he said its just so magical she laughed and dispelled the illusion on herself he relaxed visibly she raised an eyebrow and he shrugged i like you better this way he confessed shyly the other seems harder somehow oh she is shes taking arton for everything she can get kethry replied to answer your question yes im still worried but i also know that all three of us are doing the best that we can so worrying isnt going to make a great deal of difference one way or the other he stood up with visible reluctance i probably should leave you why kethry asked frankly are you expecting anyone tonight well no but neither am i she glanced at warrl who took the hint padding through the stillopen door between their rooms shutting it behind him with a casual kick kethry moved closer to jadrek before he could move away not touching him but standing so near that their faces were within inches of each other jadrek i want you to know that i find you very very attractive his eyes registered his complete surprise as she deliberately held his gaze i also want you to know that i am not a virgin and im perfectly capable of dealing with attentions that i dont welcome you she finished do not come under that category iyou never stop surprising me i hardly know what to say then dont say do unless you dont find me attractive slowly he lifted one hand and cupped it against her face kethry he breathed kethry i find you very attractive almost unbearably attractive but im not a young man she echoed his gesture his cheek warm beneath her hand if i wanted a young man theres a tavern full downstairs its you i admire jadrek the mind the person youre something special something those pretty bodies downstairs arent and probably never will be very hesitantly he leaned forward and kissed her she returned the kiss as passionately as she dared and suddenly he responded by embracing her and prolonging the kiss until she was breathless when they broke apart his gray eyes were dark with confusion kethry there are more comfortable places to be doing this she said very softly over there for one she nodded at the curtained bed halfhidden in the shadows he blushed he blushed even harder when she led him there by the hand and all but pushed him down onto it i he stammered looking past her kethry im not very experienced at this sort of you were doing just fine a moment ago she interrupted him gently then prevented further protests by embracing him and resuming the kiss where it had been left off he seemed to hesitate for a moment then seemed to make up his mind all in an instant and returned her embrace with a fervor that at least equaled her own he pulled her down beside him she did not resist in the least that being exactly what she wanted from him for a very long time all they did was kiss and exchange halting hesitant caresses almost like a pair of naive youngsters but when she returned every tenderness with more of the same he grew braver daring to undo the lacings of her dress daring to touch her with fingers that slowly grew bolder he frequently stopped what he was doing for long moments just to look at her his eyes full of wonder as if this was something more magical for him than all the exercising of her powers as a sorceress as if he couldnt believe that she was returning touch for touch and emotion for emotion when he did that she had to fight to keep back the tears of sympathy the only way she could was to keep a little corner of her mind free to concentrate on the hatred she felt for the women who must have treated him with coldness or indifference so that this experience was such an unexpected revelation for him he stroked her with hands so gentle that she could hardly credit it he was by no means the best lover shed ever had he was perhaps a little clumsy and as he had confessed not at all practiced but his gentleness made up for that and more and besides she rather figured that she had experience enough for both of them when they finally joined together it was like nothing shed ever dreamed of for her heart was as involved in the act as her body kethry he whispered hoarsely as he started to sit up whispering into the darkness for the candle had long since burned out she could hear the beginnings of an apology in his voice and interrupted him dont you dare she replied reaching up for him and pulling him toward her so that his head rested on her shoulder dont you dare spoil this with any of your nonsense about being old then i didnt make a fool of myself he asked shyly you dont want me to go you werent making a fool of yourself any more than i was she told him if showing how you feel is so very foolish i dont think it is and no please dont go i want you to stay ive had my fill of nights spent alone he sighed and relaxed into her arms kethry i care for you maybe more than i should she reached into the darkness and brushed strands of damp hair from his forehead dont think youre alone in caring more than you should she let him take that in for a moment then laughed softly or did you think i was only after you for your book collection gods keth he who was usually so glib was once again at a loss for words then he joined in her laughter no i didnt tarma on the other hand they held each other for another long momentuntil he spoke again kethry what weve got ahead makes promises foolish she interrupted him weve already made all the promises either of us dare to for now lets just enjoy what times we have and worry about staying alive shall we thats probably wise he replied with a reluctance that made her heart race he raised himself on his elbow for a moment and cupped her face in both hands and kissed her kissed her in a way that made his words about not making promises a lie and eventually he fell asleep with his head cradled on her shoulder kethry held him her heart full of song oh windbom this is the one she thought before she joined him in slumber hes hes like something ive always missed and never known i missed it until now but now i could never be content with anyone but him not ever again eleven kethry sighed rose from her chair and went once more to the window she stood there restlessly leaning on the sill with her chin in her hand watching the street below a dark silhouette against the oranges and reds of a spectacular sunset more than a hint of weariness in that sigh jadrek thought sympathetically rubbing his tired eyes last night was yet another late night with both of us too exhausted at the end of it to do anything other than sleep tonight looks to be the same theres never a moment to spare for simple things like food and sleep much less anything else i want to tell her how i feel that i i love her but there never seems to be any time much less the right time he studied the way she was holding herself the sagging shoulders the way she kept turning her head a little to ease the stiftness he knew was in her neck because he had loosened those muscles for her far too many times of late his own neck felt as stiff and he felt echoes of those same aches in his own shoulders gods were both tired mentally and physically shes spent more hours cajoling stubborn suspicious merchants than i care to think about ive spent almost the same number of hours dancing around the touchy sensibilities of priests and highborn not the way i would have chosen to spend our time and both of us return from meetings socompletely drained conspiracy is for the young combining it with a love affair is insanity warrl gave an amused snort from where he lay curled on his chosen spot on the hearth you manage well enough wise one the rough voice in jadreks mind said that is solely i suspect because our opportunities have numbered far less than our wishes jadrek thought at him feeding a little more revived just by the casual contact with the kyrees lively mind i fear that even the supposed wisdom of accumulated years fails to keep my desire from outstripping my capabilities the only difference between my youth and my age is that now i am not ashamed to admit the fact the kyree snorted contemptuously again but jadrek ignored him and continued furthermore i shudder to think what tarma is likely to say about this liaison when she learns of it you know less about her than you think was the kyrees enigmatic reply suddenly the great beast raised his head and stared in the direction or the palace a message what jadrek asked aloud as kethry turned to look sharply at the lupine creature tarma sends her regrets but char requires her presence and she seems to think that the trandust he intends to abuse this evening might make him talkative needless to say she does not intend to miss her opportunity the kyree turned warm and glowing eyes on the archivist she asks me to come to the stable at dark so that she can return here afterward without worrying about spies on her backtrail i would suggest given your earlier plaint about not having any time to yourselves that you might take advantage of the occasion that has been presented to you unless you have other plans jadrek nearly choked on a laugh at kethrys indignant blush i think we can find some way of filling in the time he said aloud as she glared at both of them the hour grew late the candle burned down to a stub and kethry replaced it and still no sign of tarma jadrek regretted more than once that his ability to communicate with warrl was sharply limited by distance kethry suddenly dropped the candle end she was about to discard and her whole body tensed what jadrek asked anxiously wondering if she had sensed some sort of occult probing in their direction its anger she replied distantly terrible terrible anger ive never felt anything like this in her before her her who she didnt answer him and he said a little more sharply who keth keth she shook her head as if to clear it and resumed her seat at the table but he could see that her hands were trembling before she clasped them in front of her on the table to conceal the fact keth he repeated gently but insistently its its the sheenearan bond between us she said at last we each can feel things the other does sometimes jadrek shes in a killing rage shes just barely keeping herself under control and i cant tell why she looked up at him and he could see fear the mirror to his own in her eyes ive never felt anything like this out of her shes usually so controlled even when im ready to spit nails it has to be something char said or did but what could bring her to the brink like this theres enough rage resonating down the bond that im half prepared to go kill something i dont know he said slowly and im almost afraid to find out they stared at each other helplessly until finally he reached out and laid his hand over her clenched ones offering what little comfort he had to give after that it was just the deadly waiting finally after both of them had fretted themselves into a state of nervous exhaustion they heard warrls nails clicking on the wooden steps outside tannas presence was revealed only by the creaking of the two trick boards one in the fifth step one in the eighth otherwise she never made a sound kethry jumped to her feet ran to the door and flung it open tarmaarton stood in the light streaming from the door so very still that for a moment jadrek wasnt entirely certain she was breathing she remained in the doorway for a long long moment her face utterly expressionless except for the eyes which burned with a rage so fierce kethry stepped back an involuntary pace or two warrl came up from behind her and nudged tarmas hand with his nose only then did she seem to realize where she was and walk slowly inside stopping only when she came to the table she did not take a seat as she usually did she continued to stand halfshrouded in shadows and looked from jadrek to kethry and back again finally she spoke ive found out what happened to idra so once char had downed a full bottle of brandy to enhance the tran hed gotten himself into a mood where he was talkative but wasnt really thinking about what he was saying kethry tensed feeling tarmas anger burning within her a halfmad fire at the pit other stomach tarma spoke in a tonelessly deadly voice still refusing to seat herself alcohol and tran have that effect in combination connecting the mind to the mouth without letting the intellect have any say in what comes out and as id been hoping his suspicious nature kept him from wanting to confide in any of his courtiers and there was good old arton so sympathetic so reliable always dependable so he threw his rumpkissers out and began telling me how everybody abused him everybody turned on him especially his sister she shifted her weight a little the floorboard creaked beneath her and kethry could feel the anger rising up her spine channel that she told herself locking her will into adepts discipline theres enough pure rage here to bum half the city down if you channel it use the anger dont let it use you with that invocation of familiar discipline came a certain amount of relief the fires were partially contained harvested against future need it wasnt perfect she was still trembling with emotion but at least the energy wasnt being all wasted and there will he future need then he told me about how his sister had first supported him then betrayed him how he had known from the first that the hunt for the lost sword had been nothing more than a ruse to get her across the border and into contact with stefan he carried on about that for long enough to just about put me to sleep what an ungrateful cold bitch she was how she deserved the worst fate anyone could imagine he was pretty well convinced she was shechorne too and you know how they feel about that here i had just about figured that was all i was going to get out of him when suddenly he stopped raving kethry felt a prickle of fear when the bond of sheenedran between herself and tarma transmitted sent another surge of the incredibly cold rage her oathsister was feeling ive never known anyone who could sustain that kind of emotionor this long without berserking had tarma been anything other than kalenedral someone or several someones would be long dead by now hacked into many small pieces i fixed her he said i fixed her properly i planned it all so beautifully too i had zaras bespell one of his apprentices to look like me and sent the apprentice off with the rest of the court on a three day hunt then zaras and i waited for the bitch in the stables i distracted her he hit her from behind with a spell and when she woke up her body belonged to zaras he had her saddle up and ride out just as if it were any other day but this time her destination was my choice we took her to the old tower on the edge of hielmarsh its deserted and the rumors i had spread about hauntings keep the clods away from there what tarma told them horrified even kethry inured to the brutality of warfare as she was and she of the three of them had been the least close to the captain tarmas own internal torment was only too plain to her oathsister who was continuing to share in it and jadreks expression could not be described idras torture and punishment had begun with the expedient most commonly used to break a woman multiple rape rape in which her own brother had been the foremost participant chars methods and means when that failed became more exotic jadrek excused himself halfway through the toneless recitation to be audibly sick when he returned pale shaking and sweating with reaction tarma had nearly finished kethrys stomach was churning and her throat was choked with silent weeping his own sister kethry shuddered her eyes burning and blurring with her tears no matter how much he hated her she was still his sister tarma came closer looming over the table like a dark angel she took the dagger from her belt and held it out into the light of the tablecandle she held it stiffly point down in a fist clenched so tightly on the hilt that her knuckles were white oathbreaker i name him tarma said softly but with all the feeling that she had not given vent to behind the words of the agesold ritual of outcasting oathbreaker he and all who stand by him oathbreaker once by the promises made to kin then shattered oathbreaker twice by the violation of kingoath to liegeman oathbreaker three times oathbreaker a thousand times by the violation of every kinbond known and by the shedding of shared blood oathbreaker i name him kethry echoed rising to place her cold hand over tarmas taking up the thread of the seldomused passage from the mercenaries code she choked out her words around a knot of black anger and bleak mourning both so thick and dark that she could barely manage to speak the ritual coherently through the chaos of her emotions she was still channeling but now she was channeling the emotion through the words of the ritual emotion was power that was what made a deathcurse so potent even in the mouth of an untutored peasant this may well once have been a spell and it was capable of becoming one again she knew that even though she was no priest channeling that much emotionenergy through it had the potential of making the outcasting into something more than mere ritual oathbreaker i do name him mage to thy priest oathbreaker once she choked hardly able to get he words out by the violation or sacred bonds oathbreaker twice by the perversion of power granted him for the common weal to his own ends oathbreaker three times by the invocation of pain and death for pleasure somewhat to her surprise she saw jadrek stand place his trembling damp hand atop hers and take up the ritual she had never guessed that he knew it oathbreaker i name him and all who support him he said though his voice shook oathbreaker i do name him who am the common man of good will making the third for outcasting oathbreaker once by the lies of his tongue oathbreaker twice by the perversion of his heart oathbreaker three times by the giving of his soul willingly to darkness tarma slammed the dagger they all had been holding into the wood of the table with such force that it sank halfway to the hilt oathbreaker is his name she snarled all oaths to him are null let every mans hand be against him let the gods turn their faces from him let his darkness rot him from within until he be called to a just accounting and may the gods grant that mine be the hand she brought herself back under control with an effort that was visible and turned a face toward them that was no longer impassive but was just as tearstreaked as kethrys own this is the end of it he couldnt break her she was too tough for him right up to the last he didnt get one word out other not one and in the end when he thought his bullyboys had her restrained she managed to break free long enough to grab a knife and kill herself with it the fireandcandle light flared up long enough to show that the murderous rage was still burning in her but still under control i damn near killed him myself then and there warrl managed to keep me from painting the room with his blood it would have been suicide and while it would have left the throne free for stefan id have left at least two friends behind who would have been rather unhappy that id gone and gotten myself killed by the rest of chars guard unhappy is understating the case jadrek replied gently slowly resuming his seat but yes at least two good friendsister please sit kethry could see tears still glinting in his eyes but she could also see that he was thinking past his grief something she and tarma couldnt quite manage yet as tarma lowered herself stiffly into her accustomed chair he continued our plans have been plagued by the inability to bring a force of trained fighters whose loyalty is unswervingly ours into the city now i ask you who served under idra what would her sunhawks think to hear this gods kethry brought her fist to her mouth and bit her knuckles hard enough to break the skin theyd want revenge just like us and not just them but every man or woman who ever served as a hawk jadrek nodded in short an army our army one that wont swerve from their goal for any reason or be stopped by anything short of the death of every last one of them now for a brief time they fought their battle with pen and paper messages coded in obscure dialects or rarely in plain tradespeech left the city every day that there was someone that they judged was trustworthy enough to carry them tarma from her position as trusted insider was able to tell them that the few messages that were intercepted baffled chars adherents and were dismissed out of hand as merchantclan warrlng the rest went south and east following the trade roads to find the men and women who wore or had once worn the symbol of the sunhawk the answers that returned were not of paper and ink but flesh and blood and of deadly anger the last time justin twoblade and his partner had entered petras it had been with a feeling of pleasant anticipation petras bad been the turnaround point for the caravan theyd been guarding and it was well known for its wines and its wenches hed had quite a lively time of it that season in petras now he entered the city a second time again as a caravan guard three things differed he would not be leaving at least not with the traders he was guarding his partner was not ikan dryvale and his mood was not pleasant he and his partner parted company with the caravan as soon as their clients had selected a hostelry taking their pay with them in the form of the square silver coins that served as common currency among the traders of most of this part of the world then looking in no way different than any other musteredout guards they collected their small store of belongings loaded them on their horses and headed for a district with a more modest selection of inns and if they seemed rather heavily armed and armored well they had been escorting jewel traders it was only good sense to arm heavily when one escorted such tempting targets what was the name of that inn were looking for justin asked his new partner his voice pitched only just loud enough to be heard over the street noise i didnt quite catch it from the contact the fountain of beer kyra replied just as quietly her eyes flicking from side to side in a way that told justin she was watching everything about her without making any great show of doing so i suspect thats it ahead of us his hands were full reins of his horse in the left pack in the right so he pointed with his chin the sign did indeed sport a violently yellow fountain that was apparently spouting vast quantities of foam if youll take care of the lodgings ill take care of the stableman kyra offered weve both got tokens one of us should hit on a contact if we try both good justin replied shortly they paused just at the inn gate and made an exchange of packs and reins kyra went on into the stableyard with their horses as he sought the innkeeper behind his bar justin bargained heatedly for several minutes arriving at a fee of two silver for stabling room and meals for both but there was a third coin with the two square ones he handed the innkeeper a small round bronze coin bearing the image of a rampant hawk on one side and the suninglory on the other it was in fact the smallest denomination of coin used in hawksnest used only in hawksnest and almost never seen outside of the town the innkeeper neither commented on the coin nor returned it but he did ask justice twoblade when registering them on his rolls justice was one of the halfdozen recognition words that had come with justins message justin the fighter corrected him justin of the hawk that was the appropriate answer the man nodded and replied right justice justin also nodded then stood at the bar and nursed a small beer while he waited for kyra to return the potboy showed them to a small plain room on the ground floor at the back of the inn stablemans one contact for certain sure kyra told him as soon as the boy had left he wished me justice i gave im mname as kyra brighthawk and then e tol me t wait for a visitor innkeepers another gave me the same word always provided we arent in a trap justin raised one laconic eyebrow at kyras headshake my child you dont grow to be an old fighter without learning to be suspicious of your own grandmother i would suggest to you that we follow enemy territory rules kyra shrugged you been the leader ill live with whatever ye guess we should be doin justin felt of the bed found it satisfactory and stretched his lanky body on it at full length it is a wise child that obeys its elders he said sententiously then quirked one corner of his mouth it is also a child that may live to become an elder kyra shrugged goodnaturedly a few moments later the boy returned with a surprisingly good dinner for two which he left justin examined it with great care by smell and by cautious taste evidently we arent supposed to leave justin guessed and if this stuff has been tampered with i cant tell it kyra followed his careful inspection of the food with one of her own nor me an my grandy was a wisewoman i don know about you friend but i could eat raw snake likewise my lady justin dug a healthy portion out of the meat pie theyd been served and handed it to her solemnly she accepted it just as solemnly it might have been noted had there been anyone else present that neither partook of anything the other had al ready tried if any of the food had been tampered with it would likely be only one or two dishes if that were the case one of them would still be in shape to deal with the consequences when after an hour nothing untoward happened to either of them justin grinned a little sheepishly well dont apologize kyra told him i tell ye i druther eat a cold dinner than find mself wakin up lookin at the wrong endf somebodys knife they demolished the rest of the food in fairly short order then began another interminable wait after a candlemark of pacing kyra finally dug a long branch of silvery derthenwood out other pack as well as a tiny knife with a blade hardly bigger than a pen nib she sat down on the floor next to the bed and began the slow process of turning the branch into a carved chain justin watched her from halfclosed eyes fascinated in spite of himself by the delicate work the chain had only a few links to it when the wait began when it ended there was scarcely a fingerlength of branch remaining then without warning a portion of the wall blurred and kethry stepped through it kethry just held out her arms welcoming both of them into an embrace which included tears from all three of them gods keth justin finally pulled away reluctantly it has been so damned hard keeping this all inside i know none better windborn i cannot tell you how glad i am to see you two youre the first to come may the lady forgive me but there were times i wondered if this was going to work oh its working all right better than you could guess he wiped his eyes and nose on the napkin from their tray and locked his emotions down all right lady mage we need information not waterfalls firsttell me how you got here so fast we werent about t let anybody beat us here kyra replied not after that message sewen sent me on ahead t tell ye that queen sursha give us leave t deal with this soons we get some of her new army units in t replace us the rest of the hawksll be here in bout a month ikans out rounding up all the former hawks we can track down justin continued well be trickling in the same as the hawks will no more than two or three at a time and disguised one of the merchant houses is going to let some of us use their colors ikan took the liberty of taking your name in vain to old gnumo we have the support of surshas bards and half a dozen holy orders well be everything from wandering entertainers to caravan guards youve got a plan i take it tarma has shes worked it out with a couple of highborn we can trust kethry told him all i really know about is my part of it but generally were hoping to accomplish the whole thing with a minimum of bloodshed specific blood kyra replied with a smoldering anger justin shared oh yes one of the lot weve already taken out raschars adept but the others kethry allowed her own anger to show tarmas identified every person that had a hand in the deed and they will answer to us justin nodded slowly what about arms theres going to be at least half of us without much given the disguises being smuggled in to us from an outside source so that char wont be alerted that somethings up by activity in forges and smithies were getting everything tarma could think of bows arrows with warpoints various kinds of throwing knives grapnels climbing spikes pikes swords the last is the hardest that and armor but were hoping most of you will manage to bring your own do either of you have a guess how many there might be that we can count on six hundred at an absolute minimum justin said with grim satisfaction thats four hundred hawks and the two hundred that either retired to hawksnest or that ikan knows for a fact he can get hold of and will want in gods thats better than id hoped kethry said weakly therere four hundred regular troops here about a hundred and fifty assorted militia and fifty personal guards belonging to char therere some other assorted fighters but tarma tells me they wont count for much therere chars adherents and their private guards but we dont know but that they wont turn their coats or hide if things look chancy that means well be going pretty much oneonone all the professionals starting the fight even even with his mages justin asked dubiously kethry raised her chin her eyes glinting like emerald ice in the light from the window beside her he hasnt a mage that can come close to me in ability and i have more power at my disposal than any of them could hope for where are you getting that kind of power justin asked in surprise i mean youre alone you and the hawks your anger i cant begin to tell you how strong a force ive already tapped off just you two when i start to think about six hundred hawks it makes my head reel its the kind of power a mage sees perhaps once in a lifetime and if i werent an adept id never be able to touch it much less control it youre adept class now justin said incredulously great good gods no wonder you arent worried not with power like that at my disposal i can channel all that anger harvest it and save it for the hour of striking were the attackers this time i can set up as many spells as it takes as far in advance as i need to spells specifically designed to take out each mage and wait until the moment of attack to trigger them im assuming only half of those will work the rest will probably be deflected but the mages will be offbalance and i can take them out one at a time i know how mages think when theyre under magical attack they tend to ignore anything mundane and they seldom or never work together white winds is one of the few schools that teaches working in concert i think we can plan that they will be concentrating on me and not on anything nonmagical and that they wont even think to band together against me justin nodded satisfied sounds like you people have a pretty good notion of what youre about now comes the hard part uhhuh kethry nodded waiting singly or by twos and threes the hawks came just as justin had told kethry they would each of them arrived in some disguise some seeming utterly harmless a peasant farmer here a party of minstrels there a couple of merchant apprentices day by day they trickled into petras and no one seemed to notice that they never left it again each went to one of the dozen inns whose masters had bought into the conspiracy carrying with them a small bronze coin and a handful of recognition words each was met by kethry or by one of the other official greeters justin kyra or ikan who had arrived within days of the first two from there things got far more complicated than even most of these professional mercenaries were used to beaker coughed scratched his head and turned his weary donkey in to what passed for a stableman at the wheat sheaf inn the stableman here was like most of the clients of farm stock and probably had never even seen a warhorse up close much less handled one beakers dusty donkey was far more in his line of expertise the stable was a packedearth enclosure with a watering trough and a pile of hay currently being shared by three other mangy little donkeys and a brace of oxen beaker had serious second and third thoughts about this being the contact point for a rebel force but the instructions had said the wheat sheaf and specified the stableman as the contact ye wanta watch that one beaker drawled handing the wizened peasant the rough rope of the donkeys halter with one hand and four coins with the other three copper pennies and one bronze hawkpiece shell take revenge if she even thinks yere gonna lay hand to er oh aye i know th type the fellow replied grinning and proving that a good half of his teeth had gone with his lost youth ol girl like this she hold a grudge till judgment day eh he pocketed all four coins without a comment well that was the proper sign and counter beaker felt some of his misgivings slide away and ambled on into the dark cave of the roughbrick inn like most of its ilk it had two floors each one large room the upper would have pallets for sleeping the lower had a huge fireplace at one end where a stout middleaged woman was tending an enormous pot and a roast of some kind it was filled with clumsy benches and trestle tables now but after the inn shut down for the night those that could not afford a pallet upstairs would be granted leave to sleep on table bench or floor beneath for half the price of a pallet opposite the fireplace was the bar a stack of beer kegs and a rack of mugs presided over by the innkeeper beaker debated looking prosperous when his stomach growled and made the decision for him he paid the innkeeper for a mug of beer a bowl of soup and a slice of roast the man took his money gave him his drink and a slice of nottoostale bread beaker slid his pack off his back rummaged his own bowl and spoon out of it then shrugged it back on before weaving his way through the tables to the monarch of the kitchen rather to his surprise the inn staff of places like this one were rather notorious for being surly the woman gave him a broad smile along with a full bowl and put a reasonably generous slice of meat on his bread juggling all three carefully he took a seat as near to the door as possible and sat down to eat the food was another pleasant surprise fresh and tasty and stomachfilling and the inn was cool after the heat and dust of the road the beer was doing a respectable job of washing the grit out of his throat beaker was about halfway through his meal when her heard someone come up behind him hows the food tday sojer beaker grinned and turned in his seat kyra when are you gonna get rid of that damn accent when cows fly probly makes me fit in here though she straddled the bench beside him a mug and bowl of her own in hand eat here evry chance i get ma kemak she sure can cook pa kemak don water the beer neither finish that up boy we gotta get you off th street soons we can she set him a good example by nearly inhaling her soup from the inn kyra led beaker on a rambling stroll designed to shake off or bore any pursuit bringing him at last to the stableyard entrance of a wealthy merchant a murmured word with the chief stableman got them inside from there they slipped in the servants door and climbed a winding staircase to the attic of the house normally a room like this was crowded with the accumulated junk of several generations now it was barren except for a line of pallets there were only two windows both shuttered but there was enough light that beaker could recognize most of those sprawled about the room beat you birdbrain garth mocked from a corner looking around beaker could see that a good half of the pallets were occupied and that evidently he was the last of tarmas scout troop to arrive well hell if theyd given me somethin besides a halfdead dwarf donkey t get here on no excuse jodi admonished tresti and i were shayana mendicants we came here on our own two feet beaker what have you got in the way of arms asked someone off on the opposite side of the room peering through the attic gloom beaker could make out that the speaker was a skirmisher he knew vaguely a hawk called vasely one short knife and my sword he replied and ive got my brigandine under this shirt get over here and pick out what you want then take whatever you think you can use we arent short of anything but swords and bodyarmor beaker crossed the attic picking his way among the pallets and sorted through the piles of arms shortly thereafter he was being caught up on the developments by his fellow scouts he learned that they hid their faces by day slipping out only at night to meet in the ballrooms and stableyards of the great lords who had also joined the conspiracy there they would hear whatever news there was to hear and practice their skills each night as the hawks gathered to spar kethry would siphon off the incredibly dangerous energy of their anger and hate dangerous because the energy generated by negative emotions was hard to control and attracted some very undesirable otherplanar creatures but it was a potent force and one kethry was not going to let go unused she channeled what she accumulated each night into the dozen trapspells she was building one for each of chars mages she was beginning to think that she might well be able to carry this off for despite her brave words to justin she had no idea if what she planned was going to work nor how well she was just too new at being adept to be certain exactly what her capabilities were i wish youd tell me what youre going to do jadrek said plaintively hed been watching her as she traced through the last of the parchment diagrams laying in the power she had acquired that night there were times his patience astounded her still i didnt realize youd want to know she replied sealing the new layer of power in place and looking up at him with surprise as she finished come around here behind me and have a look then he rose moved to her right shoulder and bent over the table with his expression sharp with curiosity well you know im not a mage but i do know some of the magebooks and keth what youve been doing doesnt even look remotely familiar you know what a trapspell is thats this part she leaned over the parchment and pointed out the six tiny diagrams encircling the last mages name as he looked over her shoulder with acute interest she could feel without even seeing his face thats just the part thats like a trigger on a physical trap right exactly except that what will activate the trigger wont be something the mage does but something i do a kind of a mental twist to release the rest of it he examined the elaborately inscribed sheet with care leaning on the back of kethrys chair and not touching the page that looks familiar enough from my reading but whats all the rest of this thats something new something i put together theres a mindmagic technique called a mirroregg that roald told me about she said sitting back he responded to her movement by beginning to massage her neck as she talked it involves surrounding someone with an eggshaped shield that is absolutely reflective on the inside its something you do he told me when youve got a projective that refuses to lock his mindgift down or is using it harmfully everything he projects after that gets flung straight back into his face roald says its a pretty effective way of teaching someone when admonishment fails i would think so jadrek agreed ah his gentle hands hit a particularly tense spot and kethry fell silent until hed gotten the muscles looser i thought about it and it occurred to me that there was no reason why the same kind of thing couldnt be applied to magical energy so i found a spell to make a mirrored shield and another to shape a shield into an egg shape and combined them thats this bit she traced the twisted patterns with her finger above the diagram when jiles got here he agreed to let me throw one on him as a test it worked better than either of us had guessed scared him white you see with most other trapspells if you have the patience to work your way through it you can find the keypoint and get yourself loose by cutting it not this one because everything you do reflects back at you therere only two ways to break this one from the outside or to build up such pressure inside that the spell cant contain it jadrek pondered that in silence for a moment while kethry let her head sag and reveled in the relaxation his hands were leaving in their wake whats to keep the mages from building up that kind of pressure he asked at last nothing if they can but if they try and they dont figure out that theyre going to have to shield themselves within the shield theyll fry themselves before they free themselves jadrek spoke slowly and very quietly that is not a nice spell these arent nice people kethry replied recalling all the soulsearching shed done before deciding that this was the thing to do frankly if i could call lightnings down on all of them i would and take the guilt on my soul i agree it isnt a thing one should use lightly and just before i trigger the traps i intend to burn the papers i wont need them any more at that point and id rather that the knowledge didnt get into too many hands just yet and later how do you keep someone else from finding out how you did it what if gods jadrek love once a things been thought of it gets out no matter what so once this is all over with im going to arrange for the information to be sent to every mage school i know of and spread it as far and wide as i can what jadrek asked so aghast that he stopped massaging you cant stop knowledge you shouldnt try if you do half the time its the wrong people that get it first so im doing the best thing you can do with something like this making sure everybody knows about it that way if its used it will be recognized mages trapped inside one of these eggs will realize whats happened and get outside help before they hurt themselves ones outside will know the counter oh he said resuming what hed broken off there was silence for a while as he plainly pondered what shed said one more thing to love about him he doesnt always agree with me but he hears me out and he thinks about what ive said before making up his own mind huh he said when shed begun to drowse a little under his gentle ministrations i guess youre right if you cant guarantee that something harmful stays out of the wrong hands and i cant theres no way then see that all the right hands get it and that they get the antidote i dont know that this is all that moral jadrek i only know that the alternative taking the chance that someone hke zaras figures out what i did first is less moral she sighed i never thought that becoming an adept would bring all these moral predicaments with it he kissed the top of her head keth power brings with it the need to make moral judgments history proves that you have no choice but to make those decisions she sighed again and reached up to lay one of her hands across his where it rested on her shoulder i just hope that i always have someone around to keep reminding me when something im thinking about doing isnt nice i may still do it but id better have good reasons for doing so he squeezed her shoulder gently dont worry as long as im around you will thats what i hoped youd say she thought to herself closing her eyes and leaning back that is exactly what i hoped youd say twelve tarma tarma looked up from the maps spread before her to see jadrek nudging his way into the knot of fighters she was tutoring shed had ample time to leam every twist and turn of the maze within the palace and she was endeavoring to make sure every person of the secret army knew every corridor and storeroom before the planned coup she felt a twinge of excitement when she saw that jadreks expression was at once tense and anticipatory she excused herself and turned her pupils over to jodi what is it she asked him quietly not wanting to raise hopes that might be dashed in the next moment you look like youve swallowed a live fish and youre not certain if youre enjoying the experience he raised an eyebrow you arent far wrong thats about how my stomach is feeling stefans in petras warriors oath she bared her teeth in a feral grin as those nearby glanced at her in startlement although they had been planning for this very moment suddenly she felt rather as though the fish was wriggling about in her stomach when how long ago did you make contact where is he now about three candlemarks ago and hes with keth at the inn it seemed the safest place for him all right this is it hes here were ready let me get sewen and ikan and ill meet you at kethrys she turned on her heel and began making her way across the crowded dimly lit ballroom she kept sight ofjadrek as he slipped back out the door and she noticed that he was slumpshouldered and limping slightly poor devil he looks like warmedover death all this is giving me energy but its sapping his keth too talk all day plot all night spellcast when you arent plotting chase one another around the bedroom when you arent spellcasting warrl broke into her thoughts still at it are they tarma thought at him well if the liaison has survived this much stress for this long keths right about him being the one good id welcome jadrek as clanbrother with no reservations hes the closest thing ive seen since keth to a shinain and he has more sense than both of you put together yow know he still thinks you dont know about the love affair warrl chuckled keth hasnt enlightened him i cant read her as easily as i can him what with all her mageshields so i dont know why she hasnt told him that you knew about it from the first she might assume he knows you know or she might be waiting to see how he handles the situation i suspect the latter given keths devious mind hmm if anyone would know about jadreks condition you would youre practically in his pocket most of the day he was limpinghows he doing physically extremely well his bones only bother him when hes very tired like tonight or very chilled need knows how kethry worries about him so need takes very good care of him good enough to make the palace assault with us we need his knowledge i would judge so hell have every fighter of the hawks watching out for him after all hai hell probably come out better than the rest of us will well back to business she had reached sewen and ikan by the end of that mental conversation which had all taken place in the space of a few heartbeats they looked up at her approach and knowing her as well as they did she reckoned they would have no trouble reading the news in her eyes time is it sewen straightened and rolled up the map theyd been working with she nodded hes here no need to say who he was not when all they lacked for the past several days to put the plan into motion had been stefansens physical presence keths room ready roth nodded ikan signaled justin who came to take his place sewen did the same with the scout mala within moments the three of them darkly cloaked and moving like shadows through the illlit streets were on their way to kethrys room warrl as always told the others of their approach kethry was at the door before they set foot on the staircase and held it open just enough that they could slip inside jadrek was already there seated at the table beside him looking somehow far more princely than tarma had remembered was stefansen it was stefansen the ruler who rose to greet them to clasp the hands and shoulders of both ikan and sewen with that same ease and frank equality idra had always shown and thank them for their presence and help with a sincerity that none of them doubted the meeting was in some ways rather unnerving for sewen and ikan tarma knew how much like his sister stefansen looked but the others hadnt been warned and in the soft light from their candles the resemblance was even stronger tarma could almost hear their thoughts shock a touch of chill at the back of the neck then they shook themselves into sense kethry gestured bringing three more chairs into abrupt existence as jadrek unrolled the first of a series of maps on the table all six of them seated themselves almost simultaneously stefansen cleared his throat and the odd note in the sound caught tarmas attention and by the way the other two looked up at him in startlement sewens and ikans as well jadrek has kept me appraised of whats been going on he said with a kind of awkward hesitation that he had not displayed before so i know the reason all you sunhawks are here i dont i dont deal well with emotion its hard for me to say things that i feel but i just want you to know that i understand i have half a dozen reasons for wanting to roast char over a slow fire and that one is at the top of the list but i think all of you have a prior claim on his hide i was never as close to idra as even the lowliest of her hawks so if its possible when this is over hes yours sewens eyes lit at those words the hawks thank you for that highness an ill tell you true theyll fight all the better for the knowing of the promise it only seemed fair he looked straight into tarmas eyes as if asking whether this had been the wise choice she nodded slightly and he looked easier very well gentlemen ladies he said after a moment of silence all the pieces are on the game board shall we begin it was midsummers night and folk in carnival garb thronged the streets among the mob of wildly costumed maskers who would notice six hundredodd more celebrants who would notice masks on a night of masking who would note six hundredodd sets of phony weaponry among so many thousand tawdry pieces of junk like them who would take alarm from another merchant or peasant playing at warrior except that beneath the cheap gilding and pastedon glass jewels beneath the paper and the tinsel the arms and armor of this lot was very real this was the night of all nights that the rebels had hoped to be able to use in part because of the ability to move freely and in part because of one aspect in particular of the midsummers night celebrations of rethwellan though the folk of petras were mostly long since severed from any direct ties to the farms that formed a good third of rethwellans wealth midsummers night was still the night which ensured the fertlity of the land there would be reveling in the streets right up until the stroke of midnight but at midnight the streets would be deserted every man and woman in petras would be doing his or her level best to prove to the goddess in her aspect as lover that the people of rethwellan still worshiped her in all the appropriate ways this midsummers night they would be trying especially hard because over the past three months the priests of the city had been doing their best to encourage exactly that behavior tonight some of them had even unbent themselves enough to admit that on this one night perhaps it didnt altogether worry her if your partner did not happen to be your lawfully wedded spouse and that if one felt guilty after being infected with her sacred desires and fulfilling same well for a case of indulgence after midsummers night penances would be few and light and forgiveness easily obtained for all but six hundredodd who would not be fulfilling her desires as lover but as avenger tarma picked her way through the thinning crowds still wearing her guise of arton it was that guise that was going to give the hawks the entry to the palace grounds from all directions she knew the hawks were converging on the palace she would be one of the last to arrive kethry was already in place waiting to spring her trapspells if they didnt work she would be in a position to guide hawks to the mages to deal with them physically while she kept them occupied magically if they did work she would be a most welcome addition to their arsenal and just in case char somehow slipped through their fingers warrl here mindmate got the horses in place warrls duty was to work with horsemaster tindel the fastest of the shinainbred mounts shed sold char the year before were to be saddled and kept at the ready in a culdesac just outside the palace gate with warrl and tindel guarding them if char got away rrom them tarma and the best riders among the hawks would be hot on his heels saddled bridled and ready to ride good lets hope we dont have to use them devoutly tarma approached one of the side gates that gave out onto a delivery area tonight the gate stood open for the convenience of servants and the courtyard beyond was dark and deserted and there was kethry still in her own disguise and looking angry enough to bite a board in two tarma altered her walk swaying a little as if drunk she was carrying what looked like a jug loosely in her right hand as it happened it wasnt a jug it was her sword magicked with another illusion kethry spotted her tarma put a little more of a stagger into her step there you are you beast and drunk as a pig she shrilled to the amusement of the two gate guards jjanna tarma slurred uncertainly coming to a halt just before the gate of course its janna you brute you asked me to meet you here you sot ive been waiting for hours dont you believe her arton snickered the righthand gate guard she aint been here moren half a candlemark an she showed up with a big blond lad on one arm too reckon shes been playin moren one game tonight eh youdamnedslutt tarma snarled feigning that she had suddenly gone fightingdrunk she advanced on kethry brandishing the jug kethry backed up until she was just inside the gate itself giving every evidence of genuine and absolute fear im gonna beat you bloody you fornicating little bitch kethry whirled and threw herself on the lefthand guard begging his protection distracting both guards for the crucial moment that it took tarma to get within arms length of the righthand guard then tarma pivoted and took her guard out with the pommel of her sword just as kethry executed a neat right cross to the point of her targets chin both went down without a sound within heartbeats the hawks were swarming the gate as two of their number already bespelled into looking like the two guards they were replacing dragged the bodies into the gatehouse trussed and gagged them and took up their stations the fighters filled the courtyard on the other side hidden in the dark shadow of the palace waiting for tarma and kethry to make the next moves kethry stood in frozen immobility for a single moment sensitized to stirrings of energies by her own status as kalenedral tarma actually felt her spring her trapspells well kethrys eyes met hers with incredulous shock theyre holding all of them lady with us then and lets hope they keep holding new body keth right the mage answered and tarma waited impatiently as the figure of janna blurred became a rosy mist and the mist solidified into a new guise a very ordinary looking female fighter in the scarletandgold livery of chars personal guardall right hawks tarma said in a low but carrying voice this is it form up on your leaders she marched up to the unlocked delivery door kethry beside her and pushed it open the halfdrunk guard beyond blinked at her without alarm and bemusedly he was one of chars own personal guards and tarma in her guise of arton had ordered him to stand duty tonight on this door for a reason he was one of the men that had participated in the rape and torture of idra she swung once without a qualm cutting him down before he had a chance to do more than blink at her her only regret was that she had not been able to grant him the lingering death she felt he deserved she and kethry hastily dragged his body out of the way then she waved to the waiting shadows in the court behind her and the sunhawks poured through the door a flood of vengeance in human shape a flood which split into many smaller streams and all of them were deadly no luck tarma said flatly as her group met as planned with stefans just outside the corridor leading to the rooms assigned to the unattached ladies of the court he wasnt in his quarters and he wasnt with the mages nor with any of his current mistresses stefansen reported that leaves the throne room their combined group which included jadrek who had accompanied stefan and both the other sunhawk mages now numbered some fifty strong the new force surged down the pristine white marble of the great hall to their goal of the throne room all of them caught up in battlefever the hawks had met with opposition from chars fighters some of it fierce the bodies lying in pools of spreading scarlet on the snowy marble of the halls were not all wearing chars livery sewen had been hurt and ikan garth was dead and more than fifty others tarma had known only vaguely but the hawks had triumphed even in the pitched battle with the seasoned troupers of chars army and all but a handful of those who had murdered their captain were now making their atonements to her in person but among that handful and the only one as yet uncaught was raschar those in the lead shouted as they reached their goal the great bronze double doors of the throne room first in triumph and then in anger as they attempted to force those doors open the sculptured doors to the throne room were locked from the inside justin and beaker and a half dozen more battered at them futilely as the rest came up their efforts did not even make the glittering doors tremble dont bother stefansen shouted over the noise those damned doors are a handspan thick well have to try to get in from the garden no we wont kethry snarled audible in her rage even over the frustrated efforts of those still trying to batter their way in stand back she raised her hands high over her head her face a mask of fury and tarma felt the surge of power that could only mean she had summoned some of that terrible angerenergy she had channeled away but not used in the trapspells this was the best purpose for such energies tarma knew anything destructive would do kethry called out three piercing words and a bolt of something very like scarlet lightning lanced from her hands to the meeting point of the double doors there was a smell of hot metal and scorched air and a crash that shook every ornament in the hall to the floor the fighters around her cringed and protected their ears from the thundershock the doors rocked but did not open fight it down girl tarma cautioned her and kethry visibly wrestled her own temper into control if she lost to it she had warned tarma she would be prey to the stored anger kethry closed her eyes took three deep breaths then faced the obstacle again oh no she told the doors and the spell that was on them you dont stop me that easily again she called the lightning and a third time and on the fourth the doors burst off their hinges and fell inward with a crash that shook the floor cracked the marble of the walls of the great hall and rained debris down on all their heads from the ceiling none of which they particularly noticed as they stormed into the throne room to find it empty jadrek cursed with a command of invective that astounded kethry and pointed to where a scarlet and gold tapestry behind the throne flapped in a current of air the tunnel it was walled off years ago figures that the little bastard would have it opened up stefan spat think man where does it come out jadrek closed his eyes and clenched both hands at his temples as kethry tried to will confidence and calm into him if the records i studied are right and i remember them right he said finally it exits in the old temple of ursa outside the city walls tarma and her chosen riders had already spun around and were sprinting for the door and kethrywas right behind them because she had already laid most of the spell on them it was childs play to invoke the guises shed set for just this eventuality even while pelting down the hall as fast as her legs could carry her they were exceedingly simple illusions anyway not faces but livery the scarlet and gold livery of chars personal guards exactly as the guise she wore was garbed they didnt have far to run and hawks now held the main gate and had forced it open so there was nothing to bar the path to their allies as they pounded into the torchlit court behind the main gate a dozen shinainbred horses driven by warrl and led by tindel galloped past that portal their ironshod hooves drew sparks from the stones of the paving and they tossed their heads as they ran plainly fresh and eager for an allout run which was exactly what they were going to get as the horses swirled past the palace door the hawks ran to meet them not bothering to give tindel the time to bring them to a halt instead they mounted on the run as tarma had taught them even kethry the worst rider of all managed somehow grabbing pommel and cantle and getting herself in the saddle of the stillcantering gelding shed singled out without really thinking about what she was doing where tindel shouted over the pounding of hooves as they thundered out the gates again leaving a panting warrl to collapse behind them this was no race for him and he knew it temple of ursa tarma yelled in reply and tindel cut anything else she was about to say off with a wave of his hand i know a quicker way he bellowed he urged his gray into the fore and led them in a mad stampede down crazy twisting alleys kethry had never seen before a good half of which were just packed dirt festival gewgaws and dying flowers were pounded to powder as they careened through once a tiny hawkers cart thankfully unattended was knocked over and kicked aside reduced to splinters as it hit a wall kethrys nose was filled with the stench of backalley middens and trampled garbage she was splashed with stale water and other liquids best left nameless her eyes were dazzled by sudden torchlight that alternated with the abyssal dark valleys between buildings she got only vague impressions of walls flying past halfseen openings as they dashed by cross streets and the pounding of hooves surrounding her throbbed like the pounding of the power at her fingertips then a startled shout a wall that loomed high against the stars and an invisible wall of cooler air and absolute blackness that they plunged through still without a pause then they were outside the city walls continuing the insane gallop along the road that led to a handful of old mostly deserted temples and beyond that to hielmarsh the moon was full it was nearly as bright as day without a single cloud to obscure the light the fields and trees before them were washed with silver and the horses able now to see where they were going increased their pace kethry urged her beast up to the front of the herd until she rode just behind tarma and tindel she gripped her horse with aching knees and tried to see up the road the temple couldnt be far not if it was to be reached by a tunnel it wasnt the white marble of a building that could only be the temple in question stood out clearly against the dark shadows of the trees behind it at this pace hardly more than a breath or two away just as they came within shouting distance of the temple moonlight reflecting from a cloud of dust on the road ahead of them told them without words that char had already started the next stage of his flight this road led almost directly to hielmarsh kethry knew he was heading for his little stronghold or perhaps the mazes of the marsh there would be no pulling him out of there but hielmarsh was hours away and that dust cloud a few furlongs at most and their horses were shinain not much exhausted by the race theyd run so far scarcely sweating and still on their first wind the little party ahead of them knew they were coming though they had to they had to hear the rolling thunder of two dozen pairs of hooves they also had to know there was no escaping but the hawks didnt want a pitched battle if they could help it the dust was settling which meant the quarry had turned at bay kethry saw tarma give the signal to pull up as they came within sight of char and his men the knot of fighters ahead of them huddled together on the moondrenched road swords glinting silver as they held them at ready kethry and the rest of the hawks obeyed their leader and slowed their horses to a walk the kings party numbered almost forty putting the hawks at a twotoone disadvantage if they fought tarmas contingency plan as kethry knew called for no such fight that was the reason for the magical disguises majesty tarma called knowing char would see the arton he trusted your brothers stormed and taken the palace hes holding the city against you i got what men i could and tried to guess which way youd be heading raschar dug his spurs into his geldings sides and rode straight to his faithful retainer arton he cried panic straining his voice hellfire i heard youd gone down at the gates i have never been so glad to see anybody in my life as he pulled up beside tarma kethry could see his skin was pale and he was sweating and his eyes were hardly more than black holes in his head rein in majesty ive got you some help here she called up at the mixed group of guards and common soldiers still nulling about uncertainly up ahead you lot get back to the temple split yourselves up i dont much care how half of you head back down to hold the road for as long as you can the rest of you lay a false trail off to lasleric come on move it out we havent got all night there hadnt been a single officer among them and the mixed contingent was obviously only too happy to find someone willing to issue orders that made sense unlike the frantic babbling of their king they obeyed tarma without a murmur sending their nervous beasts around the clot of hawks blocking the road within moments they were out of sight returning back toward the temple and beyond tarma waited until they were completely out of sight before giving kethry a significant look kethry nodded and dropped the spell of illusion shed been holding on their company char stared his jaw sagging as what appeared to be his guard was revealed as something else entirely then he paled his face going whiter than the moonlight as he recognized tindel tarma and kethry what he started to stutter then drew himself up and took on a kind of nervous dignity just what is this supposed to mean who are you what do you want you probably havent heard of us before your majesty tarma drawled as two of the hawks closed in on the king from the rear coming up on either side were just a common mercenary troop we go by the name of idras sunhawks when she spoke the name he choked and rowled his horse savagely too late the hawks were already within grabbing distance of his reins he tried to throw himself to the ground but other hands caught him and held him in his saddle until he could be tied there should take us about three candlemarks to get him back tindel began a growl from the ranked fighters behind tarma interrupted him and he stopped looking startled stefan promised him to us my friend tarma said quietly he goes back only when were finished with him but we called the oathbreaking on him kethry pointed out hes ours by the code no matter how you look at it tindel looked from face to stubbornly set face and shrugged well what do we do with him huh hadnt thought that far tarma began i had kethry said firmly there was still a vast reservoir of angerenergy for her to draw on and while the coercion of innocent spirits was strictly forbidden a white winds sorceress the opening of the gates of the otherworld to a ghost that had a debt to collect was not and idra most certainly had a long bitter debt owed to her we called oathbreaking on him thats a spell partner i do believe we ought to see that spell completed tarma looked at her askance so did the rest of the hawks char gagged made choking sounds how do you propose to do that and just what does it mean to see it completed kethry shifted in her saddle keeping char under the tail of her eye it only takes the priestess and the mage to complete the spell and i know how jadrek found the rest of it in some of the old histories as for what it does it brings all the broken oaths home to roost does that mean what i think it does kethry nodded and tarma smiled a bloodthirsty grin that sent a chill even up her partners backbone all right where the temple back there will do i think all we need is a bit of sanctified ground with chars horse between them they led the mystified mercenaries toward the white shape of the temple on their backtrail it was fortunately deserted kethry did not especially want any witnesses to this besides the principals the temple was in a state of extreme disrepair walls half fallen and crumbling the pavement beneath their horses hooves cracked and uneven tarma began to look dubious as they penetrated deeper into the complex are we far enough in do you think i dont want to chance one of the horses falling and maybe breaking a leg if theres any help for it this will do kethry judged reining in her mount and swinging a little stiffly out of the saddle the rest dismounted as well with several of them swarming the kings mount to pull him roughly to the ground the horses eased of their burdens sighed and stamped a little pawing at the weathered stone now what tarma asked tindel you and beaker and jodi stand here you three hold char she indicated a spot on the pavement in the center of a roughly circular area that was relatively free from debris tarma you stand south ill stand north the rest of you form a circle with us as the ends the hawks obeyed still mystified but willing to trust the judgment of the mage theyd worked so closely with for three years all right tarma just be kalenedral thats all you need to do and hold in mind what this bastard has done to our sister and captain that wont be hard came the icy voice from across the circle kethry took a deep breath and brought stillness within herself for everything depended now on creating a channel from herself for the anger of the others if she let it affect her it would consume her when she thought she was ready she took a second deep breath raised her arms and began oathbreaker he stands judged oathbreaker to priestess oathbreaker to mage oathbreaker to true man of his people oathbreaker we found him oathbreaker in soul oathbreaker in power oathbreaker in duty oathbreaker we brought him oathbreaker in thought oathbreaker in word oathbreaker in deed oathbreaker he stands judged and condemned she called upon the power she had not yet exhausted and the rising power within the circle let the wall of strength stand between this place and the world as the barrier had been built between herself and the dark mage for the magic duel so a similar barrier sprang up now one pole beginning from where she stood the other from where tarma was poised this wall was of a colorless milky white it glowed only faintly let the pillars of wisdom stand between this world and the next mist swirled up out of the ground just in front of char and his captors kethry could see his eyes bulging in fear for the mist held a light of its own that augmented the moonlight the mist formed itself into a column which then split slowly into two the two columns moved slowly apart then solidified into glowing pillars let the gate of judgment open more mist this time of a strange bluish cast billowed in the space between the two pillars kethry felt the energy coursing through her it was a very strange almost unnerving feeling she could see why even an adept rarely performed this spell more than once in a lifetime it wasnt just the amount of power needed it was that the mage became only the vessel for the power it in a very real sense was controlling her she spoke aloud the final word of opening then called with thought alone to the mistshape within the pillars and fed it all the last of the hawks united anger in a great burst of unleashed power the mist swirled billowed grew dark then bright then dark again it glowed from within the color a strange silverblue then the mist condensed around the glow forming a suggestion of a long road a road under sunlight and out of the center of the glowing cloud rode idra char gave a strangled cry and fell to his knees before the rider but for the moment she was not looking at him she was colorless as moonlight and as solidly real as any of tarmas leskyaekalenedrcd when kethry had decided to open the gate she had faced this moment of seeing idras face with a tinge of fear wondering what she would see there she feared no longer the long lingering gazes idra bestowed upon each other children were warm and full of peace this was no spirit suffering torment but the face she turned upon her brother was full of something colder than hate and more implacable than anger hello char she said her voice echoing as from across a vast canyon you have a very great deal to answer for tarma led two dozen boneweary hawks back into petras that morning they made no attempt to conceal themselves and word that they were coming and word of what they carried preceded them the streets of petras cleared before their horses ever set hoof upon them and they rode through a town that might well have been emptied by some mysterious plague but eyes were watching them behind closed curtains and sealed shutters eyes that they could feel on the backs of their necks there was fear echoing along with the sounds of hoofbeats along those streets fear of what the hawks had done fear of what else they might do by the time they rode in through the gates of the palace a nervous crowd had assembled in the court and stefansen was waiting on the stairs the hawks pulled up in a semicircle before the new king still silent but for the sound of their horses hooves as the last of the horses moved into place the last whisper coming from the crowd died leaving only frightened ponderous silence a silence that could almost be weighed and measured there was a bloodstained bundle lashed on the back of raschars horse a bundle that tindel and tarma removed carried to the new kings feet and dropped there without ceremony the folds of what had been chars cloak fell open revealing what the cloak contained stefan though he had visibly steeled himself turned pale there was just about enough left of raschar to be recognizable this man was sworn oathbreaker and outcast tarma said harshly tonelessly and he was so sworn by the full rites by a priest a mage and an upright man of his own people all of whom he had wronged all of whom had suffered irreparable loss at his hands we claim mercenarys justice on him by the rights of that swearing we executed that justice upon him who would deny us that right there was only appalled silence from the crowd i confirm it stefansen said into the silence his voice firm and filling the courtyard for not only have i heard from a trusted witness the words of his own mouth confessing that he dishonored tortured and slew his own sister the lady idra captain of the sunhawks and princess of the blood but i have had the same tale from the servants of his household that we questioned last night hear then the tale of raschar the oathbreaker tarma stood wearily through the recitation not really hearing it although the murmurs and gasps from the crowd behind her told her that stefan was giving the whole story in all its grimmest details the mood of the people was shifting to their side moment by moment and now that the whole thing was over all she wanted to do was rest the energy that had sustained her all this time was gone are there any she heard stefansen cry at last his voice breaking a little who would deny that true justice has been dispensed this day the thunderous no that followed his question satisfied even tarma quite a little family party tarma thought wryly surveying the motley individuals draped in various postures of relaxation around the shabbycomfortable library of stefansens private suite enjoy it while you can warrl laughed in her mind lt wont be too often that you can throw cherrystones at both a king and a crown prince when they tease you it was only roald and he was asking for it stefansen had been officially crowned two days ago and roald had arrived as valdemars official representative complete with silver coronet on his blond head and with a full entourage as well the time between the night of the rebellion and the day of the coronation had been so hectic that no one had had a chance to hear the full story of the rebellion from either tarma kethry or jadrek so stefansen had decreed today that he was having a secret council session had all but kidnapped his chosen party and locked all of them away included in the party were himself and mertis and he had taken care that there was a great deal of food and drink and comfortable seats for all and once everyone was settled in he had demanded all the tales in their proper order the entire council was mostly sunhawks or exhawks sewen and tresti justin and ikan kyra beaker and jodi tarma herself and kethry of course then the outsiders tindel jadrek and roald it had taken a long time to get through the whole story and when kyra had finished the last of the tales telling in her matteroffact way how idra had ridden out of the cloud of mist and moonlight you could have heard a mouse sneeze what i dont understand is how you hawks took that so calmly tindel was saying i was as petrified as char i swear but you it was like she was real lad beaker said in a kindly tone to a man at least a decade or two his senior weve ridden with idra through things you cant imagine shes stood by us through fear and flood and hellfire itself how could we have been afraid of her she was only dead its the living we fear and rightly justin rumbled into the somber silence that followed beakers words and speaking of the living you will never guess who sauntered in two days ago shinain tarma shook her head baffled shed been spending most of her free time sleeping your dear friend leslac oh no she choked justin if ive ever done you any favors keep him away from me leslac roald said curiously minstrel isnt he dark hair swarthy thin popular with women thats him groaned tarma hiding her face in her hands whats it worth to you he asked leaning forward and wearing a slyly humorous expression to get him packed off to valdemar permanently choice of talesedrins herds she said quickly three mares and a stallion and anything but battlesteeds four mares and one of them sworn to be infoal done done done she replied waving her hands frantically stefan old friend roald said turning to the king is it worth an infoal shinain mare to force a swordpoint marriage by royal decree on one motheaten bard roalds face was sober but his eyes danced with laughter for that id force a swordpoint marriage on tindel stefansen chuckled whos the lucky lady countess reine shes actually a rather sweet old biddy unlike her harridan sister who is thank the gods no longer with us im rather fond of her for all that she hasnt the sense of a newhatched chick roald shook his head and sighed a few years back her sister went mad during a storm and killed herself or so its said and nobody wants to find out otherwise im supposed to be keeping an eye on her to keep her out of trouble how delightful oh it isnt too bad she just has this ability to attract men who want to prey on her sensibilities they are of course all of honorable intent of course said stefan solemnly well leslac seems to be another of the same sort its common knowledge in my entourage that the poor dear is absolutely head over heels with him and his music he naturally has been languishing at her feet accepting her presents and swearing undying love when no one else is around i dont doubt i can see it coming now he figures that when i find out ill confront him hell vow he isnt worthy of her being lowborn and all ill agree and hell get paid off but i actually have no objection to lowbornhighborn marriages i expect reines family will be only too happy to see the end of the stream of vultures thats been preying on her and i can see a way of doing two friends a favor here im certain that the threat of royal displeasure if he makes reine unhappy will keep the wandering fancy in line once i get him back with me i tarma said fervently will be your devoted slave for the rest of your life both of you stefan shook his head at her i owe you too much tarma and if this will really make you happy it will trust me it will consider it ordered roald now i have a question for you two fellowconspirators over there what can i do for you if youre serious kethry began totally anything short of being crowned unless the sword sings for you even i cant manage that titles lands wealth i cant quite supply char made too many inroads in the treasury but for years we have wanted to found a joint school kethry said slowly want is actually too mild a word by the edicts of my own mage school now that im an adept i just about have to start a branch of the white winds school what we need really is a place with a big enough building to house our students and teachers and enough lands to support it but that kind of property isnt easily come by because its usually in the hands of nobles or clergy im disappointed stefan said with a grin i thought youd want something hard one of chars hereditary holdings was a fine estate down in the south near the border a large manorhouse a village of its own and an able staff to maintain it it is by the by where i was supposed to end my days in debauchery it has an indoor riding arena attached to the stable because char hated to ride when it rained it has a truly amazing library why it even has a professional salle because the original builder was a notable fighter is that just about what youre looking for tarma had felt her jaw dropping with every word until when stefan glanced over at her with a sly smile and a broad wink she was unable to get her voice to work kethry answered for her windborn gods yes i stefan would you really give it to us well since the property of traitors becomes property of the crown and since i have some very unpleasant memories of the place lady bright im only too pleased that you want it just pay your taxes promptly thats all i ask tarma tried to thank him but her voice still wouldnt work kethry made up for her leaping out of her chair and giving the king a most disrespectful hug and kiss both of which he seemed to enjoy immensely furthermore ill be sending my offspring of both sexes to you for training he continued if nothing else i want them to have the discipline of a good swordmaster something i didnt have maybe that will keep them from being the kind of brat i was this will probably scandalize my nobles oh it will lover mertis laughed but i agree with the notion it will do the children good then my nobles will have to live with being scandalized now i want the rest of you to decide what youd like he said when kethry had resumed her seat but not her calm because im going to do my best by all of you but right now i fear i do have a council session and there are a lot of unpleasant messes char left behind him that need attending to stefan rose and gave his hand to mertis and the two exited gracefully from the library the rest clustered around tarma and her partner congratulating them all but jadrek who had inexplicably vanished the partners made their weary way to their rooms it had been a long day but for tarma a very happy one but kethry was preoccupied and a little disturbed tarma could sense it without any special effort keth she asked finally whats stuck in your craw its jadrek he hasnt said anything or come near me since the night of the rebellion she turned troubled and unhappy eyes on her partner i dont know why i thought he loved me i know i love him and this afternoon just disappearing like that well were official now hes reverting to courtly manners you dont go sneaking around to a ladys room you treat her with respect courtly manners be hanged kethry snapped dammit tarma well be gone soon doesnt he care if he doesnt say something then youll hit him over the head and carry him off like the uncivilized barbarian mercenary i know you are and ill help kethry started laughing at that i hate to tell you this but thats exactly what ive been contemplating go make wishlists of things you think youll be needing for this new school of ours tarma advised her that should keep your mind occupied i have the feeling this is going to sort itself out before long she parted company with her sheenedra at kethrys door they had rooms inside the royal complex now not in the visitors area stefansen was treating them as very honored guests she knew she wasnt alone the moment she closed the door behind her she also knew who it was without warrls helpful hint of its jadrek i let him in he wants to talk tarma hello jadrek she said calmly lighting a candle beside the door before turning around to face him we havent been seeing a lot of you weve missed you ive been thinking he said awkwardly i she crossed her arms and waited for him to continue he straightened his back and hfted his chin tarma shena talesedrin he said with all the earnest solemnity of a high priest have i your permission to pay my court to your oathsister she raised an eyebrow can you give me a good reason why i should her question wilted him he sat down abruptly obviously struggling for words i tarma i love her i really do i love her too much to just play with her i want something formal binding us something in keeping with her honor shes lovely you know that as well as i do but it isnt just her exterior i care for its her mind she challenges me like nobody ive ever known before were equals i want to be her partner not not a i dont know i want to have something like mertis and stefan have and i know well give each other that i want to help you with your schools too i think its a wonderful dream and i want to make it real and work alongside of both of you to make it more than a dream were something more than partners she and i tarma reminded him theres certain things between us that will affect any children kethry may have i took the liberty of asking warrl about that he said blushing i dont have any problem with children with them being raised talesedrin everything i know about the shinain everything ive learned in working with you i would be very very proud if you considered my blood good enough to flow into the clans tarma this is probably going to sound stupid but ive come to love you youve done so much for me more than you guess what i really want is that what weve built with the three of us in the last few months should endure the friendship the love the partnership i never had that before and id do anything right now to prevent losing either of you tarma looked into his pleading eyes and much to his evident shock and delight she took both his hands pulled him up out of his chair into her arms hugged him just short of breaking his ribs and planted a kiss squarely in the middle of his forehead before letting him go again well outclan brother she laughed while i cant speak for the lady i would suggest you trot next door and ask her for her hand yourself because i do know that if you dont youre going to find yourself trussed hand and foot and lying over hellsbanes rump like so much baggage you see we happen to be barbarians and we will do anything to prevent losing you he shala his mouth worked for a moment as he stared at her his eyes brightening with what tarma suspected were tears of joy then he took her face in both his hands kissed her and ran out her door as if joy had put wings on his back better get stefan to pick your successor she called after him because were going to keep you much too busy to putter about in his archives and so they did appendix one dictionary of shinain terms

deep this is the price of commanding this is the price of commanding that if you wont others will so you take your post mindful of each ghost youve a debt to them to fill this is the price of commanding the archivist jadrek i sit amid the dusty books the dust invades my very soul it coats my heart with weariness and chokes it with despair my life lies beached and withered on a lonely bleak uncharted shoal there are no kindred spirits here to understand or care when i was young how often i would feed my hungry mind with tales and sought the fellowship in books i did not find in kin for one does not seek friends when every overture to others fails so all the company i craved i built from dreams within those dreamsfrom all my books of lore i plucked the wonders one by one and waited for the day that i was certain was to come when some new hero would appear whose quest had only now begun with desperate need of lore and wisdom i alone could plumb and then ah then id ride away to join with legend and with song the trusted friend of heroes figured in their words and deeds until that day among the books id dwell but i have dwelt too long and like the books i sit alone a relic no one needs i grow too old i grow too old my aching bones have made me lame and if my futile dream came true i could not live it now the time is past long past when i could ride the wings of fleeting fame the dream is dead beneath the dust as neath the dust i bow so unregarded and alone i tend these fragments of the past poor fool who bartered life and soul on dreams and useless lore and as i watch despair and bitterness enclose my heart at last within my souls dark night i cry out is there nothing more lizard dreams kethry oathbound most folk avoid the pelagir hills where ancient wars and battles were fought with magic not with steel for land and gold and chattels most folk avoid the forest dark for magics still surround it and change the creatures living there and all that dwell around it within a tree upon a hill that glowed at night with magic there lived a lizard named gervase whose life was rather tragic his heart was brave his mind was wise he longed to be a wizard but who would ever think to teach their magic to a lizard so poor gervase would sit and dream or sigh as sadly rueing that fate kept him forever barred from good he could be doing that he had wit and mind and will it cannot be debated he also had the kindest heart that ever gods created one day as gervase sighed and dreamed all in the forest sunning he heard a noise of horse and hound and sounds of two feet running a human stumbled to his glade a human worn and weary dressed in a shredded wizards robe his eyes past hope and dreary the magic of his birthplace gave gervase the gift of speaking he hesitated not at allran to the wizard squeaking hide human hide hide in my tree he danced and pointed madly the wizard stared the wizard gasped then hid himself right gladly gervase at once lay in the sun until the hunt came by him then like a simple lizard now he fled as they came nigh him andglowered in the hollow tree and hissed when they came near him and bit a few dogs noses so theyd yelp and leap and fear him thrice damn that wizard snarled his foe hes slipped our hunters neatly the hounds have surely been misled theyve lost the trail completely he whipped the the dogs off of the tree and sent them homeward running and never once suspected it was all gervases cunning the wizard out of hiding crept thrice blessing i accord you and is there somehow any way i can at all reward you i want to be a man like you gervase replied unthinking a wizardor a man replied the mage who stared unblinking for i can only grant you one the form of man or power what will you choose choose wisely i must leave within the hour gervase in silence sat and thought his mind in turmoil churning and first the one choice thinking on then to the other turning yes he could have the power he craved the magic of a wizard but whod believe that power lived inside a lowly lizard or he could have the form of man but what could he do in it and all the good he craved to dohow then could he begin it within the councils of the wise there sits a welcome stranger his word is sought by high and low if there is need or danger he gives his aid to all who ask who need one to defend them and every helpless creature knows he lives but to befriend them and though his form is very strange compared to those beside him the mages care not for the form but for the mind inside him for though hes small and brightly scaled they do not see a lizard hes called by all both great and small gervase the noble wizard hes known by all both great and small gervase the lizard wizard lovers untrue tarma swordsworn i shall

miles from keep or hold a troupe of guards comes riding with a lady and her gold riding in the center shrouded in her cloak of fur companioned by a maiden and a toothless aged cur three things see no end a flower blighted ere it bloomed a message that was wasted and a journey that is doomed one among the guardsmen has a shifting rest less eye and as they ride he scans the hills that rise against the sky he wears both sword and bracelet worth more than he can afford and hidden in his baggage is a heavy secret hoard of three things be wary of a feather on a cat the shepherd eating mutton and the guardsman that is fat from ambush bandits screaming charge the packtrain and its prize and all but four within the train are taken by surprise and all but four are cut down as a woodsman fells a log the guardsman and the lady and the maiden and the dog three things know a secretfirst the lady in a dream the dog that barks no warning and the maid who does not scream then off the lady pulls her cloak in armor she is clad her sword is out and ready and her eyes are fierce and glad the maiden gestures briefly and the dogs a cur no more a wolf swordmaid and sorceress now face the bandit corps three things never anger or you will not live for long a wolf with cubs a man with power and a womans sense of wrong the bandits growl a challenge and the lady only grins the sorceress bows mockingly and then the fight begins when it ends there are but four left standing from that horde the witch the wolf the traitor and the woman with the sword three things never trust in the maiden sworn as pure the vows a king has given and the ambush that is sure they strip the traitor naked and they whip him on his way into the barren hillsides like the folks he used to slay they take a thorough vengeance for the women he cut down and then they mount their horses and they journey back to town three things trust and cherish well the horse on which you ride the beast that guards and watches and the sister at your side
