julian comstock a story of nd century america by robert charles wilson we read the past by the light of the present and the forms vary as the shadows fall or as the point of vision alters james anthony froude look not for roses in attalus his garden or wholesome flowers in a venomous plantation and since there is scarce any one bad but some others are the worse for him tempt not contagion by proximity and hazard not thyself in the shadow of corruption sir thomas browne crowns generally speaking have thorns arthur e hertzler to mr william taylor adams of massachusetts who might not have approved of it this book is nevertheless respectfully and gratefully dedicated prologue i mean to set down here the story of the life and adventures of julian comstock better known as julian the agnostic or after his uncle julian conqueror readers familiar with the name will naturally expect scenes of blood and betrayal including the war in labrador and julians runin with the church of the dominion i witnessed all those events firsthand and at closer proximity than i might have liked and they are all described in the five acts as i call them that follow in the company of julian comstock i traveled from the pinebark eden in which i was born all the way to mascouche lake melville manhattan and stranger places i saw men and governments rise and fall and i woke many a morning with death staring me in the face some of the memories i mean to set down arent pleasant ones or flattering and i tremble a little at the prospect of reliving them but i intend to spare no onewe were what we were and we became what we became and the facts will ennoble or demean us as the reader chooses to see it but i begin the story the way it began for mein a town in the boreal west when julian was young and i was young and neither of us was famous act one a pinebark eden or the caribouhorn train christmas and the same fires which were kindled for heretics will serve for the destruction of philosophers hume a philosopher in october of the year the election show came to townjulian comstock and i along with his mentor sam godwin rode to the tip east of williams ford where i came to possess a book and julian tutored me in one of his heresies there was a certain resolute promptness to the seasons in athabaska in those days summers were long and hot december brought snow and sudden freezes and most years the river pine ran freely by the first of march spring and fall were mere custodial functions by comparison today might be the best we would get of autumnthe air brisk but not cold the long sunlight unhindered by any cloud it was a day we ought to have spent under sam godwins tutelage reading chapters from the dominion history of the union or otiss war and how to conduct it but sam wasnt a heartless overseer and the gentle weather suggested the possibility of an outing so we went to the stables where my father worked and drew horses and rode out of the estate with lunches of black bread and salt ham in our backsatchels at first we headed south along the wire road away from the hills and the town julian and i rode ahead while sam paced his mount behind us his pittsburgh rifle in the saddle holster at his side there was no perceptible threat or danger but sam godwin believed in preparednessif he had a gospel it was be prepared also shoot first and probably damn the consequences sam who was nearly fifty winters old wore a dense brown beard stippled with white hairs and was dressed in what remained presentable of his army of the californias uniform sam was nearly a father to julian julians own true father having performed a gallows dance some years before and lately sam had been more vigilant than ever for reasons he hadnt discussed at least with me julian was my age seventeen and we were approximately the same height but there the resemblance ended julian had been born an aristo or eupatridian as they say back east while my family was of the leasing class his face was smooth and pale mine was dark and lunar scarred by the same pox that took my sister flaxie to her grave in his yellow hair was long and almost femininely clean mine was black and wiry cut to stubble by my mother with her sewing scissors and i washed it once a weekmore often in summer when the creek behind the cottage warmed to a pleasant temperature his clothes were linen and silk brassbuttoned cut to fit my shirt and pants were coarse hempen cloth sewn to a good approximation but clearly not the work of a new york tailor and yet we were friends and had been friends for three years ever since we met by chance in the hills west of the duncan and crowley estate we had gone there to hunt julian with his rifle and me with a simple muzzleloader and we crossed paths in the forest and got to talking we both loved books especially the boys books written by an author named charles curtis easton whom i would meet when he was sixty years old and i was a newcomer to the book tradebut i anticipate myself i had been carrying a copy of eastons against the brazilians illicitly borrowed from the estate libraryjulian recognized the title but vowed not to rat on me for possessing it since he loved the book as much as i did and longed to discuss it with a fellow enthusiastin short he did me an unbegged favor and we became fast friends despite our differences in those early days i hadnt known how fond he was of philosophy and such petty crimes as that but i suppose it wouldnt have mattered to me if i had today julian turned east from the wire road and took us down a lane bordered by splitrail fences on which dense blackberry gnarls had grown up between fields of wheat and gourds just lately harvested before long we passed the rude shacks of the estates indentured laborers whose nearnaked children gawked at us from the dusty laneside and i deduced that we were headed for the tip because where else on this road was there to gounless we continued on for many hours more all the way to the ruins of the old oil towns left over from the days of the false tribulation the tip was located a distance from williams ford in order to prevent poaching and disorder there was a strict pecking order to the tip it worked this way professional scavengers hired by the estate brought their pickings from ruined places to the tip which was a pinefenced enclosure a sort of stockade in an open patch of grassland there the newlyarrived goods were roughly sorted and riders were dispatched to the estate to make the highborn aware of the latest discoveries then various aristos or their trusted servants rode out to claim the prime gleanings the next day the leasing class would be allowed to sort through what was left and after that if anything remained indentured laborers could rummage through it if they calculated it was worthwhile to make the journey every prosperous town had a tip though in the east it was sometimes called a till a dump or an eebay today we were lucky a dozen wagonloads of scrounge had just arrived and riders hadnt yet been sent to notify the estate the gate of the enclosure was manned by an armed reservist who looked at us suspiciously until sam announced the name of julian comstock then the guard briskly stepped aside and we went inside the fence a chubby tipman eager to show off his bounty hurried toward us as we dismounted and moored our horses happy coincidence he cried gentlemen addressing mostly sam by this remark with a cautious smile for julian and a disdainful sidelong glance at me anything in particular youre looking for books said julian before sam or i could answer books wellordinarily i set aside books for the dominion conservator this boy is a comstock sam said i dont suppose you mean to balk him the tipman promptly reddened no not at allin fact we came across something in our digginga sort of library in miniatureill show you if you like that was intriguing especially to julian who beamed as if he had been invited to a christmas party and we followed the stout tipman to a freshlyarrived canvasback wagon from which a shirtless laborer was tossing bundles into a stack beside a tent the twinewrapped bales contained booksancient books wholly free of the dominion stamp of approval they must have been more than a century old for although they were faded it was obvious that they had once been colorful and expensively printed not made of stiff brown paper like the charles curtis easton books of modern times they had not even rotted much their smell under the cleansing athabaska sunlight was inoffensive sam julian whispered ecstatically he had already drawn his knife and he began slicing through the twine calm down said sam who wasnt an enthusiast like julian oh but sam we should have brought a cart we cant carry away armloads julian nor would we ever be allowed to the dominion scholars will have all this and most of it will be locked up in their archive in new york city if it isnt burned though i expect you can get away with a volume or two if youre discreet about it the tipman said these are from lundsford lundsford was the name of a ruined town twenty miles or so to the southeast the tipman leaned toward sam godwin and said we thought lundsford had been mined out a decade ago but even a dry well may freshen one of my workers spotted a low place off the main excavationa sort of sinkhole the recent rain had cut it through once a basement or warehouse of some kind oh sir we found good china there and glasswork and many more books than this most hopelessly mildewed but some had been wrapped in a kind of oilcoth and were lodged under a fallen ceiling there had been a fire but they survived it good work tipman sam godwin said with palpable disinterest thank you sir perhaps you could remember me to the men of the estate and he gave his name which i have forgotten julian knelt amidst the compacted clay and rubble of the tip lifting up each book in turn and examining it with wide eyes i joined him in his exploration though i had never much liked the tip it had always seemed to me a haunted place and of course it was hauntedit existed in order to be hauntedthat is to house the revenants of the past ghosts of the false tribulation startled out of their centurylong slumber here was evidence of the best and worst of the people who had inhabited the years of vice and profligacy their fine things were very fine their glassware especially and it was a straitened aristo indeed who did not sit down to an antique tablesetting rescued from some ruin or other sometimes you might find useful knives or other tools at the tip coins were common the coins were never gold or silver and were too plentiful to be worth much individually but they could be worked into buttons and such adornments one of the highborn back at the estate owned a saddle studded with copper pennies all from the year i had often been enlisted to polish it and disliked it for that reason here too was the trash and inexplicable detritus of the old times plastic gone brittle with sunlight or soft with the juices of the earth bits of metal blooming with rust electronic devices blackened by time and imbued with the sad inutility of a tensionless spring engine parts corroded copper wire rotten with verdigris aluminum cans and steel barrels eaten through by the poisonous fluids they had once containedand so on almost ad infinitum here as well were the inbetween things the curiosities as intriguing and as useless as seashells put down that rusty trumpet adam youll cut your lip and poison your bloodmy mother when we had visited the tip many years before i met julian there had been no music in the trumpet anywayits bell was bent and corroded through more than that though there hovered above the tip any tip the uneasy knowledge that all these things fine or corrupt had outlived their makershad proved more imperishable in the long run than flesh or spirit for the souls of the secular ancients are almost certainly not first in line for resurrection and yet these books they tempted eye and mind alike some were decorated with beautiful women in various degrees of undress i had already sacrificed my claim to spotless virtue with certain young women at the estate whom i had recklessly kissed at the age of seventeen i considered myself a jade or something like one but these images were so frank and impudent they made me blush and look away julian ignored them as he had always been invulnerable to the charms of women he preferred the more denselywritten material he had already set aside a spotted and discolored textbook of biology he found another volume almost as large and handed it to me saying here adam try thisyou might find it enlightening i inspected it skeptically the book was called a history of mankind in space the moon again i said read it for yourself tissue of lies im sure with photographs photographs prove nothing those people could do anything with photographs well read it anyway said julian in truth the idea excited me we had had this argument many times especially on autumn nights when the moon hung low and ponderous on the horizon people have walked there julian would say pointing at that celestial body the first time he made the claim i laughed at him the second time i said yes certainly i once climbed there myself on a greased rainbow but he had been serious oh i had heard these stories who hadnt men on the moon what surprised me was that someone as welleducated as julian would believe them just take the book he insisted what to keep certainly to keep believe i will i muttered and i stuck the object in my backsatchel and felt both proud and guilty what would my father say if he knew i was reading literature without a dominion stamp what would my mother make of it of course i wouldnt tell them at this point i backed off and found a grassy patch a little away from the rubble where i could sit and eat lunch while julian went on sorting through the old texts sam godwin came and joined me brushing a spot on a charred timber so he could sit without soiling his uniform such as it was he loves those musty old books i said making conversation sam was often taciturnthe very picture of an old veteranbut today he nodded and spoke familiarly hes learned to love them and i helped to teach him his father wanted him to know more of the world than the dominion histories of it but i wonder if that was wise in the long run he loves his books too dearly i think or gives them too much credence it might be theyll kill him one of these days how sam by the apostasy of them he debates with the dominion clergy just last week i found him arguing with ben kreel our local representative of the council of the dominion in effect the mayor of the town about god and history and such abstractions which is precisely what he must not do if he means to survive the next few years why what threatens him the jealousy of the powerful said sam but he would say no more on the subject only stroked his graying beard and glanced occasionally and uneasily to the east eventually julian had to drag himself from his nest of books with only a pair of prizes the introduction to biology and another volume called geology of north america time to go sam insisted better to be back at the estate by supper so we wouldnt be missed soon enough the official pickers would arrive to cull what we had left but i have said that julian tutored me in one of his apostasies this is how it happened as we headed home we stopped at the height of a hill overlooking the town of williams ford and the river pine as it cut through the low places on its way from the mountains of the west from here we had a fine view of the steeple of the dominion hall and the revolving waterwheels of the grist mill and the lumber mill all blue in the long light and hazy with coalsmoke and far to the south a railway bridge spanning the gorge of the pine like a suspended thread go inside the weather seemed to proclaim its fair but it wont be fair for long bolt the window stoke the fire boil the apples winters due we rested our horses on that windy hilltop as the afternoon softened toward evening and julian found a blackberry bramble where the berries were still plump and dark and we plucked some of these and ate them that was the world i had been born into it was an autumn like every autumn i could remember drowsy in its familiarity but i couldnt help thinking of the tip and its ghosts maybe those people the people who had lived through the efflorescence of oil and the false tribulation had felt about their homes and neighborhoods just as i felt about williams ford they were ghosts to me but they must have seemed real enough to themselvesmust have been real had not realized they were ghosts and did that mean i was also a ghost a revenant to haunt some future generation julian saw my expression and asked what was troubling me i told him my thoughts now youre thinking like a philosopher he said grinning no wonder theyre such a miserable brigade then unfair adamyouve never seen a philosopher in your life julian believed in philosophers and claimed to have met one or two well i imagine theyre miserable if they go around thinking of themselves as ghosts and such its the condition of all things julian said this blackberry for example he plucked one and held it in the pale palm of his hand has it always looked like this obviously not i said impatiently once it was a tiny green bud of a thing and before that it was part of the substance of the bramble which before that was a seed inside a blackberry and round and round for all eternity but no adam thats the point the bramble and that tree over there and the gourds in the field and the crow circling over themtheyre all descended from ancestors that didnt quite resemble them a blackberry or a crow is a form and forms change over time the way clouds change shape as they travel across the sky forms of what of dna julian said earnestly the biology he had picked out of the tip was not the first biology he had read julian sam said i once promised this boys parents you wouldnt corrupt him ive heard of dna i said its the life force of the secular ancients and its a myth like men walking on the moon exactly like and whos your authority on this ben kreel the dominion history of the union everything changes except dna thats a peculiar argument even from you julian it would be if i were making it but dna isnt changeless it struggles to remember itself but it never remembers itself perfectly remembering a fish it imagines a lizard remembering a horse it imagines a hippopotamus remembering an ape it imagines a man julian sam was insistent now thats enough you sound like a darwinist i said yes julian admitted smiling in spite of his unorthodoxy the autumn sun turning his face the color of penny copper i suppose i do that night i lay in bed until i was reasonably certain both my parents were asleep then i rose lit a lamp and took the new or rather very old history of mankind in space from where i had hidden it behind a pinewood chest i leafed through the brittle pages of it i didnt read the book i would read it but tonight i was too weary to pay close attention and in any case i wanted to savor the words lies and fictions though they might be not rush through them like a glutton tonight i meant only to sample itto look at the pictures in other words there were dozens of photographs and each one captured my attention with fresh marvels and implausibilities one of them showed or purported to show men standing on the surface of the moon just as julian had described the men in the picture were americans they wore flags stitched to the shoulders of their moon clothing an archaic version of our own flag with something less than the customary sixty stars their clothing was white and ridiculously bulky like the winter clothes of the inuit and they wore helmets with golden visors that hid their faces i supposed it must be very cold on the moon if explorers required such cumbersome protection they must have arrived in winter however there was no ice or snow in the neighborhood the moon seemed to be little more than a desertdry as a stick and dusty as a tipmans wardrobe i cannot say how long i stared at this picture puzzling over it it might have been an hour or more nor can i accurately describe how it made me feellarger than myself but lonely too as if i had grown as tall as the clouds and lost sight of every familiar thing by the time i closed the book i saw that the moon had risen outside my windowthe real moon i mean a harvest moon fat and orange halfhidden behind windtattered clouds i found myself wondering whether it was truly possible that men had visited that celestial orb whether as the pictures implied they had ridden there on rockets rockets a thousand times larger than our familiar independence day fireworks but if men had visited the moon why hadnt they stayed there was it so inhospitable a place that no one wanted to remain or perhaps they had stayed and were living there still if the moon was such a cold place i reasoned people living on its surface would be forced to build fires to keep warm there seemed to be no wood on the moon judging by the photographs so they must have resorted to coal or peat i went to the window and examined the moon minutely for any sign of campfires pit mining or other lunar industry but i could see none it was only the moon mottled and changeless i blushed at my own gullibility replaced the book in its hiding place chased all these recreant thoughts from my mind with a hasty prayer and eventually fell asleep it falls to me to explain something of williams ford and of my familys place in it and julians before i describe the threat sam godwin feared which materialized in our village not long before christmas i beg the readers patience if i detail matters that seem wellknown i indulge the possibility of a foreign audience or a posterity to whom our present arrangements are not selfevident situated at the head of the valley was the font of our prosperity the duncan and crowley estate it was a country estate owned by two new york mercantile families with hereditary senate seats who maintained their villa not only as a source of income but as a resort safely distant several days journey by train from the intrigues and pestilences of the eastern cities it was inhabitedruled i might saynot only by the duncan and crowley patriarchs but by a whole legion of cousins nephews relations by marriage and distinguished guests in search of clean air and rural views our corner of athabaska was blessed with a benign climate and pleasant scenery according to the season and these things attract idle aristos the way strong butter attracts flies it remains unrecorded whether the town existed before the estate or vice versa but certainly the town depended on the estate for its prosperity in williams ford there were essentially three classes the owners or aristos below them the leasing class who worked as smiths carpenters coopers overseers gardeners beekeepers etc and whose leases were repaid in service and finally the indentured laborers who worked as field hands inhabited rude shacks east of the river pine and received no compensation beyond bad food and worse lodging my family occupied an ambivalent place in this hierarchy my mother was a seamstress she worked at the estate as had her mother before her my father however had arrived in williams ford as a bondless transient and his marriage to my mother had been controversial he had married a lease as the saying goes and had been taken on as a stablehand at the estate in lieu of a dowry the law in athabaska allowed such unions but popular opinion frowned on them my mother had retained only a few friends of her own class after the wedding her blood relations had since died perhaps of embarrassment and as a child i was often mocked and derided for my fathers low origins on top of that was the thorny issue of our religion we werebecause my father waschurch of signs which is a marginal church every christian church in america was required to secure formal approval from the council of registrars of the dominion of jesus christ on earth if it wanted to operate without the imposition of crippling federal taxes the dominion is sometimes called the church of the dominion but thats a misnomer since every church is a dominion church as long as its recognized by the council dominion episcopal dominion presbyterian dominion baptisteven the catholic church of america since it renounced its fealty to the pope of rome in all are included under the dominionist umbrella since the purpose of the dominion is not to be a church but to certify churches in america were entitled by the constitution to worship at any church we please as long as its a genuine christian congregation and not some fraudulent or satanistic sect the dominion exists to make that distinction also to collect fees and tithes to further its important work we were as i said church of signs a denomination shunned by the leasing class and grudgingly recognized but never fully endorsed by the dominion it was popular mostly with the illiterate transient workers among whom my father had been raised our faith took for its master text that passage in mark which proclaims in my name they will cast out devils and speak in new tongues they will handle serpents and if they drink poison they will not be sickened by it we were snakehandlers in other words and famous beyond our modest numbers for it our congregation consisted of a dozen farmhands most of them lately arrived from the southern states my father was its deacon though we didnt use that title and we kept snakes for ritual purposes in wire cages on our back acre a practice that contributed very little to our social standing that had been the situation of our family when julian comstock arrived in williams ford as a guest of the duncan and crowley families along with his mentor sam godwin and when julian and i met while hunting at that time i had been apprenticed to my father who had risen to the rank of an overseer at the estates lavish and extensive stables my father loved and understood animals especially horses unfortunately i was not made in the same mold and my relations with the stables equine inhabitants rarely extended beyond a brisk mutual tolerance i didnt love my jobwhich consisted of sweeping straw shoveling ordure and in general doing those chores the older stablehands felt to be beneath their dignityso i was pleased when my friendship with julian deepened and it became customary for a household amanuensis to arrive unannounced and request my presence at the house since the request emanated from a comstock it couldnt be overruled no matter how fiercely the grooms and saddlers gnashed their teeth to see me escape their autocracy at first we met to read and discuss books or hunt together later sam godwin invited me to audit julians lessons for he had been charged with julians education as well as his general welfare fortunately i had already been taught the rudiments of reading and writing at the dominion school and refined these skills under the tutelage of my mother who believed in the power of literacy as an improving force my father could neither read nor write and it was not more than a year after our first acquaintance that sam presented himself one evening at my parents cottage with an extraordinary proposal mr and mrs hazzard sam had said putting his hand up to touch his army cap which he had removed when he entered the cottage so that the gesture looked like an aborted salute you know of course about the friendship between your son and julian comstock yes my mother said and worry over it often enoughmatters at the estate being what they are my mother was a small woman delicate in stature but forceful with ideas of her own my father who spoke seldom on this occasion spoke not at all only sat in his chair gripping a laurelroot pipe which he did not light matters at the estate are exactly the crux of the issue sam godwin said im not sure how much adam has told you about our situation there julians father general bryce comstock who was my friend as well as my commanding officer shortly before his death charged me with julians care and wellbeing before his death my mother pointed out at the gallows for treason sam winced thats true mrs hazzardi cant deny itbut i assert my belief that the trial was unfair and the verdict unjust just or not however it doesnt alter my obligation as far as the son is concerned i promised to care for the boy and i mean to keep my promise a christian sentiment my mother said not entirely disguising her skepticism as for your implication about the estate and the practices of the young eupatridians there i agree with you entirely which is why i approved and encouraged julians friendship with your son apart from adam julian has no reliable friends the estate is such a den of venomous snakesno offense he added remembering our religious affiliation and making the common but mistaken assumption that congregants of the church of signs necessarily like snakes or feel some kinship with themno offense but i would sooner allow julian to associate with uh scorpions striking for a more palatable simile than abandon him to the sneers machinations ruses and ruinous habits of his peers that makes me not only his teacher but his constant companion but im more than twice his age mrs hazzard and he needs a friend more nearly of his own growth what do you propose exactly mr godwin i propose to take on adam as a second student to the ultimate benefit of both boys sam was ordinarily a man of few wordseven as a teacherand he seemed as exhausted by this oration as if he had lifted some great weight as a student of what mr godwin mechanics history grammar and composition martial skills adam already knows how to fire a rifle pistolwork sabrework fistfightingbut thats only a fraction of it sam added hastily julians father asked me to cultivate the boys mind as well as his reflexes my mother had more to say on the subject chiefly about how my work at the stables helped offset the familys leases and how difficult it would be to get along without those extra vouchers at the estate store but sam had anticipated the point he had been entrusted by julians motherthat is to say the sisterinlaw of the presidentwith a discretionary fund for julians education which could be tapped to compensate for my absence from the stables and at a handsome rate he quoted a number and the objections from my parents grew less strenuous and were finally whittled away to nothing i observed all this from a room away through a gap in the door which is not to say there were no misgivings before i set off for the estate the next day this time to visit one of the great houses rather than to shovel ordure in the stables my mother warned me not to entangle myself in the affairs of the highborn i promised her i would cling to my christian virtuesa hasty promise less easily kept than i imagined julians somewhat feminine nature had won him a reputation among the other young aristos as a sodomite that they could believe this of him without evidence is testimony to the tenor of their thoughts as a class but it had occasionally redounded to my benefit on more than one occasion his female acquaintancessophisticated girls of my own age or oldermade the assumption that i was julians intimate companion in a physical sense whereupon they undertook to cure me of my deviant habits in the most direct fashion i was happy to cooperate with these cures and they were successful every time it may not be your morals that are at risk she said the highborn conduct themselves by their own rules and the games they play have mortal stakes you do know that julians father was hanged julian had never spoken of it and i had never pressed him but it was a matter of public record i repeated sams assertion that bryce comstock had been innocent he may well have been thats exactly the point there has been a comstock in the presidency for the past thirty years and the current comstock is said to be jealous of his power the only real threat to the reign of julians uncle was the ascendancy of his brother who made himself dangerously popular in the war with the brazilians i suspect mr godwin is correctbryce comstock was hanged not because he was a bad general but because he was a successful one no doubt such scandals were possible i had heard stories about life in new york city where the president resided that would curl a cynics hair but what could these things possibly have to do with me or even julian we were only boys such was my naïveté the days had grown short and thanksgiving had come and gone and so had november and snow was in the airthe tang of it anywaywhen fifty cavalrymen of the athabaska reserve rode into williams ford escorting an equal number of campaigners and polltakers most people in williams ford despised the athabaskan winter i wasnt one of them i didnt mind the cold and the darkness not so long as there was a hardcoal heater in the kitchen a spirit lamp to read by on long nights and the chance of wheatcakes or headcheese for breakfast and christmas was coming up fastone of the four universal christian holidays recognized by the dominion the others being thanksgiving easter and independence day my favorite of these had always been christmas it was not so much the gifts which were generally meagerthough last year i had received from my parents the lease of a muzzleloading rifle mine to carry of which i was exceptionally proudnor was it entirely the spiritual substance of the holiday which im ashamed to say seldom entered my mind except when it was thrust upon me at religious services what i loved was the combined effect of brisk air frostwhitened mornings pine and holly wreaths nailed to doorways cranberryred banners draped across the main street to flap cheerfully in the cold wind carols and hymns chanted or sung i liked the clockwork regularity of it as if a particular cog on the wheel of time had engaged with neat precision but this year it was an illomened season the body of reserve troops rode into town on the fifteenth of december ostensibly they had come to conduct the presidential election national elections were a formality in williams ford and in all such places distant from the national capital by the time our citizens were polled the outcome was a foregone conclusion already decided in the populous eastern statesthat is when there was more than one candidate which was very seldom for the last six electoral years no individual or party had contested the federal election and we had been ruled by one comstock or another for three decades election had become indistinguishable from acclamation but that was all right because an election was still a momentous event almost a kind of circus involving the arrival of polltakers and campaigners who always had a fine show to put on and this yearthe rumor emanated from high chambers of the estate and had been whispered everywherethere would be a movie shown in the dominion hall i had never seen any movies though julian had described them to me he had seen them often in new york city when he was younger and whenever he grew nostalgicfor life in williams ford was sometimes too sedate for julians tasteit was the movies he was provoked to mention and so when the showing of a movie was announced as part of the electoral process both of us were excited and we agreed to meet behind the dominion hall at the appointed hour neither of us had any legitimate reason to be there i was too young to vote and julian would have been conspicuous and perhaps unwelcome as the only aristo at a gathering of the leasing class the highborn had been polled independently at the estate and had already voted proxies on behalf of their indentured labor so i let my parents leave for the hall early in the evening and i followed surreptitiously taking one of my fathers horses and arrived just before the event was scheduled to begin i waited behind the meeting hall where a dozen leasehorses were tethered until julian arrived on a much finer animal borrowed from the estate stables he was dressed in his best approximation of a leasers clothing hempen shirt and trousers of a dark color and a black felt hat with its brim pulled low to disguise his face he dismounted looking troubled and i asked him what was wrong julian shook his head nothing adamor nothing yetbut sam says theres trouble brewing and here he regarded me with an expression verging on pity war he said war theres always war a new offensive well what of it labradors a million miles away obviously your sense of geography hasnt been much improved by sams classes and we might be physically a long distance from the front but were operationally far too close for comfort i didnt know what that meant and so i dismissed it we can worry about that after the movie julian he forced a grin and said yes i suppose so as well after as before so we entered the dominion hall just as the torches were being extinguished and slouched into the last row of crowded pews and waited for the show to start there was a broad wooden stage at the front of the hall all religious appurtenances had been removed from it and a square white screen had been erected in place of the usual pulpit or dais on each side of the screen was a kind of tent in which the players sat with their scripts and dramatic gear speakinghorns bells blocks a drum a pennywhistle and so forth this julian said was a strippeddown edition of what one might find in a fashionable manhattan movie theater in the city the screen and therefore the images projected on it would be larger the players would be more professional for scriptreading and noisemaking were considered fashionable arts and attracted talented artists and there might be additional players stationed behind the screen for dramatic narration or particular sound effects there might even be an orchestra with music written for each individual production the players provided voices for the actors and actresses who appeared in the photographed but silent images as the movie was shown the players observed it by a system of mirrors and could follow scripts illuminated by a kind of binnacle lamp so as not to cast a distracting light and they spoke their lines as the photographed actors spoke so that their voices seemed to emanate from the screen likewise their drumming and bellringing and such corresponded to events within the movie the illusion was quite striking when the players were professional but their lapses could be equally astonishing julian once recounted to me a new york movie production of wm shakespeares hamlet in which a player had come to the theater intoxicated with drink causing the unhappy denmark to seem to exclaim sea of troublesan unprintable oathi have troubles of my own with more obscenities and much inappropriate bellringing and vulgar whistling until an understudy could be hurried out to replace him of course they did it better in the secular era julian whispered and i prayed no one had overheard this indelicate comment by all reports movies had surely been very spectacular during the efflorescence of oilwith recorded sound natural color rather than blackandgray etc but they were also by the same reports hideously impious and often pornographic fortunately or unfortunately from julians point of view no examples were believed to have survived the film stock had long since rotted and digital copies were wholly undecodable these movies belonged to the twentieth and early twentyfirst centuriesthat period of great unsustainable and hedonistic prosperity driven by the burning of earths reserves of perishable oil which culminated in the false tribulation and the wars and the plagues and the painful dwindling of inflated populations to more reasonable numbers our truest and best american antiquity as the dominion history of the union insisted was the nineteenth century whose household virtues and modest industries we had been forced by circumstance to imperfectly restore whose skills were unfailingly practical and whose literature was often useful and improving but i have to confess that some of julians apostasy had infected me i was troubled by unhappy thoughts even as the hall torches were pinched out and ben kreel our dominion pastor pacing in front of the movie screen delivered a lecture on nation piety and duty war julian had said implying not just the everlasting war in labrador but a new phase of it one that might reach its skeletal hand right into williams fordand then what of me and what of my family were here to cast our ballots ben kreel said in his eventual summation a sacred duty at once to our faith and to our country a country so successfully and benevolently stewarded by its leader president deklan comstock whose campaigners i see by the motions of their hands are anxious to get on with the events of the night and so without further ado etc please direct your attention to the presentation of their moving picture first under heaven which they have prepared for our enjoyment the necessary gear had been hauled into williams ford under a canvastop wagon a projection apparatus and a portable swiss dynamo probably captured from the dutch in labrador powered by distilled spirits the dynamo had been installed in a trench freshly dug behind the church in order to muffle its sound which nevertheless came up through the plank floor like the aggravated growling of a huge buried dog that vibration only added to the sense of moment as the last illuminating flame was extinguished and the electric bulb within the mechanical projector flared up the movie began as it was the first i had ever seen my astonishment was complete i was so entranced by the illusion of photographs come to life that the substance of it almost escaped me but i remember an ornate title card and scenes of the second battle of quebec recreated by actors but utterly real to me accompanied by drumbanging and shrill pennywhistling to represent the reports of shot and shell those at the front of the auditorium flinched instinctively while several of the villages prominent women came near to fainting and grabbed up the hands or arms of their male companions who might be as bruised come morning as if they had participated in the battle itself soon enough however the dutchmen under their crossandlaurel flag began to retreat from the american forces and an actor representing the young deklan comstock came to the fore reciting his vows of inauguration a bit prematurely but history was here truncated for the purposes of artthats the one in which he mentions both the continental imperative and the debt to the past he was voiced of course by one of the players a basso profundo whose tones emerged from his speakingbell with ponderous gravity which was also a slight revision of the truth for the genuine deklan comstock possessed a highpitched voice and was prone to petulance the movie then proceeded to more decorous episodes and scenic views representing the glories of the reign of deklan conqueror as he was known to the army of the laurentians which had marched him to his ascendancy in new york city here was the reconstruction of washington dc a project never completed always in progress hindered by a swampy climate and insectborne diseases here was the illumination of manhattan whereby electric streetlights were powered by a hydroelectric dynamo four hours every day between and pm here was the military shipyard at boston harbor the coal mines and rerolling mills of pennsylvania the newest and shiniest steam engines to pull the newest and shiniest trains etc etc i had to wonder at julians reaction to all this this entire show after all had been concocted to extoll the virtues of the man who had executed his father i couldnt forgetand julian must be constantly awarethat the incumbent president here praised was in fact a fratricidal tyrant but julians eyes were riveted on the screen this reflected i later learned not his opinion of current events but his fascination with what he preferred to call cinema this making of illusions in two dimensions was never far from his mindit was perhaps his true calling and would eventually culminate in the creation of julians suppressed cinematic masterwork the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin but i anticipate myself the present movie went on to mention the successful forays against the brazilians at panama during deklan conquerors reign which may have struck closer to home for i saw julian flinch once or twice as exciting as the movie was i found my attention wandering from the screen perhaps it was the strangeness of the event coming so close to christmas or perhaps it was the influence of the history of mankind in space which i had been reading in bed a page or two a night ever since our journey to the tip whatever the cause i was beset by a sudden sense of melancholy here i was in the midst of everything that was familiar and ought to be comfortingthe crowd of the leasing class the enclosing benevolence of the dominion hall the banners and tokens of the christmas seasonand it all felt suddenly thin as if the world were a bucket from which the bottom had dropped out i supposed this was what julian had called the philosophers perspective if so i wondered how the philosophers endured it i had learned a little from sam godwinand more from julian who read books of which even sam disapprovedabout the discredited ideas of the secular era i thought of einstein and his insistence that no particular point of view was more privileged than any other in other words his general relativity and its claim that the answer to the question what is real begins with the question where are you standing was that all i was i wondered here in the cocoon of williams forda point of view or was i an incarnation of a molecule of dna imperfectly remembering as julian had said an ape a fish and an amoeba maybe even the nation that ben kreel praised so extravagantly was only an example of the same trend in naturean imperfect memory of another nation which had itself been an imperfect memory of all the nations before it all the way back to the dawn of man in eden or in africa as julian believed the movie ended with a stirring view of an american flag its thirteen stripes and sixty stars rippling in sunlightbetokening the narrator insisted another four years of the prosperity and benevolence engendered by the rule of deklan conqueror for whom the audiences votes were solicited not that there was any competing candidate known or rumored the completed film flapped against its reel the electric bulb was quickly extinguished the polltakers began to reignite the wall torches several of the leasemen in the audience had lit pipes during the display and their smoke mingled with the smudge of the torches to make a bluegray thundercloud that brooded under the high arches of the ceiling julian seemed distracted and slumped in his pew with his hat pulled low adam he whispered we have to find a way out of here i believe i see one i said its called the doorbut whats the hurry look at the door more closely two men of the reserve have been posted there i looked again and what he said was true but isnt that just to protect the balloting for ben kreel had retaken the stage and was getting ready to ask for a formal show of hands tom shearney the barber with a bladder complaint just tried to leave to use the jakes he was turned back tom shearney was seated less than a yard away from us squirming unhappily and casting resentful glances at the reserve men but after the balloting this isnt about balloting this is about conscription conscription quiet youll start a stampede i didnt think it would begin so soon but weve had telegrams from new york about a defeat in labrador and a call for new divisions once the balloting is finished the campaigners will probably announce a recruitment drive and take the names of everyone present and survey them for the names and ages of their children were too young to be drafted i said for we were both just seventeen not according to what ive heard the rules have been changed to draw in more men oh you can probably find a way to hide out when the culling begins but my presence here is wellknown i dont have a mob to melt away into in fact its probably not a coincidence that so many reservists have been sent to such a little town as williams ford what do you mean not a coincidence my uncle has never been happy about my existence he has no children of his own no heirs and he sees me as a possible competitor for the executive but thats absurd you dont want to be presidentdo you i would sooner shoot myself but uncle deklan has a jealous bent and he distrusts the motives of my mother in protecting me how does a draft help him the entire draft isnt aimed at me but im sure he finds it a useful tool if im drafted no one can complain that hes exempting his own family from the conscription and when he has me in the infantry he can make sure i find myself on the front lines in labradorperforming some noble but suicidal trench attack butjulian cant sam protect you sam is a retired soldier and has no power except what arises from the patronage of my mother which isnt worth much in the coin of the present realm adam is there another way out of this building only the door unless you mean to break a pane of that colored glass that fills the windows somewhere to hide then i thought about it maybe i said theres a room behind the stage where the religious gear is stored you can enter it from the wings we could hide there but it has no exit of its own itll do as long as we can get there without attracting attention that wasnt too difficult for the torches had not all been relit much of the hall was still in shadow and the audience was milling about and stretching while the campaigners got ready to record the vote that was to followthe campaigners were meticulous accountants even though the final tally was a foregone conclusion and the ballrooms were already booked for deklan conquerors latest inauguration julian and i shuffled from one shadow to another giving no appearance of haste until we were close to the foot of the stage we loitered near the entrance to the storage room until a goonish reserve man who had been eyeing us was called away to dismantle the projecting equipmentthat was our chance we ducked through the curtained door into nearabsolute darkness julian stumbled over some obstruction a piece of the churchs tack piano which had been taken apart for cleaning by a traveling pianomechanic who died of a seizure before finishing the job the result being a woody clang that seemed loud enough to alert the whole occupancy of the churchbut didnt what little light there was came through a high glazed window that was hinged so that it could be opened in summer for ventilation it gave a weak sort of illumination for the night was cloudy and only the torches along the main street were shining but the window became a beacon as soon as our eyes adjusted to the dimness perhaps we can get out that way julian said not without a ladder although what speak up adam if you have an idea this is where they store the risersthe long wooden blocks the choir stands on when theyre racked up for a performance maybe those would do julian understood the plan at once and began to survey the shadowy contents of the storage room as intently as he had surveyed the tip for books we found the raw pine risers and managed to stack them to a useful height without causing too much noise in the church hall the campaigners registered a unanimous vote for deklan comstock and then began to break the news about the conscription drive just as julian had surmised some few voices were raised in futile objection ben kreel called loudly for calmno one heard us rearranging the furniture the window was at least ten feet high and painfully narrow and when we emerged on the other side we had to hang by our fingertips before dropping to the ground i bent my right ankle as i landed though no lasting harm was done the night already cold had turned colder we had dropped just near the hitching posts and the horses whinnied at our unexpected arrival and blew steam from their nostrils a fine gritty snow had begun to fall there was not much wind however and christmas banners hung limply in the brittle air julian made straight for his horse and loosed its reins from the post what do we do now i asked you adam will do nothing but protect your own existence while i but he balked at pronouncing his plans and a shadow of anxiety passed over his face we can wait this crisis out i insisted a little desperately the reserves cant stay in williams ford forever no unfortunately neither can i for deklan conqueror knows where to find me where will you go though he put a finger to his mouth there was a noise from the front of the dominion hall the doors had been thrown open and the congregants were beginning to emerge ride after me julian said quick now i did as he asked we didnt follow the main street but caught a path that turned behind the blacksmiths barn and through the wooded border of the river pine north in the direction of the estate the night was dark and the horses stepped slowly but they knew the path almost by instinct and some light from the town still filtered through the thinly falling snow that touched my face like a hundred small cold fingers it was never possible that i could stay at williams ford julian said you ought to have known that adam truly i should have it was julians constant theme after all the impermanence of things he preached it like a sermon i had always put this down to the circumstances of his childhoodthe death of his father the separation from his mother the kind but impersonal tutelage of sam godwin but i couldnt help thinking once more of the history of mankind in space and of the photographs in itnot of the first men on the moon who were americans but of the last visitors to that celestial sphere who had been chinamen and whose space suits had been firecrackerred like the americans they had planted their flag in expectation of more visitations to come but the end of oil and the false tribulation had put paid to those plans then i thought of the even lonelier plains of mars photographed by machines or so the book alleged but never touched by human feet the universe it seemed was full to brimming with lonesome places somehow i had stumbled into one the snow squall ended the uninhabited moon peeked through the clouds and the winter fields of williams ford glowed with an unearthly luminescence if you have to leave i said let me come with you no said julian he had pulled his hat down around his ears to protect himself from the cold and i couldnt see much of his face but his eyes shone when he glanced in my direction thank you adam i wish it were possible but it isnt you must stay here and dodge the draft if possible and polish your literary skills and one day write books like mr charles curtis easton that was my ambition which had grown over the last year nourished by our mutual love of books and by sam godwins exercises in english composition for which i had discovered an unexpected talent not a talent that was born fullyformed however only two years previously i had presented to sam godwin my first finished story which i had called a western boy his adventures in enemy europe sam had praised its style and ambition but called attention to a number of flaws elephants for instance are not native to brussels and are generally too massive to be wrestled to the ground by american lads a journey from london to rome cant be accomplished in a matter of hours even on a very fast horseand sam might have continued in that vein had i not found an excuse to leave the room at the moment it seemed a petty dream none of that matters i said thats where youre wrong julian said you must not make the mistake of thinking that because nothing lasts nothing matters isnt that the philosophical point of view not if the philosopher knows what hes talking about julian reined up his horse and turned to face me something of the imperiousness of his famous family entering into his mien listen adam theres something important you can do for meat some personal risk are you willing yes i said immediately then listen closely before long the reservists will be watching the roads out of williams ford if they arent already i have to leave and i have to leave tonight i wont be missed until morning and then at least at first only by sam what i want you to do is this go homeyour parents will be worried about the conscription and you can try to calm them down but dont allude to any of what happened tonightand first thing in the morning make your way to the estate and find sam tell him what happened at the dominion hall and tell him to ride out of town as soon as he can do so without being caught tell him he can find me at lundsford thats the message lundsford theres nothing at lundsford preciselynothing important enough that the reservists would think to look for us there you remember what the tipman said last fall about the place he found those books a low place near the main excavations tell sam he can look for me there i will i promised blinking against the cold wind which irritated my eyes thank you he said gravely for everything then he forced a smile and for a moment he was no longer the presidents nephew but just julian the friend with whom i had hunted squirrels and gazed at the moon merry christmas adam he said and all the christmases to come then he wheeled his horse about and rode away there is a dominion cemetery in williams ford and i passed it on the ride back home but my sister flaxie wasnt buried there as congregants of the church of signs we werent entitled to plots in the dominion yard flaxie had a place in the acreage behind our cottage marked by a modest wooden cross but the cemetery put the thought of flaxie in my mind and after i returned the horse to the barn i stopped by her grave despite the shivery cold and tipped my hat to her the way i had always tipped my hat to her in life flaxie had been a bright impudent mischievous small thingas goldenhaired as her nickname implied her given name was dolores but she was always flaxie to me the pox had taken her very suddenly and as these things go mercifully i didnt remember her deathi had been down with the same pox though i had survived it what i remembered was waking up from my fever into a house gone strangely quiet no one had wanted to tell me about flaxie but i had seen my mothers tormented eyes and i knew the truth without having to be told death had played lottery with us and flaxie had drawn the short straw it is i think for the likes of flaxie that we keep up a belief in heaven i have met relatively few adults outside the enthusiasts of the established church who believe very fervently in heaven and heaven was scant consolation for my grieving mother but flaxie who was five had believed in it wholeheartedlyimagined it was something like a summer meadow with wildflowers blooming and a picnic eternally under wayand if that childish belief soothed her in her extremity then it served a purpose more noble than truth to night the cottage was almost as quiet as it had been on the morning after flaxies death i came through the door to find my mother dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and my father frowning into the bowl of his pipe as if it had posed a question he couldnt answer the draft he said as if this explained everything which in fact it did i know i said i heard all about it my mother was too distraught to speak my father said well do what we can to protect you adam but im not afraid to serve my country well thats a praiseworthy attitude he said and my mother wept even harder but we dont know whats necessary it might be the situation in labrador isnt as bad as it seems scant of words though my father was i had often enough relied on him for advice which he had freely given he was aware for instance of my distaste for snakes for which reason abetted by my mother i had been allowed to avoid the sacraments of our faith and the venomous swellings and occasional amputations that sometimes followed and although that aversion disappointed him he had nevertheless taught me the practical aspects of snakehandling including how to grasp a serpent in such a way as to avoid its bite and how to kill one should the necessity arise grasp it where its neck ought to be behind the head ignore the tail however it may thrash and crack its skull hard and often enough to subdue iti had recounted these instructions to julian whose horror of serpents far exceeded my own i could never do such a thing he had exclaimed this surfeit of timidity may surprise readers familiar with his later career he was a practical man despite his unusual beliefs but on this occasion his well of advice had run dry he looked like a hunted man who has come to the end of a culdesac and can neither go forward nor safely turn back i went to my bedroom but not to sleep instead i bundled a few of my possessions for easy carryingmy squirrel gun chiefly and some notes and writing and the history of mankind in space i thought i should add some salted pork or something of that nature but i resolved to wait a while so my mother wouldnt see me packing before dawn i put on several layers of clothing and rolled down the rim of my packle hat until the wool covered my ears i opened the window of my room and clambered over the sill and closed the glass behind me after i had retrieved my rifle and gear then i crept across the open yard to the barn where i saddled a horse a gelding named rapture who was fast and strong and rode out under a sky that had just begun to show first light last nights snowfall still covered the ground i was not the first up this winter morning and the cold air already smelled of christmas the bakery in williams ford was making nativity cakes and cinnamon buns and the yeasty smell from the ovens covered the northwest end of town like an intoxicating fog for there was no wind to carry it away the day was dawning blue and still signs of christmas were everywhereas they ought to be for today was the eve of that universal holidaybut so was evidence of the conscription drive the reservists were already awake passing like shadows in their scruffy uniforms and a crowd of them had gathered by the hardware store they had hung out a faded flag and posted a sign which i couldnt read because i was determined to keep a distance between myself and the soldiers but i knew a recruitingpost when i saw one i didnt doubt that the main ways in and out of town had been put under close observation i took a back road to the estate the same riverside road julian and i had traveled the night before in the calm air our tracks had remained undisturbed and i could see that no one else had recently passed this way when i came close to the estate i lashed rapture to a tree in a concealing grove of pines and proceeded on foot the duncancrowley estate was not fenced nor was there any real demarcation of its boundaries for under the leasing system everything in williams ford was owned in the legal sense by the two great families i approached the estate from the western side which was wooded and used by the aristos for casual riding and hunting this morning the copse was not inhabited and i saw no one until i had passed the snowmounded hedges where the formal gardens were planted here in summer apple and cherry trees blossomed and produced fruit flowers bloomed bees nursed in languid ecstasies but now the garden was barren its paths were quilted with snow and there was no one visible except the senior groundskeeper sweeping the portico of the nearest of the several great houses the houses were dressed for christmas christmas was an even grander event at the estate than in the town proper as might be expected the winter population of the duncancrowley estate wasnt as large as its summer population but a number of both families resided here yearround along with their retinues and any cousins and hangerson who felt like hibernating over the cold season sam godwin as julians tutor wasnt permitted to sleep in either of the two most luxurious buildings but bunked among the staff in a whitepillared house which was smaller than its neighbors but would have passed for a tolerable mansion among the leasing class this was where he had conducted lessons for julian and me and i knew the building intimately it too was dressed for christmas pine boughs were suspended over the lintels and a red and white banner of the cross dangled from the eaves the door wasnt lockedi let myself in it was still early in the morning as the aristos calculate time the tiled entranceway was empty and silent i went directly to the room where sam godwin slept and conducted his classes down an oaken corridor lit only by the early sun shining through a single window the floor was carpeted and gave out no sound though my shoes left damp footprints in the weft of it at sams particular door i was confronted with a dilemma i was afraid to knock for fear of alerting others my mission as i saw it was to deliver julians message as discreetly as possible but i couldnt walk in unannounced on a sleeping mancould i i tried the handle of the door it moved freely i opened the door a fraction of an inch meaning to whisper sam and give him some warning but i heard sams voice low and muttering as if he were talking to himself and i stopped and listened more closely the words were strange to me he was speaking a guttural language not english perhaps he wasnt alone it was too late to back away however so i decided to brazen it out i opened the door entirely and stepped inside saying sam its me adam i have a message from julian i stopped short startled by what i saw sam godwinthe same gruff but familiar sam who had taught me the rudiments of history and geographywas practicing black magic or some other form of witchcraftand on christmas eve he wore a striped cowl about his shoulders and leather lacings on his arm and a boxlike implement strapped to his forehead and his hands were upraised over an arrangement of candles mounted in a brass holder that appeared to have been scavenged from some ancient tip the invocation he was murmuring hung like a fading echo in the still air of the room bahrook atah atteneye hello heynoo my jaw dropped adam sam was nearly as startled as i was and he hurriedly pulled the shawl off his back and began to unlace his various unholy riggings this was so irregular i could barely comprehend it then i was afraid i did comprehend it often enough in dominion school i had heard ben kreel talk about the vices and wickedness of the secular era some of which still lingered he said in the cities of the eastirreligiosity skepticism occultism depravity and i thought of the ideas i had so casually imbibed from julian and indirectly from sam some of which i had even begun to believe einsteinism darwinism space travel had i been seduced by the outrunners of some fashionable paganism borne into williams ford from the gutters and alleys of manhattan had i been duped that is by philosophy a message sam said concealing his heathen gear what message where is julian but i couldnt stay i fled the room sam barreled out of the house after me i was fast but he was longlegged and strong for all his fortyodd years and he caught me up in the winter gardenstackled me from behind i kicked and tried to pull away but he pinned my shoulders securely adam for gods sake settle down he cried that was impudent i thought invoking god himbut then he said dont you understand what you saw i am a jew a jew of course i had heard of jews they lived in the bible and in new york city their equivocal relationship with our savior had won them opprobrium down the ages and they were not approved of by the dominion but i had never seen a living jew in the flesh and i was astonished by the idea that sam had been one all along invisibly so to speak you deceived everyone then i said i never claimed to be a christian i never spoke of it at all but what does it matter you said you had a message from juliangive it to me damn you where is he i wondered what i should say or who i might betray if i said it the world had turned upsidedown all ben kreels lectures on patriotism and fidelity came back to me in one great flood of shame had i been a party to treason as well as atheism but i felt i owed this last favor to julian who would surely have wanted me to deliver his intelligence whether sam was a jew or a mohammedan there are soldiers on all the roads out of town i said sullenly julian went for lundsford last night he says hell meet you there now get off of me sam did so sitting back on his heels anxiety inscribed upon his face has it begun so soon i thought they might wait for the new year i dont know what has begun i dont think i know anything at all and so saying i leapt to my feet and ran out of the lifeless garden i fled back to rapture who was tied to the tree where i had left him nosing unproductively in the soft white snow i had traveled perhaps an eighth of a mile back toward williams ford when another rider came up on my flank from behind it was ben kreel himself he touched his cap and said do you mind if i ride with you a ways adam hazzard i could hardly say no ben kreel wasnt a pastorwe had plenty of those in williams ford each catering to his own denominationbut he was the appointed representative of the athabaska branch of the dominion of jesus christ on earth almost as powerful in his way as the men who owned the estate and if he wasnt technically a pastor he was at least a sort of moral shepherd to the townspeople he had been born right here in williams ford son of a saddler had been educated at the estates expense at the dominion college in colorado springs and for the last twenty years he had taught elementary school five days a week and general christianity on sundays i had marked my first letters on a slate board under ben kreels tutelage every independence day he addressed the townsfolk and reminded them of the symbolism and significance of the thirteen stripes and the sixty stars and every christmas he led the ecumenical service at the dominion hall he was stout and gray at the temples cleanshaven he wore a woolen jacket deerskin boots and a packle hat not much grander than my own but he carried himself with an immense dignity as much in the saddle as on foot the expression on his face was kindly but that was no surprise his expression was almost always kindly youre out early adam he said what are you doing abroad at this hour i blushed down to my hairroots nothing i said is there any other word that so spectacularly represents everything it wants to deny under the circumstances nothing amounted to a confession of bad intent couldnt sleep i added hastily thought i might shoot a squirrel or so that would explain the rifle knotted across my saddlehorn and it was at least remotely plausible for the squirrels were still active doing the last of their scrounging before settling in for the cold months on the day before christmas ben kreel asked and in the copse on the grounds of the estate i hope the duncans and crowleys dont hear about it theyre jealous of their trees and im sure gunfire would disturb them at this hour wealthy men and easterners prefer to sleep past dawn as a rule i didnt fire i muttered i thought better of it well good wisdom prevails youre headed back to town yes sir let me keep you company then please do i could hardly say otherwise no matter how i longed to be alone with my thoughts our horses moved slowlythe snow made for awkward footingand ben kreel was silent for a while then he said you neednt conceal your fears adam i think i know whats troubling you for a moment i had the terrible idea that ben kreel had been behind me in the hallway at the estate and that he had glimpsed sam godwin in his old testament paraphernalia wouldnt that create a scandal and then i thought it was exactly such a scandal sam must have feared all his life it was worse even than being church of signs for in some states a jew can be fined or even imprisoned for practicing his faith i didnt know where athabaska stood on the issue but i feared the worst but ben kreel was talking about conscription not about sam ive already discussed this with some of the other boys in town he said youre not alone adam if youre wondering what it all means this military excitement and what might happen as a result of it and youre something of a special case ive been keeping an eye on you from a distance as it were here stop a moment we had come to a bluff above the river pine looking south toward williams ford from a little height gaze at that ben kreel said contemplatively he stretched his arm out in an arc as if to include not just the cluster of buildings that was the town but the empty fields as well and the murky flow of the river and the wheels of the mills and even the shacks of the indentured laborers down in the low country the valley seemed at once a living thing inhaling the crisp atmosphere of the season and breathing out its steams and a portrait static in the still blue winter air as deeply rooted as an oak and as fragile as a ball of nativity glass gaze at that ben kreel repeated look at williams ford laid out pretty there what is it adam more than a place i think its a way of life its the sum of all our labors its what our fathers gave us and its what we give our sons its where we bury our mothers and where our daughters will be buried here was more philosophy then and after the turmoil of the morning i wasnt sure i wanted any but ben kreels voice ran on like the soothing syrup my mother used to administer whenever flaxie or i came down with a cough every boy in williams fordevery boy old enough to submit himself for national serviceis just now discovering how reluctant he is to leave the only place he truly knows and loves even you i suspect im no more or less willing than anyone else im not questioning your courage or your loyalty its just that youve had a little taste of what life might be like elsewhereor so i imagine given how closely you associated yourself with julian comstock now im sure julians a fine young man and an excellent christian he could hardly be otherwise could he as the nephew of the man who holds the nation in his palm but his experience has been very different from yours hes accustomed to citiesto movies like the one we saw at the hall last night and i glimpsed you there didnt i sitting in the back pewsto books and ideas that might strike a youth of your background as exciting and well different am i wrong i could hardly say you are sir and much of what julian may have described to you is no doubt true ive traveled some myself you know adam ive seen colorado springs pittsburgheven new york city our eastern cities are great proud metropolisessome of the biggest and most productive in the worldand theyre worth defending which is one reason were trying so hard to drive the dutch out of labrador surely youre right im glad you agree because theres a trap certain young people are prey to ive seen it before a boy might think one of those great cities is a place he can run away toa place where he can escape all the duties and obligations he learned at his mothers knee simple things like faith and patriotism can feel to a young man like burdens which might be shrugged off when they become too weighty im not like that sir i said though every word he spoke seemed to have my name written all over it and theres yet another element in the calculation the conscription threatens to carry you out of williams ford and the thought that runs through many boys minds is if i must leave then maybe i ought to leave on my own hook and find my destiny on a citys streets rather than in a battalion of the athabaska brigade and youre good to deny it adam but you wouldnt be human if such ideas didnt occur to you no sir i muttered and i felt my guilt increasing for i had in fact been a little seduced by julians tales of city life and sams dubious lessons and the history of mankind in spaceperhaps it was true that i had neglected my obligations to the village that lay so still and so inviting in the blue near distance i know ben kreel said things havent been easy for your family your fathers faith in particular has been a trial and we havent always been good neighbors to youspeaking on behalf of the village as a whole perhaps youve been left out of activities other boys enjoy as a matter of course picnics games friendships well even williams ford isnt paradise but i promise you adam if you find yourself in the brigades and especially if you find yourself tested in time of war youll discover that the same boys who shunned you in the dusty streets of your home town become your best friends and bravest allies and you theirs for our common heritage knits us together in ways that may seem obscure but become obvious under the harsh light of combat i had spent so much time smarting under the remarks of other boys that my father raised vipers the way other folks raise chickens for example that i could hardly credit ben kreels assertion but i knew very little of modern warfare except what i had read in the novels of mr charles curtis easton so it might be true and the prospect as was intended made me feel even more shamefaced there ben kreel said do you hear that adam i did i could hardly avoid it the bell was clanging in the dominion church steeple announcing the early ecumenical service it was a silvery sound on the winter air at once lonesome and consoling and i wanted almost to run toward itto shelter in it as if i were a child again theyll be wanting me ben kreel said will you excuse me if i ride ahead no sir please dont mind about me as long as we understand each other dont look so downcast adam the future may be brighter than you expect thank you for saying so sir i stayed a while longer on the low bluff watching as ben kreels horse carried him toward town even in the sunlight i felt the cold and i shivered some perhaps more because of the conflict in my mind than because of the weather the dominion man had made me ashamed of myself and had put into perspective my loose ways of the last few years and pointed up how many of my native beliefs i had abandoned before the seductive philosophy of an agnostic aristo and an aging jew then i sighed and urged rapture back along the path toward williams ford meaning to explain to my parents where i had been and to reassure them that i wouldnt suffer too much in the coming conscription to which i would willingly submit i was so disheartened by the mornings events that my eyes drifted toward the ground even as rapture retraced his steps as i have said the snows of the night before lay largely undisturbed on this back trail between the town and the estate i could see where i had come through this morning raptures hoofprints having recorded the passage as clearly as figures in a book then i reached the place where julian and i had parted the night before there were more hoofprints here in fact a crowd of them and i saw something else written in effect on the snowy groundsomething which alarmed me i reined up at once i looked south toward williams ford i looked east the way julian had gone last night then i took a bracing inhalation of icy air and followed the trail that seemed to me most urgent the eastwest road through williams ford was not heavily traveled especially in winter the southern road which was called the wire road because the telegraph line runs alongside it connected williams ford to the railhead at connaught and sustained a great deal of traffic but the eastwest road went essentially nowhere it was a remnant of a road of the secular ancients traversed mainly by tipmen and freelance antiquarians and then only in the warmer months i suppose if you followed the old road as far as it would take you you might reach the great lakes or somewhere farther east in that direction or you could ride the opposite way and get yourself lost among washouts and landslips in the rocky mountains but the railroadand a parallel turnpike farther southhad obviated the need for all that trouble still the eastwest road was closely watched where it left the outskirts of williams ford the reserves had posted a man on a hill overlooking it the same hill where julian and sam and i had paused for blackberries on our way from the tip last october but it was a fact that the reserve troops were held in reserve and not sent to the front lines mainly because of a disabling flaw of body or mindsome were wounded veterans missing a hand or an arm some were elderly some were too simple or sullen to function in a disciplined body of men i cant say anything for certain about the soldier posted as lookout on the hill but if he wasnt a fool he was at least utterly unconcerned about concealment for his silhouette and the silhouette of his rifle stood etched against the bright eastern sky for all to see but maybe that was intentional to let prospective fugitives know their way was barred not every way was barred however not for someone who had grown up in williams ford and hunted everywhere on its perimeter instead of following julian directly i rode north a distance and then through an encampment of indentured laborers whose ragged children gaped at me from the glassless windows of their shanties and whose softcoal fires made a smoky gauze of the motionless air this route connected with lanes cut through the wheat fields for the transportation of harvests and fieldhandslanes that had been deepened by years of use so that i rode behind a berm of earth and snake rail fences hidden from the distant sentinel when i was safely east i came down a cattletrail that reconnected me with the eastleading road on which i was able to read the same signs that had alerted me back at williams ford thanks to a fine layer of snow still undisturbed by any wind julian had come this way he had done as he said he would and ridden toward lundsford before midnight the snow had stopped soon after leaving his horses prints clearly visible though softened and halfcovered but his were not the only tracks there was a second set more crisply defined and hence more recent probably set down during the night this was what had caught my attention at the crossroads in williams ford clear evidence of pursuit someone had followed julian without julians knowledge that had dire implications the only redeeming circumstance being the fact of a single pursuer rather than a company of men if the powerful people of the estate had known it was julian comstock who had fled they would have sent an entire battalion to haul him back i supposed julian had been mistaken for an indentured fugitive or a leaseboy fleeing the conscription and that he had been followed by some ambitious reservist acting on his own initiative otherwise that whole imagined battalion might be right behind meor perhaps soon would be since julians absence must have been noticed by now i rode east adding my own track to the previous set it was a long ride noon came and noon went and more hours passed and i began to have second thoughts as the sun angled toward its rendezvous with the southwestern horizon what exactly did i hope to accomplish to warn julian if so i was a little late off the mark though i hoped that at some point julian had covered his tracks or otherwise misled his pursuer who didnt have the advantage i had of knowing where julian meant to stay until sam godwin arrived failing that i halfimagined rescuing julian from capture even though i had but a squirrel rifle and a few rounds of ammunition plus a knife and my own wits both feeble enough weapons against whatever a reservist might carry in any case these were more wishes and anxieties than calculations or plans i had no fullyformed plan beyond riding to julians aid and telling him that i had delivered my message to sam who would follow along as soon as he could discreetly leave the estate and then what it was a question i dared not asknot out on this lonely road well past the tip now farther than i had ever been from williams ford not out here where the flatlands stretched away on every side like the frosty plains of mars and the wind which had been absent all morning began to pluck at the fringes of my coat not when my own shadow was drawn out before me like a scarecrow gone riding it was cold and getting colder and soon the winter moon would be aloft and me with only a few ounces of salt pork in my saddlebag and a dozen matches to make a fire if i was able to secure any kindling by nightfall i began to wonder if i had gone insane i told myself that i could go back that i hadnt yet been missed that it wasnt too late to sit down to a christmas eve supper and wake in time to hear the ringingin of the holiday and smell the goodness of nativity apples drenched in cinnamon and brown sugar i mused on it repeatedly sometimes with tears in my eyes but i let rapture keep on carrying me toward the darkest part of the horizon then after what seemed endless hours of dusk with only a brief pause when both rapture and i drank from a creek which had a skin of ice on it i began to come among the ruins of the secular ancients not that there was anything spectacular about them fanciful drawings often portray the ruins of the last century as tall buildings ragged and hollow as broken teeth forming vineencrusted canyons and shadowy culdesacs or culsdesac my french is rudimentary no doubt such places existmost of them in the uninhabitable southwest however where famine sits enthroned and waves his scepter over a dominion expressly made for him which would rule out vines and such tropical itemsthough old miami or orlando might begin to fit the billbut most ruins were like the ones i now passed mere irregularities or more precisely regularities in the landscape which indicated the former presence of foundations these terrains were treacherous often concealing deep basements that could open like hungry mouths on unwary travelers and only tipmen loved them i was careful to keep to the path though i began to wonder whether julian would be as easy to find as i had imaginedlundsford was a big locality and the wind had begun to scour away the hoofprints i relied on for navigation i was haunted too by thoughts of the false tribulation of the last century it wasnt unusual to come across desiccated old bones in localities like this millions had died in the worst dislocations of the end of oilof disease of fighting but mostly of starvation the age of oil had allowed a fierce intensity of fertilization and irrigation which had fed more people than a humbler agriculture could support i had seen photographs of americans from that blighted age thin as sticks their children with distended bellies crowded into relief camps that would soon enough become communal graves when the imagined relief failed to materialize no wonder then that our ancestors had mistaken those decades for the tribulation of biblical prophecy what was astonishing was how many of our current institutionsthe church the army the federal governmenthad survived more or less intact there was a passage in the dominion bible that ben kreel read to us whenever the subject of the false tribulation arose in school and which i had committed to memory the field is wasted the land mourns for the corn is shriveled the wine is dry the oil languishes be ashamed farmers howl vinekeepers howl for the wheat and the barley for the harvest of the field has perished it had made me shiver then and it made me shiver now in these barrens that had been stripped of all their utility by a century of scavenging where in this rubble was julian and where was his pursuer it was by his fire i found him but i wasnt the first to arrive the sun was altogether down and a filmy aurora played about the northern sky dimmed by a fingernail moon when i came to the most recently excavated part of lundsford the temporary dwellings of the tipmenrude huts of scavenged timberhad been abandoned here for the season and corduroy ramps led down into the empty digs the snow here had been blown into windrows and dunes and all evidence of hoofprints had been erased but i rode slowly and paid close attention to the environs knowing i was close to my goal i was buoyed by the observation that julians pursuer whoever he was hadnt returned this way from his mission had not that is taken julian captive or at least hadnt gone back to williams ford with his prisoner in tow perhaps the pursuit had been suspended for the night a little while laterthough it seemed an eternity as rapture shortstepped down the frozen road dodging pitfallsi heard the whicker of another horse and saw a plume of smoke curl into the moonbright sky quickly i turned rapture off the road and tied his reins to the stump of a concrete pillar i took my squirrel rifle from the saddle holster and moved on foot toward the source of the smoke until i was able to discern that the fumes emerged from a fissure in the landscape perhaps the very dig from which the tipmen had extracted a history of mankind in space months ago surely this was where julian had gone to wait for sams arrival i crept a little farther on and saw julians horse unmistakably a fine estate horse worth more im sure in the eyes of its owner than a hundred julian comstocks moored to an outcropand alarmingly here was another horse as well not far away the second animal was a stranger to me it was slatribbed and elderly in appearance but it wore a military bridle and the sort of cloth bibblue with a red star in itthat marked a mount belonging to the reserves i studied the situation from behind the moonshadow of a fractured abutment the smoke suggested that julian had gone down into the hollow of the tipmens dig to shelter from the cold and bank his fire for the night the presence of the second horse suggested that he had been discovered and that his pursuer must already have confronted him more than that i could not deduce it remained only to approach the contested grounds as closely as possible and see what more i could learn i inched another yard forward the dig was revealed by moonlight as a deep but narrow excavation covered in part with boards with a sloping entrance framed in old timber the glow of the fire within was just visible as was the chimneyhole that had been cut through the planking some distance south there was as far as i could discern only the single way in or out i decided to proceed as far as i could without being seen and to that end i lowered myself down the slope sliding by the seat of my pants over ground that was as cold it seemed to me as the wastelands of the arctic north i was slow i was cautious and i was quiet but i was not slow cautious or quiet enough for i had just got far enough to glimpse an excavated chamber in which the firelight cast a kaleidoscopic flux of shadows when i felt a pressure behind my earthe barrel of a gunand a voice said keep moving mister and join your friend below i kept silent until i could comprehend more of the situation than i presently understood my captor marched me down into the low part of the dig here the air was noticeably warmer and we were screened from the wind though not from the stagnant reek of what once had been a basement or cellar in some establishment of the secular ancients the tipmen hadnt left much behind at the end of the season only a rubble of broken bits of things indistinguishable under layers of dust and dirt the far wall was of concrete and the fire had been banked against it under a chimneyhole that must have been cut by antiquarians in the course of their labors a circle of stones hedged the fiercelyburning fire and the damp planks and splinters in it crackled with a deceptive cheerfulness deeper parts of the excavation with ceilings lower than a man standing erect opened in several directions julian sat near the fire with his back to the wall and his knees drawn up under his chin his clothes had been made filthy by the grime of the place he frowned and when he caught sight of me his frown deepened into a scowl go over there and get beside him my captor said but give me that little bird rifle first i surrendered my weapon modest as it was and joined julian thus i was able to get my first clear look at the man who had captured me he appeared not much older than myself but he was dressed in the blue and yellow uniform of the reserves his reserve cap was pulled low over his eyes which twitched left and right as though he feared an ambush in short he appeared both inexperienced and nervousand maybe a little dim for his jaw was slack and he seemed unaware of the dribble of mucus that had escaped his nostrils as a result of the cold weather his weapon however was very much in earnest and not to be trifled with it was a pittsburgh rifle manufactured by the famous porter earle works which loaded at the breech from a cassette and could fire five rounds in succession without any more attention from its owner than a twitch of the index finger julian had carried a similar weapon but had been disarmed of it it rested against a stack of small staved barrels well out of reach and the reservist put my squirrel rifle beside it i began to feel sorry for myself and to think what a poor way of spending christmas eve i had chosen i didnt resent the action of the reservist nearly as much as i regretted my own stupidity and lapse of judgment i dont know who you are the reservist said and i dont careone draft dodger is as good as the next in my opinionbut i was given the job of collecting runaways and my bag is getting full i hope youll both keep till morning when i can ride you back into williams ford anyhow none of us will sleep tonight i wont in any case so you might as well resign yourself to captivity if youre hungry theres a hank of old pork for you i was never less hungry in my life and i began to say so but julian interrupted its true adam he said were fairly caught i wish you hadnt come after me im beginning to feel the same way i said he gave me a meaningful look and said in a lower voice is sam no whispering there our captor barked but i divined the intent of the question and nodded to indicate that i had communicated julians message though that was by no means a guarantee of our deliverance not only were the exits from williams ford under close watch but sam couldnt slip away as easily as i had and if julians absence had been noted there would have been a redoubling of the guard and probably an expedition sent out to hunt us the man who had captured julian was evidently an outrider assigned to patrol the roads for runaways and he had been diligent in his work but didnt know the significance of the trophies he had bagged he was less diligent now that he had us cornered however for he took a soapstone pipe from his pocket and proceeded to fill it making himself comfortable on a wooden crate his gestures were nervous and i supposed the pipe was meant to relax him for it was not tobacco he put into it perhaps the reservist was a kentuckian for i understand the less respectable people of that state often form the habit of smoking the silk of the female hemp plant which is cultivated prodigiously there kentucky hemp is grown for cordage and cloth and paper and as a drug is less intoxicating than the indian hemp of lore but its mild smoke is said to be pleasant for those who indulge in it though too much can result in sleepiness and great thirst julian evidently thought those symptoms would be a welcome distraction in our captor and he gestured at me to remain silent so as not to interrupt the reservist in his vice the reservist packed his bowl from an oilcloth envelope until it was full and soon the substance was alight and a more fragrant smoke joined the effluvia of the campfire as it swirled toward the ragged gap in the ceiling clearly the night would be a long one and i tried to be patient in my captivity and not think too much of christmas or the yellow light of my parents cottage on dark winter mornings or the soft bed where i might have been sleeping if i had been less rash in my deliberations i began by saying this was a story about julian comstock and i dont mean to turn it into a story about myself perhaps it seems so but theres a reason for it beyond the obvious temptations of vanity and selfregard i did not at the time know julian nearly as well as i thought i did our friendship was a boys friendship i couldnt help reviewing as we sat in silent captivity in the ruins of lundsford all the things we had done together reading books hunting in the foothills west of williams ford arguing amiably over everything from philosophy and moonvisiting to the best way to bait a hook or cinch a bridle it had been too easy during our time together to forget that julian was an aristo with close connections to men of power or that his father had been famous both as a hero and as a traitor or that his uncle deklan comstockdeklan conquerormight not have julians best interests at heart all that seemed far away and distant from the nature of julians true spirit which was gentle and inquisitivea naturalists disposition not a politicians or a generals when i pictured julian as an adult i imagined him pursuing some scholarly or artistic adventure digging the bones of preadamite monsters out of the athabaska shale perhaps or making an improved kind of movie he was not a warlike person and the thoughts of the great men of the day were almost exclusively concerned with war so i had let myself forget that he was also everything he had been before he came to williams ford he was the heir of a brave determined and ultimately betrayed father who had conquered an army of brazilians but had been crushed by the millstone of political intrigue he was the son of a wealthy woman born to a powerful family of her ownnot powerful enough to save bryce comstock from the gallows but powerful enough to protect julian at least temporarily from the mad calculations of his uncle he was both a pawn and a player in the great games of the aristos and while i might have forgotten all this julian hadntthose were the people who had made him and if he chose not to speak of them they nevertheless must have haunted his thoughts its true that he was often frightened of small thingsi remember his disquiet when i described the rituals of the church of signs to him and he would sometimes shriek at the distress of animals when our hunting failed to result in a clean kill but tonight here in the ruins i was the one who halfdozed in a morose funk fighting tears while it was julian who sat intently still as coolly calculating as a bank clerk gazing with resolve from beneath the strands of dusty hair that straggled over his brows when we hunted he often gave me the rifle and begged me to fire the last lethal shot distrusting his own resolve tonighthad the opportunity presented itselfi would have given the rifle to him i halfdozed as i said and from time to time woke to see the reservist still sitting guard his eyelids were at halfmast but i put that down to the effect of the hemp flowers he had smoked periodically he would start as if at a sound inaudible to others then settle back into place he had boiled a copious amount of coffee in a tin pan and he warmed it whenever he renewed the fire and drank sufficiently to keep himself from falling asleep that obliged him periodically to retreat to a distant part of the dig and attend to his physical needs in relative privacy we couldnt take any advantage from it however since he carried his pittsburgh rifle with him but it allowed a moment or two in which julian and i were able to whisper without being overheard the man is no mental giant julian said we may yet get out of here with our freedom its not his brains so much as his artillery thats stopping us i said perhaps we can separate the one from the other look there adam beyond the fire i meanback in the rubble i looked at the place he indicated there was motion in the shadowsa particular sort of motion which i began to recognize the distraction may suit our purposes julian said unless it becomes fatal and i saw the sweat that had begun to stand out on his forehead but i need your help he added i have said that i didnt partake of the particular rites of my fathers church and that snakes were not my favorite creatures as much as i had heard about surrendering ones volition to godand i had seen my father with a massassauga rattler in each hand trembling with devotion speaking in a tongue not only foreign but utterly unknown though it favored long vowels and stuttered consonants much like the sounds he made when he burned his fingers on the coal stovei could never entirely convince myself that i was protected from the serpents bite some in the congregation obviously had not been there was sarah prestley for instance whose right arm had swollen up black with venom until it had to be amputated by williams fords physician but i wont dwell on that the point is that while i disliked snakes i was not especially afraid of them as julian was and i couldnt help admiring his restraint for what was writhing in the shadows nearby was a nest of snakes scorched out of hibernation by the heat of the fire right nearby i should add that it wasnt uncommon for these collapsed ruins to be infested with snakes mice spiders and poisonous insects death by bite or sting was one of the routine hazards faced by professional tipmen including concussion blood poisoning and accidental burial the snakes after the tipmen ceased work for the winter must have crept into this chasm anticipating an undisturbed sleep of which we and the reservist had unfortunately deprived them the reservistwho came back a little unsteadily from his necessarieshad not yet noticed the digs prior tenants he seated himself on his crate and scowled at us and studiously refilled his pipe if he discharges all five shots from his rifle julian whispered tremulously then we have a chance of overcoming him or of recovering our own weapons but adam no talking there the reservist mumbled you must remember your fathers advice julian finished i said keep quiet julian cleared his throat and addressed the reservist directly since the time for action had obviously arrived sir i have to draw your attention to something what would that be my little draft dodger im afraid were not alone in this place not alone the reservist said casting his eyes about him nervously then he recovered and squinted at julian i dont see any other persons i dont mean persons but vipers said julian vipers in other wordssnakes at this the reservist started again his mind perhaps still confused by the effects of the hemp smoke then he sneered and said go on you cant pull that one on me im sorry if you think im joking for there are at least a dozen snakes advancing from the shadows and one of them is about to achieve intimacy with your right boot julians sense of timing was exquisite perhaps as a result of his theatrical inclinations hah the reservist said but he couldnt help glancing in the indicated direction where one of the serpentsa fat and lengthy examplehad lifted its head and was sampling the air above his bootlace the effect was immediate and left no more time for planning the reservist leapt from his seat on the wooden crate uttering oaths and danced backward at the same time attempting to bring his rifle to his shoulder and confront the threat he discovered to his dismay that it wasnt a question of one snake but of dozens and he compressed the trigger of the weapon the resulting shot went wild the bullet impacted near the main nest of the creatures causing them to scatter with astonishing speed like a box of loaded springs unfortunately for the hapless reservist who was directly in their path he cursed and fired four more times most of the shots careened harmlessly one obliterated the midsection of the lead serpent which knotted around its own wound like a bloody rope now adam julian shouted and i stood up thinking my fathers advice my father was a taciturn man and most of his advice had involved the practical matter of running the estates stables i hesitated a moment in confusion while julian advanced toward the captive rifles dancing among the surviving snakes like a dervish the reservist recovering somewhat raced in the same direction and then i recalled the only advice of my fathers that i had ever shared with julian grasp it where its neck ought to be behind the head ignore the tail however it may thrash and crack its skull hard and often enough to subdue it and so i did just thatuntil the threat was neutralized julian meanwhile recovered the weapons and came away from the infested area of the dig he looked with some astonishment at the reservist who was slumped at my feet bleeding from his scalp which i had cracked hard and often against a concrete pillar adam he said when i spoke of your fathers advicei meant the snakes the snakes several of them still twined about the dig but i reminded myself that julian knew very little about the nature and variety of reptiles theyre only corn snakes i explained once confined to the southeast corn snakes have spread north with the warming climate i have read that certain of the secular ancients once kept them as petsyet another instance of our ancestors willful perversity theyre big but theyre not venomous julian his eyes gone large absorbed this information then he looked at the crumpled form of the reservist again have you killed him well i hope not i said we made a new camp in a less populated part of the ruins and kept a watch on the road and at dawn we saw a single horse and rider approaching from the west it was sam godwin julian hailed him waving his arms sam came closer and looked with some relief at julian and then speculatively at me i blushed thinking of how i had interrupted him at his prayers however unorthodox those prayers might have been from a purely christian perspective and how poorly i had reacted to my discovery of his true religion but i said nothing and sam said nothing and relations between us seemed to have been regularized since i had demonstrated my loyalty or patent foolishness by riding to julians aid it was christmas morning i supposed that didnt mean anything in particular to julian or sam but i was poignantly aware of the date the sky was blue again but a squall had passed during the dark hours of the morning and the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even even the ruins of lundsford were transformed into something softedged and oddly beautiful and i was amazed at how simple it was for nature to cloak corruption in the garb of purity and make it peaceful but it wouldnt be peaceful for long and sam said so there are troops behind me as we speak word came by wire from new york not to let julian escape we cant linger here more than a moment where will we go julian asked its impossible to ride much farther east theres no forage for the animals and precious little water sooner or later well have to turn south and make a connection with the railroad or the turnpike its going to be short rations and hard riding im afraid and if we want to make good our escape well need to assume false names well be little better than draft dodgers or labor refugees and i expect well have to pass some time among that hard crew at least until we reach new york city we can find friends in new york it was a plan but it was a large and lonesome one and my heart sank at the prospect of it we have a prisoner julian told his mentor and we escorted sam back into the excavated ruins to explain how we had spent the night the reservist was there his hands tied behind his back still groggy from the punishment i had inflicted on him but well enough to open his eyes and scowl julian and sam spent a little time debating how to deal with this encumbrance we could not of course take him with us the question was how to send him home without endangering ourselves needlessly it was a debate to which i could contribute nothing so i took a little slip of paper from my backsatchel and a pencil and wrote a letter it was addressed to my mother since my father was without the art of literacy you will no doubt have noticed my absence i wrote it saddens me to be away from home especially at this time i write on christmas day but i hope you will be consoled with the knowledge that i am all right and not in any immediate danger that was a lie depending on how you defined immediate but a kindly one i reasoned in any case i would not have been able to remain in williams ford since i could not have escaped the draft for long even if i postponed my military service for some few more months the conscription drive is in earnest i expect the war in labrador is going badly it was inevitable that we should be separated as much as i mourn for my home and all its comforts and it was all i could do not to decorate the page with a vagrant tear please accept my best wishes and my gratitude for everything you and father have done for me i will write again as soon as it is practicable which may not be immediately trust in the knowledge that i will pursue my destiny faithfully and with every christian virtue you have taught me god bless you in the coming and every year that wasnt enough to say but i couldnt spare time for more julian and sam were calling for me i signed my name and added as a postscript please tell father that i value his advice and that it has already served me usefully yrs etc once again adam youve written a letter sam observed as he came to rush me to my horse but have you given any thought to how you might mail it i confessed i had not the reservist can carry it said julian who had already mounted his horse the reservist was also mounted but with his hands tied behind him as it was sams final conclusion that we should set him loose with the horse headed west where he would encounter more troops before very long he was awake but as i have said sullen and he barked im nobodys damned mailman i addressed the message and julian took it and tucked it into the reservists saddlebag despite his youth and despite the slightly dilapidated condition of his hair and clothing julian sat tall in the saddle he was of course an aristo of the highest order but i had never really thought of him as highborn until that moment when he took on the aspect of command with a startling ease and familiarity he said to the reservist we treated you kindly the reservist uttered an oath be quiet you were injured in the conflict but we took you prisoner and we treated you more gently than you treated us when the conditions were reversed i am a comstock and i wont be spoken to crudely by an infantryman at any price youll deliver this boys message and youll do it gratefully the reservist was clearly startled by the assertion that julian was a comstockhe had been laboring under the assumption that we were mere village runawaysbut he screwed up his courage and said why should i because its the christian thing to do julian said and because if this argument with my uncle is ever settled the power to remove your head from your shoulders may well reside in my hands does that make sense to you soldier the reservist allowed that it did and so we rode out that christmas morning from the ruins where the tipmen had discovered a history of mankind in space which i had tucked into my backsatchel like a vagrant memory my mind was a confusion of ideas and anxieties but i found myself recalling what julian had said long ago it now seemed about dna and how it aspired to perfect replication but progressed by remembering itself imperfectly it might be true i thought because our lives were like thattime itself was like that every moment dying and pregnant with its own distorted reflection today was christmas which julian claimed had once been a pagan holiday dedicated to sol invictus or some such roman god but which had evolved into the familiar celebration of the present and was no less dear because of it i imagined i heard the christmas bells ringing from the dominion hall at williams ford though that was impossible for we were miles away and not even the sound of a cannon shot could carry so far across the prairie it was only memory speaking maybe that logic was true of people toomaybe i was already an inexact echo of what i had been just days before and maybe the same was true of julian already something hard and uncompromising had begun to emerge from his gentle featuresthe first manifestation of a freshly evolved julian called forth perhaps by his violent departure from williams ford evolution cant be predicted julian used to tell me its a scattershot business it fires but it doesnt aim perhaps we couldnt know what we were becoming but that was all philosophy and not much use and i kept quiet about it as we spurred our horses toward the railroad the distant east and the whole onrushing future by leaving williams ford in search of the safety and anonymity of a distant city i began to learn something of the imponderable vastness of the nation in which i lived and the surprising variety of its people that useful knowledge was obtained at considerable risk however since we were still pursued by the horsemen of the reserve who considered us less tourists than fugitives after we left the digs at lundsford we found ourselves once more in open country a drear treeless fiefdom unrelieved by the vertical works of man or nature clouds gathered and darkened the wintry sky and by the afternoon we were riding through curtains of squalling snow our horses already tired quickly became exhaustedmy own mount rapture perhaps more than the other two animals for both sam and julian had taken young geldings from the estates stables while rapture was just a working horse thin at the shanks and of an appreciable age indifferent as i generally was to the wants of animalsnot a few of the estates horses and mules had attempted to plant their heels on my skull as i shoveled out their stalls thus alienating my natural sympathyi did begin to feel sorry for rapture and for myself as well as the discomfort of the journey settled into my legs thighs and spine i was relieved when darkness began to gather since it meant we would be obliged to stop and rest but that wasnt a simple matter in the snowy wastes of athabaska there was no natural shelter at hand only a landscape so nearly flat that i could credit julians assertion that it had once seen service as the bottom of a primordial ocean sam halted and stared into the gloomy and snowshrouded distance as if listening for pursuers then he beckoned us off the road a ways this seemed to me a dubious choice since the true path of even the main road was increasingly obscured by blowing snow but sam had long anticipated the need for an eventual escape from williams ford and he had scouted this route in advance we followed the remains of a rail fence the posts of which were blunted protuberances from the whitened prairie until we reached the ruin of a fieldstone farmhouse degraded by time and weather but stout enough to provide shelter and a place for a modest fire thus the snow became an ally concealing any trail we might have left sam had laid in a cord of wood chopped from the spindly willows that grew along a nearby creek and had even provided fodder for the horses sam and julian set about preparing a meal while i dried and curried the horses and i made sure rapture got his ration of hay without interference from the highborn animals i was wet and cold myself and the farmhouse was gloomy and admitted the wind through every hollow window and dropped board and i didnt like the dangerously fractured and weakened plank floors or the walls and rafters that seemed made more of mildew than of anything substantial enough to support a roof but sam selected the most sheltered corner of the building and reinforced its gaps with a tarpaulin from his kit and he built the fire in a galvanized washtub suspended on massive rocks so we could stoke its heat without fear of setting the entire house aflame and because sam had equipped himself like a soldier embarking on a long march we enjoyed cornmeal and bacon and coffee in addition to the salt pork and stale bread i had hastily packed we talked among ourselves while the fire crackled and the night wind stabbed its knives about i was uneasy with sam whose unusual religious inclinations i had so recently discovered and perhaps he was as uneasy with me for he turned to me as we finished our corncakes and said i never meant for you to come with us adam you would have been safer in williams ford despite the conscription i told him i knew the choice i had made and what it meant and i thanked him for his help and promised to make myself as useful as possible on the journey since youve cast your lot with us ill do my best to protect you from any riski promise you that adam but my first obligation is to julians safety only secondarily to yours do you understand it wasnt a reassuring statement but it was honest and within its scope generous i acknowledged it with a nod then i took a breath and apologized for my shock at the discovery that he was a jew its a matter best left undiscussed he said especially in public no doubt that was true but my curiosity had gotten the better of me and since the present situation was very far from public i ventured to ask how long he had been a jew and what had led him to choose that venerable if problematic faith out of the many possibilities at hand sam frowned in so far as i could detect any expression beneath his beard adam those are personal questions yes and im sorry please excuse me i only wondered nostop if were going to be traveling together i suppose youre entitled to ask what embarrasses me is that i cant supply a whole answer he stirred the fire contemplatively while the wind howled in the crevices of the darkened ruin my parents were jews though they kept their practices clandestine they died when i was very young i was raised by a charitable christian family until i was old enough to enter the military i guessed that was how he had acquired the skills necessary for passing undetected in a christian majority but the rituals you were enacting thats all i have of judaism adam a few prayers for special occasions poorly remembered ive met a number of jews in my career and to some degree refreshed my understanding of the religions rites and doctrines but i cant claim to be either knowledgeable or observant then why do you light the candles and say the prayers it honors my parents and their parents before them and so on is that enough to make a man a jew in my case it is im sure the dominion would say so but you disguise yourself very successfully i said meaning to compliment him thank you he said somewhat acidly adding well all three have to disguise ourselves very soon ultimately i mean to get us aboard a train bound for the east but we cant travel among respectable peoplethe news of julians disappearance will have been disseminated among that class well have to present ourselves as landless you in particular julian will have to suppress your manners and vocabulary and you adam and here he cocked his eye at me with an earnestness i found disquieting youll have to forgo some of the gentility of the leasing class if were not to be discovered i told him i had met many examples of indentured or transient laborers through my fathers activities in the church of signs i knew how to say dont for doesnt and how to spit should the necessity arise and how to swear though i didnt like to even so sam instructed me the men and women who follow your fathers faith have already distinguished themselves from the lowest types by their urge to attend a church in a few days well be surrounded by thieves fugitives adulterers and worse and not one of them interested in repentance i can make you look lowborn easily enough but it will take some study before you can act and speak the part until then my urgent advice is to keep your mouths shut whenever possibleboth of you as if to set a tutelary example he lapsed into a brooding silence in any case we were too exhausted for further talk and despite the crude circumstances the keening of the wind the thinness of the old army blanket sam had given me and the daunting prospects before us i was asleep before very long in the morning sam ordered julian and me to scout the eastwest road from a prudent distance and alert him if we saw any military traffic there our horses would have made us conspicuous so we left them behind and hiked to the verge of the main road where we concealed ourselves behind hummocks of snow we had put on as many layers of clothing as we could get our hands on and taken all the coldweather precautions we had learned from sam and gleaned from the military romances of mr charles curtis easton none of it was especially effective however so we spent much of the afternoon stomping our feet and breathing into our hands the snowfall had ended and the wind had passed but the temperature hovered near the freezing point causing a sort of wraithy mist to rise from the landscape and making everything chill and drear late in the afternoon we heard a group of cavalry moving through the fog quickly we hid ourselves peeping through an embrasure in the mounded snow i counted five men of the athabaska reserve coming down the road they were the usual backcountry soldiers with the exception of the man who rode at the head of the troop that man was a longhaired veteran of stern demeanor his uniform was in impeccable order but he rode at a curious angle which was explained when i saw that he had been strapped to the saddle by an arrangement of belts on account of the fact that he was missing his right leg he was in other words a different kind of reservist one whose inventory of bodily parts had been whittled by the war but whose military skill and professional instincts remained fully intact when he came abreast of our position he reined up and turned his head this way and that seeming almost to scent the air julian kept utterly still while i resisted an impulse to flee with all the speed in my legs during this interval i was scarcely able to breathe though my heart raced like a mouse in a tithebox and the silence was broken only by the wheezing of the horses and the creak of leather saddles then one of the reservists cleared his throat and another pronounced some witticism which caused a third to laugh and the onelegged man sighed as if in resignation and spurred his horse and the cavalrymen rode on we hurried back to deliver our intelligence to sam sam as a result of his past service in the army of the californias was comfortable in the company of military men and he had made the acquaintance of several reservists during their visits to williams ford and his travels to connaught when julian described the man who led the small company we had seen sam shook his head in dismay that must be oneleg willy bass he said an excellent tracker but your reports incomplete julian finish it please i didnt know what he meant julian had described the cavalry detachment in minute detail i thought very nearly to brand of polish mr willy bass used on his pommel and i couldnt imagine what he had left out julian too seemed nonplused until the critical datum came to mind then he smiled west he said in full please julian the detachment was traveling from the east to the west good now draw a conclusion from that well since they must have ridden out of williams ford in the first place i guess they were returning home yes i know oneleg willy well enough that i doubt hes finished with us most of his virtue as a tracker is in his obstinacythe rest is guile but if hes ranged to the east of us and turned back he must not have our scent exactly i calculate this would be a good time for us to make for the railroad i ventured to ask more exactly where we were headed sam said a coaling station called bad jump it has a poor reputation and the businesses that operate there arent the kind that keep honest ledgers but that suits our purposes entirely bad jump may have been our likeliest destination but it was nowhere close and we had to ride all that day and through the night nearly without rest that was hard on us and even harder on the horses but the animals werent our main concern sam said in bad jump we would have to sell them in any case or rid ourselves of them some other way by this time i had become almost affectionate toward rapture who hadnt attempted to kick me even once and i was reluctant to abandon him i couldnt argue with sams logic however for horses are cumbersome baggage on a train and the quality of the animals sams and julians at least would instantly incriminate them as estate horses we rode for three days and camped rough three nights the end of december was raw and cold and i couldnt sleep for shivering even in the ingenious shelters sam contrived for us along the route because of the clear skies our fires would have been easy to detect and sam was quick to quench them he had considerable respect for the tracking skill of oneleg willy bass and often scanned the horizon behind us and his nervousness spurred us to a greater exertion in so far as we were capable of it early on one of those cold mornings long before dawn i crawled out from our makeshift tent under a sky in which the aurora borealis burned and trembled with unusual vividness and clarity meaning only to attend to a call of nature i found myself staring upward the air was as clear as freshwater ice and the shifting lights in the zenith looked to my weary eyes like the greenshaded alleys gilded walls and glacial parapets of some vast celestial city heaven flaxie might have said though it was surely a more austere and indifferent heaven than the one she used to imagine according to the dominion reader for young persons from which my mother had liked to quote heaven was a new jerusalem a city that is with many gates one by which presbyterians might enter another for baptists and so forthbut none for jews or atheists and probably not much more than a mousehole for the church of signs though that codicil was not explicit it occurred to me that i was bound for a different city however more substantial if less desirable and that this glowing intimation of heaven might be as close to divinity as i was likely to get i might have stood there indefinitely bound up in these thoughts if rapture had not snorted and by that homely noise recalled me to the material world by the time we sighted bad jump a smudge of soot against the thin line of the railroad poor rapture was nearly halt having turned his hoof in a gopherhole and i wasnt feeling much better though i was glad we had escaped the attention of oneleg willy bass be aware that were entering a kingdom of larceny sam advised us commerce in these coaling towns is conducted by rougher rules than the ones that prevail in williams ford well have to give up much to get the little we really need and if the bargain seems unfair please stifle your objections in fact speak as little as possible keep your hats pulled low for that matter our first stop will be at the stables of a horsetrader and then with luck well board a train julian might have been the most conspicuous of us had his hands and face not been grimed with soot for he was the most fairskinned it isnt a hard rule that aristos must be lighterskinned than the leasing or indentured classesthere are plenty of darkskinned aristos and no shortage of lightskinned laborersbut the tendency is unmistakable this has to do ive been told with the way populations were dispersed during the fall of the cities in the last century and how the vagrant urban masses were taken up as corvée labor by propertied interests in my case my skin wasnt a problem but my vocabulary and manners might be sam had turned his old army jacket inside out by way of disguise and this morning he had boiled a pan of water and shaved off his bearda shocking transformation with his beard he had always seemed the perfect exemplar of an aged military scholar without it he looked dismayingly young and vulnerable the blade revealed a stern jaw scratched and bleeding in places and a wider and more mobile mouth than had ever been perceptible through his whiskers i joked to julian that this couldnt be an evolution since it had happened so suddenly but in darwinian philosophy julian said such drastic changes were allowed forthey were called catastrophic thenceforth julian often made remarks about sams catastrophic razor and described the cuts and scrapes as sams punctuated equilibrium a witticism the significance of which escaped me we rode down a gentle slope toward the corrals and stables of the horsetrader bad jump came into closer focus as a conglomeration of board sheds and tin shacks attached to the general area of the coaling tower like a barnacle on the hull of a ship and i asked sam how such a rude town could have come to exist in the midst of the prairie with no visible agriculture to sustain it its a product of the rail fees sam said which are fixed by the landed aristocracy of the coastal ports how can a rail fee create a town though a fixed price invites a black market it means a profit can be taken invisibly by stationmasters and their collaborators in the rail trust labor refugees for instance would never be allowed to buy passage on a respectable passenger car but there are phantom carsfreight cars rigged with a few crude amenitiesthat move about the country almost by stealth and they can be hired for a price and where one kind of illicit commerce flourishes others are inevitably attracted this trader he said as we passed through an iron gate enclosing an immense property of sheds stables and corrals deals mainly in stolen horses for instance from time to time a reservist might want to exchange his federal mount for specie and flee the state by train no licensed dealer would conduct such a business but other men are willing to assume the risk of prison or worse if the price is attractive enough the trade was less brisk in the winter sam said but it didnt cease entirely that it did not was evidenced by the traders wellpopulated stables and stock yards and by the number of hands who worked about the place we rode up to the main house or office which was a slightly grander building than the general run of rude shacks in the neighborhood we were ignored by a score of indifferent stablehands until an unkempt woman appeared at the door of the house sam inquired for the owner and without speaking a word the woman turned and went inside and a large and brutish individual returned in her place he gave his name as winslow but he didnt offer his hand instead he stared at us with a feigned disinterest and asked why we were bothering him on a peaceful sunday morning certain items to sell said sam well im not buying right at the moment but mr winslows eyes lingered on the estate horses perhaps we can talk it over privately said sam and mr winslow sighed and made theatrical gestures of impatience and disdain but finally invited sam indoors to dicker while julian and i stayed with the horses we passed the time by surveying our surroundings the animals in the stables were only cursorily tended so far as we could judge i was reluctant to release rapture into this company though i had been convinced of the necessity of it itll come by all right in the long term i whispered to my spavined but loyal mount and i stroked his mane and pronounced the words as if i believed them beyond the trading post of mr winslow stood the towers of the coaling silo where the railway tracks bisected the snowy plain the sight of the tracks excited me a little i had been once or twice to connaught the railhead that served williams ford but i had never been aboard a train trains and the rails and bridges they ran on had always seemed marvelous to me i wondered what it would be like to ride oneto feel the miles slip away under me like clouds under the wings of a bird and to be borne off at flying speed to the fabled cities and harbors of the east when sam emerged from mr winslows hovel his expression was grim he instructed us to dismount and fill our satchels with food from the saddlebags for everything else had been sold mounts saddles rifles i protested at this lastwouldnt we need weapons to protect ourselves but sam pointed out that a rifle is a cumbersome object difficult to disguise and that none of our fellow travelers would have one then winslow emerged from his cabin and inspected the horses with a critical eye clucking his tongue at invisible defects but he couldnt entirely mask his pleasure at the quality of the estatebred mounts and mr winslow has been kind enough to let us sleep in his hayloft tonight sam said a train is scheduled to come through tomorrow morning if it hasnt been delayed by snow in the mountain passes with any luck well be on it though we still have to buy passage i said a final goodbye to rapture who rewarded me with a disdainful stare and tried to fix my mind on the exciting prospect of train travel sam walked ahead of us toward the crowd of wouldbe refugees who had camped by the coaling station in anticipation of tomorrows train these landless people circulated among huts and colorful tents where vendors bartered hot meals hand weapons piecemeal salvage and lucky trinkets most of these travelers vendors and customers alike were men but there were a few families among the crowd including a few children i asked sam in a whisper how these people had come to be here some were labor refugees from the great western estates he said fleeing indenture and the law some were migrant farmworkers or free factory hands stranded by the exigencies of blackmarket travel some were smallholders displaced by expanding estates many were criminals of the commonest sort most were expecting to catch the next train east i was afraid we would have to fight them for a berth or perhaps be left behindnot a pleasant prospect with oneleg willy bass still hunting usbut sam said not to worry that he had held back more than enough scrip to guarantee us a ready place we waited while sam went inside the timber building which housed the offices of the rail trust sam spent a considerable time in there and julian and i wandered a little among the vendors stalls inspecting dyed blankets and alcohol stoves pocket knives and lucky pigsknuckles i was tempted by a vendor who sold morsels of skewered meat grilled over a charcoal firethe smell after days of trail food was intoxicatingbut julian reminded me that the quality of the meat might not be good given that it was almost certainly derived from animals mr winslow couldnt profitably ship east elderly mules and tubercular cattle my appetite powerful as it was retreated before the suggestion then sam came out of the rail trust office looking grimly satisfied he had bought us a place on the very next train he said and we would only have to spend one more night in bad jump with any luck we passed the night in the loft of one of mr winslows barns a crude accommodation sam divided the hours of darkness into three watches julian took the first sam the second and i the lastthe earlymorning watch which was the coldest when sam woke me to attend to these duties i wrapped my blanket around myself and took his place at the loft door which was open to the wind and heaped loose hay about myself until i was little more than a pair of eyes contained in a haybale an eventless three hours passed in which i struggled against cold and the temptation of sleep then the sky lightened with the pearlescent glow that announces the dawn the western horizon revealed itself in a wintry silhouette and i saw something that interested me deeply an inky column of smoke distant but steadily approaching it was the train most trains in those days burned soft coal rather than anthracite and on a clear day their smudgy signatures were unmistakable i climbed out of the hay meaning to wake the others but i was preempted by the appearance of mr winslows wife who came up a ladder from the barn below and said briskly train from the west boys cavalry from the north best be on your way the news of approaching cavalry seemed to have spread widely in bad jump for by the time we had packed our possessions and left the barn the whole town was in turmoil we hurried down to the vicinity of the tracks where we stood as the train approached anxious as i was about the threat from the north i was captivated by the arrival of the engine and its immense chain of freight cars some of the cars were labeled sulfur or bauxite or nitre and must have come by way of california cascadia or the fearful mines of the desert southwest some bore goods imported from asia to our pacific ports and were inscribed with chinese characters like arrangements of tumbled sticks there were cars that stank of cattle goats and sheep followed by cars that smelled of wood and cold iron the engine at the head of it all was a very fine one in my estimationwhat the leaseboys back in williams ford would have called a prime charger its iron and brass and steel parts shone as if freshly polished the crew had attached a rack of caribou antlers to the span between the headlight and the smokestack giving it a fierce appearance and it arrived at the coaling station with such a hissing of steam and clanging of muscular metal parts that i was almost paralyzed with awe its shadow fell over the prairie like a giants fist sam and julian who had seen more trains than i had hauled me out of my trance by the collar of my coat as the flood of wouldbe pilgrims rushed to the phantom cars these cars were manned by travel agents as they were calledminor employees of the rail trust who supplemented their incomes by riding herd over blackmarket passengers not all of the transients at bad jump had bought passage but all of them were eager to escape the threat of approaching horsemen many of these people were indentured laborers fleeing their estates who dreaded the punishment that would be inflicted on them should they be returned to their rightful employers others had committed crimes even graver than theft of due service or were afraid of the new conscription and their panic created an unexpected crush travel agents shouted from the open doors of the phantom cars demanding the presentation of paid tickets and fending off desperate stragglers they made their rifles conspicuous and a shot was fired within our hearing which only aroused the mob to more frenzied exertions stay close sam ordered as we pushed our way through that gauntlet of elbows and knees the car on which we had bought passage was number thirtytwo last in a line of six such cars the travel agent in charge of it was a burly man in a tattered trust jacket with two pistols strapped to his hip and a rifle in his left hand he discharged the rifle into the air twice while i watched but still the mob pressed him and he began to look uneasy the train wont be stopped long sam said it was taking on coal and water with obvious haste but look there on a low ridge to the northwest a group of riders had appeared they were too far away to be individually distinguished but i didnt doubt that their leader was the persistent oneleg willy bass paid passage only the travel agent shouted as we pressed through the mass of illdressed refugees show papers or be shot no passage without papers the car was filling quickly i glanced back at the cavalrymen who had begun to approach the train at a steady gallop sam waved our credentials like a flag in the air come on then the agent said and we were lofted aboard like so many sacks of mail then the travel agent fired his rifle at the sky and announced that the next unticketed man within three feet of him would be shot dead the cavalry rode down on us at a gallop closing the distance just then the train gave a lurch and began to move and the agent turned to the nearest of his passengers and said secure that door the ticketless mob shrieked to see their hopes thus extinguished and the door as it slid closed encountered many scrabbling hands and fingers i was able to catch a last glimpse of the horsemen under the command of oneleg willy bass as they charged through the tents and shacks of bad jump the cavalrymen shouting and gesticulating in an attempt to delay the trains departure then the door clanged fully shut and only by putting my eye to a crack in the boards could i see blue sky a few pearly clouds and the prairie seeming to move with ponderous grace as the caribouhorn train began to gather speed a book could be written about the events that transpired aboard the phantom car but it would a sad and often obscene volume i mean to chronicle only the adventures that affected us most directly the car was a converted freightbox that ought to have been retired from service years ago it was essentially a single room long and narrow with loose straw scattered at one end of it and a few bound bales on which passengers might sit or lie and at the other end a stove vented through the roof and a chair on which the travel agent sat vigilantly his rifle in his lap of other furniture there was a water barrel a whiskey barrel and a barrel of salt meat probably horse the walls of the car were poorlyjoined planks through which the wind came rushing in the skimpy daylight admitted by these cracked boards was supplemented by the glow of the stove and glimmer of three or four hanging lamps our fellow passengers were among the best and worst men i have ever met the latter outnumbering the former by a fair throw we introduced ourselves to a few of them as bad jump receded behind us i kept my mouth shut for the most part as sam had suggested speaking only the polite minimum but i was tempted to curiosity now and then i had never seen such folks as these there were a dozen indentured men from a cruellymanaged california estate for instance who spoke the spanish language and wore tattoos in the shape of weeping roses on their arms there were cattleherders and shepherds who were evasive about their origins there were manual laborers aiming for work in the east and many single sullen men who growled insults when spoken to or confined their sociability to the card games that sprang up as soon as the train left bad jump there was at least one wellspoken and literate man aboard his name was langers and he described himself as a colporteur that is a salesman of religious tracts as soon as the train was in motion langers opened the large sample case he carried and began to offer his wares at what he called discount prices at first i was astonished that he would bother attempting such sales since the great majority of the passengers was almost certainly illiterate but on closer examination his pamphlets proved to be little more than picturebooks got up to resemble sacred literature the song of solomon frankly illustrated was one title another was acts condemned by leviticus explained and described with diagrams they did not bear the dominion stamp of approval these were offensive and i put a distance between myself and the colporteur but he did a brisk trade among the laborers and refugees whose appetite for religious instruction seemed nearly insatiable many of the men had been wageworkers and during the afternoon we were treated to massed choruses of piston loom and anvil the popular anthem of the industrial laborer this was the first time i had heard the chorus of that song by piston loom and anvil boys we clothe and arm the nation and sweat all day for a paupers pay and half a soldiers ration though i have heard it many times since and it struck me as awkwardly rhymed and in its later verses seditious i asked julian about the bellicosity of the song and he explained that the ongoing war in labrador had engendered new industries that employed mechanics and wagelaborers in large number the complaints of that emerging class had lately become vocal and these discontents julian said might eventually transform the traditional rural economy of estate and indenture i was feeling homesick however and i didnt much relish the company of militant mechanics anxious to overturn the existing order williams ford for all its inequities had been a less raucous place than bad jump or the phantom car and i wished i had not been forced to leave it that feeling deepened as the afternoon passed into evening passengers lined up to take a hot meal from the bubbling pot atop the stove while the travel agent doled out rations from the whiskey barrel to anyone who could pay i sat at the rear of the car sipping snowmelt water from a canteen and nursing my unhappiness whiskey was the word he used but experienced drinkers of whom there were many in the crowd expressed the opinion that the fiery fluid was in fact idaho velvet or potatojack after a time julian came to sit with me much of his eupatridian softness had been worked out of him over the last few days and he was beginning to grow the sparse beard that would eventually become his trademark his hands and face were dirtyshockingly so given his fondness for bathing he had endured all the same trials i had lately endured and yet he was able to smile and ask what it was that had got the worse of me do you have to ask i waved my hand at the raucous passengers the smoky stove the grim travel agent and the noisome hole in the floor that served as a privy were in a terrible place among terrible men temporary companions julian said carelessly all bound for a better life a statement too optimistic by half as it turned out it wouldnt be so bad if they would conduct themselves like christians perhaps it would or perhaps it wouldnt my father served among men just like these and led them into battle where their manners mattered less than their courage and thats a quality not apportioned by ones station in lifeit exists or not to the same proportion among all men regardless of origin in panama my fathers life was often enough saved by men who used to be called beggars or thieves and he took that lesson to heart it was a sentiment i had also encountered in the literary works of mr charles curtis easton where admittedly i had liked it better do i have to tolerate vulgarity though on the chance that a hooligan might save my life true vulgarity is obviously not to be tolerated but the point adam is that the standards by which we judge these things are pliable or ought to be and they expand or contract from place to place and time to time i suppose they evolve i said grimly in fact they do and if you want to make a success of your travels youd do well to remember that fact i said i would try though my heart wasnt in it but an incident that evening served as a painful illustration of the truth of julians lesson the caribouhorn train stopped at a coaling station and two more travel agents came aboard to relieve the one who had guarded us through the days journey during that exchange i caught a glimpse of the world outside which in the darkness looked just like bad jump tinroofed shacks and a prairie horizon a few flakes of snow swirled into the phantom car along with the two agents in hide coats who carried battered rifles and wore ammunition belts over their shoulders then the door was closed again and the stove stoked up to a simmering redness our new overseers took their place at the front of the car and we were docile under their surveillance until it became obvious that the agents had no especial interest in our behavior beyond preventing a fullscale riot then the revelries resumed sam and julian called me forward to join a circle of men around the stove i did so reluctantly there was a song in progress which julian accompanied on the choruses perhaps i should have joined in too just to be companionable but it wasnt a suitable song it was about a young woman who lost her shawl on the way to churchbut that was only the beginning of her misfortune for on each succeeding day the unlucky female lost yet another article of clothing culminating on a saturday night on which she lost that which a virtuous woman values above all else her downfall being minutely described the song provoked much laughter and gaiety but i failed to find the humor in it then a flask was passed around the circle it came eventually to the person on my left who swilled from it enthusiastically and offered it to me no thank you i said the man who made the offer wasnt much older than myself he was tall and raggedly dressed and he wore a threadbare woolen cap pulled down around his ears his face was ruddy and he had seemed genial enough during the singing but my refusal of the liquor caused him to squint in bewilderment whats that mean no thank you pass your bottle to the next man im not a drinker not a drinker nor ever have been you wont drink why not he seemed genuinely curious and i cast about for a suitable answer unfortunately what came to mind was the dominion reader for young persons a volume from which my mother used to read aloud on sundays that book was filled with proverbs and commonplace wisdom and i had learned much of it by heart in the past when i particularly wanted to irritate julian or when his arguments about moonvisiting began to pall i would cite one of the quotations from it to discuss the nature and position of the earth does not help us in our hope of the life to come attributed to saint ambrose by some scholars by others to timothy lehaye that would send him into paroxysms of indignationan entertaining spectacle if you were in the mood for it to night however the quotation that came to mind was from the chapter on temperance i turned to the man with the flask and said i would not put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains he blinked at me say that again i had assumed this homily about the evils of drink was universally familiar and i began to repeat it i would not put a thief in my mouth but i was interrupted by his fist what i didnt understand was that lymon pugh as he called himself was a simple man not accustomed to metaphor or simile and he thought i had accused him of being a thief or made an implication about what he might be willing to put in his mouth ill fight the man who says that twice he declared stand up it was a fight from which i couldnt honorably back away but mr pugh was a daunting opponent he squared his shoulders and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt to reveal muscular forearms crossed with numerous scars his big hands clenched into rocklike fists were similarly scarred and he possessed only a stump where his righthand pinkie finger ought to have been i had been trained in fighting by sam godwin however so i raised my own fists and set one foot ahead of the other and made clear my determination not to back down the crowd moved back to give us room the card players abandoned their games and some began to place bets on the impending combat go on my assailant jeered strike a blow or try to he had had no formal training and took a looselimbed approach to the battle my cheek was still smarting from his first blow and i meant to erase his smugness and i did this by feigning a punch with my left hand and striking him squarely with the right the blow was telling and his eyes widened as the breath went out of him and the crowd murmured its appreciation good one i heard julian cry lymon pugh was surprised but not deterred as soon as he recovered he swung into me with a will his big arms flailing had he fought decently with a sense of style and grace as i did im sure i would have defeated him but lymon pugh wasnt educated in the art and he used his scarred hands and arms as if they were clubs i had countered only a few of these windmill punches before my own arms began to numb with the impacts pughs arms were as insensible as salted hams however and he used them to advantage getting through my guard twice and finally rendering a blow so ferocious that my head filled with fireworks and my legs lost all direction before i could regain my senses the fight was declared a victory for mr pugh who danced in circles and waved his hat and hooted like an ape in his triumph sam and julian helped me to a haybale at the rear of the car where sam applied a handkerchief to my bleeding face i let my guard down i said thickly im sorry you had to see that on the contrary sam said whether you know it or not you did exactly the right thing as far as these people are concerned the haughtiness has been knocked out of youyoure no better or worse than any of them now that was a bitter consolation however and it provided little comfort as the raucous night roared on the reveling stopped at last once the liquor began to tell on the revelers who slumped and dozed under the indifferent gaze of the travel agents i was eventually able to sleep although my injuries and the cold air keening through the cracks in the car woke me from time to time there is something mournful and uneasy about waking up late at night on a moving train the wheels clicked a bony rhythm the engine growled like a distant leviathan and from time to time the whistle sounded a cry so lonesome it seemed to speak for the whole wide moonless night but there was an exception to this monotony of sound and i should have paid greater attention to it i was dreaming in a disjointed fashion of williams ford and of flaxie playing by the stream on a summer afternoon when i felt the phantom car lurch to a slow stop there followed a clanking and a rumbling and a silence and more clanking until the train started up again i wondered if i should wake sam who was snoring nearby and tell him about these events but i was afraid of seeming naive sam had ridden trains often before in his career and this was probably only another coaling stop or a pause in some switching yard where a branch road intersected the main line the travel agents huddling in the glow of the stove seemed unalarmed so i put the matter out of my mind the next day passed as the previous one had though the men were sullen after their indulgence of the night before and the smell of sickness hung about the privy hole and interfered with everyones appetite i was still smarting from yesterdays battle i spent the morning by myself perched on a haybale and composing a letter to my parents though the jarring of the railroad car made my handwriting childish i worked at it without interruption until lymon pugh came and stood in front of me his legs planted like trees in the scattered straw i didnt like to see him therei feared some fresh confrontationbut all he said was what are you doing writing a letter i said he lifted his hat and smoothed the unruly knot of black hair beneath it well then he said a letter this wasnt much of a conversation and i returned my attention to the page lymon pugh cleared his throat listen here do you take back what you said last night i considered my response carefully for i was not anxious to provoke him into another battle i meant no insult by it you called me a thief though noyou misunderstood me i only meant to explain my abstinence the thief is liquor do you see i dont drink liquor because it steals my sensibility your sensibility my capacity for reason it makes me drunk in other words thats all you were trying to saythat liquor makes you drunk thats it exactly he gave me a scornful look of course liquor makes you drunk i learned that at an early age you dont need to tell me anything about it much less make a riddle of it whats your name adam hazzard lymon pugh he said and put out his big scarred hand which i cautiously shook where are you from adam hazzard athabaska cascadia me he said a true westernercascadia is as far west as you can go without wetting your feet in the ocean what do you call that hat youre wearing a packle hat a packle hat for readers who havent seen one has a disk of stiffened wool or hemp for the crown attached to a tube of the same fabric the tube being rolled up to form a brim tied in place with threads thats a strange kind of hat he said though his own hat which resembled a sailors watchcap picked over by moths was nothing to brag about i guess it keeps you warm warm enough how did you come by all those scars on your arms i was a boner he said and to my blank expression he added in a packing plant in the valleythe willamette valley i boned beeves that was my jobhavent you ever worked in a slaughterhouse no i missed that opportunity somehow the beeves come along a line on hooks and the boner cuts the muscle from the bone you have to work close and fast for a dozen other men are doing the same job on all sides of you and the overseer brooks no slacking but it gets hot in the boning room and on wet days the air fogs and the blood slicks your grip so the knife is bound to go wrong sooner or later nobody lasts too long in that trade blood poisoning takes em or they whittle themselves down so far they cant hold a haft any longer ben kreel back in williams ford had occasionally lectured us about the evils of wage labor as opposed to the system of leasing and private indenture he might have cited this as an example had he ever ventured near a packing plant in the willamette valley i suppose thats why you left yes but it pains me lymon pugh said the job or the leaving of it i supported my mother there i might have stayed but i hear the packing industry out east has boomed just recently my idea was to get a bigger wage and send part of it home that seems sensible enough though your fingers might be whittled off as quickly in new york as in cascadia i might get better work than boning with luck canning say or even overseeing but i had to leave in a hurry is what galls me i had an argument with the shift boss which left him with a broken rib and he would have had me arrested if i hadnt collected what i found in his pockets and bought passage east i didnt have time to tell my plans to my motherfor all i know she thinks im dead he shuffled his feet though i guess i could write her a letter yes you shouldthats exactly what you should do except but that i cant write i told him he wasnt alone in that regard and that it was nothing to be ashamed of but he wasnt consoled he shuffled his feet again and said unless i can get a person to write it out for me now i understood his object in approaching me and it seemed a reasonable enough requestbetter than risking another controversy anyhow so i offered to take his dictation and lymon pugh grinned hugely and insisted on shaking my hand againa habit he ought to refrain from i told him for his grip almost crushed my fingers and made it difficult for me to grasp the pencil then the obligation of actually composing his thoughts fell upon him and he stomped about for a few minutes muttering to himself just say what youd say if your mother was here in front of you i suggested thats no helpif she was here i wouldnt need to write a letter well then make any beginning you want you might start with dear mother for example he liked that idea and repeated the phrase several times and i made a show of writing it on a fresh page in my notebook and he looked at the marks with admiration then he frowned again no its no good a letter wont work my mother cant read any more than i can well in that case do you know anyone who can read a cousin a friend of the family no except the man who runs the company store he can readive seen him lettering signsand he was always friendly enough when we came in does he have a name mr harking then we can ask him to carry the message to your mother on your behalf ill cross out dear mother and write in dear mr harking no sir lymon pugh exclaimed what that would be an impertinence if not something worse i never called him dear in my life and i dont propose to begin now its just a salutation call it whatever you wantmaybe thats how they do things in athabaskabut in the valley a man dont call the grocer dearits not suitable look i said this project is poorly thoughtout why dont you consider what you want mr harking to say to your mother on your behalfsleep on the questionand in the morning well start again how about that i hate to postpone it he said butwell it feels like the trains stopping anyhow are we in new york already do you suppose or is it just another watering hole neither as it turned out the travel agents stood up briskly and hoisted their rifles they shouted the train awake and when the passengers were all standing and blinking the foremost of the two men called out you two crack that door lymon pugh and i unbolted the long door and slid it open what we saw outside was no coaling station instead we faced a crowd of uniformed soldiers and beyond them a sea of tents and an open space in which men marched to orders counting cadences a soldier camp lymon pugh exclaimed the travel agent directed us to climb down from the phantom car and the other passengers followed behind i waited with the milling crowd in the sunlight until i could sidle closer to sam and julian are we caught i whispered not caught sam said in disgust just sold the trust took our money and sold us to recruiters a double sale i should have guessed something was up when the ticketseller at bad jump inquired so closely about your ages i was foolish he said bitterly and now were in the infantry or will be soon enough and bound for labrador by summer i wanted to question him more closely but a man in sergeants stripes formed us up into two lines and marched us off to be deloused act two the invention of captain commongold easter easter happy is the bride that the sun shines on and blessed is the corpse that the rain rains on saxon proverb here begins that portion of the narrative with which my readers may already be somewhat familiar that is the passage of julian comstock into the person of julian conqueror but that transformation and its consequences have been so often misrepresented that even a scholar of recent history may be surprised by the story as i saw and experienced itand by my part in it for that matter certainly julian was no conqueror as we arrived at the mustering camp though he soon enough ceased to be a comstock give a false name sam told julian when as a part of a line of sullen men from the phantom car we approached a tent in which army physicians waited to examine us and army clerks stood ready to enter us into the rolls do that and well be safe from the inquiries of your uncleif not safe in any other sense of the word what name should i give sam shrugged anything that appeals to you smith is a popular choice though i couldnt picture julian as a smith a jones a wilson or any of those pennyabushel names they didnt just suit him somehow i asked sam if it would be all right for me to continue as adam hazzard and sam said he supposed so much to my relief my family name may not have been aristocratic but my father would have been ashamed if i had altered it but before we were set down on paper we had to be evaluated by the medical faculty two bald men whose stained cotton smocks might once have been white who listened to our hearts and thumped our backs and generally made quick work of their observationsthough they did turn away seven men one of the men was clearly tubercular while two others showed evidence of active pox about their wrists and throats five more were turned back simply because they had lost a great number of teeth or their teeth were too loose in the jaw to be useful a toothless man could not bite or chew army hardtack and such men had been known to starve to death on a long march i dont know what happened to the rejected men i believe they were put back aboard the phantom car perhaps to be abandoned at some switching station along the main line and probably robbed in the process sam himself was the object of considerable scrutiny because of his age he told the examining physician he was thirtytwo but we were required to disrobe and sams body betrayed the lie in its wrinkled and leathery flesh but he was also strong and lean and sound of breath and after only a little discussion the doctors gave him their approval julian and i were ushered through more quickly then we were made to line up beside a trench into which we dropped our familiar clothing retaining only a few possessions in satchels or dittybags provided by the quartermaster while a scrawny recruit doused our naked bodies with yellow powder from a bucketan insecticide intended to kill lice fleas and other vermin the dust was noxious and it coated our hair our skin our throats and our lungs it burned our eyes so badly that we were soon weeping as helplessly as infants and we coughed and gagged like consumptive patients in the final stages of that disorder we were nearly murdered by it in other words and i suppose even the lice among us must have been badly inconvenienced though at the end of a week they had rallied and staged a comeback as soon as we had recovered our breath we were lined up in front of a company clerk who marked our names on a list of inductees sam gave his name as sam samson which drew a skeptical look i registered as adam hazzard and pronounced my name proudly despite the fact that i was shivering and clad mainly in a coating of insecticidal dust then julian stepped up he was still dizzy under the influence of the yellow powder and when asked his name he began julian julian com at which point sam delivered a kick to his shins commongold julian finished adding a little cough it was a striking pseudonym i thought and entirely appropriate julian commongold gilded in lice powder and abandoned among the common folk but a noble name for all that rich with dignity it suits you i whispered little else does today he whispered back then we were administered an oatha pledge of loyalty to flag and savior to the worldly power of the executive branch the wisdom of the senate and the spiritual majesty of the dominion that was a solemn moment in spite of our nakedness and uncontrollable shivering the oath though we swore to it under a sort of compulsion was not meaningless to me i held those institutions of liberty in awe and i had been feeling guilty about my draftdodging necessary though it seemed at the time by swearing fealty i felt washed clean despite the bug powder clinging to my mortal fraction then we lined up for uniforms which were handed out with only cursory attention to size and fit so that we spent another halfhour bartering coats and pants among ourselves and warming ourselves at the trench in which our civilian rags had been soaked in spirits and set aflame at the end of that time a sergeant escorted us to a mess tent in which we were given a hot meal of beef stew much to the delight of the vagabond men among us for whom this simple but reliable bill of fare was and would continue to be the infantrys great redeeming virtue at last we were assigned to cots which were arranged in rows under a canvas tent large enough to house a circus as i imagined and we had a few moments to ourselves to smoke or talk as we preferred by the light of scattered lamps before all dark was sounded on a trumpet during this time julian reminded me that new years day must have come and gone while we were aboard the caribouhorn train the year had exhausted itself and passed into that haunted sepulcher we call the past and now it was a year in which julians uncle deklan would be inaugurated into yet another term as the uncontested president of the united states seatosea and equatortopole and i reminded myself that i was now a warrior in that cause and would remain one for some time to come by spring i might be fighting to drive the dutch from the sacred precincts of labrador to reclaim our right to the wood water and minerals of that contested state and to assert our godgranted master of the northwest passage i was in short and irrevocably an american soldier you have fallen out of obscurity adam and into history julian said with only a little of his customary cynicism it was a daunting thought but exciting and i was still dwelling on it when my fatigue overcame me and i fell asleep i will not narrate every trivial detail of camp life or postpone indefinitely my attention to the battles and conflicts in which julian and i participated in any event we did not long remain in that crude camp on the winter prairie we were kept there only for the most basic kind of training and to weed out men with hidden epilepsy or poxgaunt or who were prone to fits of madness or madmelancholy by easter all such draftees would be mustered out or put to such simple duties as suited them those of us who remained were naturally curious about our future some of the formerly indentured men were ignorant of the nature and purpose of the war in labrador an ignorance that made them more fearful than they needed to be in the great cities there were newspapers to recount the course and outcome of this or that battle and to chart the overall progress of the war so that even clerks and wagelaborers might be reasonably wellinformed but the majority of the draftees were landless men and deaf to such sources of information they took their intelligence where they could find it from sunday allcamp service or from rumor and hearsay and some of them took julians counsel on the subject it must not be assumed that our time at the mustering camp was one long round of historical and philosophical debateof course it was not we were up early in the morning for reveille roll call sick call mess call followed by squad and company drill as soon as we had been assigned to squads and companies guard mound adjutants call policing camp which meant picking up trash then it was battalion drill until noon another mess call regimental drill until the five oclock mess general parade tattoo and tapssix days out of seven on sundays there was no drill and nothing more formal than a morning allcamp service which allowed for restorative rest and conversation we learned the presentation of arms and the intricacies of parade and we were introduced to the pittsburgh rifles that would accompany us into battle we learned to take our weapons apart and put them together to keep them clean dry and oiled and in general to treat them with all the tender feeling a young mother might attach to a firstborn infant as the winter became less severe and the month of february ended we were taken on marches across the damp patch of prairie where the camp was situated allowing our boots to make accommodation with our blisters and vice versa and we were ordered into mock battles and tutored in the digging of entrenchments and taught how to negotiate a cutwire fence how to attack an enemys lunette and how to follow a regimental flag we refined our marksmanship on the firing range we learned to call out marching cadences without blushing at the obscenities in the chantstoughening us against moral as well as physical hardship in short we were worked hard and fed well until we felt proud of ourselves for having survived the ordeal and considered ourselves superior to the general run of civilian clerks and laborers we suspected we could not be bested in genuine warfare and certainly not by the dutch as we called the mitteleuropan forces julian and i benefited from sams prior tutelage and we were among the more skillful recruits for that reasonthough sam warned us not to make ourselves too conspicuous julian in particular had to feign a certain clumsiness during our drills with horses otherwise he might have been taken up into the cavalry and out of sams sphere of protection sam himself by design or because of his age put in a mediocre performance on the endurance exercises but he was steadily and expertly working up another line of influence he made a friend of the camps quartermaster who was also a veteran of the isthmian war the rivalry between the army of the californias and the army of the laurentians meant that neither sam nor the quartermaster could expect any favoritism because of their prior experience and for reasons of anonymity sam could confess to nothing more than a short stint as a foot soldier but the two men supported each other in extracurricular ways and did each other collegial favors and sam was soon adopted into the small circle of isthmian veterans who had found their way into the eastern forces including officers sam used his influence to keep julian and me within arms length and to guarantee that the three of us would stay together even after we were dispatched to labrador labrador was the subject of many sunday sermons sunday service was conducted by dominion officers and for that reason the conflict was cast mainly in spiritual terms that is to say the war was presented as a battle between good and evil what was good was full ownership of north america by its natural masters and what was evil was the claim of territorial interest advanced by that ungodly commonwealth of nations known as mitteleuropa we listened with due attention to these sermons often delivered at white heat and we took them to heart but in the free hours after allcamp meeting many of the inductees including lymon pugh and myself gathered around julian commongold to hear him air a more pragmatic version of war history those talks took place over consecutive sundays what julian told us in brief was that the possession of labrador had been contested in principle or in fact ever since the false tribulation of the last century the allied nations of mitteleuropa while america was still in the grip of civil unrest had recognized the significance of the northwest passage opened to shipping by a warming climate and coveted its rich natural resources they asserted what some call the steppingstone theory of international entitlement that because europe controlled iceland and greenlandand because greenland was just adjacent to baffin islandand baffin island to the hudson straithence hudson bayhence labrador and newfoundlandtherefore all this territory ought to be administered by mitteleuropa from its bureaucratic palaces at munich airier justifications were sometimes cited including the theorized ancient landing of vikings on the eastern shores of north america but julian assayed the tolerance of his listeners and confined his argument to the most pertinent points by the time the union had rallied and was ready to dispute that claim there were mitteleuropan coaling stations from devon island to kangiqsujuaq mitteleuropan trawlers plying the rich waters of the foxe basin mitteleuropan warships patrolling off belcher island and mitteleuropan troops and colonists ashore at battle harbor and goose bay america fought back of course this all happened in the reign of president otis who consolidated much of north america under his own unitary rule it was otis who gained us such boreal states as athabaska and nunavut and added immense territories to the union but otiss campaign against the forces of centralized europe was less successful and is passed over lightly in the official texts suffice to say that at the end of president otiss thirtyyear term of office the dutch had secured a permanent foothold in labrador occupied rebellious newfoundland and taken control of the northern bank of the st lawrence all the way from the sea to baie comeau even this thumbnail sketch of history taxed the geographical understanding of his auditors and julian was reduced to scratching maps in the dirt with the point of his bayonet there the matter had restedor festered for what followed was decades of clashes between american and mitteleuropan warships accusations of piracy skirmishes along the laurentians stern diplomatic notes sent and received etc nevertheless a sort of modus vivendi had prevailed in which the continuity of commerce took precedence over national pride the socalled pious presidents who ruled during this interlude were more concerned with entrenching the power of the dominion of jesus christ and regulating land use in the prairie west than with battling foreigners the union grew in power and prosperity during the long and sunny reigns of the pious our great rail network was perfected and enlarged while the estate system imposed legal regularity on the patchwork of land and indenture customs that prevailed prior to that time food was reasonably plentiful the population began growing after the catastrophic mass deaths of the false tribulation the pox took fewer children during those years and international trade turned our ports into respectable cities harboring tens of thousands of inhabitants that was the state of the nation when julians grandfather emmanuel comstock assumed the presidency julians narrative as i have said was not as dry and abbreviated as mine or he would never have held an audience in fact his theatrical instincts served him admirably on these slow sunday afternoons he spoke in lilting cadences adopted comic voices or postures to suit his subject stroked his wispy beard to imitate the pious presidents etc and when he discussed the comstock dynasty julians impersonations became sharper and more cuttingthough i doubt any of his listeners noticed emmanuel comstock the first of the imperial comstocks was a brutal but farsighted president who made it his business to modernize the armies and bring them under the discipline of the church of the dominion his work was successful and before long the nation possessed a fighting force to be reckoned witha force emmanuel comstock wasted no time in exercising the newlyreformed army of the laurentians attacked the dutch north of the st lawrence while admiral finchs redandwhite fleet inflicted dramatic losses on the mitteleuropans off groswater bay during the course of these conflicts emmanuel comstock took for his wife a senators daughter and in the fifth and sixth year of his reign the union produced two sons deklan the eldest and bryce comstock emmanuel comstock was determined that his sons would not be aristocratic idlers so the brothers were trained from infancy as warriors and statesmen and as soon as they reached maturity they were given military commissions in order to hone their command skills deklan was made a major general in the army of the laurentians and the younger bryce received a comparable rank in the army of the californias different as the brothers werethe kindly happily married bryce and the brooding solitary deklanboth proved ableenough commanders the first comstocks victories had pushed back the mitteleuropans but had not driven them from north america the stadhouders or dutch governors were too firmly entrenched in the vast tracts of northeastern land they had ruled and exploited for so many years but the army of the laurentians under deklan comstock captured and occupied all of newfoundland and the rail link between septiles and schefferville passed into american hands that was the famous summer campaign of described in the novel the boys of by mr charles curtis easton in its wake core elements of the army of the laurentians marched to new york city for a victory parade soon afterward emmanuel comstock died of a fall from his horse while hunting on the grounds of the executive palace and deklan by the consent of a passive senate assumed the presidency coincidentallyor so the textbooks say here julian called his listeners into a closer circle so that his impersonation of deklan comstocks shrill voice and petulant manner would not be overheard by passing officers sam was not present or else he would have put a stop to the proceedings sam had already warned julian against displays of atheism or sedition but julian saw no reason why his induction into the military should interfere with those interesting hobbies deklan had been competent enough as a figurehead general but he proved to be a jealous and suspicious president he was especially jealous of his younger brother bryce whom he saw as a potential rival and it was partly to put bryce in harms way that deklan conjured up the isthmian war see mr eastons against the brazilians an american warship the maude had exploded while passing out of the panama canalprobably due to a faulty boiler but deklan comstock declared it an act of sabotage and blamed the canals brazilian custodians he wanted the canal in american hands and after a keenlymanaged campaign the army of the californiasunder the command of bryce comstockgave it to him panama should have been a fine gem in deklans diadem but the younger bryce had frustrated his brothers dark hopes simply by surviving and aroused further jealousy by the muchdiscussed brilliance of his military career the western armies could not march all the way to new york for their celebrations bryce was called back to that city alone ostensibly to have the order of merit bestowed upon him but no sooner had bryce comstock left the train than he was surrounded by eastern soldiers and taken up on charges of treason i will not weary the reader with a description of that trumpedup charge as julian called it or the fratricidal logic that transformed a victorious officer into an enemy of the nation suffice to say that the trophy to be placed around the neck of bryce comstock went from gold to hemp and that his true reward was a place at the throne of a ruler more majestic than the reigning commander in chief and so matters had stood julian told his eager listeners for the last decadea stalemate in labrador a victory on the isthmus of panama and deklan comstock growing ever more brooding and selfabsorbed in the marbled corridors of the presidential palace at least until last year americas acquisition of the canal had alarmed the mitteleuropan powers who were forced to depend ever more heavily on the northwest passage for their trade into the pacific and they feared american dominance there so they had fortified their remaining american possessions enhanced their military and naval forces and soon enough launched a massive counterattack against the army of the laurentians this is the war we are to fight asked lymon pugh whose attention had been strained by julians narrative thats exactly the war we are to fight and it isnt going well for us the dutch are arrayed in force weve already lost the railroad to schefferville and both quebec city and montreal are threatened by the enemy the army of the laurentians took heavy casualties last summer which is why the draft was doubled up sounds like we have the short end of the stick then another soldier remarked perhaps not said julian for he was not a defeatist or a friend of the dutch the enemy are wellprovisioned but their supply lines stretch all the way across the atlantic ocean and our navy is making things hot for dutch shipping their army is of a fixed number while ours is growing and julian added grinning broadly were americans and they are not which makes all the difference there followed a cheer for the union and much chestthumping and the crowd of draftees went off bragging about how they would rout the enemy and show the dutch what american soldiers were truly made of it was lymon pugh lingering behind who asked how do you know all these things julian commongold are you some kind of scholar you talk like one julian deflected the question with a shrug im from new york cityi read the newspapers this put lymon pughs mind back on the subject of reading and literacy in general and he grew thoughtful as we broke for mess of course julians tutorials on the state of the war did not escape the attention of the camps ranking officers for long word spread and according to sam who kept his ear to the ground the dominion men on the staff were unhappy with julian for his editorializing and wanted him to receive a reprimand but the camps military commander vetoed that idea for julian was a promising soldier and his blunt talk had braced the men more effectively than a dozen firebreathing sunday sermons sam was not bound by such scruples and chastised julian roundly for his loose talkreminding him that in the long run notoriety might be as dangerous as combatbut julian paid little attention i suppose i shouldnt be surprised sam said to me after one of these confrontations its the comstock in him hell make a fine soldier then i said or a famous corpse said sam we were scheduled to be shipped east for the spring campaign but before then on another sunday afternoon lymon pugh approached me once again on the subject of reading and writing thought perhaps i could learn all about it he said sheepishly unless i left it too late what about that adam hazzard is it something only children can learn no i said for i considered myself in this community a sort of evangelist of literacy my writing skills had been mooted about and many of the men came to me to help them read or compose letters anyone can learn it at any time its not especially difficult could i learn then i expect you could and will you teach me i was feeling magnanimousthe day was bright the air had a delicate warmth and a general languor had descended over the camp along with the swampy smell of the thawing prairie and an unfortunate breeze from the latrines i reclined on my cot with my boots off and my toes exposed to the air lymon pugh sat on the cot adjoining where he greased his rifle in a distracted way his scarred hands moving almost of their own volition a charitable act did not seem out of order but i cant do it in one lesson mind well have to begin from first principles i expect well have plenty of time if neither of us is killed in the war you can give it to me piecemeal adam in that case well begin with the letters of the alphabet the alphabet is a collection of all the letters there are and once you learn them no unexpected letters will come along to confuse you how many of these letters are there twentysix altogether he looked crestfallen thats a large number it only seems so here ill write them out for you and you can keep this paper and study it i took a page from my notebook and copied down all the letters in their large and small incarnations thus aabbccetc seems like youre wrong on the count lymon pugh observed when i had finished thats at least fifty i estimate no only twentysix but each one comes in a greater or lesser variety the larger being called a capital letter he studied the page uncomprehendingly maybe we should call this off it dont seem like anything i could ever commit to memory you underestimate yourself suppose while you were wandering east from the willamette valley you came upon a village with just twentysix people in it and decided to stay there youd learn the names of the whole tribe soon enough wouldnt you and many other things about them people arent scratches on a page though people walk about and talk and such letters may not walk about but they do talk for each one represents a sound look we dont have to introduce you to all twentysix at once that would make you like a stranger at a crowded social event which is always an uneasy experience take the first three by themselves as if they were sitting around a campfire and invited you to join them this is fanciful bear with me here is a and his companion the lesser a and i pronounced the sound of the letter and its variations and instructed lymon pugh to repeat them and to associate the sounds with the letters shape the way he might connect a face with a name when he had done this satisfactorily we proceeded to blunt simple bb and the more elusive and chameleonic cc by the time he mastered these three letters nearly an hour had passed and it seemed to me that lymon pugh like a sponge had absorbed all the knowledge he had room for at the moment and any more of it would simply leak out around the edges he agreed to defer further instruction until the next lessonperhaps the following sundaybut observed these are only sounds and i dont see how they connect to writing or reading you can stack and arrange them to make words ultimately but dont get ahead of yourself is there a word i might make with just these three the only one i could think of was the word cab so i wrote that out for him and he was delighted by it damn if my uncle didnt drive a cab in portland some years back and it was a fine rig with a fourhorse team i wish i could have written out that word for him he would have thought i was a dominion scholar or an aristo in disguise practice the letters in your spare time i said giving him a blank page to work with and an extra pencil i had stolen from the quartermasters tent last week previously because i like to keep a stock of pencils on hand theyre perishable and often hard to come by you can write cab i said and showed him or cabthey mean the samebut you should practice both i will he said and after a moments pondering added but this is too generous adam hazzard i ought to pay you for all this work i was happy enough that he had got out of the habit of striking me with his fists and that was all the payment i wished for but to smooth the awkwardness i said there must be many things you know about that i dont someday you can teach me one or two of them he frowned over this idea taking up his rifle again and finishing its assembly then as he set aside the last oiled rag he brightened i guess i can tell you how to make a fine knocker that might be a good example since i dont know what a knocker is oh well warming to his subject i guess anyone can make a crude sort of knockeryouve probably done it yourself though maybe they call it by some other name in athabaska a knocker adam you know the thing you use when you want to knock someone about the head perhaps if you described it put a stone in the end of a sock and you have one swing it in a circle and bring it down on the skull of your enemy bang i was startled by his violent exclamation do you need to do thisvery often did in the valley most of us boys did if we wanted to make any money outside of the slaughterhouse by taking it from drunks for instance or when we set to fighting each other but a stone in a sock is a poor sort of knocker the very worst here lymon pugh launched into an exposition of the way to make a superior knocker of which the owner might justly be proud you begin he said by cracking a chicken egg only not in the usual style you must crack it very fine at the narrow end to make a small hole and then empty out the soft parts and let the shell dry then you melt some leadan old candlestick a handful of bullets or some such thing bury the shell up to its hole in sand and pour the molten lead inside you let it settle overnight then you dig it out and peel away the shell and whats inside is a good smooth heavy slug in the shape of an egg then you make a sling for itan old sock wont do for a respectable manof pressed leather or strong hemp and tie it with a leather thatch and stitch on a bead or a brass button if youre feeling artistic the whole assembly tucks into your pocket real neatits not bulkybut a knocker like that will crack a mans head just like an egg thus bringing the process full circle i said slightly appalled hows that never mind thats a fine piece of knowledge lymon and i thank you for it and i consider myself paid in full though i dont have any use for a knocker right at the moment thats all right said lymon pugh grinning i dont have anyone to write to either except maybe the grocer or any books to read but you never know when the alphabet might come in handy or a knocker i said and then the mess call sounded it must not be assumed that our adjustment to the military life was easily made many were the nights in that camp on the prairie when i fell asleep with tears trembling in my eyes thinking of what seemed like a carefree existence back in williams ford if i had been scorned by other boys or treated roughly in the stables or nipped by a brood mare now and then those memories receded so that all my previous life appeared as one lazy summer on the banks of the river pine where squirrels fell from the trees like tropical fruit and i was forever adoze in a sundappled glade with a book open on my chest dreaming of pleasanter wars than this one my thoughts turned too to the gentler sex who were in scant supply at the moment and i wondered if i would ever again be allowed to gaze on a smiling face or examine a pair of feminine eyes from close proximity the male urge was not dormant in me and i was afraid i might grow as lonely and desperate as some of my fellow soldiers who dispelled their lusts in obscene and indescribable pursuits a copy of acts condemned by leviticus circulated furtively among the men and i confess i glanced at it once or twice out of curiosity but in general we were kept too busy to feel sorry for ourselves for many of these men the army was a marked improvement on the lives they used to live and had its compensations in regular meals and the small but dependable pay we were paid for the first time shortly before we were due to ship east where there might be an opportunity to spend some of our geld especially if we were stationed near montreal or quebecor so the speculation ran in any case it was a novelty to hold cash in our hands many of the soldiers promptly sewed the scrip and coin into secret pockets in their dittybags or hid it in their clothing or in makeshift belts tied about their waists but because the money was a new thing to meall i had seen of money in williams ford was leasechits and antique penniesi repaired right away to the dormitory tent to handle and examine it where sam and julian joined me were off in the morning sam said as he came in for better or worse celebrating easter in montreal i think and then battlethe real thing what are you staring at so steadfastly adam hazzard these coins of the coins i especially liked the largest the one dollar coin it was not as finely wrought as the coinage of the secular ancients but still very neatly pressed and stamped the dollar contained a measurable amount of real silver and had milled edges and vine stalks engraved around the face and the words in god we trust written in letters so ornate as to be all but illegible and in the middle of all this a relief portrait of a sternlooking man with small eyes and a pointed nose there were silhouettes on the coins of smaller denomination too some of which i recognized from illustrations in the dominion history of the union as the historic patriots washington hamilton and otis but the face on the dollar was unfamiliar to me and when i showed it to julian he laughed so the old villains vanity finds yet another expression thats my uncle adamdeklan comstock or a flattering facsimile of him hes on a coin now a new coin for a new year and plenty of them i imagine the mint must be working overtime to pay for the war effort julian directed my attention to the obverse of the dollar on which was written deklan comstock potus president of the united states and the year with a representation of two clasped hands signifying the concord of the armies of the east and west alongside the stamp of the boston mint and the ambiguous but vaguely threatening legend now and forever let me see that sam said and on examining the coin he remarked yes thats him a flatteringenough likeness he could drill holes in wood with that nose of his it was bryce who got all the looks in the family here we approached territory which i had not dared to explorethat is the subject of julians family but i was not a stableboy right at the moment and julian was not an aristo we were both soldiers and would so remain at least for the duration of our involuntary enlistment so i dared to ask what was your father like julian did you know him well before he died sam and julian exchanged glances i knew him well enough julian said in a softer voice i was but eight years old when he died and he went to war two years before that to be honest adam hes more an impression in my mind than a solid memory he was always kind to me he never condescended to me though i was a child and he was patient enough to explain what i didnt understand and your mother to my surprise it was sam who answered emily baines comstock is as fine a woman as youll ever meet he declared and perhaps you will meet her someday shes exactly the kind of woman a man like bryce comstock deserved to have at his side and she loved him dearly and was inconsolable for a long time after his death emilys more than just beautifulshes clever and resourceful and here he reddened and cleared his throat does she live in the executive palace i asked theres a cottage reserved for her on the palace grounds said sam but she keeps a rowhouse in manhattan where she prefers to stay emily doesnt care for the rivalries and jealousies of the highborn shes happier with artists actors scholarsthat type of person from whom she has little to fear my mothers a cultured woman julian added and doesnt care to be in the presence of deklan conqueror who is as ignorant as he is villainous that was how julian had come to be raised in manhattan which was where he had seen so many plays and movies and spoken with philosophers and picked up his heretical ideas but you must have met your uncle facetoface i said too often after my fathers death it was all i could do to restrain myself from calling him a murderer oh those holiday dinners at the executive palace you have no idea adam my mother and i pressed in with deklan and his crowd of sycophants while the craven agents of the dominion blessed his every whim and impulse we were on display i thinkdeklans way of announcing that he could command the loyalty even of his murdered brothers widow and son we were powerless against him he could have snuffed us out at any time he tolerated my mother because she was a woman and me because i was a child and both of us because we were a perverse emblem of his supposed generosity i had touched a hostility that ran deep in julian and the edge in his voice was impossible to ignore the way he spoke of those palace dinners and the clergy who presided at them made me wonder if this humiliation might be the ultimate source of his apostasy but such speculation was not useful and i dropped the subject because it made julian so conspicuously unhappy there sam said do you hear that it was the sound of a train whistle windborne over the thawing prairienot the caribouhorn train that had brought us here from bad jump but an army train which we would board first thing in the morning and which would carry us to the battlefront in the east pack away those comstock dollars sam said or youll have nothing to spend on women and liquor by the time we get to montreal i blushed at his joke and tried to laugh though there was more truth in it ultimately than i like to admit the social atmosphere aboard the troop train to montreal differed in instructive ways from that aboard the phantom car months had passed since we left bad jump and those of us who had been strangers then had since become if not friends at least confederatesintimately known to one another for better or worse if we were afraid of the war to which we were being delivered we kept that tender feeling to ourselves we sang a great deal to maintain high spirits and i was not the prude and child i once had been and i joined in on the less obscene choruses of those twodollar shoes hurt my feet not because vulgarity had become especially desirable but because merriment is an antidote to dread i noticed too how the soldiers often appealed to julian commongold for an opinion or a verdict in some dispute and accepted his judgment as settled law this despite julians evident youth unsuccessfully disguised by his sparse yellow beard it was as if he carried around with him an invisible but perceptible aura of authority which perhaps was what sam had called the comstock in him it manifested in his squareset shoulders his careful grooming and the easy way he wore the blueandyellow uniform of the infantry but it was a comradely authority too coexistent with his confident sense of himself and the evident pleasure he took in socializing even with those beneath his original station in life he smiled often and it was a smile only the most truculent among us could fail to give back the train carried us out of the prairie and into a land of forest and lakes rain beat down steadily most of the day but it made no difference to us for we were inside a fullyequipped passenger car with protection from the weather this was train travel as i had always imagined it i sat at a window watching raindrops glide sideways as we passed in and out of cavernous pine forests and followed the smoky shore of a great gray lake to the pagans of ancient rome julian once told me the easter season had represented death and rebirth certainly there was no lack of rebirth in the countryside through which we passed ferns unrolled in shady glens the sodden limbs of trees were budding afresh and cattails poked through ponded winter marshes and there was death too if you looked for it in the occasional ruins we passednot just old settled basements as in lundsford but whole stone buildings mossygreen and once or twice the remains of entire towns slouching brick boxes that shed raindrops as we rattled past them at thirty miles to the hour crows nested in those old buildings and their eaves were crowned with chalky dung and the only visitors were the local deer or an occasional wolf or bear as might be i gazed on many more such overgrown ruins until night fell it was wholly dark when we approached the outskirts of montreal where campfires smoldered in the rainy distance we heard an occasional growl of thunder or perhaps it was cannonade and it was at this point that the singing stopped and a wary silence replaced it and we fell into less pleasant reveries about the future and what it might hold for us an entire regiment of draftees had been packed into the traina big body of men but it was nothing compared to the great army assembled by general galligasken outside of the city of montreal our company was in the common phrase a drop in the bucketand it was a large ungainly bucket uninterested in welcoming new drips as soon as we collected our gear and left the train we were conducted to a muddy field in which we were invited to make our own contribution to a sea of tentsnothing but mud and canvas as far in the rain and the night as the eye could see after much flailing about during which we repeatedly slipped and stumbled in the glutinous muck and cursed and were cursed in turn by the soldiers trying to sleep in adjoining quarters we had erected our own rough sleepingplaces and we tumbled into them fullydressed and woke a few hours later when reveille sounded our uniforms all scabbed with mud i could not help looking about curiously as we formed up in companies for roll call the rain had ceased during the night the morning was brisk and bright and high clouds careened across the sky like runaway meloncarts everywhere in every direction men were being bugled out of bed and mustered up and regimental flags popped in the breeze with a sound like knots bursting in a pinewood fire the vast flat field in which we stood was crosscut with muddy roads and already horses and mules crowded these paths straining to pull provision wagons or caissons and i discerned in the distance the grander tents of regimental and battalion commanders otherwise there was nothing but an ocean of soldiers on all sidesinfantry cavalry artillery the nearest thing i could see that was not a part of the army of the laurentians was a line of low trees as far away as a cloud seems when it sits upon the horizon is this montreal i asked sam if so the city was considerably less grand than i had imagined it though still very large dont be idiotic sam said the city of montreal is some miles distant most of it on an island in the st lawrence river do you think they would muster so many men in the midst of a modern city half of them would be drunk by noon if that was the casethe other half having absconded to the whore houses and dont blush like that adam youre a soldier now you ought to be hardened to such things the sensitive reader not so hardened may dislike to see rough talk set down verbatim on the innocent page i apologize and rest my defense on the cold grounds of veracity it has been said i forget by whom that you cant throw a stone in the city of montreal without hitting either a church or a whore house i would soon enough find out for myself the truth of that statement for it was announced at noon mess that our regiment was to be allowed a supervised leave and we would be escorted to the city for easter services in one of the grand ancient dominion churches there do jews celebrate easter i asked sam as we marched to the outskirts of montreal i dont suppose they do it would be surprising if they did sam agreed though we have our own holiday about this time of year which is called passover what event does it mark if not the crucifixion and resurrection the fact that the jews were exempted from the plagues that fell upon egypt well i said thats something to be grateful for recalling my bible studies under ben kreel those were unpleasant plagues and not to be taken lightly more than unpleasant julian chimed in and i was glad that the sound of tramping feet though muffled by the damp ground was loud enough to prevent anyone eavesdropping while julian dilated on this delicate subject inventive i would say almost to the point of madness insectsboilsthe butchery of childrensuch work by any other agency would be considered an example of unexcelled sadism rather than celestial justice i was quietly shocked though hardly surprised by this fresh apostasy god is jealous by nature julian i reminded him it says so in the text oh yes julian agreed jealous certainly but also forgiving merciful but vengeful wrathful but loving in fact just about anything we can imagine him to be thats the paradox of monotheism as i call it contrast a christian with a natureworshipping pagan if the pagans cornfield is ravaged by a windstorm he can blame the bad manners of the cyclonegod and if the weather is kind he addresses his thanks to mother sunshine or some such and all this though not sensible has a kind of rude logic to it but with the invention of monotheism a single deity is forced to take responsibility for every contradictory joy and tragedy that comes down the turnpike he is obliged to be the god of the hurricane and the gentle breeze together present in every act of love or violence in every welcome birth or untimely death i could do with a little less mother sunshine at the moment remarked sam applying a handkerchief to his brow for the day had grown warm and the march was tiring but you cant blame the jews for celebrating their exemption from his wrath i protested no julian said no more than i can blame the sole survivor of a train wreck for crying out a heartfelt thank god i was allowed to livethough the same god who spared him must therefore have abstained from preventing the wreck or rescuing any other person from it the impulse to gratitude on the part of the survivor is understandable but shortsighted i dont see how monotheism makes it any worse though it seems to me once you start multiplying your gods you might not know just where to stop a crowd of gods so numerous you cant recognize most of them seems hardly better than no god at all especially once they begin to bicker among themselves dont you often tell me to seek out the simplest explanation for a thing one is a simpler number than a dozen julian admitted but none is simpler than one thats enough of this thank you said sam why sam said julian grinning mischievously are you afraid of a little philosophical conversation this is theology not philosophyan altogether more dangerous subject julian and im not so much afraid of the loose talk as i am of the loose tongue behind it where is the dominion that we should censor ourselves where is the dominion the dominion is everywhereyou know that the dominion is at the head of this very march referring to our newlyinstalled dominion officer one major lampret who strode before us a handsome man in a handsome uniform a dominion officer who is by definition a commissioned officer trained at the dominion academy in colorado springs wears the standard uniform of an infantryman of his rank but adorned with redandpurple pipings and blazons and a pair of silver angels wings pinned to the chest and the soft widebrimmed hat sometimes called a chaplains crown julian might have insisted on continuing the conversation if only for the purpose of aggravating sam but by this time we had come upon a great iron bridge by which we crossed a body of water so immense that i could hardly credit its christening as a river vessels from many nations moved beneath that bridge some with immense white sails and some powered by boilers some warping toward the port of montreal and others bound for the inland great lakes trade or for the wide ocean far to the east and beyond this bridge lay the astonishing city of montreal and it was the city that finally drew all of our attentionall of mine at least i would see bigger cities in my life and travel farther from home but as montreal was the first true city i had seen i could not help but contrast it with williams ford by that measure it was immense and it had once been even larger julian reminded me for we had all morning passed through a landscape that was essentially one vast tip playedout and burnedover with scrub brush and low trees overlying what must once have been zones of industry or sprawling suburbs what remained was only the core of the city as it was known to the secular ancients all its rind and peelings having been stripped away but that central core preserved many wonderful antique structures the buildings are so tall i could not help exclaiming and julian said though once much taller even these buildings have been scavenged adam he drew my attention from the stark concrete walls complexly chambered to the crude peaked roofs above them with their fluted redclay tiles and slumping chimneys you see how the roof is less sturdy than the building under it though considerably newer theres nothing much over four or five stories tall here yes yes tall enough and stop gawking adam youll embarrass yourself but some of these buildings were once almost ten times higher the greater part of them having been taken down by inches for their wood wire and aluminum even their steel frames were eventually whittled down and sent to the rerolling mills leaving only the subdivided stumps for people to inhabit if you think this city is magnificent adam conjure up in your minds eye the city it once was run the decades back and youd see marvels of steel and glassmanmade mountainsa city halfway to infiltrating the sky itself new york city is the same he added with evident pride only larger i was not daunted by his comparisons however for modernday montreal seemed quite astonishing enough with its bricked or cobbled streets and busy occupants let julian dwell on the glories of the pastthere was enough here to occupy the inquisitive mind the people were almost as surprising as the city in which they resided because we marched in a unit our regiment made a kind of martial parade and the inhabitants of the city stood back not always graciously to accommodate our passage while horses and wagons took alternative routes at the sound of our approach the women of the city wore colorful clothes dyed all the colors of the rainbow and seemed both aloof and alluring as they strolled through the vernal sunshine and passed in and out of the innumerable shops and markets the men dressed more conservativelymore peahen than peacock but their trousers and shirts and coats were clean and pressed even the children were welldressed and only a few of them went barefoot i asked julian are these folks aristos some but mostly not the eastern cities are not estates with a tightlycontrolled leasing class the business of the city requires artisans and laborers to be able to move freely between various jobs and managers and petty owners can negotiate loans and establish factories or shops as they please and profit from them the cumulative effect is a population some of whom are prosperous enough to dress extravagantlyat least at eastereven though they arent propertied in the full sense of that word hasnt the war harmed the city its been a mixed blessing i gather in the recent past the city has been exclusively in american hands and the presence of garrisoned troops has created an economic boom along with a bumper crop of larceny and vice look there adam that should impress youi believe thats the cathedral in which were supposed to worship after this sarcastic comment i could not admit how astonished i truly was though julian laughed once more at my gawking we had come up a low rise and around a corner into the neighborhood of a huge church it was the largest i had ever seennot the largest church but the largest thing i had ever seen meaning a manmade thing and not an act of nature railroad bridges aside but even the airy trestle at connaught which crosses the river pine might have fit inside this cathedral if properly folded its spires were tall enough to snag clouds and i could hardly catch my breath as we marched under its shadow and through the enormous and ornate wooden doors we paused in the dimness of the foyer under the direction of major lampret and took off our caps and stuffed them in our pockets out of respect then we passed through a second set of doors into the body of the cathedral as julian called it which was like the dominion hall back in williams ford if the dominion hall had been inflated to monstrous size its modest walls exchanged for vaulted granite and its woodwork shaped and polished by an army of imaginative and slightly mad carpenters everywhere in every direction was filigree down to the finest scale and alcoves and cubbies in which more filigree was on display and candles more numerous than stars in the sky creating a miasmic odor of smoky wax and above all this were several great stained glass windows as tall as the pines of athabaska illustrating ecclesiastical themes and of sunshot colors so radiant as to seem edenic there was some awed commentary among the troops few of whom had ever been inside a cathedral and several of the men hooted loudly in order to hear their voices come echoing back from the high arched ceiling until major lampret cuffed them into a respectful silence then we took our places in the pews does it gall you i whispered to sam to be in such a place for a christian religious service i was raised by christians after the death of my true parents he reminded me and ive been inside many churches on many easters and on other occasions too and i try to conduct myself as a wellmannered guest if not a genuine devotee now be quiet adam hazzard and listen to the singing as it happened we were stationed near the choir at first the choir seemed only a vague crowd dressed all in white then as my eyes adjusted to the dimness i realized the choristers were female and most of them young and i am ashamed to say that i was pleased by that discovery for the city women possessed a beauty just as striking it seemed to me right then as all the stained glass saints and marble martyrs in christendom skeptics will put that down to the deprivations of army lifeand there is of course some truth to thatbut i am convinced there was also an element of destiny in my fascination for standing in the front rank of the choir was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen i wont attempt to set down here the emotions this anonymous woman stirred in me for the superlatives would embarrass the mature writer summoning all my powers of objectivity then this is what i saw a short female person of approximately my own age in a cloudwhite surplice her body what some might call stout and others would call healthy with a pink and radiant face and large eyes whose color i could not at this distance discern although i imagined them correctly as it turned out to be a handsome chestnutbrown and a crown of hair that coiled like a vast collation of ebony springs the light behind her making a spectacular halo of it if she noticed me staring at her she showed no sign i could not distinguish her voice from the voices of the other female choristers but i was sure it was at least as pure and angelic as the rest they sang a hymn that was unfamiliar to me with references to the fortress of virtue the armory of faith and other metaphorical architecture thenunhappily for i was transported by the soundthe singing stopped and major lampret himself stepped up to the pulpit all eyes were suddenly on him including those of the choir and i found myself resenting the trim figure he cut in his dominion uniform its angelwing breast pin glinting in the multicolored light major lampret employing his paradeground voice so as to reach the back pews explained that the cathedral though nominally a catholic church had agreed to allow its premises to be used for nondenominational christian services dominioncontrived and dominionapproved for the spiritual benefit of such divisions as the army could spare from duty at the front he thanked the local clergy for their generosity then he admonished us all to keep silent and refrain from eating any food we might have concealed about ourselves and not to interrupt the service with cries of thats so or go on or other vulgar ejaculations nor to clap and whistle at the end of the sermon but rather to sit tight and think of redemption then a local clergymana priest i suppose for catholic clergy are so calledmounted the podium and began to read the sermon that had been prepared for him by the dominion scholars the lesson bid fair to be a long oneit began with palm leaves and promised a leisurely route to the resurrection which for me was the highlight of the story for i had always enjoyed picturing the astonishment of observers at the discovery of the empty tomband the clergyman had mastered that peculiar ecclesiastical drone which in combination with the heat and the fatigue of the march and the smoky air caused more than a few nodding heads among his temporary parishioners julian sitting next to me seemed deeply attentive but i knew better than to believe the appearance for julian had once told me what he did during church services an atheist being as much a foreigner in church as a jew he passed the time he said by imagining the movie he would one day make the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin rehearsing in his mind the individual scenes and the dialogue and how he might decorate the sets or work out the plot for maximum drama i fought off my own drowsiness by occasionally glancing back at the choir where the woman who had captivated me stood patiently she betrayed no boredom with the sermon though she occasionally cast a glance heavenward more in exasperation it seemed than in prayer and twice raised her left foot to scratch the calf of her right leg as the day grew warmer a bead of sweat formed on her forehead and trickled down her cheek absorbing and reflecting the colorful light it fascinated me an hour passed the clergyman was halfway through his oration or so i deduced since we had got past judas and were about to embark on the nasty business with pontius pilate when there was a distant crack as of thunder followed by a low rumbling that traveled up the wooden pews and into our spines this caused some muttering in the ranks but the priest carried on regardless and sam whispered artillery fireno danger to us the dutch dont have a cannon capable of reaching montreal from their trenches that reassured me a few more minutes passedthe stations of the cross were painstakingly negotiatedthen came another explosion nearer this time causing the clergyman to hesitate and a rain of dust to sift down from the ceiling that was close i exclaimed to sam he was frowning it shouldnt be possible major lampret hushed us but it came again a sharp report and a rolling boom so loud that it seemed to beperhaps was right next door i heard the distant clangor of fire bells and someone in the city began to crank a hand sirena dolorous and eerie sound which i had not heard before now the regiment stood up in alarm and the clergyman at the pulpit waved his hands in an urgent but indecipherable gesture and major lampret shouted form up form up and march out boys were wanted elsewhere but dont run youll clog the doors then a shell struck a deafening blow to the cathedral itself causing the illustrated windows to shatter and fly inward from their frames shards of glass brightly colored and razorsharp cascaded down around us i saw a man near the pulpit pierced by some crystalline splinter from a glass saintthe wound was almost certainly mortaland then a general panic began in earnest despite major lamprets shouted orders at first i joined the rush for the door then i turned back to see what had happened to the fascinating chorister but she was gonejust a flash of white among a flock of billowing surplices as the choir hurried into an adjoining chamber i followed behind sam and julian and had almost achieved the exit when some force from behind probably an over eager infantryman pushed me offbalance so that i fell and struck my head on the exquisitely carved backboard of a pew knocking myself quite unconscious i was not out of my senses for longjust long enough to become separated from my regiment i raised my head in confusion aware of the pain in my temple and little more the great cathedral was still intact except for the shattered windows and the stampede had left it almost deserted save for the priest and a few other clergymen who were attending the wounded man down front i touched my scalp where it had impacted the pew and my fingers came back stained with blood i looked around for sam or julian or even lymon pugh but they were gone with all the restgone back to camp i guessed to prepare some response to this fresh dutch outrage i was sure they would have taken me with them except that i had fallen between the rows of pews and would have been easily missed in the rush i reasoned that i ought to rejoin my regiment as soon as possible lest i be set down as absent without leave or marked as a deserter but when i stumbled out of the cathedral i was immediately lost the shelling had caused no little damage in the neighborhood and the street by which i had arrived here was blocked with debris and partially aflame city folk rushed about haphazardly some wounded or burned and redpainted firereels drawn by panting dray horses clattered down the open roadways with their brass bells fiercely clanging but only certain areas of this vast city had been damagedit was so large that most of it seemed untouchedand after a brief thought i resolved to work my way north until i came within sight of the iron bridge my regiment had originally crossed it was with this purpose in mind that i set out along a side street undamaged in the attack where the fourand fivestory concrete buildings had been divided into shops and the floors above were balconied and ironrailed and decorated with spring flowers the picturesque alley was not straight however it twined like a serpent and when i reached the next intersection i couldnt tell which way to go in the meantime crowds of city people continued to brush past me not a few of them were fleeing the artillery attack in the cathedral district and they were too absorbed in their own misfortune to notice one dislocated infantryman i stood helpless in my confusion until my eyes were drawn by a flourish of white across the waya surplice robe as you may have guessed and it was worn by none other than the woman with the springloaded hair and lustrous eyes i dashed across the street heedless of the many passing carriages you were in the church i said when i reached her and she turned to squint at me her small fists clenched in case i proved hostile yes she said brusquely were youahwere you hurt obviously i was not she replied in a tone so cool that i supposed she must have grown accustomed to being shelled by the dutch from time to time the event being no more surprising to her than a summer squall i was i managed to say i injured my head how unfortunate i hope you recover she turned away wait i said and gestured back toward the billowing smoke whats happening here its called war she said as if she were addressing an idiot who had inquired about the color of the sky and in her defense that must have been how i sounded the dutch have launched an artillery barrage though it seems to be finished for the moment shouldnt you be with your regiment soldier i should be and i would be if i could find it which way is the big iron bridge there are several but the one you want is just down that direction i thanked her and added may i see you safely home of course not she said my name is adam hazzard i said remembering the importance of a polite introduction calyxa she said grudginglythe first time i had heard that interesting name go back to your regiment adam hazzard and put a bandage on your head its bleeding you sing very beautifully huh said she and walked off without looking back it was a brief meeting but a pleasant one even under these extraordinary circumstances and as i hurried to the bridge despite my anxiety and the blood trickling down my face and the smoke rising from the city behind me i thanked providence or fate or fortune or one of those other pagan deities for having brought the two of us together they have a chinese cannon said sam i had caught up with my regiment and both sam and julian had apologized for not rescuing me or even noticing that i was missing until after the cathedral was evacuated i took this as a commentary on the chaos that followed the attack rather than on my own insignificance and a hearty welcome dispelled any lingering resentment on my part i expected we would be thrust into immediate battle in order to punish the dutch for their impudence but a modern army is a sedentary beast and slow to move general galligasken who commanded the army in total was a notoriously cautious leader reluctant to unleash his forces until every contingency had been accounted for and all preparations were fully in place it was a tendency that frustrated the executive branch julian said but it made galligasken a popular figure with the troops who were wellfed under his regime and whose lives were not recklessly squandered the veterans among us had shared stories of the harsh rule of galligaskens predecessor general stratemeyer a disciplinarian who squandered thousands of lives in futile and unproductive trench attacks general stratemeyer had been killed early last year when he rode away from his camp to consult a cavalry commander but took a wrong turn placing him athwart a line of dutch skirmishers who were pleased to employ him for target practice for these reasons we did not march into battle at once but sat in camp while scouts and pickets probed the opposing lines and brought back captives who disgorged useful intelligence about the enemys capabilities and intentions sam though still a mere private worked his connections until he was welleducated about the current state of military affairs a week after the attack on montreal the three of us huddled in our tent against another interval of rain and sam told us about the chinese cannon while a springtime zephyr whipped the canvas above our heads i asked him what made a cannon chinese and why it was to be particularly feared the chinese he said have been waging wars of their own for many years and theyre cunning in the production of field artillery especially longbore cannonry some of these weapons they sell abroad to help finance their own military expeditions chinese cannons are formidable but very expensive the mitteleuropans must have bought one or are using their own factories to mimic the design we have artillery pieces aplenty i protested for i had seen them about the camp many and wellmade sam agreed but the chinese cannon has a greater range than anything of ours it can deliver shells and canister deep into an opponents territory i suppose we could build a similar cannon along traditional lines but it would be clumsy to transport the genius of the chinese cannon is that it quickly breaks down into what are called subassemblies which can be moved by horse or rail as easily as a conventional artillery piece we need to capture or decommission this cannon i said firmly probably general galligasken has thought of that said julian though your reasoning as far as it goes is flawless adam sam ignored julians sarcasm and said we will do so or at least make the attempt but it needs forethought and careful planning i expect well see action before the week is out curb your impatience adamthe dutch are just as eager to get you in their sights as you are to punish them i would punish them grandly i declared for it was cowardly of them to have attacked helpless civilians at montreal putting calyxa among others at risk youll see worse things before the army is done with us said sam and in that as in most of his prophecies he was entirely correct the next day the rain stopped and a few days after that the roads had dried and general galligasken himself rode through camp which we took to be the signal of an impending attack i caught a brief glimpse of the general one wide dirt lane cut through the entirety of the army encampment connecting several parade grounds and it was down this route that general galligasken rode infantrymen pressed the margins of the road on all sides waving their caps and shouting as the general passed by i was determined not to miss such a spectacle and by a determined use of my elbows i made my way to the front of the crowd or close enough that by some welltimed jumping i could see the whole of the procession what surprised me was the generals relative youth he was not a young man especially but neither was he a grizzled veteranlast years campaigns had been a success for the dutch sam had explained and there were fewer grizzled veterans extant than there ought to have been many younger men had been catapulted up the ranks general bernard w galligasken was one of these and he cut a sprightly figure in the saddle smiling serenely at the lapping ocean of infantrymen that surrounded him he was vain some said about his appearance and certainly his uniform was tailored to within a fine inch and bright in all its colors the blueandyellow costume suited him however and his long hair brushed his stiff starched collar in a jaunty fashion the alabaster handle of his porter earle pistol glinted from the supple leather holster at his hip and there was a great deal of stamped metal on his chest to mark the battles he had endured and the bravery he had displayed in them his hat was a broadbrimmed extravagance with a turkey feather attached the chinese cannon spoke twice during this display and one of the shells burst less than a quarter of a mile from our camp but the dutch did not exactly have our range because of the great distance from which they aimed and their inability to spot the impacts it was a haphazard affair which we all ignored the cannon sam said used particular and expensive ammunition which the dutch were probably hoarding for the more intense fighting to come this procession of general galligasken with his train of subordinates and standardbearers was a little more fuss and feathers than would have been deemed proper back in williams ford but the general was not in camp solely to make a show he met with his battalion commanders that night in a council of war final plans were laid and we were instructed by our superiors to sleep on our arms and be ready to move before dawn the next morning we marched to battle at first it was route march in which we were not held to a strict formation though our regiment aware of its unblooded status kept up in dignified linesoffour things went slowly in the darkness of the early morning and the roads were still damp so that mule trains and horsedrawn wagons struggled in the soft spots as dawn pearled the horizon the sound of marching feet creaking leather rattling canteens and tinkling spurs was joined by an incongruously joyful chorus of bird song it was spring and the birds were nesting unaware that their homes might be destroyed by cannonade or rifle fire before the day or the season was out the territory through which we passed had been overbuilt in the days of the secular ancients but only a few traces of that exuberant time remained and a whole forest had grown up since then maple and birch and pine its woody roots no doubt entwined with artifacts from the efflorescence of oil and with the bones of the artifacts owners what is the modern world julian once asked but a vast cemetery reclaimed by nature every step we took reverberated in the skulls of our ancestors and i felt as if there were centuries rather than soil beneath my feet the skirmishing began as soon as the sun cleared the horizon or perhaps it had begun sooner since we were in the rear of the advance and the hilly terrain around us obscured the sounds of battle in fact the battle announced itself like a coming storm by a series of ominous signs first the pall of smoke over the hilly ground ahead of us second the low growl of artillery third the crackle of smallarms fire fourth the acrid smell of gunpowder these tokens of conflict increased in volume and intensity as the sun rose and then we began to see a sight that disheartens any soldier wagonloads of casualties being carried to the rear it must be fierce fighting i said in a low voice as a canvasback dominion wagon as these makeshift ambulances were called jounced past its passengers concealed but their groans and screams all too audible on the morning air then we topped another hill and the battlefield was briefly laid out before us like a game boardmuch of it however masked by smoke i thought i saw general galligasken observing from this same ridge and our longestrange cannons were here arrayed banging and recoiling repetitively down below were the nearest of the enemys trenches it was my first glimpse of the dutch or deutsche as they are more properly called for germany is the heart and brain of mitteleuropa and deutsche is another name for the german language but many of the foreign soldiers in labrador and most of the foreign settlers were former residents of the netherlands which had lost much of its land to the sea in recent times i could hardly contain myself at the sight of their massed army all my life i had heard of the vicious and aggressive mitteleuropans until they became a kind of legend to me often cited but never seen but here they were in the flesh and even at this great distance through the coiling smoke and the air hot with gunfire i caught glimpses of their characteristic black uniforms and blue helmets and their curious crossandlaurel flags they seemed from this height to be in welldefended positions with their trenches arranged in a broad semicircle dotted with lunettes and redoubts and abatisses each end anchored against a riverbank firmly controlled by enemy artillery currently an american division was making a brazen frontal attack with some diversionary skirmishing at the sides the attack was not going well however to judge by the numerous corpses already littering the ground before the dutch entrenchments sam leaned close to julian and asked in his tutelary voice what do you see a battle julian said his voice was unsteady and i had seldom seen his face so bloodless though he was pale by nature you can do better than that keep your wits about you and tell me what you see julian suppressed his fear with a visible effort i see well a conventional attack boldly conducted but i cant imagine why the general is wasting so many troops this way there seems to be no strategy about it only brute force galligasken is a cannier officer than that what do you not see julian julian gazed a little longer then nodded the cavalry and why would galligasken not put his cavalry into battle because theyre elsewhere youre implying that he does have a strategy and that it involves our mounted forces that at least is what im hoping it was true that the fight seemed bold but in effective the american attack began to buckle as we watchedone of our veteran divisions had come under especially galling fire and the commander failed to rally his troops a standardbearer fell his flag was not recovered terrified men lay motionless or turned and dashed for the rear and it might have been the beginning of a rout except that our regiment was sent into the fray as reinforcements a soldier whose arm had been shattered walked past me as we advanced into the smoke and noise his left forearm was all but detachedconnected to its elbow by a few mucilaginous stringsand he clasped it against his belly with his right hand as a child might clutch a bag of candy to protect it from thieving playmates his uniform was thoroughly doused with blood he seemed not to see us and although he opened his mouth repeatedly no sound emerged from it dont look at that man sam scolded me eyes ahead adam sam was the only soldierly one among us he advanced in a crouch with his pittsburgh rifle held steadily the rest of us moved across this scarred meadow like cattle up a slaughterhouse chute a process lymon pugh had described to me our company commander shouted at us to stop bunching together or be killed like geese and we separated but reluctantly at such a time any normal person craves the presence of another human being if only to have something to hide behind we were protected for a time by the thick pall of smoke stinking of cordite and blood that lay over the battlefield though shells from enemy artillery exploded around us at intervals and some in our company were wounded by the shrapnel but as we approached the enemys lines volleys of bullets flew past at close proximity and our company was not exempt from casualties i saw two men fall one wounded in the face and one of our men who had been in the vanguard we reencountered as a corpse in a bombcrater his vitals so widely scattered over the bloody earth that we had to step carefully to avoid treading on his steaming viscera this was so irregular that i became convinced that i was mad or that the world had suddenly become so war in the novels of mr charles curtis easton was not conducted with such savagery mr eastons wars allowed for bravery pluck patriotism and all that tribe of reassuring virtues the present war seemed to make no such allowances it was purely a matter of killing or being killed as chance and circumstance would have it i kept my rifle at the ready and twice fired at wraiths in the smoke without any way to determine whether the shot went home among my swirling thoughts was a passing concern for julian i could not help thinking of the time we had spent hunting squirrels and other game back at williams ford and how julian had enjoyed every part of those expeditions except the killing he was one of those gentle souls who instinctively recoil from death and who dread inflicting it on others this was not cowardice but a species of innocencean admirable if innate tenderness of feeling which i suspected was about to get him killed at that moment a wind sprang up clearing some of the haze from the becalmed though savagely active battlefield with the next gust the nearest lines of the dutch defenders were revealed to us in stark clarity as if a curtain had been drawn a line of riflebarrels protruded from earthen breastworks like quilly spines from a porcupine and these were hastily leveled at us now that visibility permitted careful aiming and smoke erupted from their barrels down sam shoutedforgetting for the moment that he was not the company commander but only an ordinary soldier nevertheless it was sturdy advice which we all obeyed we dropped most of us voluntarily though several fell in a fashion that indicated they might not rise again the dutch bullets whined past us with maddening insectile noises mosquitovoiced but deadly in their flight as mr easton once wrote in this case correctly we hugged the ground as if the familiar metaphor of mother earth had become a factsuckling pigs could not have been more intimately connected to their maternal sow all of us except julian as soon as i dared to look up i was shocked to find him still standing that image of julian has been so deeply impressed upon me that to this day i see it from time to time in dreams he had washed and dried his uniform just yesterday anticipating battle as if it were a social soiree and despite the rigors of the march he seemed as clean and unspoiled as a stagesoldier in some new york operetta he frowned as if what confronted him was not the barbarous enemy but an especially perplexing puzzle which required deep thought to work out he held his rifle at ready but didnt aim or fire it julian cried sam for the love of god down the love of god did not add any weight to the admonitionjulian had always been impermeable to god and just now it seemed he might also be impermeable to bullets the volleys surged around and kicked up dirt at his feet without interfering with his person by this time nearby soldiers had noticed him standing like a sentinel in the rain of sizzling lead and we waited for what seemed an inevitable lethal impact already impossibly postponed for the dutch shooters were finding their range as the air cleared a bullet like a flicking finger tugged at the collar of julians uniform another doffed his cap for him still he didnt move the spectacle entranced us all and small appreciative or despairing cries of julian commongold began to sound above the clamor of battle he stood and kept standingit was as if an angel had dropped down to earth in the guise of a foot soldierthe crude material world couldnt touch him and he was as immune to bloodshed as an elephant to fleabites then a bullet creased his ear i saw it happen there was no impact since the bullet passed through the fleshy part of the lobe spraying just a little blood but julian turned his head as if he had been tapped on the shoulder by an invisible adjutant the contact shook him into a fresh awareness of his situation he did not drop to the ground however it was only that his puzzled frown evolved into a grimace of anger and disdain he lifted his rifle with grave deliberation sighted it on the enemy breastworks and fired though julian had said nothing the men around him reacted as if he had given an order to advance our standardbearer who was hardly more than a dozen years old leapt up and ran forward with the regimental flag in his hands the rest of us fired our weapons almost in unison and then joined the charge whooping the smoke of battle provided cover enough that we came close to the dutch entrenchments without being decimated and our reckless charge had a greater than anticipated effect only a moment seemed to pass before we were athwart the mitteleuropan trenches firing our pittsburgh rifles with abandon or dropping to reload them with fresh cassettes the dutch at close proximity looked much like americans apart from their peculiar uniforms and so it was their uniforms i fired at half convinced that i was killing not human beings but enemy costumes which had borne their contents here from a distant land and if some living man suffered for his enslavement to the uniform or was penetrated by the bullets aimed at itwell that was unavoidable and the fault couldnt be placed at my feet this private charade was not equivalent to courage but it enabled a callousness that served a similar purpose i lost sight of julian in the melee and in truth i could not spare much thought for him at this chaotic moment even today the memory is little more than a collage of noise and ugly incidents the battle evolved quickly or took foreverin all honesty i cannot say whichand then we heard a new and alarming sound it was a sort of gunfire not the sharp report of a pittsburgh rifle but a staccato chain of gunshots sustained for seconds and then repeated sam explained later what had happened general galligasken had sent his cavalry out on a flank attack against the dutch positionshardly an unusual maneuver but the cavalry had been training in secret with a new weapon which was our answer to the chinese cannon this weapon which came to be called the trench sweeper was a heavy rifle with an enormous cassette the size and shape of a pieplate which fed bullets to its chamber and fired them in rapid successiona volley of gunshots continuing for as long a time as the trigger was depressed the porter earle works had produced relatively few of these guns but a number of them had been distributed to galligaskens cavalry division for occasions such as this the cavalry riding into the dutch at their flanks encountered a fierce resistance but the dutch commander had been fooled by galligaskens frontal attack and he had weakened his left and right in order to shore up the center a good many american cavalrymen were killed before the dutch defenses were penetrated but eventually the trench sweepers were brought to bear and the resultant rain of fire caused enemy troops to panic and abandon their positions in increasing numbers before long they were fleeing across the river at which they had made their stand scores of them were drowned in the process and their bodies littered the shore like branches from a thunderstruck tree it was a rout ultimately more than a thousand of the enemy were killed and twice that number were taken prisoner our own corpses numbered just a little over five hundred general galligasken ordered a pursuit of the fleeing dutch army and captured a few stragglers and some supply wagons and horses but the main column disappeared into the hills and forests and galligasken wisely held back fearing an ambush and was content with the spoils of the day this was eventually called the battle of mascouche mascouche being the name of a nearby tip it was a stirring victory all in all except that we did not capture the chinese cannon it had been kept to the rear of the action and was dismantled and spirited away before we could reach it in the aftermath of the battle i found sam and julian both more or less unhurt and we made a new camp on the riverside as supplies were trucked forward and field hospitals established for the wounded by nightfall we had been fed and were resting in our tents it was an incongruously warm benevolent evening sweet as april butter and the moon was bright and cheerfully indifferent to the shed blood congealing beneath it julian said very little that evening in truth although he had survived the fight with only a nick to his earlobe i was afraid for him it seemed that something just as vital as blood had drained out of him during the exciting events of the day as we were getting ready to sleep he leaned from his bedroll and whispered i dont know how many men i killed today adam enough to help ensure a victory i said is it really a victory what we saw today it more closely resembled a fire in a charnel house he added its a bitter thing to kill a strangerworse to kill strangers beyond counting he was speaking hyperbole but the very flatness of his voice suggested a grievance too deep for words and to a degree i shared it to fire a bullet into the heart or brains of ones fellow maneven a fellow man striving to do the same to youcreates what might be called an unassimilable memory a memory that floats on daily life the way an oil stain floats on rainwater stir the rain barrel scatter the oil into countless drops disperse it all you like but it will not mix and eventually the slick comes back as loathsomely intact as it ever was we can never again be what we once were julian whispered i sat up indignantly im still just adam hazzard adam hazzard from williams ford hasnt gone away julian he just went to war someday hell go somewhere else new york city perhaps julian evidently took some comfort from my crude philosophizing for he grasped my hand warmly and said in a trembling voice thank you for saying so sleep on it i suggested perhaps we wont have to kill anyone tomorrow and you can get some useful rest but i couldnt take my own advicecouldnt sleep despite my exhaustion any more than julian could so we lay awake while the moon shone down on the battlefield where we had driven back the dutch and on the hospital tents with their detritus of severed limbs and on the river that flowed somewhat bloodstained to the mighty st lawrence and all the way to the shoreless sea because of general galligaskens humanitarian concern for the army of the laurentians we were not obliged to fight the following day nor did we march in pursuit of the enemy but stayed where we were and buried our dead and consolidated our defenses in case the dutch attempted a counterattack in another month or less this land would be a steaming gehenna hospitable only to the mosquitos and the horseflies that feed on human and animal flesh and our marches should we make any would be mortal contests of endurance already the hospital tents where they were not wholly preoccupied with wounded men hosted a number of invalids down with the summer complaint and there was the everpresent danger of an outbreak of cholera or some other communicable disease we drew water from local streams to drink for the army barrelwater was stagnant and fusty and we hoped for the best but the weather held calm and pleasant for a few days more on sunday afternoon after dominion services a general lassitude fell over the camp and i wandered among the tents like an aristo strolling through his garden though aristocratic gardens are generally more pleasing to the nose than military encampments it was while i was strolling and sampling the sunshine and humming tunes to myself that i heard a noise which puzzled and interested me there are all sorts of noises around an army camp army engineers banging wood for inscrutable purposes army blacksmiths bending horseshoes on an anvil infantrymen at target practice and any number of other clattery pursuits but most of those sounds had abated on account of the sabbath what i heard was a sound that could be mistaken at a distance for the irregular knocking of a woodpecker on a tree or a boy drummer unsuccessfully attempting some novel rhythm but the sound had a brittler more mechanical quality than that and once my curiosity was engaged i could think of nothing else but to track the noise to its source its approximate source i soon discerned was a square canvas tent situated up a sloping meadow that became farther east a respectable hill the tents flaps were open so i wandered past it hands clasped behind my back feigning indifference but sparing a subtle glance or two inside but it was difficult to see inside in any meaningful waymy vision was hampered not just by the shade of the canvas but by an obscuring miasma of tobacco and hemp smoke which wafted into the sunshine in coiling exhalations as if the tent itself were alive and breathingand i had to make several passes before i could discern the agency responsible for so much smoke and noise it was a man seated at a flimsy wooden table working a machine my effort to remain inconspicuous was apparently not successful for on my seventh or eighth pass the mysterious man called out stop hovering there whoever you are his voice was rough and he spoke with a nasal accent not unlike julians come in or go outi dont care whichbut choose one im sorry if i disturbed you i said hastily i was disturbed before you came along dont take all the credit what are you staring at that machine i admitted taking an uninvited step into the shade and resisting the temptation to hold my breath as my vision adapted to the dim light i could see that the man had equipped himself with an ashtray pipe leather pokebag and a flask that added the astringent odor of alcohol to the already dizzying assortment of musks in the air he was not dressed as an infantryman and in fact he seemed to be a civilian his clothes were threadbare and patched but must have been respectable at one time he wore a narrow hat slouched over his eyes but this was only a sparing assay of the man for i was much more interested in the machine the machine though not much larger than a generouslyproportioned bread box was as intricate as a pocket watch turned insideout finished in black enamel and studded with round ridged buttons on which letters were etched one per key a sheet of paper was squeezed around a cylinder like a rolling pin set behind all this and words were printed on the page its a typewriter the man said i suppose they dont have typewriters in whatever hamlet you hail from i ignored this implied insult to williams ford and said you mean its a printing press are you making a book for i had not yet inquired into the mechanics of bookmaking and i guessed this might be the way books were manufactured by grubby men copying them one letter at a time do i look like a publisher to you you ought not to impose on my hospitality and then insult me my name is adam hazzard i said theodore dornwood he muttered and returned his attention to the business before him thats an admirable machine i persisted even if its not a printing press what do you do with it do you make signs or notices im not a publisher im not a signmaker and im not even a company clerk my station in life is below all those im a writer that startled mei had never seen a writer before nor met anyone who described himself as one my eyes widened and i exclaimed without much in the way of forethought so am i mr dornwood caught the smoke from his pipe the wrong way and began to cough at least i added thats my ambition i mean one day to write books such as the ones by mr charles curtis eastoni assume youve heard of him of course ive heard of him his books litter all the stalls in hudson street where is hudson street then thinking that if this street were in montreal i might be willing to part with some of my army pay in order to catch up with mr eastons recent work manhattan mr theodore dornwood said casting a glance at the page in his typewriter with a certain rueful longing youre a new york writer then i correspond for the spark the spark was a new york city newspaper i had never seen a copyof the spark or any other newspaperbut julian had mentioned it once or twice as a popular if vulgar daily journal is that what youre doing nowcorresponding no just at the moment im passing the time with every idle infantryman who happens to wander by but i was working curiously enough before you began hovering at the tentflap since theodore dornwood came from manhattan i was tempted to ask whether he had met julian comstock there or passed him on the streets but i remembered that any careless identification of julian as a comstock might attract the attention of julians murderous uncle and deklan conqueror must be uniquely sinister i had lately thought if he was more dangerous to confront than a legion of armed and angry dutchmen the difference sam explained was that our enlistment would only last a year or so while the threat from julians uncle would persist throughout his reign therefore i left julians name out of the discussion and said well i wish i had a machine as fine as that one do all new york writers own one the privileged few how does it work you push the keyslike this seeand the letters are impressed on the paperat least when the operator is allowed sufficient privacy in which to work isnt it a slow process compared to handwriting faster if youre trained to it and the finished manuscript is easier to set as copy hazzard you said your name was are you the soldier whos been teaching these country boys their letters the lessons i gave lymon pugh had been so successful that a few other infantrymen had begged to be included i was pleased that mr dornwood had heard of me im the one and you write too he inhaled from his pipe and gave out a vesuviusload of smoke the pungent air in the tent was beginning to make me feel lightheaded though it seemed to have no such effect on dornwood who must have saturated himself in his vices so long that he had acquired an immunity to them he wasnt old in the sense that sam godwin was old but he was at least ten years older than myselfold enough to be hardened to his own bad habits what are you working on at the moment adam hazzard i blushed at the question and said well i do keep paper and pencils handy though i dont have a writingmachine with springs and levers i mark down a word or two from time to time no modesty between scribblers said dornwood fiction is it yesa story about a western boy kidnapped by chinese traders and taken to sea against his will and when he escapes his captors he falls in with pirates but what they dont know is i see and how many pirates have you met adam hazzard the question took me by surprise in life wellnone but you must have studied them extensively from a distance not exactly well are you absolutely sure pirates exist since theyre so foreign to your experience no dont answer that im making a point why write about pirates adam when youre embedded in an adventure at least as momentous as anything c c easton ever imagined what are you sayingthat i should write about the war but ive only seen a little of it no matter write what you know its one of the abiding principles of the trade the worse for me then i said ruefully for i dont know much at all when you come down to it surely everybody knows something the battle of mascouche for instance werent you in the thick of it yes but it was my first wouldnt it be a sensible exercise to set down in pencil what happened on that day not what happened to the army of the laurentiansleave that to the historiansi mean what happened to you your personal experience who would be interested it would be an exercise in writing if nothing else adam he exclaimed standing up from his desk and flinging an arm around my shoulders in a surprising display of conviviality why are you wasting your time here a writer must write first and last dont squander precious minutes gazing at my typewriteror worse touching itnow is the time to hone your literary skills while the dutch are quiet and the weathers fair take up your humble pencil adam hazzard and set down in all the detail you can remember the events of a few days past this made immediate sense to mein fact i was excited by his suggestion and reproached myself for not having thought of such an exercise before and when its done shall i show it to you he sat back down as if the wind had gone out of him show it to me my account of the battle so that you can point out what an experienced writer might have done differently mr dornwood knotted his brows and looked uncomfortable then he said well all right i suppose you can bring it to me next sunday if neither of us is killed by then thats very generous im a wellknown saint said dornwood i meant to go straight to my tent and practice my literary skills as dornwood had suggested but on the way back i was distracted by a crowd of men who had gathered around the tent of private langers langers the reader will remember was a passenger on the caribouhorn train a colporteur as he pleased to call himself who had been in the business of selling religious pamphlets on delicate topics to lonely men who enjoyed the printed illustrations for reasons not necessarily allied to piety or faith private langers had been put out of that trade by conscription and he was just another infantryman now but his entrepreneurial instincts had survived the transformation and it seemed like he was back in businesssome kind of businessjudging by the eager crowd around him i asked another soldier what was going on langers was on burial duty the man said surprising that that should have made him so popular he collected all sorts of things from the bodies of dead dutchmen jackets and hats badges and wallets eyeglasses and glass eyes brass buckles and leather holsters enemy armaments had to be handed over to the quartermaster but everything else i gathered was fair game for the burial detail i knew that men were often tempted to take a souvenir or two from their fallen foes if their stomachs were strong enough for the treasurehunt but he had gone far beyond that modest impulse he had harvested the fields of the fallen with a bushel basket and put the culled trinkets on display dozens of dutch prizes were arrayed on a blanket in front of his tent under a sign which read everything it seemed to me an odd price a few of the objects were obviously worth more than that such as the collections of dutch coins which could be traded in montreal for legal tender but most were worth much less the jackets almost all had bulletholes in them for instance and even the glass eye though lifelike was cracked but there was a trick to it the soldier next to me explained it dont mean you pay a dollar and take what you like everything has a number beside it written on those scraps of paper and langers has a jar with similar scraps inside it when you pay your dollar he says reach into the jar and you do so and you pull out a number and find out just what it was you bought it might be something good like that mermaid buckle there but it might be a sad little leather bag or a shoe with a hole in it isnt that gambling hell no the soldier said its not half as much fun i had been warned against gambling all my life both by my mother and by the dominion reader for young persons though the only gambling i had ever seen firsthand was the kind the indentured folks indulged in betting tobacco or alcohol on dice or cards most of those games ended in fist fights and i was never tempted by them but private langerss pickanumber enterprise was more difficult to resist i was curious about the dutch and felt that i ought to know a thing or two about the people i had been shooting at and occasionally killing to own one of their possessions seemed almost a religious act if i can be excused that small apostasy like the custom primitive peoples have of eating their enemys heartsa more christian enactment of the same urge so i pushed to the front of the crowd and took a comstock dollar from my pocket and paid it over for the privilege of reaching into private langerss lucky mug the number i retrieved was which corresponded to a small leather satchel muchscuffed and disappointingly slender this was not by any standards a valuable thing to have boughtand langers smiled with satisfaction as he tucked away my dollar and handed over the satchel but my disappointment didnt last for the satchel when i opened it contained a letter apparently written by a dutch soldier shortly before his death again this had no monetary value and langers had every reason to crow over the bargain but as a souvenir of a mans life and a glimpse into the habits of the mitteleuropan infantry the letter interested me terrifically i unfolded the two closelywritten pages i had bought and thought about that deceased dutchman putting his pen to paper little suspecting that his words would become the property of a williams ford leaseboy much less the booty of a corpselooting colporteur i took the letter to my tent and stared at it for nearly an hour thinking about fate and death and other weighty and philosophical subjects lymon pugh came by as i was deep in these reveries and i showed him the letter he puzzled over it a moment my lessons in reading dont seem to have advanced this far he said of course you cant read it its written in dutch dutch they dont just speak that noise they also write it down thats their habit yes but you know all your letters adam cant you decipher it oh i can read the letters all rightso can you though you might not be accustomed to cursive script this word here for example liefstethose are all familiar letters i cant make out what they spell though it looks like it might be pronounced leafst or leafstee depending on how they use their terminal vowels lymon pugh looked scornful thats not a word its certainly not a word in english but in dutch if theyre going to write out letters why cant they do it decently no wonder we have to fight them but i suppose its not meant to be understood not by the likes of us at least perhaps its a code maybe what you have there is a plan of action written from one dutch general to another that had not occurred to me the suggestion was troubling and i determined to show the letter to major ramsden of our regiment major ramsden spoke a little dutch since his father had been a stranded dutch sailor and it was ramsden who interrogated captured prisoners in their own language i found him dozing in his tent taking advantage of the sabbath calm and he was not delighted to see me but he agreed to look at what id brought him when i handed him the letter he turned it halfsideways and squinted at it and ran his fingers over it and hummed to himself at length he was so reluctant to render a translation that i wondered whether he might be illiterateable to speak dutch but not read it but when i hinted at that possibility he gave me a venomous look and i let the matter drop i have preserved the letter through many years and it sits beside me as i write and this is how it looked though the ink is faded now and some of the letters are uncertain liefste hannie it began ik hoop dat je deze brief krijgt ik probeer hem met de postboot vanuit goose bay te versturen ik mis je heel erg dit is een afschuwelijke oorlog in een vreseleijk landijzig koud in de winter en walgelijk heet en vochtig in de zomer de vliegen eten je levend en de bestuurders hier zijn tirannen ik verlang er zo naar om je in mijn armen te houden what does that mean i asked major ramsden frowned some more and looked at me resentfully then he said its all about how he hates america he hates america they all dothe dutch what does he hate us for major ramsden squinted at the text for our freedoms he said this had been the subject of todays dominion service by coincidence our godgiven freedoms enumerated and the enemys instinctive hatred for them does he say which freedoms upset him so is it the freedom of pious assembly the freedom of acceptable speech all those and what about this i pointed out the second sheet of the letter on which the dutchman had committed a drawing the pen sketch was ambiguous it appeared to show some sort of animal or perhaps a sweet potato with spots and a tail under it was written fikkie mis ik ook it says all americans are dogs the major explained i could only marvel at the fanaticism of the mitteleuropans and at the unreasoning hatred their rulers had instilled in them for the next few months our regiment was largely exempted from the war though not from its consequences it was explained to us in a series of general camp meetings that the dutch attack on montreal as it turned out had been little more than a feint by a few divisions of the mitteleuropan army the real action was at the saguenay river where it entered the st lawrence east of quebec city that was where our freshwater navy under admiral bolen fought a pitched battle with a fleet of heavilyarmored enemy gunboats which had been assembled in lake st john by the stealthy dutch we had lost many a vessel in that encounter and the burning wrecks some still flying the thirteen stripes and sixty stars had been seen floating down the st lawrence like the candled boats the japanese launch in honor of their dead mr easton describes this poignant custom in his novel of a union sailor in the orient the dutch proceeded to build fortifications near tadoussac overlooking the river and brought up their best artillery including a chinese cannon to harass union traffic and strangle american trade and it quickly became apparent that the purpose of the campaign of would be to reduce these fortifications while maintaining a protective cordon around both montreal and quebec city much of the army of the laurentians therefore was put aboard boats and shipped east to participate in the land battle but montreal itself must still be garrisoned and that responsibility fell to the less seasoned troops which included our regiment of western conscripts i was sad not to be included in the summer action but julian scoffed at that sentiment and said we were lucky and that if our luck held we might be released from the military without seeing more bloodshed than the battle of mascouche and that would be a fine thing but my patriotism or naïveté burned more brightly than julians and i was occasionally distraught to think of all the dutchmen being killed by other soldiers creating a shortage for the rest of us and yet it was not all bad news for we would be allowed many recreational leaves in the city of montreal that summer and i was eager for another chance to meet with calyxa and perhaps even to learn her last name our first leave was nearly canceled however because of an event which involved julian and cast a pall over the entire camp a newfashioned colonel lately assigned from new york city had decided our encampment ran too close to our breastworks and i was assigned to help relocate the offending tents the tents by this time had taken on all the qualities of homesteads however with rude cookingpits flues made of mud lines strung to dry laundry and all such small domestic entanglements thus the work had lasted well into the night and i had not had very much sleep when i was awakened by sam godwins hand on my shoulder the following morning wake up adam he said julian needs your help whats he done now i asked rubbing my eyes with hands still gritty from the nights work only the usual intemperate talk but lampret has got wind of it and julian has been called to the majors headquarters for what lampret calls a discussion surely julian can handle a discussion all by himself i would like to sleep an hour longer and then go down to the river to bathe if its all the same bathe later im not asking you to go with julian and hold his hand i want you to conceal yourself outside lamprets tent and listen to their conversation take notes if necessary or just apply your memory then come and tell me what transpired cant you just ask julian about it after the things done major lampret is a dominion officer he has the power to assign julian to some other company or even send him off to the front at any time he chooses if lampret is angry enough he might not give julian time to packwe might not see julian again in the worst case or discover where hes been sent that made sense and was alarming i said as a last wistful defense cant you listen in on their conversation as well as i can a muddy young private whos been on work detail all night might be excused for dozing off among the ropes and barrels outside lamprets tent i have no such excuse and my age makes me conspicuous go on adam theres no time to lose so i roused myself and drank a little tepid water from a canteen to bring myself fully awake then i walked over to major lamprets headquarters which was just a big square tent pitched next to the quartermasters warren of fresh supplies it was this surplus of barrels boxes ropes and loose equipment that provided my cover as sam had suggested three convoys had unloaded just yesterday and our quartermaster was overworked trying to distribute store and apportion the bounty as a result i was able to saunter into a labyrinth of stacked goods and negotiate my way to the layer of provisions which happened to abut major lamprets tent by some quiet and artful shifting i created a blind and i curled up in it just adjacent to lamprets canvas sam had not told me when the meeting between julian and lampret was set to take place however and as i waited i was tempted again by sleep for the day was warm and so was my uniform and a barrel of salt pork nearby had drawn a crowd of flies whose droning became a kind of lullaby and the resinous boxboards sweating in the sunlight gave off a dolorous perfume my chin dipped from time to time and i was afraid i would be found here hours later dreaming contentedly only to discover on waking that julian had been shipped off to schefferville or points north i used this unpleasant prospect to torture myself into alertness nevertheless i was relieved when i caught sight of julian approaching across the parade ground his head erect and his uniform clean and square reporting as ordered julian said when he arrived and although i could no longer see him his voice was as crisply audible as if he had spoken into my ear julian commongold said major lampret said private commongoldor should i call you pastor commongold sir julian asked i understand youve been lecturing the troops on religious subjects since i was unable to see either party to this conversation i mean to transcribe it as if it were dialogue in a play that is without benefit of observation for that is how i experienced it thus j ulian im not sure i know what you mean sir lampret lets be straightforward with one another ive had my eye on you for a while now youre not like the other men are you julian hesitating no two of us are alike as far as i can see lampret youre literate for one thing and obviously wellread you have opinions on current events and ive been a few places private commongold and i know a manhattan accent when i hear one julian is that so uncommon lampret quite the opposite one of your type turns up in every regiment sooner or laterif not a manhattan cynic then a barracks lawyer from boston or a wouldbe senator with a rural address im just trying to sort out which kind of problem you are raised in new york and you had a comfortable life there by the look and bearing of you who was your father julian commongold some upandcoming rag merchant a mechanic with enough money to buy the illusion of prosperity and a storefront education for his son toadying before his betters by day and cursing them at night in the privacy of his kitchen is that why you decided to leave your family and join the army or did you just get drunk and end up on the wrong train like a lost schoolboy julian coolly the major is very perceptive lampret or if not that something similar i suppose you were the sort of boy who always had his way on the playground a few impressive words and everyone wants to be your friend julian no sirnot everyone lampret notheres always the inconvenient few who see through the charade julian the major is surprisingly wellinformed about life in new york city i was under the impression that he had spent most of his time in colorado springs that was a daring and dangerous thing for julian to say the dominion academy in colorado springs had produced some fine strategists and tacticians it had also produced and in greater abundance a legion of spies and informers according to sam the dominion military college was once an authentic military academy back when the union still operated an air forcethat is a battalion of airplanes and airmen to fly them this is the sort of thing i would once have dismissed as another of julians historical fantasies except that the dominion history of the union made passing reference to it war in the airanother of the unimaginable pastimes of the secular ancients but that institution declined with the end of oil although strategic stockpiles its said kept the air force flying a few years into the false tribulation after that the air force academy came increasingly under the sway of the dominionist center of power at colorado springsbecame ultimately a sort of institutional liaison between the dominion and the generals dominion men are full officers and entitled to issue orders but their real power is disciplinary unlike other cos a dominion officer can bring up a man on charges of impiety or sedition a soldier convicted of those crimes might face anything from dismissal with prejudice to ten years in a stockade it was a power seldom exercised for the relationship between the army and the dominion had always been a delicate one dominion officers were generally not wellliked and were often regarded as priggish and potentially dangerous interlopers a good dominion officer from the point of view of the men of the line was one who would do his share of the work who would foster piety by example rather than punishing its absence and whose sunday sermons were brief and to the point major lampret was wellenough liked by the men for he seldom threatened them but he was aloof in their company and watched them carefully from a distance there was about major lampret something of the aspect of a wellfed colorado mountain lion lethargic but muscular and ready to pounce the moment his appetite revived had julian whetted major lamprets appetite for apostates and contrarians that was the question i asked myself as i listened from my nest of ropes and boxes lampret you might want to consider your tone of voice private commongold may i offer you a lesson in civics there are three centers of power in the modern union and only three one is the executive branch with its supporting host of owners and senators one is the military and the last is the dominion of jesus christ on earth theyre like the tripod feet of a stool each supports the other and they work best when theyre equal in reach but youre not a propertied person mr commongold as far as i know and youre certainly not a clergyman and the army in its wisdom has put you in the lowest possible rank your position doesnt entitle you to an opinion much less the loose expression of it julian there is proverb sir that opinions are likelike lampret say noses julian noses in the sense that everyone has one lampret yes and like noses some opinions are less noble than others and some are thrust in where they dont belong you may have all the opinions you want mr commongold but you may not share them if they undermine the piety or preparedness of american troops julian i have no love for the dutch sir or any intention of undermining american soldiers lampret thats a guarded denial do you think im a bully private commongold looking for an excuse to exercise my authority on the contrary im a realist by and large the men under my command are untutored and ignorant i understand that and i accept it for these men religion is little more than their mothers halfforgotten admonitions and the promise of a better world to come but thats what serves them and i expect thats how the lord intended it i dont want my men to go into battle harboring doubts about their personal immortalityit makes them poorer soldiers julian not in my experience i fought beside those men and they gave exemplary service the major may not have noticed since he wasnt there that was a gauntlet thrown at lamprets feet and my concern for julian escalated to real fear it was one thing to argue with the major it was another thing to bait him dominion officers were traditionally excused from combat they carried pistols not rifles and they were more useful behind the lines where they ministered to the spiritual needs of the troops the commonest slur made against dominion men was that they were cowards hiding behind their angelswing badges and their big felt hats i could not of course see the majors reaction to julians statement but a kind of steely silence radiated from the tent like the heat from a smoldering coalpile then there was a sound of rustling paper major lampret spoke next evidently quoting from a document lampret on consecutive sundays private commongold was observed speaking to soldiers on the parade ground behind the meeting tent on these occasions he talked without restraint or decency about the holy bible and other matters that fall within the purview of the dominion is that correct julian less audibly no doubt surprised by the written evidence in so far as it goes i suppose it is but lampret did you for instance suggest to these men that theres no evidence of divine creation and that eden is a mythical place julian after a lengthy pause perhaps i compared the biblical account of genesis to other mythologies lampret to other mythologies suggesting that it is one julian sir if my remarks are to be taken out of context lampret reading again private commongold went on to assert that the story of the expulsion of the first man and woman from eden might be understood in unorthodox ways he claimed that as it seemed to him the chief virtue of eden was the relative absence from it of god who created the first couple in his image and then left them undisturbed in their innocent revels private commongold also suggested that the tree of knowledge and its forbidden fruit was a hoax worked up by the serpent who wanted the garden all to himself and that adam and eve had probably been expelled by trickery when god wasnt looking since god the private said was an incorrigably inattentive deity judging by the sins and enormities he habitually leaves unpunished julian in an even quieter voice since he must have realized by now that lampret had a spy among the troops and that he was at risk of more than an upbraiding it was only a sort of joke major really nothing but a pleasing paradox lampret pleasing to whom though clearing his throat private commongold further hinted that the dominion though it claimed to speak with the authority of holy writ was more akin to the voice of that serpent sowing fear and shame where there was none before and no pressing need for it did you in fact say this julian i suppose i must have or words that might be mistaken for it lampret the report is lengthy and detailed it cites apostasies too grotesque and numerous to mention capped with your enthusiastic endorsement of the ancient and discredited creed of biological evolution need i go on julian not on my account lampret is there any doubt in your mind that these remarks constitute a breach not just of decency but of explicit regulations for the conduct of enlisted men julian no doubt whatsoever lampret do you understand that one of the fundamental services the dominion of jesus christ performs is to prevent harmful or mistaken religious ideas from circulating among the gullible classes julian i do understand lampret lightening his tone abruptly im not in the business of harassing infantrymen without cause ive spoken to your commanding officers and they all say youre a competent soldier and useful in battle in so far as youve been tested some even think you might have command potential when your greenness and arrogance begin to rub off and the rank and file seem to approve of youif they scorned your apostasies we wouldnt need to have this discussion would we julian i dont suppose so lampret then lets get to the meat of the matter these atheistic lectures must stop is that understood julian sir yes sir lampret they must stop completely along with any denigrating mention of the dominion of jesus christ on earth or any other duly constituted arm of the government do you understand julian a whisper yes lampret i hope youre sincere about thati wont be so generous in the case of a second offense remember private commongold its not your soul im worried about i cant control your thoughtsthose are between you and your maker you can absorb heresies until they bleed out your pores for all i have to do with it but i can and will stand between your vulgar jokes and the integrity of the army of the laurentians is that clear innocent men must not be sent into battle with their immortal souls at risk just because julian commongold is bound and determined to go to hell julian i understand sir and i expect ill see you there a pause in battle i mean of course i have been asked many times whether julian when i first knew him was an atheist or an agnostic im not a philosopher much less a theologian and i dont understand the distinction between those two species of nonbelievers in so far as i have an image in my mind i picture the agnostic as a modest man politely refusing to kneel before any gods or icons in which he does not place his complete confidence while the atheist although operating from the same principles brings a hammer to the event readers may draw their own conclusions about julians later career and the convictions he carried into it as for his biblical heresies these must have seemed novel and alarming to major lampret but i had heard them all beforei was an old customer and jaded i thought his stories were in a way testimony to the close attention with which julian had read the bible even if his interpretations of it were too imaginative by half im an indifferent student of scripture myself and i prefer the sensible parts of that book such as the sermon on the mount while i leave the more perplexing passagesthe ones that mention sevenheaded dragons the whore of babylon or any of that crewto scholars who relish such conundrums but julian read the bible as if it were a work of contemporary fiction open to criticism or even revision once when i queried him about the purpose of his unusual reinterpretations he said to me i want a better bible adam i want a bible in which the fruit of knowledge contains the seeds of wisdom and makes life more pleasurable for mankind not worse i want a bible in which isaac leaps up from the sacrificial stone and chokes the life out of abraham to punish him for the abject and bloody sin of obedience i want a bible in which lazarus is dead and stubborn about it rather than standing to attention at the beck and call of every passing messiah that was appalling enough that i hastily dropped the subject but it hinted at some of the motives behind julians early apostasies i made my way out of the maze of boxed and barreled supplies shortly after julian left major lamprets tent since julian hadnt been sent off to schefferville i felt no pressing need to add my pennysworth to the dialogue sam and julian must already be having but i wanted sam to know i had done what he asked of me so i slowwalked back to our encampment and came in on the end of an argument their raised voices stopped me from interrupting i gathered sam had begun to lecture julian on the importance of not attracting undue attention or creating any controversy that might snag the attention of the executive branch were a fair distance from the presidential palace julian retorted as i entered the tent not as far as you think sam said angrily and the very last thing you need is to become prominent in the eyes of the dominion major lampret is no deklan comstock but he could have you sent to the trenches just by snapping his fingersespecially now that general galligasken is fighting battles up the saguenay you dont act as if you realize that but i do realize it said julian returning sams anger ounceforounce im bitterly aware of it i just stood in the presence of a man not fit to polish my boots and listened without objection to his insinuations and his sneers i looked him in the eye sam and as he barked and whined i thought how little he suspected what i could do to him and how quickly he would genuflect if that truth came out i wasnt raised to grovel before an army parson and yet i did iti swallowed my pride and i did itbut thats not enough for you you might have swallowed your pride a little sooner and thought twice about holding classes in sedition for the enlisted men in fact i recall forbidding you to do any such thing forbidding me julian stood up so stiffspined he seemed an inch taller than he really was i was entrusted by your father with the duty of protecting you sam said do it then do as you were told and protect me but dont mother me or censor me or question my judgment that was never your province do what you were asked to do and do it like any other sensible servant the words struck sam as if they had real weight and momentum his face contorted then stiffened into a soldierly mask he seemed full of words unspoken or unspeakable but what he said in the end was all right julianas you prefer it was a servile response and julian was quite undone by it all the rage went out of him in a rush sam im sorry i was justwell the words came without thinking you know i dont think of you as a servant i wouldnt have said so until now then forgive me it isnt you im unhappy withnever you of course i forgive you said sam julian seemed ashamed of himself and he hurried away without acknowledging me sam was a silent a long while and i began to wonder if i had become altogether invisible but just as i was about to clear my throat to signal my presence he looked at me and shook his head hes a comstock adam a comstock heart and soul for better or for worse i let myself forget that dont make the same mistake i wont i saidbut only to reassure him major lampret made a display of singling out julian at the next sunday meeting in a sermon on unhelpful thinking he denounced julians apostasies and mocked them and ridiculed the idea of an army private giving out opinions on theological matters then he told us weekend leave was canceled not just for julian but for all the men of our company to punish julian for treading on the angels coattails and us for being foolish enough to listen to him it was tactic meant to make julian unpopular among his peers and undo some of the goodwill the other soldiers felt toward him and the ploy was successful at least for a time disparaging remarks were made in julians presence by men cruelly deprived of the opportunity to squander their pay in montreal whore houses and julian was cut by these barbed comments though he was careful to say nothing in return but that wasnt the end of the matter just about thenand for weeks thereafter in a steady crescendoa certain libel about major lampret began to circulate and gain currency that the major was a colorado springs cloud salesman who was careful never to get in the line of fire because of all the immortal souls entrusted to his care his own took first place and was too precious to be exposed to flying leadin other words that he was a coward who reveled in his noncombatant status there was no discernible source for this talk it passed like a fog from one group of soldiers to another never adhering to anyone in particular but i noticed julian always smiled when he heard it i was as upset as anyone else over missing my first opportunity to return to montreal for i wanted to seek out calyxa and make myself better known to her but i consoled myself with the hope that i might get another chance and i used the empty time to finish my report about the battle of mascouche and deliver it to mr theodore dornwood the journalist dornwood had forgotten his agreement to read my work and i had to remind him of it but at last he relented and took the papers from me while he read them i admired his typewriter once more i took my time looking over the mechanical device and even fingered the keys in a gingerly manner and watched the greased levers rise and fall and felt the intoxicating power to make letterssolid booklike letters not pencil scratchesappear on a blank white page i was determined to get one of these machines for myself no doubt they were expensive but i would save my pay and eventually i would buy a typewriter even if i had to go all the way to manhattan to acquire one this i solemnly resolved not actually bad dornwood said in a thoughtful tone when he had finished reading my work it was as much praise as i had expected from himmore in fact its all right then oh yes would you say you liked it id go that far you might even call it good i suppose soin its way quite good actually i savored that word good coming as it did from a genuine new york city newspaper correspondent even at the expense of a little prodding and not just good but quite good i was beside myself with pride not that you havent got a thing or two to learn dornwood added deflating me hows that i asked i tried to write it as truthfully as possible i didnt include elephants or anything of that nature your restraint is admirableperhaps even excessive dornwood paused to gather his thoughts which could not have been a trivial task given how much liquor he had consumed judging by the empty flasks scattered about the place and how the aroma of hemp smoke still suffused the air as much as i like what youve writtenits clear grammatical and orderlythis piece would have to be punched up if it were submitted for newspaper publication how so well for instance here you say private commongold walked ahead of me very steadily toward the fighting thats how it happened i was careful about the phrase too careful a reader doesnt want to hear about someone walking steadily its not dramatic you might say instead private commongold ignored the shot and shell exploding all around him to such devastating effect and strode with fierce determination straight into the beating heart of the battle you see how that livens it up i guess it does though at the expense of a degree of accuracy accuracy and drama are the scylla and charybdis of journalism adam at the time i took scylla and charybdis to be new york city editors with whom dornwood had dealt or perhaps a publishing firm in fact they were two great nautical rocks in greek mythology which had the unusual ability to move about under their own steam and had formed the bad habit of crushing sailors steer between them is my advice but list toward drama if you want a successful career in fact private commongold is a little tepid regarding rank though the name itself is goodso lets promote him captain commongold doesnt that have a ring to it i suppose so leave these papers with me dornwood said casting a glance at his typewriter which had been silent lately perhaps due to his consumption of fiery spirits ill give the subject further thought and render you more useful advice next week in the meantime adam in the event of further military action please repeat the exercise write it up as dramatically as the facts allow and bring it to me if you do that i may be willing to show you how to work that typewriter you love to stare at since youre an aspiring writer of some talent how does that sound excellent mr dornwood i said all unsuspecting the fighting continued up the saguenay and things were mainly quiet around montreal there was occasional skirmishing of course for mitteleuropan forces remained scattered through the laurentians and they would sally forth now and then for a little fun and distraction i duly wrote up these exchanges for theodore dornwood in return for literary advice but there was very little to it during this time julian distinguished himself by holding a vital artillery position when it came under heavy fire from the dutch and his reputation among the men steadily improvedwhile major lamprets continued to decline but what mattered most to me that summer took place in the city of montreal during the weekends on which after lampret lifted the ban we were offered leave so lymon pugh said his sleeves rolled up to expose his hideously scarred and muscular forearms which often frightened strangers and of which he was very proud only the two of us left we were in montreal and we had just entered a tavern on guy street lymon was there to get drunk but it was the sort of establishment that served food as well as liquor and i meant to smother my sorrows in a beefsteak while lymon drowned his in a bucket of beer as for drink i took a dipperful of plain water from the ceramic jug by the door as we entered the water was brackish and tasted of tobaccoperhaps one of the previous customers had mistaken the jug for a spittoon only the two of us left lymon repeatedby which he meant that sam and julian had gone off to separate entertainments this friday night summer was a fearfully hot and humid time around the city of montreal the horseflies which the locals called black flies had lately come into season and they patrolled the streets in brigade strength alert for human flesh the day had been overcast and the air was thick as butter and although we were fresh from camp our shirts were already sodden we wore what scraps of civilian clothing we still possessed or had recently purchased so that we would not be mistaken for men on active duty and would blend in more closely with the local population but as i had learned on previous expeditions into the city a soldier is never quite at home in montreal the local citizens did not hate us exactlyat one time they had been under garrison by the dutch and the memory of that unhappy time persisted and the army of the laurentians was a more comfortable master than mitteleuropa had been taken all in all but we were their masters at least nominally for montreal was under military law and many of its citizens chafed at the constraints imposed upon them the catholic clergy were especially volatile still smarting over the dominions interference in their affairs and local men of cree descent had been known to challenge soldiers on the street out of some grievance never fully explained to me but it was not difficult to avoid the worst of such unpleasantness and the obverse side of that coin was the generous hospitality of the less political residents of montreal including restaurantowners and barkeepers we had been given a good table in this tavern which was called the thirsty boot and we ordered what we wanted from a pleasant woman in an apron and we were otherwise left to ourselves i swear i dont know what those two do with their time lymon pugh was saying for instance what on earth does sam want with all those damned amish amish you knowthose blackhatted and bearded men he consorts with whenever we come into the city lymon was laboring under a misapprehension judaism was legal in montreal and the city had a substantial community of very devout jews with whom sam had begun taking religious services it was true that the men in that part of town often sported beards and wore wide black hats or small ones that sat on their scalps as if glued there but they werent amish i think the amish live in pennsylvania or ohio or somewhere like that i said you mean to say those men arent amish they fit every description i ever heard i think theyre jews oh then is sam a jew of some kind he dont resemble them in his dress sam had not made any public announcement about his unusual religion though neither had he gone to any lengths to disguise his association with the jews of montreal and i could not bring myself to indict him quite so frankly perhaps hes fond of their cuisine the jews have their own special menu of foods just as chinamen do the sight of all those beards might inhibit my appetite if it was me said lymon who was religious figuratively about shaving his chin whatever they eat for dinner but to each his own julian wears a beard i pointed out what that fringe of his yellow as a females wig and just about as ridiculous speaking of julian commongold im confused about his habits too once again hes gone to that coffeeshop or whatever they call it down in the narrow streets by the riverside did you get a look at the other customers there adam frail looselimbed typesi dont know what he sees in them the place is called dorothys and im sure i dont know who dorothy isperhaps the only woman ever to visit the establishment philosophers i said what julian has made friends among the citys philosophers just as sam has made friends among the jews those are philosophers i suppose that means philosophers also have their own particular foods and that julian is partial to philosophical dinners yes in a sense though its more likely the conversation than the food that attracts him philosophers discuss time and space and the purpose of humanity and such topics as that in which julian is deeply interested they have enough to say about those subjects to carry over more than a few minutes i doubt i could talk about space any longer than a second or two before i ran out of thoughts altogether in any case i overheard two of those philosophers who followed julian into the coffeeshop and their discussion was all about some musical review that opened here in town i dont know all the details i confessed but julian says there are aesthetes among the philosophers who are more concerned with art than with human destiny they seemed more concerned with the fellow who played the romantic lead in the piece i imagine thats a legitimate subject of debate among aesthetes well its all beyond me said lymon pugh and he called for another pitcher of beer you too adam if you dont mind me saying so youre a mystery you come into a city as fine as this one with all its sinful opportunities and you wander from church to church like a godstruck pilgrim though its not even sunday this wasnt a topic i cared to discuss i was looking for someone i said of course the person i had been looking for since easter was calyxa but i had not been able to find her when i approached the choirmaster at the cathedral where i had first seen her he explained that the easter chorus had been put together specifically to sing to the troops the churchs own choristers refused to entertain occupying forces as they called us and the choirmaster had been forced to hire substitute singers at fifty cents an hour plus a free lunch but the names of these women had not been recorded that led me to make inquiries at several other grand churches of which the city possessed a dizzying numberall without success what about you lymon since you find our pursuits so unrewarding what are your plans for the weekend well to get drunk first of all thats a noble ambitionor at least easily achieved but not stinking drunk not so drunk i cant navigate then its off to the shade tree hotel the shade tree was one of those establishments in which women sell their virtue for money and throw in their diseases free of charge as major lampret had put it in one of his sermons i asked lymon whether he was not afraid as lampret had also put it that he would come back absent those three essential possessions of any decent man his health his savings and his hope of salvation the women at the shade tree are pretty clean lymon said earnestly and what im afraid of is that ill come back absent what i came to get which is the satisfaction of a mans deepest need the unsatisfaction of which can also make him sick or at least surly he clenched his scarred fists as he said this and i told him he was probably correct in wanting to avoid any condition that left him surly but shouldnt you brace yourself up before you begin such an adventure and i dont mean with liquor have something to eat i am a little hungry he admitted and i watched with a quiet pride as he puzzled out the items on the menu board he was surprised that the word eggs did not begin with a as it was pronouncedbut by this time he had become resigned to the inevitable inconsistencies of the written language and accepted them without rancor both of us ordered meals and we enjoyed them as the tavern grew busier around us lymon had just made quick work of a plate of boiled eggs and stewed onions when he detected an expression of astonishment on my face and said you look like youve been ambushed and in a sense i had she didnt recognize me butof coursei recognized her she had been sitting just yards away hidden by the crowd of coarselyattired men and women who shared her table it would have been easy to miss her altogether but right now she stood up and strode through billowing pipe smoke light and humid air to the taverns small stage and i knew her at oncecalyxa she wasnt dressed as she had been at the cathedral if that calyxa had seemed unworldly in her white surplice this calyxa was entirely earthbound in a mans black shirt a size too big for her and stiff denim trousers at first i had been shocked by the sight of montreal women wearing trousers rather than skirtsin williams ford no respectable female wore trousers past the age of tenbut social customs vary by location as julian had taught me and clothes signify differently in different parts of the world i had lately begun to take pride in my ability to accept such unusual behavior as female trouserwearing and i considered myself a sophisticate far in advance of my old crowd of williams ford leaseboys the easy confidence of her walk suggested that she was at home in this place and as she took the stage to genial applause i was sure of it look at that that ones a fireplug lymon pugh said do you suppose she means to sing to us i hope so i said annoyed her pants are cut too short though pretty enough face but look at the thick ankles on her im sure i dont need to hear your opinion of her ankles her ankles are her own business theyre right there hanging off the ends of her legsas much my business as anyones id say no ones business then please be quiet what bit you lymon asked but he subsided for which i was grateful calyxa did begin to sing then in a voice that was pure but also precise and pleasingly workmanlike she did not adopt trills tremolos theatrical asides illustrative whistles or any of those musical furbelows so common among contemporary singers instead she sang the songs as they had been composed plainly that is deriving all her nuance from the words and melodies and not their decorations nor was she wildly demonstrative in her singing she just clasped her hands cleared her throat and went at it this was too subtle for some of the audience judging by the occasional cries of drunken critics but i took it as an expression of her natural modestya striking contrast to the songs themselves she performed five songs before she was finished most of which had verses that would not have been out of place aboard the caribouhorn train or wherever less respectable people gather at first i was dismayed by this but i was remindedperhaps for the first time truly convincedof julians doctrine of cultural relativism socalled for these songs which had sounded so corrupt in other voices were purified in hers i reflected that calyxa must have been raised among people for whom such songs and sentiments were in effect their daily bread and not counted as obscene or irregular in any way in other words her innocence was innate and not compromised by the vulgarity of her upbringingit was a kind of indestructible primal innocence as i came to think of it two of the songs she sang were not in english which astonished lymon pugh thats some nerve on her part to sing a song in dutch not dutch lymon but french the language was spoken here for centuries and still is in places apparently lymon had believed there were only two kinds of human speech american and foreign and he was dismayed by the news that languages were prolific often coming packaged one per country just when i learn to write a language they begin to multiply like rabbits i tell you adam theres a catch to everything the world is as meanly rigged as that lucky mug of private langers english will suit in most circumstances unless you travel abroad ive traveled far enough i thank youthis is as foreign a country as i care to see even if it is america i begged him once more to be quiet as calyxa finished her singing she ignored the applause stepped down from the stage with an air of calm satisfaction and headed back to her table i was consumed by the need to attract her attention and i did this by standing up abruptly as she passed nearly knocking my dinner plate onto the floor and exclaiming in a choked voice calyxa i may have spoken too loudly for she flinched and there was a lull in the conversation in the tavern as if some of the patrons expected violence to follow do i know you she asked when she had recovered her composure we met at easter i was in the cathedral where you performed before dutch artillery closed it up dont you remember i hurt my head oh she said smiling faintly and by this reaction causing the other customers to relax their vigilance the soldier with the small injury did you find your regiment yes i didthank you very much youre welcome she said and walked on naturally i had not expected her to prolong the conversation or to ignore her friends on my behalf nevertheless this response was a disappointment she blew you off pretty quick lymon pugh said laughing to himself youre wasting your time here adam that type of woman dont make herself available on a moments notice come to the shade tree and your luck will change i wont not when my quarry was so close well suit yourself i have a schedule to keep lymon pugh stood up not as steadily as he might have and after some exploration found the door of the tavern and left i felt conspicuous sitting alone at a table when everyone else in the tavern seemed to have arrived with a party of friends but i suppressed my uneasiness and ordered an entire second meal which i did not plan to eat simply to keep the waitress from frowning at me calyxa continued to sit with her companions other singers or musicians took the stage from time to time apparently by arrangement with the management none was as talented as calyxa and the vulgarity of their singing was not adulterated with any kind of innocence primal or otherwise she herself talked amiably as it seemed to me with her friends who were a mixed group of men and women all as young as calyxa herselfmy age that is or only slightly older the females among them shared calyxas simple taste in clothing along with a certain inattention to the finer points of hairdressing and such feminine arts the men of the group took this charming roughness to another level entirely seeming to pride themselves on their tattered pants and hempen shirts several of them wore woolen caps despite the heat of the evening as if they needed something available to tug or pull low at dramatic moments in the conversation their gestures were dramatic their voices were curt and insistent and their opinions though i could make out only a few words were vehement and complex almost to the point of philosophy it occurred to me in a dismaying moment that calyxa might have a male friend or even a husband among the crowd tragically i knew so little about her i set about studying her in the hope that i could glean a few facts by observation i noticed that she glanced occasionally at the taverns door and that whenever she did this an expression of anxiety darkened her features but that was all that happened for an hour or so and i could make no sense of it and i had begun to despair of ever passing another word with her when a series of unexpected events brought us together in a surprising way the waitress who served my table appeared to be on friendly terms with calyxa they put their heads together now and then to exchange words after one of these exchanges an expression of profound concern once more overcame calyxa and she nodded solemnly at whatever news the waitress had delivered and dire news it must have been for calyxa although she remained at the table dropped out of the conversation swirling around her and seemed lost in the most sobering kind of thoughts several times she called the waitress back and they conferred again and on one of these occasions they both looked at me in a pointed fashion but i couldnt deduce the significance of any of these maneuvers that they had some significance i did not doubt for before long the same waitress returned to my table and she pulled out the chair lymon pugh had left vacant and sat in it i was surprised by this bold move on her part fortunately the waitress took the commanding role in the talk that followed youre a soldier she said in a tone that was brisk but not unfriendly i agreed that i was and you have some interest in calyxa blake finally i had learned her surnameadmittedly at second hand i wondered if calyxa blake had mistaken my intentions and had communicated her apprehension to the waitress only the most benevolent interest i said sincerely i was impressed with her singing when she sang at one of the enormous churches of this city last easter after that i spoke to her but only briefly i was injured at the time but she was kind to me i want to thank her for thatwell i have thanked her for it in factand as much as i would like to speak further with uh miss blake hoping i was right about the miss i would never force my attention on her if i upset her with my clumsy greeting please tell her i meant nothing by it except to mark my pleasurable surprise at recognizing her that was a pretty speech though extemporaneous and i was proud of it the waitress sat and examined me with her eyes displaying no reaction then she asked for the second time youre a soldier yes a soldier i was drafted away from my home which is in athabaska does that mean you carry a pistol they say all you soldiers do i was offduty and not in uniform but it was standard practice for an american soldier in these parts to keep his pistol with him at all times my pistol was strapped under the waist of my shirt where it wasnt easily visible because i didnt want to alarm anyone or provoke any unnecessary confrontation but it was within easy reach i nodded does that frighten her no does it frighten you then she almost smiled a pistol in hands such as yours doesnt frighten me no what did you say your name was adam hazzard stay here adam hazzard i nodded in mute if bewildered consent after servicing the handful of customers who had begun to shout in an aggrieved manner for her attention the friendly waitress returned to calyxas table and there was more fervid whispering between the two of them and i tried not to blush at the unusual attention they paid me not fifteen minutes passed during which calyxa stared at the door as if she expected the devil himself to burst in before the waitress came to my table and whispered shell meet you upstairs adam hazzard i was afraid that my interest in calyxa had been too broadly interpreted and that an assignation had been set upbut of course calyxa was not the type of female who would make herself available at a moments notice so i was confused by the suggested arrangement but the waitress evinced some urgency about the matter and the grave expression on calyxas face seemed to confirm the need for haste and i nodded and said whereabouts upstairs second landing third door to the right dont run right up there though wait a moment or two after i leave dont be conspicuous about it i agreed to all these conditions the next few minutes passed slowly then i stood up affecting a nonchalance that might have been a shade too theatrical judging by the way calyxa rolled her eyes from her place at the adjoining table but that couldnt be helped shortly thereafter i was up the dimlylit stairs and i found the appointed room and let myself inside it was a small room containing only a chair a few boxes loosely stuffed with straw packing a barrel marked salt fish empty and a rusty hurricane lamp which i lit up the room smelled of moist mildewed wood a single grimy window overlooked the crowded stalls and torchlit shops of guy street from the window i could see a little of the night sky which was very dark and shot through with distant flashes of lightning the wind had a gustiness that flapped all the guy street awnings and i guessed a storm was imminent certainly the air in the city was humid enough for itand swelteringly hot especially in this upstairs chamber i perched on one of the boxes thinking calyxa might prefer the chair and waited for her to arrive trying not to perspire she opened the door not ten minutes later the reader may imagine the excitement and the curiosity her visit aroused in me her hair was a skein of ebony knitwork in the light from the hall she put her hands on her hips and regarded me evangelica thinks youre harmless she said are you harmless i guessed evangelica was the name of the waitress well im not dangerous if thats what you mean adam hazzardthats your name i nodded and youre calyxa blake adam hazzard i dont know who you areyoure only a loose soldier to mebut i need a favor and evangelica thinks you might be willing to help without wanting too much in return of course ill help whatever your situation and without demanding anything at all in return western boy just as evangelica said how old are you nineteen i said exaggerating by less than a month do you know how to use the pistol you carry around with you as a soldier im supposed to and i do have you ever used it to shoot at someone i mean ive shot at many people miss blake all of them dutchmen with my pittsburgh rifle and hit some of them i dont doubt as for my pistol its only shot targets to date but i understand the principle and im not a stranger to the practice do you mean for me to shoot someone thats a tall order not that im backing down but an explanation would be welcome you can have one if theres time she glanced around the narrow room take the chair i suggested if you want to sit i do want to sit but i want to look out the window while i do it she dragged the chair in that direction she didnt need helpcalyxa was a sturdy girl evidently accustomed to performing such tasks on her own hook she sat with her head turned so that she could watch the window while we talked putting her neck in profile this is awkward she said you can sit on a box if youd prefer it i mean the conversation well thats because we hardly know each other though ive thought of you often since easter have you why me what do you mean of all the women in the choir what set you onto me most of the soldiers ive met are more interested in whores than choristers to be honest i cant say you seemedexceptional i could hardly speak for blushing how childish but never mind she scanned the street again i dont see them though in this murkiness its hard to tell who are you expecting some men who mean to harm me in that case i guarantee you every protection in my power who are these villains my brothers she said we talked for most of an hour more alone in that airless chamber what she told mewith a frankness i found admirable if surprisingwas that her parents had died when she was just three years old and that she had been raised by her brothers job and utty uther blake who were bush runners bush runners are men who operate in the wilds of the laurentians and up into the rocky wastelands of labrador living on the margins of the law some of them form guerilla bands and might align themselves temporarily with the americans or the mitteleuropans but their main business is horse thievery smuggling and opportunistic pillage calyxa was not of much use to them as a female and her brothers had never been patient or kind toward her her only relief from their autocracy was a fouryear period when job and utty were sent to prison and she was installed in a charitable church school in quebec city where she learned to read and write the school was not a paradise but she had thrived on three regular meals a day and had enjoyed at least some access to the world of learning her innate curiosity and liveliness had been engaged and she had fought bitterly against her return to the custody of her paroled siblings but the law was stern and she was eventually given back to them to her horror they no longer considered her a useless encumbrance but had worked out a scheme by which she could be sold to a montreal brothel or failing that bartered to some other guerilla band in exchange for considerations that did not suit her plans and she resolved to escape before the transaction could be consummated fortunately her brothers still thought of her as a child at least in her mental and spiritual faculties and assumed they could bully her into submission they were wrong calyxa had grown up considerably during the time they languished in prison she was not just clever enough to outwit them she was wise enough to disguise herself as meek and lull her captors into equanimity until an opportunity for escape presented itself when job and utty left her alone in the wilderness cabin from which they ran their autumn trap linestrusting in the isolation of the place and a few stern threats to keep her docile in their absenceshe recognized an opportunity and took it she packed up what little food was available along with a compass she had stolen from utty and set out for montreal she spoke reluctantly of that grueling lonely journey and would only say that she had arrived in the city exhausted and starving a few nights spent on the streets convinced her she needed to support herself in better style and that was when she took up singingat first on sidewalks for pennies and then in establishments such as the thirsty boot she had learned singing from the clerics at the residential school and she had a natural aptitude for the work since then she had got along all right and had fallen in with better company than job and utty blake but her escape from her brothers would never be complete as long as they lived for they were angry at the loss they had suffered in their eyes she had stolen herself from them and they meant to have her back and to punish her for the crime of selftheft calyxa was determined not to let that happen during the winter months there was little to fear for the blake brothers wintered on land held by the dutch governor of the saguenay region poaching and drinking and hiring themselves to the mitteleuropans as spies but in summer the brothers became more ambitious and often came into montreal with furs to trade or money to gamble away for three years now calyxa had spent the summer months dreading the chance that her brothers would discover her whereabouts she relied on friends who were sympathetic to her cause to keep their eyes and ears open and so far though the brothers had twice come to the city they hadnt found her or heard anything about her and she always had sufficient warning to keep herself out of their view to night however calyxa had received the worst possible news job and utty were back in town and they had picked up hints of her presence and were actively hunting her in factso evangelica had heard from a friendthe blakes had learned that she frequented the thirsty boot and they were hastening this way even now you ought to go home then i said and hide ill escort you if thats what you need that would be exactly the wrong thing to do job and uttyespecially job hes the smart oneprobably formed a plan to watch the tavern rather than barge inside to make trouble theyre hunters adam hazzard and they know how to stalk prey even when the prey has got wind of them its truei hope its truethey dont know where i live but if i leave now theres every chance theyll follow me and break in when there are no witnesses present you live alone then i do no male companion right at the moment no but what does that matter well it increases the risk what will you do if you cant go home all i can do is hide here evangelica will warn me if job and utty come inside even then i should be all right unless my brothers search the building thats why i wanted you here with mespecifically thats why i wanted your pistol here with me are your brothers armed it wasnt legal for citizens to go about armed within city limits and the majority adhered to the rule her brothers werent among that majority calyxa explained both were experienced pistolfighters and unabashed about advertising the number of men they had killed that brought home to me the severity of her crisis and i advised her to check the street once more to make sure the brothers hadnt crept up on us unannounced enough time passed however that we eventually began to let down our guard and i was admiring her clockspring hair by lamplight and beginning to feel brave again when she stood up from her chair at the window and said oh hell or an even stronger word best understood under the generous allowances of cultural relativism and not printable here theyre coming she nodded i hurried to the window and caught a glimpse of two burly men one in a patched wool coat and one in what looked like a sailors peajacket as they strode across the torchlit street to the entrance of the thirsty boot directly below us put out the light calyxa said but before you do unlatch the window why what for in case we need a quick escape theres nothing outside but the street and thats two stories down i said consider it a last resort she said we huddled in the darkened room anticipating disaster the heat was oppressive i could smell the approaching storma heavy salty odorand i wasnt very fresh myself though i had bathed that very morning perhaps calyxa was equally conscious of her own scenti was aware of it but it wasnt offensive to meto me she smelled steamy and utterly distractingbut i wont dwell on the matter her brothers kept themselves downstairs for a great length of time perhaps drinking and evaluating the tavern but they were here for a purpose and it was not to be indefinitely postponed we heard footsteps on the stairs it was evangelica the friendly waitress come in stealth to warn us she knocked very faintly at the door of the room theyre coming up she whispered arnaud and the bartender threatened them but the blakes showed their pistols and everyone is cowed they mean to search all the rooms in the buildingi have to go back be prepared is your weapon loaded adam hazzard calyxa asked in a firm voice i took it out and made sure it was ready to fire give it to me then she said give it to you i dont want to burden you with the work of killing my brothers its not a burdeni only hope it doesnt become a necessity not a burden for you but a positive pleasure for me she was pretending to be bloodthirsty in order to spare my feelings and my heart melted a little at her generosity give me the gun she said i wont well then will you shoot them shoot them dead do you promise to shoot them at the first hint of a threat the hint has been given adam theyre experienced murderers you must shoot them as soon as you see their shadowsand shoot to kill not to wound or were already lost they cant be as ferocious as all that dear god give me the gun i beg you noif there must be bloodshed i want it on my conscience not yours conscience she pronounced the word as if it were a lament a quel genre didiot jai affaire calyxa unlike myself was fluent in french and sometimes fell into that language at odd moments french has always been a mystery to me and remains so but i have taken pains to make sure her words are accurately transcribed maybe the window is the better option if you wont hand over the pistol surely we neednt jump to our doom im not suggesting we jump the only danger is that we might fall quickly adam i hear them on the stairs take off your shoes i obeyed without question because she seemed to have some plan in mind though i was not pleased that it involved the window why am i taking off my shoes though leather doesnt grip like flesh holster your pistol to keep your hands available now follow me i followed her as closely as i could through the darkened room though not without stubbing my toe on a barrelrim then she threw open the hinged window admitting a gust of rain and a lightningflash the storm which had threatened all day was upon us the rattle of thunder was continuous and the wind howled mercilessly i watched with disbelief as calyxa put her upper body through the open window and squirmed until she was standing outside of it her toes clasping the narrow sill then she grabbed a gable on the roof above and hauled herself up at last her pleasant face appeared again upside down in the high end of the window frame hurry adam take my hand it was embarrassing to be assisted by a girl at such a time but it would have been more embarrassing to be trapped by a blake brother and shot or to tumble to my death so i took her hand and put my bare feet on the raindrenched sill and tried not to think of the hard surface of the street below or of the lightning that forked about the sky and fingered the lightningrods of the citys countless steeples now grasp the rim of the roof and pull yourself up i doubted i could do soi was convinced i could notbut a few breaths later i was lying beside calyxa on the halfpipe ceramic tiles that capped the thirsty boot we were inclined at a reckless angle and in danger of sliding into the void rainwater sluiced over us freely but we were for this fraction of a moment more or less safeif that word can be stretched to cover the situation i turned to speak to calyxaher face was only inches from minebut she put a finger to her lips and hushed me your pistol i took it from where i had secured it it was a porter earle military revolver of modern design and i was almost certain it wouldnt be badly affected by the weather point it she said at what between your feet where the roof ended she meant at the eavesgutters where we had just lofted ourselves up i obliged her whim steadying my right hand by bracing it with my left and pressing the tiles with my feet to keep from falling as warm as the day had been the rain was plummeting down from some glacial height of the atmosphere and i had to clench my teeth to keep from shivering probably it wont occur to them to look for us here said calyxa but if they do you must shoot the first person who attempts to cross the margin of the roof in other words if you see a head put a hole in it now be quiet i had no difficulty keeping quiet and in any case it was a noisy night the rain had the velocity of artillery fire and it burst upon the roof with a similar impact the roofs of these montreal city buildings were irregularthey didnt bear the stamp of the work of the secular ancients which is an exacting symmetry rather they had been built over the dismantled remnants of older buildings with haphazard attention to detail and no coherent plan water gushed down labyrinthine flues and runways cascaded into bricked cisterns and holding tanks and ran across the tiles in glistening washes we might have been inside a flooding river for all the noise we could contribute to it but calyxa was listening intently for sounds from inside the room we had recently left below us she cupped her ear in that direction and i tried to listen as well though without successor with too much success for i imagined i heard innumerable thumps and rattles any one of which might have signaled the approach of an angry blake brother suddenly calyxa stiffened and her eyes went wide be ready adam she said i put all my attention on the eaves of the roof though my heart was beating a military tempo rainwater in my eyes gave the scene a liquid inconstancy i saw the tileends and the edge of the eavesgutter and the high building across guy street and a section of the street far below there was a sound that might have been a window swinging wide and bouncing on its hingestops calyxa inhaled fearfully and i reminded myself to continue breathing seconds passed rain fell thunder cracked lightning crazed the tumbled clouds then there was motion at the gutter by my feet two sets of knuckles left and right gripped the eavestrough that was the horizon of the roof as i suddenly thought of it and now a hairy moon began to rise the lunar object was a blake brother investigating what he must have deduced was his sisters escape route perhaps the brothers opinion of calyxas mental and physical capabilities had improved since her last encounter with them i did not doubt that this was one of her brothers for there was a family resemblance about the hair the hair on this unwelcome rising moon curled like calyxas but it was unkempt and washed only by the gusty rain and so oily that it gave back the lightningflashes in an inky blue reflection the hair was followed by a forehead even more uncannily lunar in its scarped and pitted aspect then rose a pair of eyes yellowrimmed and threaded with blood those eyes met mine and narrowed as i imagine the eyes of a savage cat narrow when it spies its next meal ahoof fire shouted calyxa i dont know that i could have brought myself to do as she askedto fire on an apparently unarmed man even a hostile one when he was in a position of such vulnerabilityexcept that her voice startled me and caused my finger to compress the trigger of the pistol the result was instantaneous the pistol kicked in my hand the sound of the concussion joined the rattle of thunder there was a flash of red and white of bone and blood i supposed where the head of the blake brother had been then a rending screech and terrible thumps as the injured man was pulled back inside the window presumably by his outraged sibling i was too dazed to think of what to do nextthis wasnt much like shooting dutch uniforms across an earthworksbut calyxa had retained all her presence of mind she grabbed my free hand and yanked on it now run she said she set an example for me scrabbling up the slope of the roof her bare feet sliding back an inch for every two they gained i lurched after her eventually we achieved the peak of the roof where a series of crude chimneys leaned into one another like arthritic pickets on a ridge top i glanced back at the eavesgutters and i saw a hand waving a pistol and shooting it blindly a bullet clipped a chimneybrick just adjacent to my head and calyxa tugged me forward so that we slid down the opposite angle of the roofto our doom i expected but this slope conjoined another one next to it so that we found ourselves in a sort of claytile riverbed through which we splashed a few yards more then calyxa leapt across a narrow gap between two buildings ignoring the empty air below her and again i followed her example there was no bravery in thisi felt every raindrop as if it were a shot between the shoulderblades i will not record all the arduous climbs giddy descents perilous slides and painful neardisasters that befell us as we fled across the darkened roofs of montreal city that stormy night after a time we slowed and began to move more cautiously it did not seem that we were being followedunderstandably perhaps for i had killed or severely wounded one of the blake brothers and the other might not be willing to leave his wounded sibling and chase us about the tiled slopes of the city especially in weather so severe that funnelclouds were seen spinning down the st lawrence river its enough to say that we arrived at last at an iron fireescape more than a mile from the thirsty boot in some direction that was incalculable to me and that when i descended to street level my bare feet left bloody prints on the rusty ladder rungs do you live near here i asked calyxa hopefully once i had gathered breath enough to speak the rain had drenched herevery part of her was slicked or drooped by it except her hair which amazingly kept its all curly depth her mannish shirt clung to her body in a way that might have been indelicate if i had allowed my attention to linger on it she had laced her shoelaces together and carried her shoes looped around her neck like clumsy pendants she put them back on her feet bending over to tie them i had no such optionmy own boots had been abandoned at the tavern not far she said standing up then this time please let me walk you there she managed to smile despite the horrifying circumstances i wont leave you barefoot in the rain adam hazzard she said not on a night like this there is a kind of urban living i have discovered in which poverty and luxury mix together and become indistinguishable that was the case with the rooms in which calyxa blake lived she occupied several chambers in a building that had been divided up into dark but rentable spaces by some absent and inattentive owner the rooms were confining the windows minuscule the ceilings perilously low she could not have spent much money on the furnishings which were shabby threadbare nicked and splinteredi had seen better furniture abandoned at montreal curbsides but if her bookcases were humble they were bowed under the weight of surprisingly many booksalmost as many as there had been in the library of the duncan and crowley estate back in williams ford it seemed to me a treasure more estimable than any fine sofa or plush footstool and worth all the rough economies surrounding it we entered dripping from the effects of the storm which continued to beat its wings against the windows of calyxas snug if threadbare retreat as soon as she had thrown the several latches behind her and lit the nearest lamp she began unselfconsciously to strip off her sodden clothes i looked away blushing you too she said no exceptions for western prudishnessyoure dripping all over everything i have nothing else to wear ill find you something undress yourselfthose pants wont dry while youre wearing them that extraordinary statement was inarguably true and i did as she suggested while she went to another room in search of something to cover herself and me she came back wearing a kind of chinese robe with fanciful dragons embroidered on it and carrying a similar garment along with a towel which she handed to me i dried myself willingly but balked at the robe i think this is a womans item its a silk robe all the better chinese persons wear them men included you can buy them down at the docksidecheap when the boats come in if you know the right vendor put it on please i obeyed though not without feeling slightly ridiculous but the robe was comfortable and supplied just the right degree of warmth and concealment i was content with it i decided as long as some blake brother didnt break down the door and shoot me for dying in such a garment might provoke awkward questions calyxa started a fire in the kitchen stove and put a kettle on to boil while she worked i examined her bookcases more closely i hoped to find an unfamiliar title by mr charles curtis easton which i could borrow but calyxas taste didnt run in that direction few of the books were fiction and even fewer bore the dominion stamp of approval i guessed the authority of the dominion was more powerful out west than in these border lands which had so often changed hands with the dutch here were titles and authors altogether unfamiliar to me some were in french and could not be decrypted of the english titles i selected one called american history since the fall of the cities by arwal parmentier it had been published in englanda country which though sparsely inhabited had a long history of its own and whose allegiance to mitteleuropa was more formal than devotional i took the volume closer to a lamp opened it at random and read this paragraph the ascent of the aristocracy should not be understood solely as a response to the nearexhaustion of oil platinum iridium and other essential resources of the technological efflorescence the trend to oligarchy predated that crisis and contributed to it even before the fall of the cities the global economy had become what our farmers call a monoculture streamlined and relatively efficient but without the useful diversity fostered in prior times by the existence of national borders and local regulation of business long before plague starvation and childlessness reduced the population so dramatically wealth had already begun to concentrate in the hands of a minority of powerful owners the crisis of scarcity therefore when it came was met not with a careful or prepared response but by a determined grasp of power on the part of the oligarchs and a retreat into religious dogmatism and clerical authority by the frightened and disenfranchised populace it was quickly obvious to me why this volume had not received the stamp of approval and i moved to replace it on the shelf but not before calyxa returning from the kitchen with a cup of tea in each hand saw me handling it do you read adam hazzard she seemed surprised i doas often as i can really have you read parmentier i confessed i hadnt had the pleasure political philosophy was not a subject i had pursued i told her too bad parmentier is ruthless on aristocracy all my friends read him who do you read then i admire the work of mr charles curtis easton i dont know the name hes a novelist perhaps i can introduce you to his work sometime perhaps calyxa said and we sat down on the sofa she took a sip of tea and seemed more or less at ease considering that she had just seen her homicidal brother shot in the head and had spent the evening leaping about the rooftops of montreal then she put down her cup and said look at your feetyoure bleeding all over the carpet i apologized its not the carpet im concerned about here lie back and put your feet on this towel i did so and she fetched a medicine for mean ointment that smelled of alcohol and camphor and burned on application but soon began to feel soothing she examined my feet closely then wrapped them in a linty bandage and you left your boots behind she said yes that wasnt wise armyissue boots job will recognize them for what they are hell know i was with an american soldier and it wont improve his temper shooting his brother in the head had probably angered him right up to the hilt i thought and the boots wouldnt add much of a fillip to it but i took calyxas concern seriously im sorry to say this calyxa and i dont mean to insult your family but i begin to wish i had shot both of them i wish you had too but the opportunity failed to present itself your poor feet well fix them up a little more come morning and replace your boots with something better before you have to march back to your regiment i hadnt thought that far ahead and the prospect was daunting but she didnt dwell on it adam hazzard i thank you for all youve done for me today i was afraid of your motives at first but evangelica was rightyoure just as simple as you look i want to reward you and here she put her arm around my shoulder and drew my head closer to hers and kissed me lightly on the cheek and i want to reward you in the best possible way but its not practical right at the moment my skin still tingled where her lips had been you dont need to explain i would never question your virtue or make any claim on it just because i helped you fend off your brothers and i readjusted my chinese robe to disguise any testimony to the contrary on the part of my masculine nature it isnt that i do want to thank you adam it would be my pleasure as well as yours do you understand me but the time is not propitious of course it isnt with the gunplay and all what i mean is its enough that i can sit and talk with you i wanted your friendship and now i have itthats my reward jai mes règles espèce de bouseaux ignorant she said a little impatiently and i took this to be another testimonial to her gratitude to me which was irrepressible i expected nothing from her but i hinted that a second kiss would not be unwelcome and she gave me that and i returned it and i was as happy as i had ever been despite all the rooftop calisthenics and bloody violence such is love in a time of war i slept on the sofa and she woke me in the morning she examined my feet again and said the injuries inflicted by the sharp tiles of the montreal roofs were not as bad as they might have been and she rewrapped the bandages and added a layer of leather one for each foot to function as soles and more bandages so that i could walk out of doors without reinjuring myself that ought to get you where were going she said she wanted to replace my boots with something better than bandages and she wanted to find out what the ultimate outcome of the events at the tavern had been she said she knew a place where both those needs might be addressed she put on a large sunhat to conceal her face if she crossed paths with a blake brother and i took her arm and we stepped out into the sunny morning last nights tempest had washed the air clean and the ferocious wind had been domesticated into a pleasant breeze if not for the danger and the pain in my feet our stroll would have been entirely enjoyable but it was brief and it ended at the door of a basement shop on a street i didnt recognize the shop a tannery and bootery was closedby law because it was sunday nevertheless calyxa knocked loudly i know the owner she said the owner turned out to be a bearded and irritable man who would not have been out of place at the table she had occupied in the tavern last night except that his attention to his clothing was more particular he looked at calyxa curiously and at me with an undisguised mixture of loathing and distaste let us in emil i dont want to dawdle here she said and he waved us inside reluctantly his shop was a cellar rank with the smell of tannin and glue but he had some very nice boots on display can you fit my friend calyxa asked anything for you emil said slowly you know that but surely he needs something supple and sturdy on his feet he lost his boots doing me a favor dont his army masters give him boots tu es folle damener un soldat américain ici il ma sauvé la vie on peut lui faire confiance en plus il nest pas très intelligent sil te plaît ne le tue pas faisle pour moi this exchange whatever it meant mollified emil a little and he agreed to measure my feet and when he had done that he searched among his stock of premade boots and showed me a fine pair of deerskins calfhigh and goldenbrown i was sure i couldnt afford them this has to do with your savage brothers emil said to calyxa i heard about what happened at the tavern last night calyxa became more attentive what do you know about job and utty job was badly creased by a bullet he lost a lot of blood but his skull wasnt cracked and the story i heard is that hell survive it utty threatened to shoot a few people just for show but jobs wound distracted him they left the tavern for the charity clinici expect jobs still there unless he had the grace to die during the night thats all i know except that the military police took notice and theyre holding a warrant on both men calyxa smiled as if this were welcome news and i suppose it was but sooner or later it seemed to me the blake brothers would be back angrier than ever and i was afraid for her the boots were expensive even at emils grudging discount i was reluctant to spend the moneyi was saving for a typewriterbut i didnt want to appear tight in front of calyxa and i did need boots so i paid the proprietor his ransom and i was not sorry even to my injured feet the deerhide boots felt like an upholstered corner of heaven i had never owned boots that fit me so neatly the men of my company would be envious i thought and they would mock my vanity and call me dainty but i decided i would endure all that without complaint for the boots comforted my feet and reminded me of calyxa she and i walked a little farther but the day was passing quickly and i couldnt stay away from camp much longer we parted at the great iron bridge calyxa asked whether i might be back next weekend and i promised i would try to see her if the military situation allowed and that i would think of her constantly in the meantime i hope you do come back i will i vowed dont forget to bring your pistol she said then she kissed me and kissed me again i kept my promise and returned many times to the city of montreal that summer and became better acquainted with calyxa and with the city in which she lived i wont weary the reader with a description of all our encounters some were too intimate to record in any case but i will say that we were not further troubled by the blake brothersnot that season anyhow camp life was easy for a time my feet healed quickly thanks to light work and those supple deerhide boots the dutch sallies became less frequent and the only fighting for a while locally i mean was between our scouting parties and a few enemy pickets contradictory rumors continued to emerge from the saguenay campaign however a great victorya great defeatmany mitteleuropans killedscores of americans sent to early gravesbut none of that could be confirmed due to the slow pace of communications and the unwillingness of high staff to share intelligence with soldiers of the line but around thanksgiving we had a substantial hint that things had not gone well a new regiment of draftees and recruitssoft naive leaseboys as i now saw them mostly drawn from the estates and freehold farms of maine and vermontarrived in camp they were quickly trained in the business of garrisoning montreal city and maintaining its defenses which freed up those of us with battle experience for that most dreaded of military maneuvers a winter campaign galligasken would never have approved of this sam said when our regimental orders were finally cut the orders must have come down from the executive palace itself this smells of deklan comstocks meddling and impatience the news of some defeat nettled him so he ordered all his forces into a strategically absurd retaliationid bet money on it but there was no arguing with orders we packed our dittybags and slung our pittsburgh rifles a whole division of us and we were carted to the docks and loaded into steamdriven boats for the journey down the st lawrence to the saguenay there wasnt time to say goodbye to calyxa so i wrote a hasty letter and posted it from the quayside telling her i would be away at the front for an undisclosed time and that i loved her and thought of her constantly and that i hoped the blake brothers wouldnt hunt her down and kill her while i was gone the boats on which we rode burned wood rather than coal and their smudge hung over the river and followed us in the wind a poignant earthy smell i had never been out on a boat before the river pine back in williams ford was too swift and shallow for navigation i had seen boats of course especially since our arrival in montreal and they had fascinated me with their elephantine grace and their negotiations with the unpredictable and oftstormy st lawrence consequently i spent much time at the rail of this little vessel as it traveled experiencing what julian called the relativistic illusion that the boat itself was stationary and that it was the land around it that had gone into motion writhing to the west like a snake with a war in its tail we had been issued woolen coats to protect us from the weather but the day was fine and sunny though autumn had the countryside in its final grip we approached and passed the great fortifications at quebec city and followed the north channel beyond ile dorleans where the river grew much wider and began to carry the tang of salt the foliage along the north bank was umber and scarlet where it had not already abandoned itself to the wind denuded branches cast skeletal silhouettes against a dusty blue sky and crows swept the foresttop in wheeling masses autumn is the only season with a hook in the human heart julian had once said or quoted this fanciful figure of speech ran through my mind right then the only season with a hook in the heart and because it was autumn and because the land was vast and empty and the air was chill and smelled of woodsmoke the poetic words seemed to make sense and were apt about then julian came to stand beside me at the rail while the other soldiers milled about on deck or went below to try their luck at mess last night i dreamed i was on a ship he said the long light falling on his face as the wind tousled the hair that flowed out beneath his cap a ship like this one a better one adam a threemasted schooner like the ones that sail up the narrows to manhattan when i was a child my mother used to take me to the foot of fortysecond street to see those ships i liked the idea that the ships came from faraway placesthe mediterranean republics or nippon or ecuador as it might beand i liked to pretend some spirit of those places still clung to themi convinced myself i could smell it a whiff of spice above the stink of creosote and rotting fish those must be very fine ships i said but in my dream the ship was leaving new york harbor not arriving she had just caught the wind in her sailstook the bone in her teeth as sailors say and she was passing under the old verrazano bridge i knew i was being carried away somewhere not to a safe place exactly but to a different place than i was accustomed to where i might change into someone else he smiled sheepishly though there was a haunted look in his eye i dont suppose that makes sense i said i guessed it didnt and i didnt believe in prophetic dreams any more than julian believed in heaven but something about the melancholy way he spoke made me think his dream must be another poetic metaphor like that figure of speech involving hooks and heartsthe kind of riddle that cuts close to the tear ducts in its nonsense around dusk we sailed past the dutch fort at tadoussac it had been taken by american forces and among the soldiers on deck a cheer went up at the sight of the thirteen stripes and sixty stars flying above those battlescarred and broken walls on the high headland what did not please us so much was the litter of broken ships clinging to that stark shore halfsunken hulls gutted by artillery fire stood sentinel over islands of charred debris trapped by the whorl of the river here there had been fighting of the fiercest kind both ashore and afloat and it was a dire and oppressive place by the fading light of day we reached the craggy mouth of the saguenay shortly thereafter and our flotilla of troopships their woodfired engines straining sailed up that fjord as i believe the dutch called it making a scant few knots against the current most of us tried to sleep in the narrow bunks that had been assigned to us but we kept our arms close and come morning we could hear the distant sounds of war they landed us at the siege of chicoutimi and we spent three weeks in the trenches the companies of our regiment were kept close together to prevent our morale from being deflated by the longterm infantrymen who had fought their way here from tadoussac over the course of the summer and whose losses had been staggering it had been a badlyplanned and deadly campaign and the staff had not been spared the effects of its winnowing it was rare to see an officer at chicoutimi even as old as sam godwin high rank and hasty promotions had been handed out to boys no older than myself and commanders tents had become kindergartens from which one graduated to the grave the siege in fact was a stalemate our entrenchments had encountered their entrenchments and it was all we could do to keep the daily killing at an equitable levelno grander goal could be imagined we controlled the saguenay right up to riverofrats but the mitteleuropans held chicoutimi in a firm grip and their supply lines were secure all the way to the railhead at lake saint john where the stadhouders had established farms mills mines refineries shipworks and a flourishing community of workers and owners no matter what artillery we dragged upriver to attack them they could float some equivalent weapon downstream to repulse us and because of their greater numbers we were in constant danger of being outflanked on top of all that winter was coming fast cold weather had already driven off the black flies but that was the only good thing about it our lines were a wasteland devoid of trees or vegetation we had dug our trenches and redans out of the soil which in this neighborhood was thick with the debris of the efflorescence of oilbricks broken foundationstones and that tarry crumble with which the ancients paved their roads our entrenching tools turned up human bones from time to time the bones were not useful to us though some of the men carved scrimshaw out of venerable ankles or employed knobby old forearms as hooks on which to hang blankets to dry but the bricks were largely sound and we worked them into our defenses some of the more ambitious men made entire brick fortifications with mud for mortar but these barricades were a twoedged sword fine against rifle fire but dangerously unstable when artillery shells exploded nearby craftsmanship was everything and men with bricklaying experience were in high demand for their advice at least until the ground froze over making it impossible to dig bricks or mortar them these are the subtler arts of war we had nothing to eat but trail rations and little enough of that it was difficult even to keep warm there were days when all we had to burn were fragments of rotted wood and asphalt and there was no relief by night for the dutch loved to shell us during the hours of darkness and our artillery companies were obliged to return fire by the end of three weeks the lack of sleep constant cold and inadequate rations had turned us all into automatons shuffling through frozen or muddy trenches according to orders given by distant madmen or local commanders no older than ourselves major lampret was with usthe stories of his cowardice and selfregard had made it mandatory that he travel to the front lines or lose all credibility with the menand he conducted sunday services on three occasions each event less wellattended than the one before his rivalry with julian still simmered and i expect lampret wished he had demoted or even imprisoned private commongold when the opportunity presented itself but julian was wellliked and lampret could not do anything against him sam knew that lampret had a spy among us and he had concluded that the informer was most likely private langers our entrepreneurial colporteur who had been seen conferring with lampret on several occasions and certainly there was nothing about langerss moral character that would make the charge implausible but langers was careful and no money or favors were seen to change hands the last camp meeting held by major lampret drew a larger audience but that was because we were ordered to it we stood in a circle on cleared ground under cloudy skies in a spitting snow as grim news was announced general galligasken had been injured by shrapnel from an enemy shell even though his headquarters had been set up out of the range of conventional artilleryperhaps a chinese cannon was responsible the general still lived but he had been taken down to tadoussac for emergency treatment and he would probably lose an arm if he survived his replacement was a new general from new york city named reddick a pawn of the executive sam whispered and a lackey of the dominion as well this was bad news indeed there was worse to come reddick in his enthusiasm had ordered an all out dawn attack we were to sleep on our arms and be prepared for heavy action come morning the quartermaster issued us double rationsa welcome change though as a last supper it did little to dispel the gloomand fresh rounds of ammunition we were more convincingly cheered by the arrival of a new division of cavalry men armed with trench sweepers of the type that had proved so effective in the battle of mascouche perhaps we were not doomed after all that faint hope sustained us the sky was red with dawn when all the bugles sounded and all our artillery fired at once announcing the attack we deployed by regiments and ours was in the vanguard i asked sam what the strategy might be but he couldnt tell the armies were too large for one man to survey them and this battle was being coordinated by staff in the rear telegraph cables had been laid to help reddick communicate with field commanders and there were messengers and horsemen to carry intelligence back and forth but this was a clumsy way to manage something as fluid as a massive battle sam said so most of the initiative would be in the hands of regimental captains julian asked pointedly and loudly whether major lampret would deign to involve himself in the attack or whether he would supervise in a spiritual sense from behind lampret overheard this commentas he was no doubt meant toand announced to the assembly that he would take up a rifle if there was one to spare this won him a few scattered hurrahs though his face when he made the offer was chalkwhite and he gave julian a long daggered stare then we were in the thick of it i will spare the reader the ghastly minutiae of that awful morning except to say that our company was reduced to half its numbers before an hour had passed and i saw so much of what ought to have remained inside the human body but hadnt that i passed beyond revulsion into a kind of emotionless efficiency the roar of battle was all but deafening and if not for the organizing genius of flags and bugles i suppose we would have abandoned all order and fought for our lives individually here as in mascouche it was the trench sweeper that made the difference i had learned to recognize the sound of those heavy riflesa sort of deadly prolonged coughand so had the dutch troops who dreaded it the army of the laurentians began to make a striking advance as soon as those weapons were brought to bear though i was still not sure what our ultimate objective might be but general reddick ordered a pursuit of the fleeing enemy and we had no choice but to oblige the battle passed out of the cratered nomansland of trenches and abandoned redoubts as the mitteleuropans fell back to prepared positions on forested hilly land the order for pursuit rang out from all quarters and sam who had been slightly wounded in the thigh but stanched the bleeding with a cotton handkerchief guessed that reddick intended to destroy the dutch army in detail if our cavalry could flank them and get in their rear to this end our regiment was ordered into the trees to keep the enemy moving and acquire any loose supplies or animals they left behind and capture or kill any stragglers it was a bold plan and we might have been a useful part of it except for the consequences of a single bullet our company commander was captain paley glasswood formerly a new york city counter clerk who was at least ten years younger than sam godwinperhaps about major lamprets agebut senior in rank to most of us today he led us through a volley of fierce but as it then seemed ineffective sniper fire into the woods and across a stream and along the bow of a gentle ridge then down into a forested valley never encountering the enemy even once and we marched for more than two hours in this fashion patient but puzzled before the captain stopped and said in a ringing voice im tired boys and the stars are awfully bright then he sat down on a log sighing and mumbling we were hours from darkness though the day was gloomy with little squirts of snow now and again so his comment about the stars surprised everyone sam went up to captain glasswood to ask him what was the matter but got no response then he examined the left side of the captains head and grimaced oh hell here adamhelp me lay him down captain glasswood made no protest as we stretched him out on the cold forest floor under a canopy of creaking pines the captains gaze was distant and the pupil of one eye had grown as large as a comstock dollar he looked at me solemnly as i cradled him down to the ground oh now maria dont cry he said in a petulant voice i havent been to lucilles since tuesday whats the matter with him i asked sam who had been holding the captains head lifted up his palm and showed me streaks of clotted red apparently he was shot he said with disgust shot where in the skull through the ear by the look of it that was a dreadful thing i thought to be shot in the ear the idea of it made me shudder despite all i had seen today i didnt hear any rifle fire it must have happened during the battle or just after perhaps one of those sharpshooters got him that long ago didnt he notice the wound didnt bleed much externally and he has a bullet in his brain adam people with bullets in their brains lose all kinds of sensibility and sometimes they dont even know theyre hurt i expect he still doesnt know hes wounded and never will hes dying thats a certainty i was afraid that captain glasswood might overhear this unhappy diagnosis and be upset by it but sam was right the news if he understood it didnt trouble him at all the captain just closed his eyes and curled on his side like a man making himself comfortable on a feather bed cant you get a blanket from the cedar chest he asked wistfully im cold lucille then he screamed once and stopped breathing there were not quite twenty of us left in the company and we had lost our only commanding officer there was lampret of course who was accompanying us but lampret was a dominion man not a seasoned combatant and at the moment he was no more useful than a stick of wood staring at captain glasswoods corpse as if it had popped up from the ground like a poisonous mushroom the men of the company by some unspoken mutual instinct looked to julian for leadership and julian looked to sam and by so doing bequeathed on him the respect and obedience of the common soldiers post a guard sam said when he realized the burden of command had fallen on him but i guess were far enough from the battle that we can bury captain glasswood without attracting enemy fire we cant carry him back at any rate and it doesnt seem right to abandon him it was of course impossible to truly bury him in the frozen ground so we scraped a shallow trench out of pineneedle duff and rolled captain glasswood into it and covered him over this would not protect his body from wild animals for very long but it was a christian gesture and after a little prodding we even got a funeral prayer out of major lampret though he delivered it in a small and quaking voice julian seemed moved by the death and he did not make any disparaging remarks about god all of us were badly taken by the captains deathas peculiar as that might seem given how much death we had already witnessed and absorbed today it might have been the loneliness of the woods that made the difference or the clouds leaking frigid grains of snow or the conspicuous absence of banners and buglecalls the problem we confronted now though sam did not say so explicitly was that captain glasswood had led us according to what we all imagined was some clever strategy deep into the wilderness and away from the field of battle but the only strategy at work had sprung from the captains damaged mind and it was no longer available to us if it ever existed in other wordswords i was reluctant to pronounce even in the privacy of my own thoughtswe were lost in the wilds of the upper saguenay the sound of battle had faded behind us long ago either the dutch had been chased from their trenches stragglers and all and the war had entered another pause or we had simply passed out of hearing of it the latter possibility was undeniable for we had crossed many wooded ridges which baffle or amplify sounds in unpredictable ways the best plan now sam told the company after we had finished prayers for captain glasswood would be to return to our own lines but that return might not be direct he said until we get firm bearings and in the meantime we must act as a scouting party and note the position and defenses of the dutch should we stumble across any sam said he would try to backtrack us whether he truly possessed this skill or was only saying so to buoy our spirits i couldnt tell we walked for hours more and by nightfall we seemed to be no closer to our lines sam remained mute on the subject we dared not make a fire we carried only minimal rations and we ate sparingly and made what shelter we could and wrapped ourselves in blankets in order to sleep which i suppose some of us were able to do though the bare limbs of the trees creaked like the timbers of a ghostly ship and the wind made a sound like the sea it seems to me lymon pugh said that were sunk pretty deep in a vinegar brine of trouble and that truth was impossible to deny lymon pugh was as emaciated as the rest of us after all our time in the trenches but his muscular forearms sliced by flensing knives and tattooed by beef blood were still impressive even buried under the sleeves of his thick woolen jacket and he made a reassuring companion we walked behind sam who was scouting a path we had come a good distance up a wooded hill all of us sweating despite the frosty air the day though cold was fortunately not overcast and the position of the sun gave us some clue as to the cardinal points of the compass we knew we were east of the saguenay and probably well north of our own lines it was fortunate for us that this part of the country was not much inhabited or we might have been taken captive long ago but we could not avoid civilization for long unless we set up housekeeping in the woods and that would have been a tall order since there was nothing much to eateven small game had been chased away by warfare or scoured up by hungry dutch soldiers so we continued to climb this increasingly steep bluff until as we reached the top sam held up a hand signaling us to stop and whispered that we should not make any noise we came up singly or in twos crouching from the height of this ridge we could see a long declining counterslope gentle enough that a railroad of the narrow gauge the dutch prefer ascended it at an angle passing close to where we stood this was presumably the line between chicoutimi to the mitteleuropan estates at lake st john or perhaps it ran all the way to the rocky atlanticthe dutch had built skeins of railroads across occupied labrador in the decades during which they controlled this land the most important fact about this railroad was its connection to the town of chicoutimi which we could also see though dimly across a misty expanse of winter wilderness attached like a smudged appendix to the blue ribbon of the saguenay and that meant we were no longer lostthough we were still a great distance from where we wanted to be the way ahead was clear and obvious we need only follow the railroad until we could veer off toward more friendly territory and our hearts were light for that did not appear to be an insurmountable task we might even be back with our old regiment in time for a hot meal before bed but the journey had to be postponed a few moments more sam urged us to keep silent he had seen a train approaching from the easthe pointed out a trail of smoke hovering over the eastern passes stay hidden until it goes by every one of you we were only a few yards from the track where it crossed the peak of the ridge to begin its descent into chicoutimi and soon the train would be just adjacent to us shouldnt we fire on it or do something soldierly such as that asked lymon pugh it may not be a military train said sam i dont see any great advantage in shooting unarmed civilians even among the dutch and gunfire would draw attention on us in any case and probably get us killed no one was inclined to argue the point we were low on ammunition anyhow for we had wasted some of it shooting unproductively into empty squirrels nests in hopes of bringing down a little fresh meat we sat tight among the rocks and spindly winter bushes until we could hear the trains dutch engine straining against the slope and feel the rumble of it i had not seen a mitteleuropan train before and i wondered what it would look like it hove into view finally and it was not much different from an american train in so far as function dictates form in these matters though it did look very smoothlybuilt and the engine was painted an unusual bluegray color what was alarming was not the design of the train but its speed which was slow and worse slowing in fact it seemed as if the train was coming to a stop we raised our heads despite sams warning the train was a military one that much was patently obvious the engine was drawing only a pair of cars both of which bore the sinister crossandlaurel insigne of the mitteleuropan army we ought to have pulled up the track lymon pugh whispered to me to keep that thing from reaching chicoutimi with whatever its carrying there wasnt time i said even if we had thought of it perhaps we can tear up the tracks later but keep your wits about you lymon i believe that train isnt going any farther than right here we had no plan for this unexpected contingency sam hastily motioned at us to move a little ways up along the ridge though still keeping the mysterious dutch train within sight why had it come to this hilltop near chicoutimi and why had it paused right near us no simple explanation sprang to mind sam halted us in a stand of naked birches where the hummocky ground made it easy to disguise ourselves against accidental discovery we watched the train in breathless anticipation someone wondered aloud whether the train might not have been sent explicitly to hunt for us but one misplaced american infantry company was not significant to the dutch sam said major lampret stirred from his funk and said we ought to get as far from that thing as possible we endanger ourselves by sitting herewhy dont we retreat were as safe here as anywhere sam said coolly as long as were not seen stay put dont presume to give me orders said lampret evidently major lampret had regrown his spine but he had chosen a poor time to enter into an argument over rank i thought the men of the company thought so too for they hissed at him to keep quiet i suppose we could all fly home if we had angels wings one man muttered lampret gave way fearing mutiny but he said to sam in a low tone well talk about insubordination when we get back to camp that would be a more convenient time to discuss it sam agreed and lampret lapsed back into his sullen silence in the meantime the dutch train had halted altogether noisily bleeding steam from its valves and a few mitteleuropan soldiers clambered off the rear car what appeared to interest them was a little clearing just at the western side of the traina granite shoulder covered with pebbles and tufts of brittle weeds the dutch soldiers scouted out that flat space meticulously and shaded their eyes and peered off toward the distant saguenay and spoke their unintelligible language to one another then they returned to the train and rolled back the door on one of the twin boxcars the open door admitted a shaft of sunlight and revealed the cars contents at which we all gasped for the train was carrying a chinese cannon sam detailed a pair of men to count the enemy soldiers as they disembarked and prepared to assemble the cannon i asked julian what he thought was going on isnt it obvious adam they mean to set up an artillery battery whathere its a long way from the fight you forget the extraordinary range of the chinese cannon thats the advantage of it it can be placed far from the active lines and still be an effective weapon the drawback is that its bulky and has to be carried by a whole convoy of wagons or by a train for instance in those two cars both boxcars had been opened now and we could see that the assembly and activation of the cannon would not be a simple task for the gunners its great rotary base occupied one car and the barrel of the thing broken into telescoping pieces occupied the other the cargo of the train also included a couple of mules to assist in haulage and enstationment and winches and levers and other necessary tools there was also a number of crates marked bombe a word even lymon pugh was able to translate from the dutch or deutsche in this case im told we counted fifteen artillerymen give or take plus whatever crew remained aboard the engine we outnumber them julian remarked perhaps sam said but theyre conspicuously betterarmed but we have the element of surprise are you suggesting we engage the dutch artillery im suggesting we have a duty not to let those shells fall on american soldiers if we can help it that was a bold but bracing declaration and it pleased some in our company who were anxious to make the dutch pay a price for inconveniencing us with their war and for the cowardly act of shooting captain glasswood through the ear sam smiled well said but we have to be clever about it julian not just belligerent what would you do if it was your command capture the train julian said the company of us had all gathered around and some grinned at this though major lampret scowled and shook his head thats an objective sam said patiently not a plan tell me your plan julian took a moment to assess the situation peering at the train and the surrounding landscape post most of our company on that lip overlooking the ridge where the tall trees aredo you see we can conceal ourselves and make every shot count which is important given our limited munitions and from there we can range in on anyone who hasnt deliberately taken cover thus employing the element of surprise sam said surprise and distraction we could leave a couple of men here to make some sort of demonstration and draw the attention of the dutch in exactly the wrong direction the two of them discussed the idea at length with others in the company chiming in with suggestions then sam said it might work i think it will work if we execute it correctly but that would leave us in possession of a train containing a chinese cannonwhat do we do with it once we have it drive it down toward chicoutimi said julian for what purpose it depends on the state of the fighting if the rail happens to cross into territory held by our forces we can deliver the cannon to themand be feted as heroes no doubt failing that we can destroy the cannon and render it useless to the dutch destroy it how put some sort of fuse on those shellcasings and blow it all up i suppose we might even turn the entire train into a sort of bombset it on fire and send it hurtling into chicoutimi hard on us though that scenario we can leap off at the closest approach to our lines and make our way home julian smiled if nothing else it might save us a few miles walking it was that humble suggestion that clinched the issue we were all tired of walking and the idea of riding a captured enemy train even halfway home was a pleasant one to contemplate all of us agreed to the plan at least tacitly except major lampret who insisted that we were lunatics and mutineers for undertaking this battle without his consent and that there would be consequences if we carried it out assuming we werent all killed by our own foolishness but lamprets credibility had been so thoroughly undercut that he was easy to ignore i was in favor of the attack and my only disappointment when it was approved was that lymon pugh and i were assigned to provide the useful distraction i asked sam what he wanted us to do wait here until the rest of us are in place ill signal you when its time to begin the proceedings begin them how though just make a noise of some kindnothing too belligerent just something that will draw all eyes it neednt be anything fancythe firing will commence at once the dutchmen were beginning to harness up their mules so we had to move quickly lymon and i watched the other men of the company scuttle away backs bent and weapons ready to their hiding places a few hundred yards to the east lymon said youd better orchestrate this thing adam i dont know how to distract a dutch soldier except by shooting at him maybe you can call out to them in their own language perhaps i would except i dont speak it you have that letter you bought from langerss lucky mug ive seen you reading it over and over but not for the sense of it and i can only guess at the pronunciation based on what ive heard from dutch prisoners they wouldnt believe me for a second they dont have to believe yousams instruction was only that we should obtain their attention look theresam is already waving his handi believe the time is ripego on adam call out to them i was flustered by the rapid progression of events and i could think of nothing to do except to adopt lymon pughs suggestion i cleared my throat louder lymon said make yourself heard i cupped my hands around my mouth and cried out lieftse hannie whats that mean lymon asked i dont know they cant hear you wasnt there something about americans being no better than dogs i racked my brain fikkie mis ik ook i shouted so loudly that the obdurate syllables pricked my throat like thorns lieftse hannie fikkie mis ik ook that did the trick for one fragile momenta fraction of time as motionless as a bug in amberevery dutch soldier looked in my direction and each one wore an identical expression of confusion bordering on bewilderment then a barrage of rifle fire began to cut them down at the end of the ambush we had taken a twocar train a chinese cannon and three prisoners and left a score of dead mitteleuropan soldiers scattered about the prisoners consisted of an artilleryman and two civilian engineers they were not cooperative and had to be bound and tied everything that had been taken from the train we put back in place none of the heavy parts of the chinese cannon had yet been unhitched this was indeed a fine haul if we could get it into american hands fortunately one of the men of our companya longhaired mechanic named penniman from lake champlainhad studied trains and understood the theory of steamdriven engines well enough that he could discern the use of the controls even though they were labeled in a foreign language while he got up pressure in the boilers the rest of us policed the area collecting dutch rifles and pistols from their former owners then julian and i went to join sam in the cab of the engine while the rest of the company found room for themselves in the heavily loaded boxcars we were forced to evict the mules this had all gone very smoothly and would have been a complete triumph except that as it turned out one of the dutch soldiers had been playing dead and had secreted his rifle beneath his apparently lifeless body just as soon as penniman released the brake and the train began to move this troublesome mitteleuropan grabbed up his weapon and fired on us bullets flew through the cab and penniman was lightly injured sam cursed and took up his own rifle he leaned around the coal hopper and fired three shots i thrust out my head long enough to see the dutch rifleman retreat into a thicket of skeletal leafless trees we would have kept on rolling without further incident i suppose since the artilleryman could hardly have followed us except that the door on the rear boxcar rolled open and major lampret popped out of it shooting his own rifle wildly brake up sam cried disgustedly and penniman did so the train vented steamclouds into the cold air i managed to discern more of the action despite the veils of mist that obscured it apparently major lampret had decided to demonstrate his courage which had been so severely questioned in recent days and to restore himself to command perhaps he deemed the odds respectablehimself against one desperate dutchman or it may be that his motives were sincere and patriotic if misguided in any case his act of bravery or stupidity produced no good result the dutch infantryman fired back and his defense was more calculated than lamprets attack major lampret took a bullet and slumped to the ground at this point julian astonished me by leaping out of the enginecabin and running toward the place where major lampret had fallen sam was equally astonished but he kept his wits and shouted fire on the enemy give coverwhile doing so himself other men of our company began to follow his example though none of us was willing to make himself as vulnerable to the dutchmans bullets as had julian i fired my rifle too though part of me felt frozen in the event watching julian dodge and dash toward an injured a man who had once threatened to imprison him when julian reached the major he didnt hesitate but thrust his hands under lamprets inert arms and began to drag him back to the train geysers of icy dirt flew up around julian and the majorthese were the impacts of hostile bullets each one coming closer to its mark then the dutchman gave out an audible cry from the thicket where he was hidden and threw up his arms and fell forward and on this occasion his death was not feigned but entirely authentic several of our men jumped from the train to help julian with his burden soon the major was safely aboard major lampret had been badly hurtthe artillerymans bullet had passed through his shoulder leaving ugly wounds on the front and back of himbut he was breathing freely and there seemed to be a decent chance that he might recover if he received prompt medical attention if major lampret had meant to establish his courage by this act the attempt was a failure i supposed it was brave of him to go after the dutch soldier the way he had but julians bravery in the rescue was more conspicuous especially as it was aimed at saving the life of a man he despised and this was what drew admiration from the other men while lampret received only the most cursory attention in his suffering lampret remained unconscious and just as well or his jealousy might have killed him on the spot the gunfire and the damage to major lampret made our journey down the hillside more eerie than triumphal it was a feeling exacerbated by the land around us for our captive train soon passed out of the winter forest into a stygian realm of churned and frozen craters cutwire fences festooned with corpses and the blackened frames of burneddown farmhouses the fighting had been fierce in our absence we began to calculate our options from here the railroad ran straight to the embattled town of chicoutimi as far as we knew that locality remained in the hands of the mitteleuropans but julian found a swiss spyglass among the articles left behind in the engine cabin and he pointed it ahead of us looking very distinguished it seemed to me in his battlescarred uniform with his long hair flowing out behind him after a time he began to smile the smile broadened then julian handed the spyglass to sam look ahead samfocus on the church tower on the hill hard to see in this mist the valley through which we traveled was foggy in places and a leaden overcast had blunted the blue sky but that must be the church towerriddled with artillery impactsits not very clear turn the sidewheel with your thumb julian said to bring it into focus sam fiddled with the adjustment cursing the swiss are too clever by halftoo clever for their own good i dont thinkah there then sam smiled too what do you see i demanded dont make a secret of it only a flag on the church tower well why shouldnt there be a flag on the church tower no reason at all what distinguishes this flag is that it has thirteen stripes and sixty stars he put down the spyglass and said more gently our forces have taken chicoutimi thus it was only a matter of slowing the train and rumbling into chicoutimi with our prize a dutch military train arriving from the east might not be the most welcome sight among american troops sam reminded us we had already passed a couple of pickets who had taken hasty shots at us what we needed was some convincing signal of our amity major lampret is a dominion officer julian said dont they carry american flags with them at all times for funerals and prayers we stopped in an isolated place long enough for julian to visit the men in the boxcars who gave a spontaneous hurrah when he told them chicoutimi had fallen and to procure a flag from major lampret who carried one folded inside his shirt julian came back to the engine of the dutch train but he didnt enter the cab instead he tied the flag to a charred treebranch which he found on the ground and clambered onto the front of the engine perching himself on an iron shelf just below the lanternlens go in slowly he called back to penniman the train lurched forward as penniman released the brake almost tumbling julian onto the tracks then proceeded more smoothly and that was how we arrived in the newlycaptured town of chicoutimi a fine snow had begun to fall and the afternoon was theatrical in its shifting scrims of sun and cloud we rode all the way into the depot with julian up front like a patriotic ornament his uniform was ragged and dirty and his face was alabaster with the cold but he grinned irrepressibly and waved the sixty stars and thirteen stripes before the hundreds of infantrymen and cavalrymen who assembled at the sight of our smoke the engine passed down a corridor of these astonished soldiers before it finally hissed to a stop then the doors of the boxcars were thrown open and a great and jubilant outcry rose up for it was obvious to every spectator that we had captured a chinese cannon all intact the scourge of cholera caught up with us later that month many brave men who had survived injury and starvation all the way up the bloody saguenay were taken to their graves by the disorder the stench inconvenience and tragedy of the disease made life unpleasant for all of us sick or not and eventually most of us did get sick though we did not necessarily die i did not for exampleand i was as sick as anyone the human mind edits from memory its feverish interludes and i can recollect very little of january or february of when i came to myself what astonished me mostapart from my emaciation and general weaknesswas that i had been transported without my knowledge from chicoutimi to a field hospital in tadoussac and from there to the soldiers rest a recuperationhouse in the city of montreal i learned that many men i knew and liked had died in the outbreak and that saddened me but there was good news too sam julian and lymon pugh had survived the disease though they were sickened by it and all three of them were here in the soldiers rest also recuperating out of all of our small circle the sickest had been julian the doctors said he had come close to dying but he was well enough now that he could sit up and take medicinal soups and such sam and lymon were in even better mettle and would be leaving the rest within days and there was another bright light on the horizon which served to improve my mood that was the prospect of our release from the army of the laurentians the draft act of specified a single year of involuntary service though an aristo could contribute an indentured man for the duration and although we were strenuously canvassed to reenlist we resisted that temptation except for lymon pugh who felt the army despite its manifest dangers was a more attractive option than the meatpacking trade this meant that as early as easter i would be able to leave here with sam and julian and we would be bound for new york cityas civiliansjust as we had intended when we fled williams ford though with a heightened sense of the injustices and opportunities of life during my enforced idleness i did a great deal of reading and writing i wrote to my mother in williams ford as i had written several times before being careful not to disclose any dangerous information about julian or our precise whereabouts since there was always a chance the mail might be intercepted by some perfervid dominion or government agent still hunting the presidents nephew that meant that i could not receive any letters from my mother in return a sore trial for me but i was careful to write as regularly as possible and to reassure her about my health and welfare i also wrote to calyxa blake confessing my continued love and my desire to see her again she responded with letters of her own but these were curiously brief though friendly enough something in the tone of them worried me and i vowed to seek her out as soon as i could convince the doctors to release me that did not happen immediately however so i pursued other kinds of writing i wrote an account of the events of the winterof our voyage up the saguenay the siege of chicoutimi the fall of that town and the capture of the chinese cannon i tried to hew to the principles the correspondent theodore dornwood had taught me that is to remain within the borders of the truth but to veer where there was latitude toward drama i worked at the piece over several days reading what i had written and rewriting it until i was satisfied with the result then i pondered how to get the pages to mr dornwood if he was still anywhere near montreal mr dornwood had praised my previous efforts andif the truth be toldi had grown somewhat addicted to his flattery coming as it did from a professional war correspondent in the end it was lymon pugh who offered to be my intermediary he was the healthiest of us and he came to the wardroom the day he was due to be released we talked idly at first then he saw what i was reading and asked me about it it was a history of mankind in space i had kept this tattered and very ancient volume with me all through my military career tucked into the bottom of my dittybag it wasnt heavythe formidable stiff covers of the book had fallen off months ago really it was only a bundle of pages held together with a binding of threads which i had sewn myself clumsily an old book i said to lymon how old more than a century its from the last days of the secular ancients lymons eyes widened that old did they write in english back then or did they have some language of their own its english though some of the words and usages are peculiar here look lymon had lately taken an interest in books since he was now able to puzzle out enough words to make them intriguing to himbooks which had been mute lumps in prior times were suddenly full of voices all clamoring for attention in the course of lymons instruction i had read him chapters of mr charles curtis eastons against the brazilians which had also survived intact in my dittybag and i had even allowed lymon to borrow the volume and read ahead once he was captivated by the plot lymon though not experienced in reading endorsed my opinion that mr easton was probably the greatest of our living authors he could not imagine a better one at any rate it was a miracle that anyone wrote books at all lymon said much less good ones and he was impressed by mr eastons formidable knowledge of foreign places historic battles pirates and such interesting subjects but the history of mankind in space seemed to oppress him as he leafed through its pages and inspected its photographs his features knotted into a spindled emblem of perplexity it seems to say here that people went to the moon he uttered in a low voice thats exactly what it says and this is not a work of fiction it claims not to be i dont know whether folks walked on the moon or not but the secular ancients clearly believed it and so does julian it was a poorlyordered world we lived in lymon said if moonvisiting was deemed to be nonfiction while mr eastons straightforward narratives about wars and pirates were excoriated as they had been julian once told me in some quarters as crude storytelling this isnt a dominion book is it no when it was written there was no dominion keep your voice downyoull get us in trouble with that kind of talk its not talk only history even the dominion admits that it came into being with the false tribulation before that all the churches were independent and disorganized and had little sway with the government or any way of fulfilling the ideal of a christian world under the direct administration of heaven thats what the dominion means to set up thats its ultimate purposeto unite the world in advance of the rule of jesus christ which he would have known if he had not slept through so many sunday services im not wellchurched said lymon rubbing his left hand over his scarred right forearm do you suppose thats about to happen with the fall of chicoutimi and all the dominion must conquer a great deal more of the world than just labrador before the end of all worldly strife i doubt well see the global reign of christianity in our lifetime lymon nodded with obvious relief he said he didnt mind the prospect of christian governmenthe was willing to be ruled by heavenwhat troubled him was that heaven might employ men like major lampret as intermediaries i asked whether the major had recovered from the wounds he received during the capture of the chinese cannon he did and he even survived the cholera but hes gone back to colorado springs for the time being the events up the saguenay were an embarrassment to him and he needs to improve his morale and reputation as much his health good news for julian at least i said lymon since youre leaving here shortly and im still confined to bed would you do me a favor yes certainlywhat i have two packages i need delivered in montreal i took these out from where i had stashed them beneath the bed the smaller one is a letter to be delivered personally to calyxa blake ive written her address on the envelopecan you read it adequately well i think so this bigger bundle of papers is meant for mr theodore dornwood if hes still around and if you can find him dornwood the newspaper writer that might be difficult rumor is that he left the regiment when we went upriver and that he sits in some cheap rental and posts lies to manhattan between bouts of drunkenness and debauchery but ill try to find him for your sake if you want me to adam the reader may imagine with what impatience and anxiety i awaited lymons return for each of the missives i had entrusted to him was greatly significant to me the package for theodore dornwood contained my whole account of the saguenay expedition the smaller letter meant for calyxa was even more momentous in it i expressed my intention to propose marriage to her should she find the time to visit me in the hospital but lymon did not return that afternoon nor in the evening to forestall my uneasiness i talked with the two other patients with whom i shared the ward one was a leaseboy like myself but from a southern estate where he had been worked cruelly in the tropical heat he had been wounded north of quebec and his whole right arm though intact was a useless appendage my other companion was a cavalryman with a generous mustache and his head shaved bald who wouldnt say how he had acquired the injury that was hidden by a layer of bandages wrapping his belly neither of these men were scintillating conversationalists since both were in constant pain but the cavalryman owned a box of dominoes and we passed an hour or two playing estates after that i asked the nurse whether the hospital had any fresh reading material since i had memorized nearly every page of the history of mankind in space and against the brazilians i think there might be something she said but all she could scare up was a slender volume of stories by mrs eckerson mrs eckerson was one of the classic authors of the nineteenth century suitable for modern tastes and preserved from extinction by the dominion press but she wrote mainly for young girls and the book provoked memories of my sister flaxie nevertheless i read until my eyes tired of it and my bedside lamp by the time i blew it out was the last one burning in the morning i was treated to one of the hospitals hygienic bathsa mandatory ordeal overseen by nurses and damaging to male dignityand when i returned to my bed i found lymon pugh waiting in the visitors chair he was alone well i said did you deliver the messages i gave you yes he said with an apparent uneasiness well dont make a mystery of it tell me what happened he cleared his throat i found that theodore dornwood for you the stories about him are true adam hes living by the docks in a shack not much better than a stable he lies in a yellow bed and drinks whiskey and smokes hempen cigarettes all day long he still possesses that typewriter you always talk about but he dont seem to employ it much his bad habits dont concern me did he accept my account of the saguenay expedition at first he didnt want to see me at allhes surly when hes drunk and he called me a poxy hallucination and said i was absurd and things of that nature ordinarily i wouldnt take that from anyone but i took it from him adam on your behalf and he mellowed somewhat when i mentioned your name my western muse he called you whatever that means and when i showed him that bundle of papers his eyes lit right up the praise tickled my vanity and i asked whether mr dornwood had said anything more on the subject well he took the papers out and began to read them and then he looked at the last few pages and grinned he said it was excellent work thats all if he said anything else it wasnt to mehe shooed me away without a thankyou but the package must have improved his mood because i heard a great deal of clacking and tapping from his machine as i walked off ill seek him out when im released i said pleased by the report of mr dornwoods enthusiasm though it had lacked any flattering specifics a vastly more important question loomed and did you deliver my letter to miss blake well i went to the address you gave me wasnt she home no and hadnt been for quite a while according to the neighbors so i asked after her down at the thirsty boot it took some effort because those people are not universally welldisposed toward american soldiers but i finally found out what had become of her he paused at this critical juncture as if considering his words and i said go on whatever you learned tell me well ii found her at the place where shes now residing and i gave her your letterthats the bones of the story flesh it out then didnt she have any response she was thoughtful about it she read it a couple of times over then she said tell adam i find his suggestion interesting interesting it wasnt an acceptance of my proposal but neither was it a rejectioni held that small hope close to my heart interesting she said but unfortunately not practical right at the moment not practical i expect she meant because of where she lives i could not help remembering that her villainous brothers had threatened to sell her into a brothel and i was terrorized by the notion that they might have succeeded lymon im strong enough for the truthwhat terrible place has she gone to that prevents her from coming to see me lymon blushed and looked at his feet well oh say it shes inand dont take this too hard adamshes in prison i set up a meeting between myself sam julian and lymon pugh in order to plan strategy and in defiance of the rules of the soldiers rest we convened in the ward where julian was recovering ignoring the protests of the nurses and it was quickly agreed that we ought to rescue calyxa although my proposalthat we leave immediately and storm the prisonwas rejected it was unwise strategy sam said to attack a target before acquiring reliable intelligence about its strengths its weaknesses and the mood of its defenders i was forced to admit the truth of this though sitting in idleness while calyxa endured confinement was not a comfortable chore sam was as healthy by now as lymon pugh and he agreed to leave the hospital for the purpose of scouting out the prison i would stay here in the meantime with julian who was less recovered though he took a keen interest in the subject i shook hands with all parties at the conclusion of the meeting and i was profoundly moved and struggled to control my emotions its more than i ever expected to have such friends as would risk themselves on my behalfdespite the difference in our stations in lifeand i want you all to know that i would do the same for each one of you if the boot were on the other leg dont be so eager to thank us sam said until we actually accomplish something but i could tell that he was moved as well i sat with julian a while longer after sam and lymon left julian appeared more frail than i liked to see him his skin was very white and it cleaved to the bones of his cheeks for he had lost considerable weight and julian had never been stout something about his eyes had changed too i thought as if they had absorbed an unpleasant wisdom which dulled their color that might have been due to the cholera or to war in general and all the death he had seen it made me nervous and i thanked him again for his kindness addressing him as if he were an aristo and i was a leaseboy which of course we were but it had never seemed so between us settle down adam he said i know how fond you are of this montreal woman more than fond i confided in him and shared my secret that i hoped to marry her he grinned at the news in that case we must certainly have her released from jail it would never do to have my best friend wedded to a prisoner dont make light of it juliani cant bear it i love her more dearly than i can describe without blushing he said more gently it must be wonderful to feel that way about a woman it is though it has its distressing aspects i know one day youll meet a suitable woman and feel about her as i do about calyxa i think he appreciated this kindness on my part for he looked away and smiled to himself i suppose anything is possible he said what was not possible was for us to converse much longer for the hour of lampsout was approaching and the nurses had rallied and were preparing to descend on us in force i told julian he needed his sleep you must sleep as well adam he said though it might be hard to keep from worrying all night long sleep confidentlythats an order an order from a fellow private but im not a private anymoredidnt sam tell you both sam and i were given promotions while we were unconscious i expect it was an attempt on the part of the staff to induce them to reenlist or else a result of the terrible casualties the army of the laurentians had suffered during the saguenay expedition but for whatever reason sam was now officially a colonel and julian was a captaincaptain commongoldjust as theodore dornwood had predicted i stood up and essayed a salute but julian waved it off dont adami need a friend far more than i need a subordinate and well all be out of the army soon and on an even footing once again i supposed that was true in the sense he intended it but in another sense we would never be even againif we ever had beenfor whatever else we were we were no longer boys we had survived a war and we were men sam and lymon returned in the morning with their scouting report the good news was that calyxa was being held in a military prison not a civilian jail that was a boon because the rules applying to military prisons were more flexible than civil lawshe hadnt been convicted of anything and was serving no fixed term but was being held on suspicion which meant that it required only an official adjudgment to have her released what was her crime i asked she was hauled in sam said as part of a gang of troublemakers who call themselves parmentierists after some european philosopher when they were marching down the street with signs reading all soldiers out of montreal and such slogans as that surely its not illegal to carry a sign even under military occupation it wasnt the signcarrying that got them arrested the mob she was with ran into a pair of backwoods ruffians who had some grievance against them and gunfire was exchanged she was found to be carrying a small pistol which she had fired the backwoodsmen i suspected were none other than job and utty blake her murderous siblings but sam couldnt confirm it since he had confined his inquiries to calyxas particular circumstances will they let her out then not without orders from headquarters which is a problem since the leadership of the army of the laurentians is in a state of flux and trivial matters are being ignored it could be months before the situation returns to normal months obviously we need to retrieve her sooner than that but it might take delicate maneuvering and perhaps some forgivable chicanery may i suggest a plan he did soand it was an admirable plan which i will describe in its enactmentbut it required that we function as a group and some question remained about julians health and fitness the nurses refused to discharge him but they couldnt physically prevent him from leaving which is what he did standing up a little shakily and demanding his uniform which was presently delivered to him he was pale and perilously thin but seemed to improve as soon as we stepped into the sunshine the season was young yet with easter still a week in the future but montreal was pleasantly warm under a cloudless breezy sky we proceeded to a tavern where we rented a room to store our possessions and we waited there while lymon pugh went off to seek theodore dornwood once again it wasnt dornwood we needed but the use of his typewriter mr dornwood had been reluctant to allow it lymon said on his return but lymon had cited urgent necessity and flexed his enormous arm muscles in a conspicuous fashion until the journalist relented it was lucky i caught him when i did lymon said he was packing up says hes been called back to manhattan by his newspaper another hour and hed have been gone by train but you got what we needed from him asked sam here it is lymon pugh unfolded a piece of paper and placed it on the table before us this isnt exactly the text i requested sam said dornwood wouldnt consent to type iti had to pick it out myself and i couldnt remember quite everything at least not the way you said it the message as printed said headquarters army of the lorenshensto the army jail montreall please release to the barer of this noteone prisonerof the name of calixa blakebein a female person of athletic buildcurly black hair thick ankels by order of colonel sam samson signed is it all right lymon asked anxiously i wrote colonel as you wanted me to sam though the spelling seems irregular to me that machine is a menace adam i dont know why you crave it soit took me most of an hour to peck out the letters on it writers must suffer as badly as beefboners if theyre attached to such a device all day the spellings not important said sam the night guards at the prison are almost certainly illiterate the printed letters are what will impress them along with my rank or so i hope in order to further impress them sam had purchased a bottle of blue ink which he spilled onto a cloth napkin then he took a comstock dollar from his pocket and pressed the side of it bearing the image of julians uncle into the ink and used the coin on the paper as a sort of stamp or imprimatur which indeed looked very official and would have fooled me if i had been less schooled in reading after that it was only a matter of waiting we ordered meals of cut pork and kidney beans all around to brace us for the evening and to advance the cause of julians improving health those of us who drank spirits took beer or wine i took plain water as usual though i added a small amount of red wine to the cup at sams insistence to discourage any microscopic disease germs flourishing therein for the cholera had not spared montreal it was a medicinal hygienic precaution and it did not make me drunk or even count as a sin as far as i could see though perhaps the angels account it differently we waited until well after sunset and then until the evening crowds had abandoned the streets and all but the overnight torches had been extinguished then we left the tavern and walked as a group to the prison where calyxa was unjustly confined the prison was a building with thick ancient stone walls it had been divided into a habitation for the guards and staff on the top floor and cells for the inmates on the ground floor and in a basement below perhaps the building had served a civic purpose at one time but the army of the laurentians had made the building their own and draped it with military banners and posted guards at the rusty iron doors our sole advantage sam said would be in our confident bearing we had to present ourselves as men assigned a necessary but unexciting duty so we were not to speak furtively or cast around nervous glances but to play the role to the hilt colonel sam led the way of course his bar of command freshly sewn to the shoulderstrap of his overcoat useful now that the days heat had evaporated while captain commongold acted as his adjutant and lymon and i as ordinary soldiers the guards at the door glanced at sams insignia of rank and briefly at our counterfeit note before allowing us inside we came into a kind of anteroom where a sleepylooking officer of the guard regarded us from behind a desk he was surprised to have visitors at this late hour and his expression wasnt welcoming you have some business to conduct he asked sam nodded regally and presented him with the certificate lymon pugh had printed on the typewriter of mr dornwood the guard looked it over he was a skinny man not much older than myself aspiring to a beard he gave the note back to sam and said i have misplaced my eyeglasses colonelbest if you read it to me sam did so this is an irregular hour for a prisoner transfer the guard said i dont care that its regular or irregular said sam im here to do a job and if you have to wake your commanding officer before i can do it then wake him please and do it promptly i dont know as thats necessary as long as youll sign for the prisoner of course ill sign for her where is she the head man did not bestir himself but called one of his underlings from door duty packard show these men to the cellar take the keys we followed packard down a set of stairs into a dimlylit and stinking arrangement of ironbarred cellsa manmade hell i might even say except that it was rather more cold than warm at the moment i looked around this awful place for any sign of calyxa but what i saw was something much worse the unhappy faces of job and utty blake the two villains jointly occupied a single cell our passage had waked them up and they gazed at us with sleepy suspicion i did not doubt they were the blake brothers though i had only seen one of them before and then only the top of his head that one was job and if he recognized me by the dim light of the guards lantern he showed no sign of it both brothers possessed the family signature which was a crown of bushy curly hair but jobs incarnation of it had been altered by my prior encounter with him at the top of his forehead a wide swatch of hair was gone replaced by a conspicuously scarred and wrinkled divot where my pistol shot had creased his skull i cannot say i took pride in the sight of the wound i had inflicted on this terrible man but it didnt entirely displease me i was careful to betray no reaction however for it would have been awkward had he known me we proceeded on to a much larger cell as big as a room in which several people had been confined togetherthe parmentierists of whom calyxa was one she sprang to her feet at the sight of me but i made a cautioning gesture and she spoke not a word thats her there the guard said pointing let her out then sam demanded packard fumbled with a ring of keys by the dim glow of the lantern while he was doing that calyxa stepped forward and stood where she could whisper to me without being overheard what do you want adam she asked with unexpected coolness what do i want didnt you get my letter the other inmatesi recognized some of them from her circle of friends at the thirsty bootwere frankly curious about this midnight visit but they kept their distance from us once calyxa had given them a fierce glare yes she said i got it and read it you said you want to marry me i did of course but i hadnt thought to discuss it so baldly or through the bars of a prison cell i want to marry you above all other earthly things i said if you consent to be my wife calyxa the world wont hold a happier specimen of a man once youre free of this place but if i dont consent dont consent that bewildered me wellthats your decisionall i can do calyxa is ask i wont consent to any such arrangement until i know the details of it theres a suspicion of you among my friends who arent inclined to trust a soldier of any breed or nationality what am i suspected of bargaining my freedom in exchange for my betrothal i dont understand i cant make it any plainer am i free to go whether i marry you or not or am i to rot in this prison unless i consent i was astonished that she could suspect me of such blackmail and i put it down to the bad influence of her political companions at least i thought the expression on her face was more hopeful than despairing i said i love you calyxa blake and i wont let you linger here an hour longer even if you despise me with all the passion in your body to see you set free is all i care about right nowwe can discuss the rest of it another time i said this loudly enough to be heard by the cynical parmentierists who responded by giving me a cheer perhaps not altogether ironical in intent and they started up an impudent chorus of piston loom and anvil as calyxa shot them a vindictive look that said in essence i told you so unfortunately i was also overheard by the slackjawed guard packard who looked alarmed and pulled back his key from the keyhole whats this about he asked and he persisted in his questioning until lymon pugh was forced to silence the poor man lymon had amused himself during his hospital confinement by making himself a knockera very fine one consisting of a lead egg in a hempcloth sack just as he had once described to meand it was this device he employed to relieve the guard of his senses sam retrieved the keys from packards limp hand and opened the door and said to all those it contained you might as well take the opportunity you boysthere are only two guards in the outer office and if you handle them fast they wont have time to raise an alarm the parmentierists seemed impressed by this act of generosity on the part of an american soldier and i hoped it would make their political views more nuanced in the future they crowded out quickly eager to overwhelm the remaining guards and calyxa came into my arms well will you i asked once we had breath enough to speak will i what marry me i suppose i will she said sounding surprised at her own answer my joy was unconquerable though it ebbed as we passed the cage where job and utty blake were confined utty sat at the back of the cell scowling and muttering but job whom i had shot came up to the bars and rattled them as savagely as a gorilla and spat out curses in the french language i dont guess well set these two free sam said the keys still jingling in his hand no said calyxa please dont theyre murderers bush runners and spies for the dutch when the money is goodtheyve already been convicted and sentenced to hang she explained that in the melee between the blake brothers and the parmentierists several shots had been fired but only job and utty had struck targets job had killed a young parmentierist and utty had gunned down a luckless bystander some colonel or major of the local garrison had promptly appointed himself a court and sentenced the pair to public hanging perhaps not a wholly legal procedure even under the rules of military occupation but no one apart from the blake brothers had taken exception to it job had heard all about calyxas dalliance with a soldier and he had deduced by the events of this evening that i was that person the one who had come within an inch of blowing out his brains he directed more curses and not a little saliva at me before turning his vultures gaze on calyxa tu nous sers à rien mais pire tu nous déshonores dommage que tu sois pas mort dans lutérus de ta mère whats he saying i asked he says he regrets that i was ever born i looked job blake hard in the eye we all have regrets in this life i said philosophically tell him i regret i didnt aim lower the wedding was arranged to take place on the saturday after easter by which time sam julian and i would be civilians again and after the ceremony we would all board the train for new york city and begin our lives afresh i wont strain the readers attention by narrating every detail of our musteringout suffice to say that we rejoined our regiment and concluded our business there sam performed one duty enabled by his new rank which was to rebuke private langers whom he suspected of having acted as a spy for major lampret langers had survived the saguenay campaign and was running his lucky mug business whenever a skirmish with the dutch provided fresh corpses to loot sam waited until a crowd had gathered around langerss tent then he demanded to see the entire contents of the lucky mug which he proceeded to inventory demonstrating to the assembled soldiers that the numbers on the slips corresponded to the worthless trinkets but never to the valuable goods this revelation so incensed the privates customers than no further discipline on sams part was necessary i learned later that langers survived his chastisement we signed ourselves out of the army of the laurentians and were given documents testifying to our discharge along with something called a recall number which would summon us back to active duty in case of an emergencybut we gave that prospect scant thought sam julian and i said goodbye to lymon pugh who had reenlisted and vows of friendship were exchanged and lymon promised to write occasionally now that he was able to do so then we rode a wagon to the city of montreal where calyxa was waiting for me a few days remained before the wedding sam used the time to say goodbye to friends he had made among the jews of montreal though they were not satisfied with his degree of orthodoxy sam was firmly a jew in his own estimate and had been born such but he never adopted the refined and intricate doctrines and habits that characterize that faith such as not working on saturday a day the jews had apparently mistaken for the sabbath or attending shool on a regular basis or following every commandment of the torah which was some sort of cylindrical bible as sam described it i was taken from those things too early he lamented to me and they dont come naturally at my age i never underwent a barmitzva i dont read or speak hebrew im lucky to have had a bris come to that a custom that cant be described outside of a medical textbook though by sams account of it i was astonished that he would consider himself lucky dont the jews of montreal understand your limitations they do but theyre impatient with my apostasy properly so it may be he shook his head im not one thing or the other adam theres no suitable faith for people like me i told him not to feel sad and that he was not the only person daunted by the complexities of religion even under the generous rule of the dominion of jesus christ for instance there was no congregation of the church of signs in montreal which meant i couldnt marry calyxa in the faith of my father had i wanted toi confess i did not we had settled on an interdenominational dominion marriage to be performed by the local dominion man who licensed dioceses and collected tithes on behalf of colorado springs we would at least be married in a church albeit a nominally catholic one the church charged fees for its use by those who confess to other faiths and the going rate was steep and it used up much of the money i had saved toward the purchase of a typewriter but calyxa was worth it i thought julian had also made friends in montreal and he used the time before the wedding to take his leave of them these were the philosophers and aesthetes who gathered at the coffeeshop called dorothys julian had not introduced me to any of them and they seemed exactly as looselimbed and pallid as lymon pugh had described them when i saw them from a distance but i was no judge of philosophers at least they did not parade around with unpatriotic signs or get themselves locked up in military prison they were sometimes locked up for other reasons julian said but he changed the subject when i asked him to explain as for me i spent my time with calyxa part of this devotion was practical since there were arrangements to be made and invitations to be delivered but it was an indulgence too for we were at that stage of betrothal in which we craved each others company in all ways and at all hours if we anticipated our vows perhaps the reader can forgive us for our eagerness and ill say no more on the subject except to repeat that it was a very happy time for me of course i wrote to my mother to announce the occasion and to apologize for not being able to bring calyxa to meet her though i assured her i would do my best to make that happen preferably sooner rather than later calyxa had no family except job and utty who had a prior engagementthey were to be hanged on the day of the weddingbut all the parmentierists would be there and the staff of the thirsty boot and assorted street musicians and sundry revolutionaries and my side of the aisle would be full up with survivors of the saguenay campaign and perhaps a few philosophers jews and aesthetes at the invitation of sam and julian in the end it was a wedding like any otherfamiliar enough in its trappings to subdue the need for description in short we were wed we kissed there were cheers refreshments were served a carriage had been hired for our trip to the train station it was not quite a wedding carriage for sam and julian shared the transportation with us all of us had purchased tickets for the new york express which was due to leave montreal at sundown i rode with my arm around calyxa and we cooed at each other and uttered pleasant trivialities while sam and julian blushed or coughed into their hands or made a point of staring out the curtained windows even though the city was dull in the fading light and decorated only with gray banners announcing boil all water or similar hygienic instructions there was one stop calyxa insisted on however before we reached the train station and that was the public square where the army of the laurentians conducted its hangings job and utty had already met their fate at about the time calyxa and i solemnized our vows i suggested she might not want to sully the memory of the day by visiting a gallows but she needed reassurance that her brothers were truly dead she told me and that they wouldnt spring back to life at some inconvenient time in the future so i told the hired driver to stop where the hangings had taken place it was the policy of the army of the laurentians to leave corpses dangling from the gallows until a day or two had passed so the dead would serve as a useful advertisement of the wages of vice and rebellion this custom had been but partially honored in the case of job and utty two ropes dangled from the elaborate scaffold but only one was occupied i asked a bystander about this and the man explained that utty blake had been hanged first but that the scaffold had been built too high or the rope made too long and at the critical moment uttys head had been nipped off as the man put it so that the body no longer depended from the rope but slipped through at the neck and had to be hauled away in two pieces stains on the ground attested to the truth of this but job was still on duty he looked much smaller in death his face was purple and not pleasant to contemplate though i had seen uglier corpses during my military career a chill wind had come up and it flapped the banners adorning the nearest buildings and turned jobs corpse like a pendulum at the end of his mournfully creaking rope ponderous clouds swept through the darkening sky and the mood of the place was altogether dour and unhappy nevertheless calyxa sprang from the wedding carriage energetically and walked right up to the unkempt and frankly foul body of her brother his bootless feet dangled at about the level of her shoulders i let her stand alone on that dusty windy square in contemplation of the ephemerality of life and all worldly things for many long minutes then i joined her and put a consoling arm around her waist as awful as your brothers were i said this must be hard to endure not very hard she whispered say your goodbyes then calyxawe have a train to catch i was moved by her somber expression which implied a soul less hardened than she liked to pretend and i was even more moved when she found the christian charity to utter a quick prayer for the soul of poor dead job passe mon bonjour au diable quand tu le verras then we climbed back into the carriage and i instructed the driver to take us on to the train station the atmosphere had cooled somewhat and there was no more postnuptial cooing instead calyxa attempted to make conversation she didnt know sam or julian very well just yet in a sense she didnt know them at all despite the confidences we shared i had avoided telling her that julian was actually julian comstock the presidents nephew or that sam had been the best friend of julians murdered father i had promised sam and julian that i wouldnt mention these awkward truths and i had been true to my promise but i had told her other things about my friends and my adventures with them she looked squarely at julian and said you like to tell bible stories julian was uncomfortableas he often was in the presence of womenand seemed not to know how to respond he swallowed repeatedly his adams apple bobbing in his throat ah well do i according to adam bible stories of your own invention most of them blasphemous perhaps adam exaggerates tell me one calyxa said as the carriage rattled down the gloomy windy street and a small rain began to fall her gaze drifted to the window of the carriage tell me an easter story if you know one i didnt like the trend of this conversation julians apostasies were often shocking to the uninitiated and i had hoped calyxa would get to know him better before he trained the cannon of his agnosticism on her at close range but julian liked a challenge and i think he was charmed by calyxas boldness and directness he cleared his throat well let me see the overhead lantern teetered on its gimbals rain drummed on the carriageroof and julians breath hung visibly in the chill air god created the world thats starting a long way back calyxa said perhaps it is but do you want to hear this story or not i beg your pardon continue in the beginning god created the world julian said and set it turning and let events transpire without much in the way of personal intervention he stagemanaged a few tribal disputes and arranged a misguided flood that cost many lives and solved very few problems but in the end he decided the human race was too corrupt to be salvaged and too pathetic to destroy and so he stopped tinkering with it and left it alone but humanity on the whole was conscious of its fallen condition and went on petitioning god for unearned gifts or the redress of grievances all this badgering in gods eyes amounted to a lament for lost innocencea nostalgia for the abandoned paradise that was eden make us innocent again humanity cried out or at least send innocence among us to serve as an example god was skeptical you wouldnt recognize innocence if it handed you a calling card he said to humanity and goodness exceeds your grasp with the regularity of clockwork look for these things where you find them and leave me alone but the prayers never ceased and god couldnt indefinitely ignore all that grief and lamentation which lapped at the walls of heaven like a noxious tide all right he said at last ive heard your noise and ill give you what you want so he fathered a child by a virginin fact a married virgin for god was fond of miracles and for a woman to be simultaneously a wife a virgin and a mother seemed like a miracle with compound interest accrued and so in the fullness of time a child was borninnocent bereft of sin invulnerable to temptation and goodhearted down to the very marrow of him make of him what you will god said grimly and stood back with his arms folded i tried to evaluate calyxas reaction to these blasphemies she kept her face motionless but her eyes were attentive and unblinking the rain came down stiffly and the wheels of passing carts made a muted sound in the dusk a quartercentury or so went by julian continued and eventually that child of god was returned to his creatorscorned insulted beaten humiliated and finally nailed to a splintery cross and suspended in the galilean sunshine until he died of his wounds both physical and spiritual god received this muchabused gift by return mail as it were and he was ferociously scornful and said to humanity see what you do with innocence see what you make of love and goodwill when it looks you in the eye and so saying he turned his back on mankind and determined never to speak to the human race again or have any other dealings with it and even this julian said might have been a useful lesson taken as such but man misunderstood his own chastening and imagined that his sins had been forgiven and put up effigies of the tortured demigod and the instrument on which he had been broken and marked the event every easter with a church service and a colorful hat and as god made himself deaf to man so man became deaf to god and our prayers languished in the dead air of our cavernous churches and do so to this day the carriage was silent in the aftermath of this cruel and frankly blasphemous narrative sam sighed and stared out into the rain the vehicles springs creaked as we bounced over wet cobblestones a sound that reminded me of the creaking rope where job blake had been hung julian looked at calyxa boldly if a little apprehensively while she pondered her response thats a fine story she said finally i like that story very muchthank you julian i hope youll tell me another one some day she essayed a smile perhaps ill make up one of my own now that youve shown me how it was julians turn to gawk in astonishment he slowly took the measure of calyxas sincerity then he grinnedperhaps the first genuine grin i had seen on him since the saguenay campaign youre welcome he said then he turned his grin on me you married well adam congratulations oy said sam in the cryptic language of the jews the future defied our expectations the future always does as im sure julian would say theres no predicting evolution he used to say either in the long or the short term still the shock of our arrival in new york city can hardly be overestimated this is what happened our train although an express slowed at every switch yard and the journey lasted all night calyxa and i had a stateroom to ourselves we were awake until the early hours and consequently slept past sunrise we did not see anything of the city of new york until the porter knocked at the door to announce our imminent arrival we dressed quickly and joined sam and julian in the passenger car i was sorry i hadnt arisen earlier for we were already well within the boundary of manhattan i will not detail its wonders herethose will emerge in the later course of the story but i knew something exceptional was going on as soon as we rolled into the columned interior of the great central train station visible through the rainstreaked windows of the passenger car were many bays and depots where trains could embark or dispense passengers and the one we approached was crowded with people in all kinds of colorful dress many of them carrying signs or banners a wooden stage had been erected and a band played patriotic songs the exact details were hard to distinguish through the smudged and grimy glass but the mood of excitement was unmistakable we asked a passing porter what the occasion was but he didnt know someone famous in from the battlefront he said probably someone famous it would be ironic i thought if we had come all this way with general galligasken for a fellow traveler but there was no hint that such was the case we didnt know which passenger was being honored until we stepped out onto the platform then a tickettaker pointed at usat julian specificallyand the band promptly struck up a march dear god sam said paling as he read the signs and banners held aloft by the crowdand i read them too and my expression must have been equally gapjawed welcome the hero of the saguenay campaign said one nyc police firefighters salute the captor of the chinese cannonanother and a third said simply hurray for captain commongold sam trembled as violently as if he had looked at the jubilant crowd and seen in its place a firing squad julian was even more bewildered he opened his mouth and couldnt muster the strength to close it at that moment a whitehaired woman came to the fore of the crowd she was not young nor especially thin but her manner was vigorous and purposeful she was clearly an aristoshe was dressed expensively and gaudily as if she had marched through a milliners shop and a tropical aviary and emerged with bits of both places adhering to her she carried a wreath of flowers on which was laid a paper banner bearing the words women s patriotic union of new york welcomes captain commongold the wreath was so extravagant that her face was all but concealed by it until she lifted it up with the intent of settling it around julians neck then she got a good look at the intended object of all this adoration and froze as if she had been struck by a bullet julian she whispered mother cried julian the wreath dropped to the floor julians mother embraced him the photographers in the crowd grew interested and hoisted their cameras and the reporters took their pencils from behind their ears act three events patriotic and otherwise culminating in independence day keep thy peaceful watchfires burning angels stand at all thy doors washing from thy homes dissension as the oceans wash thy shores a hymn for america i was hastily introduced to julians mother as a friend from the army and calyxa as my wife and then we adjourned at mrs comstocks insistence to a luxurious carriage big enough to contain all five of us a team of fine white horses carried us away from the noise and confusion of the rail station the upholstery of the carriage was lush the city outside was astonishing but i was hardly conscious of any of those things in fact i was in a stricken state i did not yet fully understand the mechanism by which this unwelcome welcome had worked out but i was already convinced that i had upset the plans and perhaps hastened the doom of my friend julian calyxa was even more bewildered by this turn of events for which her experience supplied no antecedent or explanation the carriage might have been silent each of us dwelling on private thoughts and fears but for calyxas periodic demands to be let in on the joke i wish i could oblige you mrs hazzard said julians mother who had succeeded in committing our names to memory despite the chaotic conditions under which we were introduced but im not sure i understand it myself in fact mrs comstock was exhibiting an admirable degree of levelheadedness as i saw it she was a solidlybuilt woman of middle age her coifed brown hair streaked at the temples with white she occupied a central carriageseat julian brooded to her left while sam on her right looked pale and stricken except when he glanced at mrs comstock which action caused a ferocious blush to rise to his cheeks excuse me calyxa said and probably this question violates some etiquette i havent been warned about but who are you exactly emily baines comstock the older woman said gamely julians female parent if you havent inferred that fact already the name comstock comes as a surprise calyxa said casting me a sour glance i immediately confessed that i had deceived her about julians pedigree i apologized but cited my promise to julian and sam i thought you were a western leaseboy adam i am nothing less nothing more i was befriended by julian comstock when he was sent to williams ford to protect him from possible conspiracies comstock calyxa repeated conspiracies julian roused from his brooding silence and said its true calyxa and it isnt adams fault he didnt tell you before now i had hoped to remain a commongold for many more years to come but the pretense is all blown up the presidents my uncle yes and he isnt charitably disposed toward me and now that your identity has been revealed news of the scene at the rail station is bound to circulate quickly the city being what it is and will your uncle try to kill you then mrs comstock stiffened at these blunt words but julian just smiled sadly i expect so he said murderous relatives are a curse nodded calyxa who considered herself knowledgeable in these matters you have my sympathy julian the plush carriage followed a street i would later learn to call broadway then turned aside into a fashionable district of antique houses with stone facades either original or built up from authentic remains i looked about as we dismounted and everything i sawa treelined street gardens blooming with spring flowers glass windows of gemlike clarity etcspoke of aristocracy and ownership and not timidly but boastfully up a flight of stairs into the receptionroom of the great house then where a small army of servants greeted the returning mrs comstock and gaped at her son mrs comstock clapped her hands and said brusquely we have guestsrooms for mr and mrs hazzard and mr godwin please and if julians quarters are not in order they must be brought up to acceptable conditions but only for the night tomorrow we remove to edenvale i looked questioningly at julian who told me in a low voice that edenvale was the familys country estate located up the hudson river some of the servants began to welcome julian personally they seemed to remember him warmly from earlier times and were astonished at his arrival since as i later learned rumors of his death had been circulating freely julian smiled to see these old acquaintances but mrs comstock was impatient and clapped the servants to their chores and we adjourned to an enormous parlor a girl in a white apron brought us iced drinks i supposed this sort of hospitality was common among aristos and i tried to accept it as if i were accustomed to it though such luxury exceeded anything in my experience including what i had seen in the houses of the duncan and crowley families at williams fordrustic retreats by comparison with the excesses and indulgences of manhattan if this was an example calyxa meanwhile regarded it all with a painfully visible skepticism and looked at the servant girl as if she wanted to indoctrinate her into parmentierism a project i hoped she would not undertake i think i understand the outline of the misfortune julian said as we settled into the depths of our prodigiouslyupholstered chairs somehow the story of my experience in the war has been circulated in the city though i dont know how that could have come about i gritted my teeth but said nothing i couldnt until my suspicions were confirmed youve been in the papers mrs comstock acknowledged under your assumed name have i mrs comstock summoned the servant girl again barbara you know i banned cheap journals from the house oh yes said barbara and i know that the ban isnt universally observed please dont deny itwe dont have time go down to the kitchen and see if you can find anything sufficiently degraded on the subject of julian commongold do you know what i mean yes the cook reads them out loud to us barbara said then blushed at the admission and hurried off to find the papers she came back with a weeksold copy of the spark and a crudely bound pamphlet these specimens of urban journalism were passed among us to inspect the spark contained the latest intelligence from the saguenay front including the capture of a chinese cannon this proved to be a truncated account of julians bravery at chicoutimi printed under the byline of theodore dornwood the sparks famous frontline correspondent in the saguenay campaign worse than this was the pamphlet nearly a small book which had been printed as a compilation of mr dornwoods reporting under the title the adventures of captain commongold youthful hero of the saguenay it was selling briskly on all the better streetcorners the servant girl said julian and sam explained to mrs comstock that dornwood was a scoundrel who had debauched himself in montreal all during the campaign and who made up his stories out of rumor and whole cloth but i looked into the pamphlet with careful attention and my humiliation was complete i confessed at oncei could do nothing else its dornwoods signature i said haltingly but the words well the words are mainly my own they say its a pleasant experience for any aspiring writer to see his work set in print for the first time this occasion was an exception to that rule the pamphlets paper cover featured an engraved illustration of julian commongold rendered as an ironjawed youth with a piercing gaze and immaculate uniform astride the fender of a dutch trainengine waving an american flag several times larger than the version he had actually employed for the purpose while a crowd of soldiers cheered at the capture of a supposed chinese cannon the size of an ironmill smokestack apparently artists as well as journalists were expected to err on the side of drama and this one had not stinted in the effort mrs comstock took the pamphlet from me and held it at arms length an expression of distaste playing about her features did you actually do these things julian she asked some less florid version of them she turned to sam and is this your idea of protecting him from harm sam looked stricken but he said julian is a young man with a will of his own emilyi mean mrs comstockand he doesnt always yield to suggestion he could have been killed he nearly wasseveral times if you regard this as a failure on my part i can hardly contradict you he explained the circumstances of our departure from williams ford and our unwilling enlistment in the army of the laurentians i did my best to keep him safe and here he is intact despite his recklessness and minei say no more you may continue to call me emily samwe never stood on ceremony im not unhappy with you only confused and surprised she added you shaved you used to wear an admirable beard i can grow another just as admirable emily please do so she refocused her attention julian did you have to indulge in such theatrics simply because you found yourself in the army i felt as if i did i was performing my duty in my mind but did you have to be so thorough about it and you mr hazzard you claim to have written the words published by this theodore dornwood they were never meant for publication i said blushing down to my hairroots this is as shocking to me as it must be to you dornwood pretended to tutor me in the literary art and i showed him what i imagined were exercises in narrative he said nothing about publishing them much less publishing them under his own name i would have forbidden it of course which of course is why he didnt ask are you really that naive mr hazzard i could not frame an answer to this humiliating question though i saw calyxa nodding vigorously none of this would be a problem sam reminded her if the connection between commongold and comstock hadnt been made what were you doing at the depot emily a favor for the patriotic womens union we often greet returning veterans who distinguish themselves on the field of battle such ceremonies improve morale among civilians and the name comstock lends a certain éclat i wouldnt have reacted the way i did but well a great deal of time has passed since you and julian disappeared from the duncan and crowley estate there was the implication that you might have been killed i didnt adopt that repulsive idea but neither could i completely discount it when i saw julian againwell she dabbed a tear from the corner of her eye wholly understandable sam exclaimed dont blame yourself luck was against us the vulgar papers will be full of this tomorrow and of course hell hear of it the emphatic pronoun referred to president deklan comstockdeklan conqueror as he was also known a grim silence fell over the gathering at least mrs comstock said finally we can put some distance between ourselves and the executive palace edenvale wont protect us but it will make things less convenient for deklan if he decides to act rashly more than that i cannot do but lets not be gloomy my son is home safelythats something to celebrate mr and mrs hazzard will you join us at our estate for the next few days i was humbled by mrs comstocks offer since i had done nothing to deserve her hospitality and everything to deserve her opprobrium i was about to decline when julian answered for me of course adam will come we can hardly set him loose on the streets of the city hed be eaten alive mrs comstock nodded youve been a loyal friend to my son adam hazzard and it would please me if you traveled with us especially if julian can locate some more appropriate clothing for you and your lovely wife consider it settled she clapped her hands again a dozen servants appeared as if from thin air and the household became a whirlwind of preparation for the journey to the countryside calyxa and i spent a night in one of the guest bedrooms of the comstock brownstoneas sybaritic an apartment as i had ever inhabited fitted with a mattress so plush and downy that lying on it was equivalent to lying in it this might have presented unique opportunities for marital intimacy i beg the readers pardonexcept that calyxa was conscious of the movements of servants in the hallway and adjoining rooms which awareness of interfered with her sense of privacy she did note that the bedroom like the other rooms we had seen contained a framed photograph of julians father bryce comstock in a neatlytailored major generals uniform he doesnt much resemble the reigning president she observed at least the face on the coin the resemblance existed but it was entirely structural the high cheekbones the thin lips in that which animates a facethat is to say the spectrum of human emotion apparent even in a photographbryce was the opposite of deklan in fact there was much of julian in him the same brightness of eye and readiness of smile he was the better brother i told calyxa genuinely brave and not inclined to casual assassination he was a hero of the isthmian war before deklan had him hanged heroism is a dangerous profession calyxa observed correctly i slept restlessly and woke as the rest of the household began to stir in the morning the stars were just disappearing and the air was cool as we assembled ourselves and our luggage into another of mrs comstocks capacious carriages and set off with a train of servants for the docks manhattan in a spring dawn i would have been in awe if not for the dangers overhanging us i wont test the readers patience by dwelling on all the wonders that passed my eye that morning but there were brick buildings four and five stories tall painted gaudy colorsamazing in their height but dwarfed by the skeletal steel towers for which the city is famed some of which leaned like tipsy giants where their foundations had been undercut by water there were wide canals on which freight barges and trash scows were drawn by teams of muscular canalside horses there were splendid avenues where wealthy aristos and ragged wage workers crowded together on wooden sidewalks next to fetid alleys strewn with waste and the occasional dead animal there were the combined pungencies of frying food decaying fish and open sewers and all of it was clad in a haze of coal smoke made roseate by the rising sun as we approached the docks i saw the masts and stacks of schooners and steamers bobbing against the sky our company traveled along a wharf until we came to a steam launch the sylvania which belonged to mrs comstock it was a small trim impeccably whitewashed vessel gilded in places and its captain and crew had already brought the boiler up to pressure and were ready to sail before we went on board mrs comstock sent a dockboy to procure copies of the morning spark the boy returned with a bundle of these journals and as soon as we had been assigned staterooms and stored our possessions we gathered in the forecabin to inspect them our worst fears were quickly confirmed the frontpage headline announced commongold a comstock heroic boy captain revealed as nephew of president the byline this time wasnt theodore dornwoods but there were several mentions of his adventures of captain commongold the sales of which would no doubt be redoubled by the news the story itself was a reasonably accurate account of julians arrival in manhattan and the warm greeting he received from his mother not much embroidered with spurious drama most disconcerting was a brief note in the tail of the piece to the effect that the executive palace had been approached for comment but has not yet issued a public statement julian sam and mrs comstock began to discuss the possible ramifications of all this while calyxa and i went to the foredeck in a gloomy mood to distract ourselves with the passing sights manhattan with its skeletal towers and relentless commerce had already fallen behind us but there was evidence of the work of the secular ancients on every shorescavenged ruins as far as the eye could reach a reminder that human beings in inconceivable numbers had swarmed here during the efflorescence of oil what they had left behind was essentially a tip of monumental proportions so expansive that even a century of scavenging had skimmed off only the most accessible deposits of copper steel and antiquities there was testimony to this continuing work on the new jersey shore where rerolling mills and iron foundries vented black smoke into the air we passed beneath two monstrous bridgesone halffallen and choked with goosegrass one still in repair and busy with industrial trafficwhile the river itself was alive with barges steamers and those oddlyrigged little boats called dahabees which the numerous egyptian immigrants liked to sail calyxa had dressed herself under mrs comstocks tutelage in the blouse and skirt of a modest aristo she wore the clothes unwillingly but they were becoming to her although she picked at the belt that cinched her waist as if it were some medieval implement of torture this is not exactly how i expected to spend my honeymoon she remarked i began to apologize but she waved it off its all very interesting adam if slightly terrifying is julian really in mortal danger almost certainly his father was killed by deklan conqueror as punishment for achieving exactly the sort of notoriety julian has just acquired there are limits to what even a president can do of coursethe contending forces of the army and the dominion are practical constraints sam saysbut deklan is devious and may bide his time until some scheme occurs to him is there anything we can do to help in strategizing nothats best left to the aristos who understand how these things work in practical matters julian knows he can count on us much of the blame of course lies with this theodore dornwood if theres any justice hell be made to pay for his thievery and lies is there though any justice i mean i took this as a practical rather than a philosophical question there will be if i can help it you mean you intend to punish him yourself yes i said and meant it though i hadnt given the prospect much thought perhaps deklan comstock couldnt be brought to justice unless at the final judgment but theodore dornwood was no aristo and he didnt live in a walled palace and it might be within my power to extract some sort of payment from him i vowed that i would do so sooner or later any outdoor game or sport julian said to be a sport ought to have three essential qualities it should be difficult it should be impractical and it should be slightly silly his father had taught him that interesting truth he said it was our second week at edenvale there had been no word or signal from deklan comstock and the furor in the press had begun to die down for lack of supplemental fuel perhaps that engendered a premature sense of security among us certainly edenvale was a soothing locality i had never summered at an aristos country estate unless you count tending stable for the duncans and the crowleys and i was appalled and seduced by the luxury and laziness of it edenvales properties were not cultivated but kept in the wild condition trails were maintained for scenic strolling or riding and the vast acreage of wilderness invited hunting and exploration edenvale house itself sat on an immaculatelytailored lawn bordered with flower gardens during pleasant weather we took breakfast outdoors the meal catered to us by servants while we sat at dainty whitewashed tables on rainy days calyxa and i explored the seemingly endless rooms of the house or perched in its library which was stocked with nineteenthcentury classics and dominionapproved novels of light romance in the evenings sam broke out a deck of cards and we pursued the diversions of euchre or red rose until bedtime or we adjourned to the music room where mrs comstock was teaching herself to play las ojos criollos on the piano she played earnestly but haltingly and calyxa and i often excused ourselves from these sessions sam on the other hand was made rapturous by her performances and claimed he could listen to her all night without tiring though even he seemed grateful when she moved on to such simpler compositions as ladies of cairo or where the sauquoit meets the mohawk in palmier days julian explained the house might have been crowded with visiting aristos and owners and senators and such but the hanging of bryce comstock had cast a shadow over the family and mrs comstock had been shut out from the elite social circuit since then her companions had been drawn from the manhattan show business crowd or from the lower ranks of rising wealth and edenvale was not the social magnet it once had been after two weeks these small entertainments began to pall and julian proposed taking me on a tour of the wilder parts of the estatethe estate as he had known it as a child before he was sent to williams ford i readily agreed and we set out from the house on a sunny cool morning julian carried an unusual piece of luggage with him a canvas bag narrow and about three feet long i asked him about it and that was when he quoted his fathers remark about the nature of sport is it sporting equipment of some kind then yes but ill keep the nature of it to myself for nowi think youll be pleasantly surprised we had dressed in clothes not much grander than what we had worn in williams ford when we hunted squirrels in the forest and this was a relief after the complex and constraining aristo fashions into which we had recently been belted and braced a breeze turned the leaves of the ailanthus and the birch trees as we walked beneath their overarching branches and it was as if we had become young again for a few hours at least in williams ford such expeditions always put julian in a philosophical mood that hadnt changed we paused in a grove of cork trees to refresh ourselves from the canteens we had packed and julian said this is where i learned to love the past adamas a boy this was my private tip more trees than treasure as far as i can tell so it was meant to be but all this forest has grown up over layers of scuttle from the days of the secular ancients dig anywhere and youre bound to unearth an old spoon or button or bone over that wayhe pointed at a hillside lush with birch and blackberryover that way there are foundations cut into the slope and the remains of tumbledown houses do you know what i found there as a boy beetles spiders poison ivy all those but more importantlybooks you loved books so early did you even when i didnt know what they meant the books i found were mostly foul and waterdamaged but here and there a readable page was preserved i didnt just read those fragments adam i nearly memorized them it was a peculiar delicious feeling just to hold them in my handas if id found a way to eavesdrop on a conversation that faded into the air a hundred years ago what sort of books were they he shrugged novels mostly stories of intimate relations or murder or fantasies of flying to the stars or traveling in time not dominionapproved of course no and therein lay half the pleasure the fruit was forbidden but it was sweet even when it surpassed my understanding what it told me was that the history the dominion teaches is partial at best the dominions truth is built on a cracked foundation and buried in the cracks are things of immense interest and great beauty dangerous things i said though i was intrigued by the idea of stories about traveling in time and other such abominations truth is a perilous commodity julian admitted but so is ignorance adammore so are we going to see those ruined buildings then everything valuable i took away from them long ago no julian said today were going fishing so saying he led me another halfmile through a stand of birch and ailanthus to a lakea glassflat blue oval in the woods its banks choked with goosegrass and purple loosestrife julian began to unroll his bundle which i assumed would contain the rods and reels necessary for flyfishing but it did not we fished from kites instead the kitesa pair of themwere of a design i hadnt seen before a wedge of silk with stubby wings and a vent in the lower quadrant supported by three parallel sticks of supple lathing the kite thus conformed was not rigid but was what julian called a parafoil when lofted into the wind it opened like a sail and was very stable in the air and did not dip and bob like the crude kites i had made as a child or fly upsidedown or plummet to the earth without warning julian sent his kite aloft first to give me the idea though the business wasnt complicated left to itself the kite was stable enough that it hung in the sky as if riveted there by the gentle breeze by tugging the string or running the reel julian could make the kite rise or descend or travel left and right according to his will but that wasnt the end of the story attached to the bridle of each kite was a second string which carried a cork float and a hook with a tied fly thus kitefishing the kite carried the bait farther from shore than even an expert flyfisher could have cast it and fish grew plentifully in those deep and undisturbed waters i told julian the invention was ingenious but i wasnt absolutely certain the fish would cooperate in this novel means of persuading them to undertake the journey from their watery home to the frying pan he nodded and smiled youre right of course which is as it should be remember my fathers maxim a sport to be a sport must be difficult impractical and slightly silly i guess this qualifies on all counts then but youre enjoying yourself arent you he stretched out on the mossy bank of the pond his spine braced against a tree trunk and the kite reel cradled in his lap clouds of midges circled lazily over the sunlit lake while a turtle sunned itself on a nearby rock which is the entire purpose of a sport these kites are unusual where did you learn how to make them from an antique bookwhere else did the secular ancients really bother about such trivial things as kites astonishing as it may seem adam the secular ancients didnt spend all their time fornicating outside of wedlock afflicting the faithful marrying individuals of the same sex or terrorizing schoolchildren with the theory of evolution they had their innocent amusements just as we do they were people that is as human as julian or ia commonplace truth but one that slips too easily from the mind they seem to have been very powerful and very smart about kites and engines and such things its a surprise to me that they declined so rapidly during the false tribulation the false tribulationso called and what an impudence on the part of the dominion to name a disaster after their own misinterpretation of itwasnt one event but many the end of oil or more precisely the end of cheaply acquired oil crippled the ancients topheavy economic regime but there were similar crises involving water and arable land wars for essential resources expanded while machine agriculture became more expensive and finally impractical hunger stressed national economies to the breaking point and disease and plague overcame all the hygienic barriers the ancients had erected against them cities that couldnt support their own populations were inundated by starving peasants and eventually looted by angry mobs with the fall of the cities came the establishment of the first rural estates and the sale of ablebodied men into indenture all of this was complicated by the plague of infertility that reduced the worlds population so drastically and from which were only now recovering and so the ancients were punished for their arrogance i knowive read the histories julian its an old sermon punished for the crime of attempted prosperity punished for the crime of free intellectual inquiry or so the dominion would have us believe perhaps the dominion histories exaggerate but surely the secular ancients werent entirely innocent of course they werent who is the ancients suffered under an economic system that resembled nothing so much as a complex elaboration of private langerss lucky mug they were beset by greedy aristocrats belligerent dictators and ignorant religionists as are we if you havent noticed but arent we making progress of our own our cities are larger and busier than they have been since the efflorescence of oil yes and it might be that were on the cusp of a change in our traditional arrangements the workers are discontentedeven some of the indentured are learning to read and to express their grievances the dominion still keeps a tight grip in the west but fights to stifle the unaffiliated churches in the east in politics the presidency confronts an increasingly restive senate peopled by newmoney owners who distrust the old order or want a bigger piece of it the army of the laurentians and the army of the californias function as independent powers only nominally under the control of the executive and so on the entire system wobbles on its axis adam all it needs is a push in the right direction and it would collapse would that be a good thing increasingly i think it would people would suffer though he waved his hand dismissively dont people always suffer suffering is unavoidable perhaps he was right about that but his nonchalance frightened me sam had once accused julian of behaving like a comstock in a sense not complimentary to him this was something worse it seemed to me now he was thinking like a president for the rest of the afternoon we set aside political philosophy and attended strictly to fishing the day was as sweet as the sight of two kites bobbing over a sunny blue lake could make it and if the dividends were unimpressivejulian snagged a single fish i did not snag anywe wouldnt starve for our failures it was a day that as boys we would have enjoyed wholeheartedly but we werent boys and the pleasant illusion was impossible to sustain eventually the sun approached the hilltops of the hudson highlands the air grew calm the long light silvered the leaves of the birches and we packed up our kites and catch and started back to the country house edenvale was melancholy in the gloaming whether or not it was ever an eden just now it seemed more like eden after the fall untenanted possibly haunted i found myself wondering whether julian had disturbed the dead with his loose talk and i pictured our indignant ancestors emerging from their wormy basements all charged up with electricity and atheism despite the absurdity of the idea i was grateful when we passed out of the shadows of the forest and onto the wide lawn of the estate lamplight soft as butter seeped from the windows of the country house a welcome sight there was also the faint and reassuring sound of music we reached the house and entered the back hall quietly so as not to make a disturbance then followed the sound to the parlor where mrs comstock sat at the piano striking the familiar chords of where the sauquoit meets the mohawk sam gazed at her as if lost in admiration while calyxa her coiled hair shimmering in the lamplight stood with clasped hands singing though the years have fled since we were wed where the sauquoit meets the mohawk still the fields are green down in between where the sauquoit meets the mohawk etc etc sentimental though the song undeniably wasit had been popular in mrs comstocks youthits virtue was its melody which clambered up and down a minor scale as if in sympathy with human hope and mortal resignation calyxa seemed to know this and she gave the melody an appropriate voice so that the song became a wholehearted lament sweet as summer love reconsidered in an autumn dusk it made me think of the fallen condition of edenvale and of all the losses mrs comstock had suffered since the death of her husband and of the threat that hung over her son calyxa performed the song in its entirety mrs comstock banged out the final chords of the last chorus and sat away from the piano drained but calyxa to the astonishment of us all carried on for another two verses without accompaniment her fine voice expanded into the dusky stillness singing in a tender year you kissed me here two hearts joined in one beating but lovers met may suffer yet and love like time is fleeting but if your heart from mine must part where the sauquoit meets the mohawk still the rolling sea keeps the memory of the sauquoit and the mohawk long moments passed after the last syllable faded into the air mrs comstock obviously moved wiped her eyes when she had controlled her emotions she gave calyxa a curious look those verse arent in the songsheet she said calyxa nodded and seemed embarrassed no im sorryi added them myselfimpulsively the lyrics are your own its a trick i picked up singing in taverns make up a fresh verse surprise the audience you invented these lyrics beforehand or on the fly they were an improvisation she admitted what a remarkable talent im increasingly impressed with you calyxa likewise mrs comstock calyxa said she very nearly blushedsomething i had seldom seen her do then mrs comstock cleared her throat in any event the men are back from the woods julian adam please sit down weve had a communication from the executive palace and i need to tell you about it julian whitened in so far as his naturally pale complexion made that possible we did as we were told and seated ourselves well julian asked which is ita death sentence or a reprieve mrs comstock was somber but didnt seem unduly alarmed perhaps a little of both weve been invited to the independence day celebration on the palace grounds deklan sent a note claiming he wants to honor the heroism of captain commongold now that the captain is revealed as his nephew my notoriety protects me julian said in a sneering tone at least until the fourth i doubt hell make an attempt on your life before that date in any case and he can hardly slaughter you at the height of the celebration in the meantime you should issue a statement to the newspapers acknowledging your patrimony and giving credit for your achievements to the comstock bloodline and abase myself before that butcher shall i defile my fathers grave while im at it mrs comstock flinched sam said harshly these are measures to protect your life julian for what its worth its worth a great deal mrs comstock said tartly to me julian if not to you julian accepted his mothers rebuke and his expression softened very well we have a few weeks until independence day in any case and if im to live that long i want to live as a human being and not a fugitive what do you mean i mean that tomorrow im going back to manhattan our nervous idyll had ended we went aboard the sylvania the next day a storm had blown up overnight and the morning was a cool and rainy one i spent some time in the sylvanias pi lot house satisfying my curiosity about the principles and techniques of steam navigation then i went to the warmer cabin below where julian was sitting with a book in his lap the future is on my mind i said should we prove lucky enough to have one you mean dont joke julian i know the risks we face but im a married mani have obligations and i need a plan of my own calyxa and i cant impose on your hospitality forever when we reach manhattan i mean to find myself a jobanything short of the meatpacking industry i had taken to heart lymon pughs many sermons on that subjectand then locate a place where calyxa and i can live on our own well the thought is nobly intended but dont you think you should wait until after independence day you can certainly stay with us until then youre no burden on the household believe me thank you julian but why wait i might miss an opportunity or undertake an engagement you wont be able to keep adam perhaps my mother wasnt sufficiently explicit about deklan comstocks invitation when she said we were invited to the executive palace the pronoun included you what and calyxa as well i was appalled and not a little weak about the knees hows that possible what does the president want with me for that matter how could he know anything about me at all the presidents men no doubt bribe or threaten the household servants walls are transparent to them your name and calyxas were explicitly mentioned in the invitation julian im just a leaseboyi dont know how to behave in the company of a president much less a murderous one probably he wont have you killed but he must have learned that you were the true chronicler of my socalled adventures and i suppose he wants to have a look at you as for your behavior he shrugged be yourself you have nothing to gain by posing and nothing to lose by revealing your origins if the president wants to mock me for associating with leaseboys and tavern singers let him do so this was not a pleasing prospect but i bit my lip and said nothing meanwhile julian said i owe you a favor surely you dont i do though you befriended me in williams ford and showed me all you knew about that estate and how to hunt it and youve shown me edenvale edenvale is nothing manhattan adam my town is manhattan and i want to instruct you in the perils and the pleasures of it before you begin life as a working man perhaps this was meant as a distraction but i was willing to abandon myself to it considering how perilous our existence seemed to have become maybe i can learn some of the ways of the aristos before im thrust into their company at the presidential palace thats right and the first lesson is not to use the word aristos aristocrats then nor even that among ourselves were the eupatridian community a label big enough to strangle a man i thought but i practiced it dutifully and after a while it ceased to stick in the throat the reader if not versed in recent history may be anxious to discover whether or not julian and i were killed on independence day i do not mean to protract the answer to that important question but the events of the fourth will make more sense once i have described some of what happened prior to that date it was a nervous time for calyxa and me though we were newlyweds and tempted to believe in our own immortality president comstock was hardly concerned with us calyxa said and in any event we were not locked up in the fine rooms of the aristocracy we could pack up our belongings at any time and travel to boston or buffalo and live there anonymously beyond the reach of any maddened chief executive i would write books under an assumed name in this scenario and calyxa would sing in respectable cafés we went so far as to price railway tickets and scrutinize timetables though i was distressed at the prospect of abandoning julian to his fate its his own fate calyxa said and he could shed himself of it if he chose to he ran away oncecant he run away again ask him to come with us but when i proposed this option to julian he shook his head no adam thats no longer possible it was a miracle that i escaped from williams ford here im under much closer scrutiny what scrutiny i dont see it new york city is a big localitybig enough to get lost in it seems to me my uncle has eyes everywhere if i so much as packed a bag hed hear of it this house is watched though very discreetly if i go for a walk the presidents men arent far behind if i drink to excess in some broadway tavern a report will find its way to deklan conqueror and are calyxa and i also under this observation probably but the surveillance isnt so strict he cast a glance to make sure no servant could overhear us if you want to escape youre well advised to do so i wont stop you or blame you but it must be a clean escape or else the presidents men will haul you back and use you against me to be honest given your trivial position in deklans eyes you might be safer here than elsewhere but the decision is yours of course he added im sorry you find yourself mixed up in it adam i never meant for it to be so and ill do anything i can to help so calyxa and i went on studying our railroad timetables and made airy plans but failed to pursue them we continued living in the brownstone house as the days and weeks passed mrs comstock kept on with her charitable work and held occasional gatherings of the manhattan artistic circle events which julian enjoyed very much sam was often absent during this time pursuing contacts in the upper echelons of the militaryfor he was no longer sam samson but sam godwin once again restored to his reputation as a veteran of the isthmian war and i imagined he was performing his own kind of intelligencegathering with the aim of discovering the presidents ultimate intentions there was no such useful work for me but i spent many pleasant hours with calyxa as we adjusted to wedded life calyxa in her own way was as philosophicallyinclined as julian and liked to discuss the flaws and shortcoming of the system of aristocracy of which she disapproved when that palled we took walks around the city she enjoyed exploring the shops and restaurants on broadway or fifth avenue and on fine days we ventured as far as the great stone walls of the presidential palace grounds the grounds of the executive palace had once been a great park according to julian and open to the public but that had changed when the federal government moved north from washington the walls were immensely tall and thick and made of granite fragments salvaged from city ruins the huge broadway gate at th street with its stone and steel guardhouse was a work of architecture nearly as impressive as the montreal cathedral where i had first spied calyxa in her surplice and twice as monolithic i couldnt imagine what lay within those moated and forbidding walls though i was destined to find out the month of june was unusually fine and sunny and we took such walks often to avoid monotony we varied our route and we were returning from broadway by way of hudson street when we passed a manhattan bookstore the sunlight fell aslant through the window glass revealing the illustrated cover of a book by mr charles curtis eastona volume i hadnt seen before called american sailors afloat needless to say i hurried inside i had never been in a bookstore before all the books i had read had been borrowed from the estate library at williams ford or in the case of a history of mankind in space dug moldering from ancient tips of course i had known such stores existed and that manhattan must include more than a few of them but i had not gathered up the courage to seek one out i suppose i had imagined a bookstore to be an intimidating place as airy and marblepillared as a greek temple this store was not such a sacral establishment grogans books music and cheap publications was the name of it and it was no more or less grand than the shoe store to the left of it or the vaccination shop to the right even the smell of the air inside the shop was inviting a perfume of paper and ink the books on sale were many and various and all unfamiliar to me but i made my way by some instinct to the section where mr eastons novels were on displaya great plethora of them fresh and bright in their stamped and colored boards close your mouth calyxa said or youll begin to drool this must be near everything mr easton has published i hope it is he seems to have written far too many books already i had been hoarding my back pay from the army of the laurentians grudging every expensethe hope of one day owning a typewriter was still at the back of my mindbut i could not resist buying a volume or two four actuallyof mr eastons recent work calyxa browsed among the sheet music while i counted out comstock dollars to the cashier when we left the store calyxa lingered a few moments in front of the vaccination shop next door calyxa for all her contempt of the aristocracy was not immune to certain aspects of manhattan fashion the window of the vaccination shop advertised a newlyarrived yellow fever serum popular with the sort of stylish young city women who sport vaccination scars as if they were jewelry a single dose of this serum cost more than a dozen novels however and julian had already warned us against such shops which tended to dispense more diseases than they ever prevented in any case my attention was absorbed by the prospect of new easton books to read i confessed to calyxa as we walked home how inspiring mr eastons work had been to me and how it had formed my ambition to become a professional writer and how distant that prospect now seemed nonsense calyxa said adam you are a professional writer not professionalnot even published youve written a popular pamphlet already the adventures of captain commongold was on sale in grogans if you didnt notice selling briskly it appeared to me that abomination the piece that imperiled julians life horribly mangled by theodore dornwood on top of it all he murdered half my commas and misplaced the rest punctuation aside its your work and professional enough that a surprising number of literate manhattanites are willing to part with a dollar and fifty cents to read it that was true though i had not thought of it in such a light my indignation at mr dornwood was rekindled i escorted calyxa to the brownstone house of mrs comstock and said no more about the question though i privately determined to visit the offices of the spark and express my grievances there i would have preferred to spend that evening reading for the books i had bought were a novelty to me and i could not help admiring the crisp pages and unsmudged letters of the freshlypurchased volumes and the clean white string that bound the signatures snugly together but julian insisted on taking calyxa and me to see a moviean invitation that was difficult to resist after everything julian had said about movies back in williams ford we rode a taxi to the broadway theater where julian had reserved our seats and we mingled in the lobby with a crowd of welldressed eupatridians of both sexes it was clear even before we entered the auditorium that this would be a performance infinitely grander than the recruiting film i had seen in the dominion hall in williams ford the movie to be shown here which was called eulas choice was advertised with colorful lobby posters which portrayed a female in antiquated dress and a man with a pistol also a horse and an american flag julian explained that eulas choice was a patriotic story its debut timed to coincide with the independence season he didnt expect much in the way of refined drama he said but the movie had been produced by a local crew known for its extravagant camerawork and lavish stage effects it ought to be a fine spectacle he said if nothing else calyxa was illatease among the haughty eupatridians and she seemed relieved when a team of ushers appeared to shoo us into the auditorium where we took our assigned seats all the money that changes hands here she said could feed a thousand orphans orphans were a common sight on manhattan streets where they begged for coins in ingenious and aggressive ways there was also a generous supply of limbless veterans their competition thats not the way to think of it julian reproved her by that reasoning there would be no art at all nor philosophy nor books this is an independent theater not a eupatridian institution the profits pay the salaries of working actors and singers who would otherwise go hungry singers as well as actors in that case i withdraw the remark the entire theater was powered by an inhouse dynamo which thrummed from the basement like a snoring leviathan the lights were electric and they dimmed in unison as the orchestraa full brass band with stringsstruck up the overture the curtain rose revealing a huge white screen and the veiled booths in which the voiceactors and sound effects persons worked as soon as the darkness was complete the beam of the projector threw an ornate title on the screen the new york stage and screen alliance presents eulas choice a musical story of antiquity accompanied by the dominion stamp of approval this ought to be rich remarked calyxa who had seen movies under less elaborate circumstances in montreal but julian shushed her and the music swelled and subsided as the story began i wont describe my astonishmentthe reader can take it for granted i will say that for once julians pride in eastern culture seemed justified and wholly excusable this was art i thought and on a grand scale the story took place at some unspecified time during the fall of the cities the main characters were boone the beleaguered pastor of an urban church eula his fiancé and foster a thrifty industrialist the show was divided into three acts itemized in a program book the ushers had distributed each act featured three songs or arias there was no singing at first howeveronly spectacle as the audience was treated to flickering scenes of a city of the secular ancients in the last stage of its decline we saw many impossibly tall buildings artfully constructed of paper and wood but fully real to the eye we saw streets crowded with business men atheists harlots and automobiles the automobiles were perhaps a less successful artistic effect as they seemed unusually onedimensional and bobbed unconvincingly as they moved but the dedicated crew of soundmakers compensated for this with engine noises created by a baritone growling into a speakingtube how these automobiles had survived so long into the end of oil was a question the filmmakers did not address boone and eula appeared working together in boones small pious church and bantering in a way that suggested their approaching nuptials but they were interrupted by a troop of secular policemen who barged in and accused boone of speaking such forbidden words as faith and heaven these thugs led boone away to prison while eula wept piteously boone as he was dragged through the street in chains sang the first song which according to the program was aria the hand of god not gentle the filmed actor was expressive and he was voiced by a masculine tenor who lent fire and discipline to the lyrics the hand of god not gentle but just descends upon the wicked by and by and so forth if the secular policemen by this brutish behavior had earned themselves a place in hell their city was already halfway there we witnessed a montage of strikes rioting and fires the tall buildings beginning to burn as if they had been built of kindling now the audience was introduced to foster the industrialist who labored mightily to subdue a fire in his iron mill which had been set ablaze by unruly workers but he was forced back by the heat and fallen timbers against this backdrop of destruction foster wiped his sooty brow and sang in resignation the aria gone all that i have built all this was sorrowful enough to melt the hardest cynics heart but it wasnt finished eula appeared once more she had left the scene of boones cruel arrest only to find her family home engulfed in flame and her mother and father crying out from a window from which they could not be rescued the flames consumed them overwhelmed with grief eula stumbled on to the jail where she believed boone had been taken but that building too had burned to the ground several of the eupatridian ladies in the audience were moved by this tragic scene and they dabbed their eyes and blew their noses in a manner that distracted from eulas excellently performed aria lost and alone among the ruins which was the conclusion of act i the lights came up for an intermission many of the eupatridians adjourned at once to the lobby but calyxa and julian and i were young and staunch of bladder and we kept our seats images from the film were still vivid in my minds eye and i began to think about the lost wonders of the secular ancients i said to julian the secular ancients made movies didnt theyyou told me so i think movies too numerous to count though none survive unless theyve been locked away in the dominion archives the dominions cultural committee kept a large stone building in new york city julian explained where it preserved antique texts and documents and other items too blasphemous to be seen by the public no one outside the licensed clergy knew what treasures it contained and their movies had recorded sound and color photography they did then why cant we have such movies or at least a larger number of the ones we do make i dont understand it julian the simpler technologies of the past are no mystery to us we may not have bountiful supplies of oil but we can burn coal to much the same effect we could make movies with recorded sound julian said but the resources havent been allotted that way the same is true of that typewriter by which theodore dornwood seduced your services we could build a typewriter for every human being in manhattan if we liked but it would be a reckless expenditure of iron or rubber or whatever they make typewriters out ofmaterials the senate assigns to eupatridian manufacturers who in turn supply the military with weapons and other necessities i had not thought of it in those terms i supposed every trench sweeper in labrador could be considered a typewriter not manufactured or a movie not produced a painful bargain but what patriot could disagree with it an artist julian said or a small manufacturer or shopkeeper has to make do with whatever resources trickle down as surplus from above or with secondpickings from some local tip the justice of this is debatable of course he turned to calyxa what do you think of the film so far as drama she rolled her eyes scornfully and the songsexcuse me the arias are simpleminded the female singer is good though a little flat in the upper registers but bold and fluent overall i politely disagreed with her about the quality of the drama but what she said about the music amounted to high praise for calyxa dispensed her approval grudgingly at the best of times now the audience filed back into the auditorium and the lights were extinguished for act ii the production resumed with yet another spectacle hundreds of ragged men and women fleeing the fall of the cities set to a mournful trumpet eulogy and the rhythm of tramping feet among these individuals was the convicted pastor boone who unknown to eula had escaped ahead of the flames in one touching scene he came across his former captors the brutal secular policemen now starving and suffering from burns and despite their sins against him he helped them renounce their apostasy and led them to redemption in the moment of their deaths rising tearstreaked from this sacred task boone spotted a distant banner of the cross among the plodding refugees he recognized it as a symbol of the nascent dominion of jesus christ on eartha union of all the persecuted churchesand he marked the event by singing his aria in the wilderness a flag eula unknown to boone was part of the same mass of vagrant urbanites when hunger threatened to overcome her she was forced to beg help from foster the former industrialist foster traveling in a wagon explained that he was aiming to reach a certain rural plantation he owned his behavior toward eula was impeccably kind and chaste and although she still loved boone she believed the pastor had been killed in the fire so she accepted fosters gifts with a relatively free heart eulas plaintive secondact song accompanied by piano rather than full orchestra was aria i will take this offered hand then foster and eulagrowing ever closertraveled in fosters horsedrawn wagon through a montage of scenes of the degraded world of the false tribulation there were ruined houses dustblown farms starved cattle fallen airplanes rusted automobiles and so forth eventually and after arduous adventures they came to a hilltop town not far from the rural property foster owned this town had survived the fall of the cities intact and was protected by the steadfast christianity of its population the inhabitants had erected a huge symbol of their faith at the highest point of land prompting fosters aria what shines on that far hill a cross the act concluded with eulas astonished glimpse of one of the many clerics who had assembled in this virtuous town to join in the work of defending its piety none other than boone her former intended husband the curtain closed on this breathless discovery this time the three of us adjourned to the lobby during the intermission while attending to human necessity i discovered yet another of the unanticipated luxuries of the eupatridian class indoor plumbing so immaculate that the enameled receptacles for gentlemen gleamed as if freshly polished and were scented with lemon amazing what subtle easements human ingenuity can contrive i made my way back to my seat in time for act iii act iii was that portion of the movie in which a choice prominent in the title was set before poor eula that would provide great opportunities for the actresses portraying her both voice and on film to exert themselves but first we saw foster facing a dilemma of his own his plantation not far from the pious town where he and eula had taken refuge was in a shambles the wheat crop had been trampled by hungry refugees and what remained could not be harvested for lack of help meanwhile refugees crowded into town on a daily basis hoping to be fed clearly the solution was to use landless vagrants as fieldhandsbut he couldnt hire any in the classic sense because he had no money with which to pay them in any case farm work which guaranteed a daily meal was so desirable that the mob would have fought for it therefore foster worked out an ingenious solution aria all that may be sold generosity may buy he sang accepting pledges of lifelong indenture from men willing to forego daily wages a pledge alone secures the deed your labors mine while i fulfill your need etc if there was any haggling over this bargain the film did not depict it to enforce the arrangement and to make a success of it he required the assistance of the clergy in general and pastor boone in particular thus eula was treated to the sight of her contending suitors united in the creation of that new and more pious america which would grow from the ruins of the old foster was ignorant of boones prior relation to eula but boone was introduced to eula at a social gathering and recognized her at once quickly discerning the nature of her intimacy with foster boone pretended ignorance though only an idiot could have misinterpreted his facial grimaces which the screen actor portrayed in a broad mannerand eula played along this culminated in a walk by boone through a moonlit meadow where he performed his melancholy aria i give to god that which the earth denies renouncing terrestrial love in favor of the more dependable heavenly variety eula listening from a place among the trees wept almost as copiously as the ladies in the theater the ladies were not pleased with certain broadway sophisticates also present whose cries of thats rightkeep single if you can help it were quickly suppressed foster proposed to her in a scene of the following day eula did not accept his proposal at once but went to see boone for advice she approached him as a penitent to a pastorneither of them acknowledging their prior acquaintance though both were painfully conscious of itand told him the story of everything that had happened to her since the fall of the cities culminating in fosters proposal she had seen her former betrothed she said whom she had believed dead and she still loved him authentically but she loved foster as well and her mind was all in a confusion boone overcome with feeling eventually spoke many things have changed since the end of the old world he said the voice actor giving this speech all the quirks and quavers of suppressed emotion while synchronizing his words precisely with the vocal movements of the actor on the screen were embarked on a new relationship with the sacred its the twilight of an old way of life and the dawn of a new vows from prior times are not broken but annulled your marriage if you make it will surely be blesseda long choked pausedespite despite what came before eula turned her brimming eyes to his thank you pastor she said and if she said anything else it was drowned out by the sniffling in the audience eulas return to foster was bittersweet she accepted his attentions with an aria i pledge to thee followed by scenes of a spectacular wedding with many poignant glances cast between eula and the noble pastor and at last a lengthy ensemblemedleythe hand of god not gentlewhat shines on that far hilli pledge to thee the cast being joined by a chorus with much ringing of bells and exclamations by the trumpet section and a triumphant final refrain over a distant image of that christian town its wheatfields plowed by contented indentured folk and the sixty stars and thirteen stripes waving optimistically over it all an error of history since the northern states had not yet been acquired at the time of the fall of the cities but forgivable in the name of art and patriotism there was protracted applause as the curtain fell i applauded at least as vigorously as anyone elseperhaps more so i had not known that the cinematic illusion could exist on such an exalted scale sustained by the painstaking efforts of so many skilled performers working in close concert it was as much a revelation to me as the plumbing in the gentlemens room we followed the crowd outside the movie had generated in my mind a sort of patriotic glow which was compounded by the glow of the city it was the last quarter of the nightly fourhour illumination of manhattan and artificial lights glittered along broadway like legions of fireflies all in harness even the skeletal remains of the antique skyscrapers seemed infused with an electric liveliness coaches and taxis passed in great profusion and scarlet banners of the cross draped from eaves and lintels in anticipation of independence day fluttered in the pleasant breeze i told julian how impressed i was and asked him to forgive me for doubting all his boasts about new york city and the movies yes it was a tolerably good show he said a very pleasant evening out all in all tolerably good are there better ive seen a few that topped it good calyxa asked skeptically and you notorious for your agnosticism pretty as it might be isnt eula an insult to your profoundest beliefs thank you for asking julian said but no i dont feel particularly insulted by it if i am an agnostic calyxa its because im also a realist there was no realism in the film that i could discernjust a simpleminded version of what they print in the dominion readers well yesconsidered as history it was feeble and propagandisticbut it could hardly be anything else you saw the dominion stamp at the beginning of it no filmmaker can proceed without submitting his script to the dominions cultural committees realistically these matters are exempted from art since theyre beyond the artists control but in structure pacing dialogue photography harmony between the screen and the voice performanceseverything over which the filmmakers did exercise a shaping influenceit was above reproach above reproach then calyxa said in everything except what matters do you mean to say the singing didnt matter well the singing was fine admittedly and the singers didnt write the script my point exactly so it was a beautiful stupid thing wouldnt it be even more beautiful if it were slightly less stupid i dont disagree i would love to make a movie that wasnt just beautiful but also thoughtful and true ive thought about it often but the world isnt rigged to allow such a thing i doubt anyone on earth has the power to overrule the dominion in these matters except possibly the president himself then julian as if startled by his own thought blinked and smiled of course thats not something we can expect of deklan comstock no calyxa said searching his face no certainly not of deklan comstock come morning i let calyxa sleep late and took myself off to visit the publisher of the spark and of the adventures of captain commongold youthful hero of the saguenay i was equipped with nothing more lethal than my smoldering indignation fueled by the scenes of courage and sacrifice i had witnessed in the movie the night before i would confront the thieves i thought and the selfevident justice of my case would cause them to crumble before me i dont know why i expected such extravagant results from the application of mere justice that kind of calculation is seldom borne out by worldly events my first trial was in finding the office i wanted i had no trouble locating the building in which the spark was published since its address was printed in every issue it turned out to be a vast stonepile near the lexington canal most of its huge space was devoted to printing binding warehousing and distributing the companys papers and pamphlets however and i was reduced to asking my way of a grimy pressoperator who told me oh you want editorial editorial was a suite of rooms at the top of a flight of stairs on the fourth floor all the heat of the building and it was a warm june day had collected in that airless warren and so had the smells of ink and solvent and machine oil i did not know precisely to whom i ought to speak but further inquiries led me to the door of the editor and publisher a man named john hungerford apparently mr hungerford wasnt accustomed to meeting visitors who hadnt scheduled appointments but i was firm in my entreaties to his secretary and eventually i was allowed into his office hungerford sat behind an oaken desk in one of the few rooms on the floor that possessed an open window though it looked out on a brick wall he was a man of fifty years or thereabout stern and peremptory in his manner he asked without preamble what i wanted from him i said i was a writer i had hardly pronounced that word when he interrupted me i cant give you a job if thats what you want we have all the writers we needtheyre thick on the ground at the moment its not a job i want its justice im a sorry to say that a man connected with your firm has robbed me and he has done it with your collaboration that silenced him for a moment his eyebrows inched up and he looked me over whats your name son adam hazzard means nothing to me i dont expect it would but the thief is mr theodore dornwoodmaybe you know that name he evinced less surprise than i expected and what do you claim dornwood stole from you a watch a wallet a womans affections words twenty thousand of them roughly i had made an estimate of the length in words of the adventures of julian commongold a word is a small thing but twenty thousand of anything is a ponderable number may i explain be my guest i told him the story of the work i had done for dornwood in montreal and what dornwood in turn had done with my work mr hungerford said nothing but asked his secretary to send for dornwood who apparently had an office in the building in a moment or two that villain arrived dornwood in manhattan was not quite the hempscented drunkard i had last espied near montreal the success of captain commongold had improved his clothing his tonsure and his skin tone unfortunately it also seemed to have damaged his memory he looked at me blankly or pretended to until mr hungerford made an introduction oh yesmr hazzard private hazzard wasnt it im pleased to see you survived your tour of duty im sorry i didnt know you out of uniform well i know you i said uniform or not this young man has a grievance against you hungerford said and he proceeded to repeat in fair detail what i had told him what do you have to say for yourself theodore dornwood shrugged and looked vaguely hurt well what can i say i suppose theres some truth in it i do recall private hazzard coming to me for lessons in writing and i did agree to peruse a few pages for him you admit it i cried admit to consulting you yes i think you misunderstand the nature of journalism private hazzard but i dont blame you for a boreal leaseboy could hardly know any better a journalist draws on many sources you and i talked about julian commongold yesyou may even have shown me some written notesbut i discussed the subject with a great number of infantrymen and officers of which you were only one in so far as i did employ your notes as a partial source and i admit i may have it was in exchange for my advice on writing such advice as i could supply to a poorlyschooled westerner no formal bargain existed of course but if ever there was an informal one surely it was fulfilled i stared at him i made no bargain at all mr hungerford looked up sharply from his desk if you made no bargain mr hazzard then there was no bargain to be broken was there im afraid mr dornwood has the better of you on all counts except that every word printed in captain commongold is mine exactly as i wrote itapart from the misplacement of the commas dornwood who was proving to be a smooth and efficient liar threw his hands up and gave his employer a beseeching look he accuses me of plagiarism must i stoop to deny it look mr hazzard hungerford said youre not the first individual to blow in here claiming some pamphlet was based on an idea of his somehow stolen it happens with every successful piece we publish i dont mean to call you a liarand dornwood generously admits that he used you as one source among hundredsbut you present no evidence that what you say is true and every indication that its simply a painful misunderstanding on your part im glad you dont mean to call me a liar for im not onethough you might find one close to hand see here said dornwood the discussion is closed hungerford said abruptly standing and i want to go to lunch im sorry we cant do anything to accommodate you mr hazzard i dont want to be accommodated i want to be paid ill have you before a court if necessary so you say for your sake i hope you wont pursue the matter if you insist you can come back this afternoon and speak to me in the presence of my lawyer he stops by the office about three oclock perhaps he can convince you the case is hopeless if i cant goodbye mr hazzardyou know where the door is dornwood smiled at me maddeningly i went home disconsolate calyxa as it turned out had gone off with mrs comstock to buy clothing for the independence day celebration at the executive palace julianwho had stayed out late after the movie meeting friends among the showpeople and aesthetes of broadwayhad just rolled out of bed i passed him on the way to the kitchen he asked me if i had had my breakfast yet breakfast hours ago and its already late for lunch i said irritably fineid rather eat lunch than breakfast why dont we go out and have a decent meal no offense to the kitchen staff im not sure but that i wouldnt rather spend the afternoon reading not on a day as fine as this how would you know what sort of day it is im sure you havent even looked out a window yet the fineness of it seeps under the doors i smell sunshine dont be a fossil adam join me for lunch i could hardly resist his invitation without citing the mornings events which i preferred to keep to myself we dined at a restaurant not far distant which served oxtongue cobblers and lozenged pork of a refined quality and i tried to smile and make small talk but i hardly tasted the food and i was such glum company that julian repeatedly asked about my state of mind its nothing i said maybe indigestion maybe nothing of the kind have you had an argument with calyxa no are you worried about independence day no what then come on adam confess he refused to be put off the scent so i relented and described my visit to the spark julian listened to my account without interrupting coffee and cakes were produced by an attentive waiter i ignored them i could hardly meet julians eyes but when i finally fell silent and julian spoke it was only to say the cakes really are excellent adam try one im not concerned with cakes i exclaimed arent you going to chide me for my naïveté or some such thing not at all i admire what you did standing up for yourself i mean the justice is all on your sideno doubt about that the problem lies in your methodology i dont know that i have any clearly you dont ill tell you what why dont we go back to hungerfords offices this very afternoon as he suggested i was astonished at the suggestion what for so that he can have his lawyer hang me up and beat the dust out of me my threat to take hungerford to court had been empty i couldnt produce any evidence to support my side and the new york courts had no reputation for impartiality i would sooner not i thank you this time the outcome might be different i dont see how hungerford is determined not to admit liability and dornwood is a professional liar trust me julian said this was all very embarrassing but i could not see my way out of it and so i made the journey back to hungerfords office with julian at my side if mr hungerford was surprised to see me back again he didnt let on he had told the truth about his lawyer the three of them were sitting together in hungerfords officehungerford theodore dornwood and a fat man with greased hair soon introduced as buck lingley attorney at lawwhen i entered julian dismayingly chose to wait in the outer office he had instructed me to summon him if the publisher didnt relent that seemed an inescapable outcome mr hungerford invited me to sit down before i could say anything hungerfords lawyer asked whether i had proceeded with legal actionfiled a complaint or anything of that sort i said i had not better for you then lingley said youre swimming in rough waters mr hazzard do you know anything about the legal system very little i confessed i felt i had nothing to lose by honestynor much to gain come down to it do you understand what it would cost you to bring a legal action against this business or against mr dornwood as an individual and do you understand that it would cost double that once the case was thrown out of court as i assure you it would be its not a trifling thing to impugn the integrity of such men as these they impugn themselves it seems to me but im sure youre right lawyer lingley looked briefly puzzled you mean to say youll quit your claim i expect that phrase has some legalistic significance of which im not aware what happened happenedneither you nor i can change that mr lingley and if the courts dont judge in this matter heaven might not be so lax heaven isnt within my jurisdiction if youre willing to be reasonable ive prepared a paper for you to sign a paper saying what that you have no fiscal claim on this company or mr dornwood no matter whether some small amount of material you wrote found its way into dornwoods published accounts it was not a small amount mr lingley were talking about an act of thievery bold enough to make a vulture blush make up your mind lingley said do you want to settle the matter or are you going to persist in these libels i looked at the paper it was in so far as i could decipher the whereases a renunciation of all my prior complaints in exchange it said the company would not pursue me for defamation there was a space prepared for my signature if i sign this i said slowly i suppose ill need a witness my secretary will witness it no needive brought a witness of my own and i gestured through the door for julian to enter hungerford and the lawyer blinked at this unexpected development if they did not recognize julian comstock theodore dornwood certainly did he sat bolt upright and an unprintable word escaped his lips whats this about hungerford demanded who is this man julian comstock i said julian this is mr hungerford the publisher of the spark julian offered his hand hungerford took it though every other part of him seemed frozen in shock and this is mr hungerfords lawyer mr buck lingley hello mr lingley said julian in an amiable tone lingleys complexion which up to that moment had been florid turned the color of an eggshell and his tendentious manner went the way of the morning dew he did not speak instead he reached across the desk and picked up the paper i was meant to sign he folded it in thirds and tore it in two pieces then he pursed his lips in a sickly imitation of a smile im delightednohonoredto meet you captain comstock unfortunately an urgent appointment calls me awayi cannot linger he turned to hungerford i think our business is finished for today john he said and left the room in such a hurry that i was surprised the breeze didnt pull the door shut after him mr hungerford had yet to close his slackened jaw and i recognize theodore dornwood julian said our regiments civilian scribe ive read some of your work mr dornwood or at least the work that was published under your name yes dornwood said in a strangled voice which was not helpful no shut up theo mr hungerford said captain comstock do you have a contribution to make to this discussion not at all it was only that my friend adam seems to be having a hard time making himself understood i think weve overcome that difficulty hungerford said as a responsible publisher i mean to correct any mistake that finds its way into print naturally im astonished to discover that mr dornwood borrowed another mans work without attribution that error will be corrected corrected in what way julian inquired before dornwood could stammer out some version of the same question well print a notice in tomorrows spark a notice excellent said julian still theres the matter of the thousands of pamphlets that have already been distributed under mr dornwoods name if some profit or royalty has been paid to mr dornwood by mistake sir theres no problem in that department ill have our accountants calculate the full amount and pay it to you directly to mr hazzard you mean i mean of course to mr hazzard well that shows a christian spirit said julian doesnt it adam its almost contrite i said not a little astonished myself but it seems to me julian went on though im no expert on the publishing business you might be missing an opportunity mr hungerford and a lucrative one at that please explain hungerford said warily while dornwood cringed in his chair like a spanked child weve established that adam was the true author of the adventures of captain commongold was it wellwritten do you think the public has taken to it in a big way weve gone into a third printing that makes it wellwritten by my definition you say it was all your work mr hazzard all but the punctuation i said glaring at dornwood does that suggest anything to you as a publisher julian asked adam is too modest to mention it but hes written more than just these matteroffact adventures he has a novel in progress your press prints novels as well as newspapers doesnt it mr hungerford we have a modest line of bound thrillers julian asked me if my novel could be considered thrilling it has pirates in it i said there you are then adam is a proven bestseller and hes writing a book with pirates and other exciting persons in itand here he is standing in your office ill have a contract drawn up hungerford murmured mr hungerford is a canny businessman adam he wants to publish your novel will the terms be generous mr hungerford hungerford quoted a colossal number which he said was his standard rate for firsttime novelists i was quite taken aback and probably turned as white in the face as lawyer lingley had when he recognized the presidents nephew i could not speak my toes and fingers were numb good julian said but is adam really a firsttime novelistgiven the success of his previous work i mean hungerford nodded woodenly and announced a number twice as cosmic i might have fainted if i had not had the desk to lean on is the number acceptable adam i allowed that it was as for mr dornwood julian began hell be fired immediately hungerford said please dont do that im sure adam doesnt want to punish mr dornwood any further now that the error had been corrected i guess thats right i managed to say i wont hold a grudge against any man you can keep your job dornwood for all of me although dornwood gave me a pleading look he was no longer the smug manhattanite he might have been some condemned slave kneeling before a pharaoh for clemency it was an unusual sensation to hold another mans fate in my hands i could ask for his apology i supposed i supposed i could ask for his head too and hungerford would have it delivered it to me on a china plate but im not a vindictive person i want your typewriter i said they say the typewriter was invented in or thereabouts it has had many incarnations in the centuries since it went out of production even before the end of oil and was reintroduced only recently modern typewriters are made by hand by craftsmen who have studied innumerable rusty remains rescued from various tips they are expensive to buy and costly to maintain theyre also very heavy julian and i took turns carrying dornwoods typewriter down the street to a taxi stand say something julian suggested or ill think youve lost your tongue im out of words entirely unfortunate condition for a writer to be in that brought me up short was i a writer in the professional sense i guessed i was hungerford and his lawyer had meant for me to sign a quitclaim this afternoon instead i had signed a contract to write a novel and inked my name on a receipt for theodore dornwoods writing machine probably those two items the contract and the typewriter were acceptable bona fides in the authors trade i said to julian i didnt know you could do that do what what you did at the spark command obedience hungerford practically bowed to you as long as i had known julian i had known he was an aristo and i knew aristos were meant to be respected and obeyed but we had ignored that dictum as boys and been forced to ignore it as soldiers and agreed to ignore it as friends and it was seldom topmost in my mind i reminded myself that to a stranger even a highlyplaced businessman such as mr hungerford julian was no more or less than a member of the family of the reigning president no doubt hungerford imagined that a word from julian to his uncle would cause the spark to be shut down and placed under a permanent dominion sanction that was the kind of power deklan conqueror was able to exercise by implicationat least in the mind of hungerford and his lawyerit was julians power as well its a handy thing julian said as we maneuvered first the typewriter and then ourselves into an available cab to invoke the family name now and then it must be daunting to possess such power and to wield it the power is all deklans im afraid perhaps not all you borrowed a little of it just now i dont want it the thought of it sickens me the power to do goodthats the power id like to wield said julian anyone can do good in the world julian to some degree or so my mother had often told me and the dominion reader for young persons concurred the kind of good i want to do requires the kind of power few men possess what kind of good is it that wants such muscle but julian wouldnt answer calyxa wasnt impressed by the typewriter she pointed out all its dents and scarswhich were many for the machine had been carried to labrador and back at least once and had seen hard service under dornwood it still smelled a little of liquor and burnt hemp but it was serviceable and welloiled and did its job uncomplainingly calyxa also reminded me that i didnt know how to type there was a skill associated with it i could find letters and poke them but this was a relatively laborious way to conduct business she told me she had seen a booklet at grogans called typewriting selftaught and i promised her i would buy myself a copy even if it cost as much as a charles curtis easton novel if she was cynical about the typewriter she was genuinely pleased by the news that i had signed a contract for my novel and that dornwoods royalties for julian commongold had been consigned to me we would have money of our own in other words and there was the solid promise of more to come so we wont be running off to buffalo she said we can support ourselves in new york city you can sing in cafés or not as the mood suits you assuming we survive the independence day festivities at the executive palace i wished she hadnt mentioned it julians almost certain no harm will come to us there almost certain she said thats almost reassuring there was a sound like gunfire in the street that night i rose and went to the bedroom window the window had been left open in order to soften the heat in the upper stories of the house though barely a breeze was blowing i put my head outside manhattan lay quiet in the midnight darkness i could hear the rustling of draped flags and the creek of insects the bones of skyscrapers cut angular silhouettes out of the stars and here and there the fulgent glow of distant foundries smoldered down below in the stables attached to the house a sleepless horse snuffled and tapped its shod hoof on the ground more explosions followed and the sound of stifled laughter a crew of five or six boys dashed out between two of the row houses lit punks glowing in their hands offended voices hailed them from other windows what i had taken for gunshots was only the sound of exploding firecrackers tossed about by mischievous children in anticipation of the fourth of july julian and i had played the same kind of tricks back in williams ford in our younger days the dairymen had despised us for it and claimed our concussions dried up the milk in the udders of their cows i couldnt bring myself to be angry the smell of black powder came in with the night air calyxa stirred and asked sleepily whether something was burning smells like the whole towns on fire she murmured just mischief i told her i shivered though the night was warm then i shuttered the window and went back to bed in the days before the fourth of july i wrote up a special introduction to the revised edition of the adventures of captain commongold now revealed as julian comstock the youthful hero of the saguenay and replaced all the commas mr theodore dornwood had deleted or misplaced in the matter of the introduction i accepted the tutelage of sam godwin who said it was very important that i should not insult the reigning president but rather say something to praise him i didnt like to do this after everything julian had said about his uncle it felt like hypocrisy i told sam so it is hypocrisy a lie frankly but its for julians sake it may save his life or at least prolong it i could hardly refuse then for this was the same document that had imperiled julian in the first place and i was not sorry if it could be made to serve the opposite purpose so i wrote down that julian had joined the army of the laurentians under an assumed name so that he would not receive any special treatment that might otherwise accrue to a presidents nephew but would be treated as an ordinary soldier of the line not that deklan comstock would ever stoop to influencing the military to obtain a better position for julian the president no doubt believes as julian does that a man must distinguish himself on his own hook and for his own behavior and no one elses it was julians fear that some commissioned officer might attempt to curry favor through favoritism and his pride and patriotism would not allow him to accept any such unearned privilege julian i wrote wanted to achieve the condition of heroism if he achieved it at all as deklan conqueror had on his own behalf and without any softening help julian winced when he read this and told me i ought to work for the dominion since i was so facile with a flattering lie but sam rebuked him and explained that i had included the passage at his insistence ive been spending time with army officers on leave from the laurentians sam said in the high ranks particularly the men around general galligasken there is considerable discontent with deklan comstock the president attempts to rule the army like a tyrant and orders peculiar attacks and strategies of his own contriving and when these failas they almost inevitably dohe punishes some hapless major general or appoints a more servile one in his place unfortunately our success at chicoutimi isnt typical of the general progress of the war the army of the laurentians cant continue to sustain losses at the current ratethe president will have to recall veterans or whip up a new draft if he wants to prevent a complete collapse i tell you this in utmost confidence if we can placate deklan conqueror even temporarily we may also outlast him that was unsettling news even if it had a bright side but there was nothing i could do about it julian accepted it with a nod and a frown later that day i asked sam whether he had been in contact with any of the jews of new york city for there were many of themi had seen them walking blacksuited to their saturday services in an enclave near the egyptian part of town at first i thought the immigrant egyptians might also be jews since they worshipped at unusual temples of their own but this was not the case sam said in montreal i could afford such associations he said as sam godwin im too well known to risk it what would the risk be judaism is legal in this state isnt it legal but hardly respectable said sam we were strolling down broadway not for the exercise but in order to have a conversation that wouldnt be overheard by servants the rattle of carriage wheels the clatter of horses hooves and the flapping of independence day banners made it impossible for anyone to eavesdrop on uswe could barely understand each other what does respectability matter having very little of my own i was inclined to devalue the commodity it matters not at all to me personally but a great deal to certain people i deal with the military of course the dominion it goes without saying i cant do what i have been doing on behalf of julian if i become known as a practicing jew and even in my private life do you have one sam i asked and immediately regretted the impertinence he gave me a sour look i hesitate to talk about it but as a newly married man perhaps you can understand years agoeven before the death of julians fatheri had the misfortune of falling in love with mrs emily baines comstock it wasnt earthshaking news i had seen him blush whenever mrs comstock entered a room and i had seen her blush too in a way that suggested the possibility of mutual affection sam was nearly fifty years old and mrs comstock the same but i had learned that love can blossom even in the elderly still it was shocking to hear him speak of it aloud i know what youre thinking adamthe barriers are insurmountable it wasnt exactly what i had been thinking but it would do nevertheless sam said ive confided some of my feelings to emily and she has hinted that those feelings might be in some measure returned she told you to grow your beard back i observed and you did it beards dont come into the matter this is serious when bryce comstock was alive i kept my affections to myself and emily was a devoted wife to a brave soldier a man for whom my respect was immeasurable and my friendship absolute but bryce is gone these several years and emily is a widow and in social eclipse on top of that the day may come when i can propose a wedding to her not until political matters are settled howeverand not at all if im revealed as a jew the dominion forbade such marriages and called them unnatural that would make you julians stepfather i said what else have i been since julian was a child except a second father to himthough he thinks of me more as a servant im afraid hes fonder of you than he can say he trusts your advice i dont deny that im of value to himonly that he values me as a useful servant might be valued more than that well maybe so said sam the situations murky that was the third day of the month of july the eve of our visit to the executive palace independence day what cherished memories of williams ford that date provoked despite all my present anxieties it had always been the least solemn of the four universal christian holidays second only to christmas in my childish calculations it was of course a profoundly sacred occasion marked by innumerable services at the dominion hall there had been many public lectures by ben kreel about the christian nation in which we lived and the valuable role of the dominion in all our lives and such weighty matters as that but independence day also marked the true beginning of summersummer in its maturity july and august populating the world with perfume and insects the creeks that fed the river pine though still cold were available for swimming squirrels begged to be stalked and shot peddlers came up from connaught with fireworks to sell best of all independence day drew the aristos out of their estate for picnics and celebrations which meant that my mother in her role as a seamstress could sneak into the estate library and fetch out a book or two for me to read these volumes were usually but not always returned in good order i was prompted by this sentiment to compose a letter to my mother in williams ford because julians identity had been revealed i could finally write to her openly and receive mail in return and i had already sent her several notesthough no response had been received i sat by the window in the room i shared with calyxa there was a small desk there and i took a sheet of paper from its topmost drawer dear mother i wrote if my last letter reached you you will already know that i have survived a year in labradorthat i did not embarrass myself in battlethat i have married a good woman in a legal dominion serviceand that your daughterinlaw is calyxa hazzard formerly blake of montreal well all that must be news enough i have not got any reply just yet but i hope you will write soon and communicate your thoughts and fathers on this exciting subject naturally i hope for and expect your blessing if father is disappointed that i did not marry in the church of signs please tell him im sorry but that there was no suitable pastor available we are well and doing fine in new york city in fact i have recently published a pamphlet i enclose a copy and i have been commissioned to write an entire novel for the same publisher i seem to have become an author that is to say after the style of mr charles curtis easton it is a more lucrative profession than i had expected and i will send you some money if you tell me how to address it so that it wont be stolen as i write it is the morning of independence day very sunny and pleasant all around and all over manhattan church bells are ringing how is it back in williams ford does ben kreel still talk in the dominion hall until nightfall and are the fireworks still reflected in the waters of the river pine i have said we are well and thats true in fact because of my friendship with julian comstock calyxa and i have been invited to the executive palace this evening for the annual celebration there i know you have told me not to mix with aristos if i can help ittempt not contagion by proximity as you used to quote to me from the dominion readerbut an invitation from the president carries a certain weight and cant safely be refused in all likelihood nothing untoward will happen at the palace the chance that i will be beheaded or disemboweled or any such unpleasant thing is really very slight although julian is at a somewhat greater risk please do not assume that i have been killed if you do not hear from meyou know how unreliable the mails are that is about all for now please give my love to father many troubles have come my way since i left williams ford but i am less a child than you remember me and able to carry myself virtuously through even the most venomous garden while keeping my eye on the straight and narrow path and looking neither left nor right except as necessary to keep from tripping over things i signed it your loving son adam in the late afternoon we boarded a carriagecalyxa mrs comstock sam julian and myselfand set out for the presidential palace it was a nervous journey but we were brave and did not speak about the risks and hazards the long light cast a golden patina on broadway which was dressed up for the occasion with banners and bunting i was dressed up too in a tailored aristo costume that pinched various tender parts of me and so was calyxa whose elegant mauvecolored dress took up all the space not already filled by mrs comstocks even bulkier outfit i was glad to have a seat by the window of the carriage where i could see past these mounds of compressed silk to the outside world we entered the palace grounds by the broadway gate at th street our carriage and our invitations were inspected by a blackuniformed member of the presidents private security force which is called the republican guard once approved by that dour individual and carefully watched by a dozen just like him we passed over the moat and through two heavy iron doors into the manicured grounds of what had once been according to julian a vast central park very little remained of the original version of that park julian said except the great reservoir in the middle of it all the wooded areas had been burned over during the false tribulation and what did not burn had been cut down for fuel by starved and freezing urbanites both the sheep meadow and the ramble had been plowed and planted in the years that followeda quixotic enterprise for the soil was not suited to agriculture then after the fall of washington the entire park from north to south had been donated to the executive branch under president otis it was otis who had caused to be built the huge enclosing walls of brick marble and stone recovered from the ruins of manhattan it was otis who had designed the hunting grounds and stocked them with game it was otis who had erected the executive palace overlooking the great lawn our path wound northward past ailanthus groves and broad meadows of mown grass to something called the statuary lawn where large examples of sculpture dating from the efflorescence of oil had been preserved here to the left of us was a statue of a man on horseback named bolivar and a stone spike called the needle of cleopatra to the right a huge metallic arm held a verdigrised torch as tall as an athabaska pine and a fractured crowned head adjoined it the head and arm were fragments of the colossus of liberty julian said according to legend the colossus used to stand astride the verrazano narrows while boats and barges passed between her feet a cursory inspection shows that the scale is off and liberty would not have been able to span the distance even with her legs splayed at an unflattering angle still she must once have been a very large and prominently visible statuei dont mean to diminish her grandeur these items and others like them looked both bold and melancholy casting shadows like the gnomons of monstrous sundials as we rode among them in the last light of the day we were not the only coach on the path there was a regular circus of carriages coaches and mounted horsemen making their way toward the executive palace from each of the parks four gates the coaches had gilded fittings the horsemen were formally dressed and the carriage lanterns were lit and had begun to glimmer in the gathering dusk all the finest and richest men and women of manhattan had received an invitation to this annual fete those who did not considered themselves slighted the failure to receive an invitation was often a sign that some unlucky high eupatridian had fallen from favor with the executive and the uninvited person if he was a senator might begin to watch his back for knives calyxa of course was not impressed with all this gaudiness and show on account of her parmentierist principles i had hoped she would conceal her disdain for the eupatridians at least for the duration of the independence day event but that was not to be the case we arrived near the vast stables of the executive palace where boys in livery were accepting the carriages of the many guests we dismounted and had begun to walk toward the entranceway of the palace when we came across an angry aristo beating his driver with a cane the aristo in question was a stout man of middle age his carriage had thrown a wheel and the owner apparently blamed his driver for the accident the driver was a man at least as old as his master with hollow cheeks and a sort of doggish resignation about his eyes he bore the beating stoically while the aristo cursed him in words i cant repeat what the hell exclaimed calyxa coming upon this scene hush sam whispered to her that man is nelson wieland he owns half the rerolling mills in new jersey and holds a senate seat i dont care if hes croesus on a bicycle calyxa declared he ought not to use his cane that way its none of our business mrs comstock put in but calyxa would not be dissuaded from walking right up to mr wieland and interrupting him in the strenuous work of beating his employee what has this man done she asked wieland looked at her blinking he didnt recognize calyxa of course and he seemed to be confused about her status by evidence of dress if not deportment she was a wealthy aristo herselfshe had after all been invited to a presidential receptionand he decided at last to humor her im sorry to trouble you with an unpleasant sight he said this mans carelessness cost me a wheeland not just the wheel but the axle hence the carriage how was he careless oh i dont know exactlyhe claims the rig struck a stonethat the suspension of the vehicle was not wellmaintainedin other words he offers every excuse that would relieve him of responsibility of course i know better the man shirksits habitual with him and so you beat him bloody this was not an exaggeration for the blows had caused wounds which stained the fabric of the drivers starched white shirt its the only way hell mark the event in his memory hes an indentured man and slow de toute évidence non seulement vous êtes un tyran mais en plus vous êtes bête said calyxa mr wieland was brought up short by the unfamiliar language he gave calyxa another perplexed look as if she were some exotic form of life a crawfish perhaps that had emerged unexpectedly from its native element perhaps he thought she was the wife of an ambassador thank you he said finally you flatter me im sure but i dont speak the language and im afraid of being late for the reception he took up his cane and hurried away calyxa lingered a while longer with the beaten driver conversing with him in a tone too low for me to overhear they spoke until sam called her back to us was that necessary he asked that man you call wieland is a thug however much he owns julian asked what the injured driver had had to say for himself hes been working for wieland most of his life hes a blacksmiths son from some little town in pennsylvania his father sold him into wielands mill when the smithy business failed he spent years casting hubs until the coal fumes made him stupid that was when wieland took him for a personal driver then wielands entitled to beat him if he chooses the man is chattel entitled by the law maybe calyxa said the law is the law said sam the executive palace was so expansive and grand that it might have done doubleduty as a museum or a train station we entered through a portico where marble pillars supported a cathedrallike ceiling and passed into an immense receiving room where aristos clustered in conversation and waiters circulated with carts of drink and plates of small food items some of these the food items not the waiterswere impaled on toothpicks i thought it was a skimpy selection for a presidential dinner until julian explained that the morsels were not the main course but only appetizers designed to provoke hunger rather than slake it we picked at these trifles and tried to appreciate the elaborate wainscoting which was painted with images from the history of the pious presidents and the sheer scale of the architecture julians fame had preceded him in fact the story of his career as a soldier and his sudden reappearance in manhattan had circulated widely several senators approached to congratulate him for his bravery once his presence was noted and many young aristo women made a point of flattering him with their attention though he was merely courteous in return calyxa regarded these fashionable young women skeptically i suppose they seemed unserious to her they wore sleeveless gowns in order to display the number and prominence of the vaccination scars on their upper arms mrs comstock said that such scars were a vain selfdecoration expensive largely useless against disease and a danger to the recipient this might have been true for several of the vaccinated women were pale or seemed feverish or unsteady in their gait but i suppose the pursuit of fashion has always carried a price monetary or otherwise julian did not stint his introductions as he passed through the crowd he called me an author or a scribe and calyxa was mrs hazzard a vocal artist those of the elite to whom we spoke were unfailingly if briefly polite toward us we were circulating a little uneasily among this mob of cheerful eupatridians when the president of the united states made his first appearance he did not enter the receiving room but greeted us from a sort of balcony at the top of a staircase stern and wellarmed republican guardsmen were arrayed at his back their demeanor suggesting that they might have preferred to aim their pistols at the crowd if etiquette had not precluded that hostile act silence fell over the room until every face was turned toward deklan conqueror the coins didnt do him justice i thought or perhaps it was the other way around he was less handsome than his graven image but somehow more imposing it was true that he looked a little like julian minus the feathery yellow beard in fact he looked the way i imagined julian might look if he were years older and not entirely sane i dont say this to demean the president probably he couldnt help the way he looked his features were not irregular but there was something about his narrow eyes his hawk nose and his fixed ingratiating grin that suggested madness not outandout lunacy mind you but the kind of subtle madness that dallies alongside sanity and bides its time i saw julian wince at the sight of his uncle mrs comstock drew a choked breath beside me the president wore a suit of formal black that suggested a uniform without actually being one the medals pinned to his breast accentuated the effect he saluted the crowd smiling all the while he expressed his greetings to his guests and thanked them all for coming and regretted that he couldnt visit with them more personally but encouraged them to enjoy themselves with refreshments dinner would be served before long he said followed by independence day festivities in the main hall and further refreshments and fireworks on the great lawn and then he would deliver a speech it was a proud day for the nation he said and he hoped we would celebrate it vigorously and sincerely then he disappeared behind a purple curtain he wasnt seen again until after dinner when we filed into the dining hall we discovered that our seats at the long tables had been assigned to us and marked with small ornaments bearing our names calyxa and i sat together but nowhere near the other members of our party directly across from usan unfortunate coincidencewas nelson wieland the brutal industrialist who had made such a poor impression on calyxa outside the stables seated beside him was a similarly aged gentleman in silk and wool introduced to us as mr billy palumbo it emerged in conversation over the soup course that mr palumbo was an agriculturalist he owned several vast domains in upper new york state where his indentured people grew peabeans and corn for the city market mr wieland criticized the gourd soup which he claimed was too thick seems all right to me mr palumbo rejoined i like a substantial broth do you care for it at all mrs hazzard i suppose its fine calyxa said in an indifferent tone more than fine i added i didnt know a common gourd could be made so palatable or even harvested this time of year ive tasted better said wieland the discussion continued in this culinary vein throughout the meal boiled onions were servedundercooked or over we debated them medallions of lambpalumbo considered the cut too rare potatoes picked young coffee too strong for mr wielands constitution and so on by the time dessert was servedwintergreen icecream a novelty to mecalyxa seemed prepared to throw her portion across the table if palumbo and wieland didnt leave off the topic of food instead she lobbed a different kind of missile do your indentured people eat this well mr palumbo she asked abruptly the question took palumbo by surprise well hardly he said he smiled imagine serving them icecream theyd soon grow too stout to work as palumbo had long since though i do not hold a mans girth against him or perhaps they might work harder if they had such a thing to look forward to at the end of the day i doubt it very much are you a radical mrs hazzard i dont call myself that im glad to hear it compassion is a fine thing but dangerous when its misplaced what ive learned in many years of overseeing the indentured is that they have to be treated very strictly at all times they mistake kindness for weakness and if they see a weakness in an owner theyll take advantage of it theyre notorious for their laziness and inventive in finding ways to pursue it i agree mr wieland put in for instance that servant you saw me discipline earlier tonight only a broken wheel you might think but let it slide and tomorrow there would be two broken wheels or a dozen yes thats the logic of it palumbo said logic calyxa said if you carry it to its conclusion might imply that men working against their will are not the most efficient laborers mrs hazzard good grief exclaimed palumbo if the indentured are sullen its only because they fail to appreciate their own good fortune have you seen the popular film eulas choice yes but i dont see what that has to do with it it explains the origins of the indenture system very succinctly a bargain was struck sometime around the end of the false tribulation and the same terms obtain today you believe in the theory of heritable debt mr palumbo heritable debt is the radicals term for it you ought to be more careful in your reading mrs hazzard its a question of property wieland interjected yes calyxa said for the indentured dont have anyin fact they are property not at all you defame the people you mean to defend of course the indentured have property they own their bodies their skills if any and their capacity for labor if they dont seem to own these things its only because the commodity has already been sold it happened as in the film mr palumbo mentions refugees from the fall of the cities traded the only goods they possessedtheir hands their hearts and their votesfor food and shelter in a difficult time a person ought not to be able to sell himself calyxa said much less his vote if a person owns himself then he must be able to sell himself else what meaning does property have as for the vote he isnt deprived of itit still existshe has only signed it over to his landed employer who votes it for him yes so the owners can control that sorry excuse for a senate this was perhaps too much to say nearby heads turned toward us and calyxa blushed and lowered her voice i mean these are opinions that i have read in any case the bargain you describe was made more than a century ago if it was made at all nowadays people are born into indenture a debt is a debt mrs hazzard the commitment doesnt vanish simply because a man has had the bad luck to die if a mans possessions pass by right to his survivors so do his obligations what have you been reading that left you laboring under such misapprehensions a man named oh i think parmentier calyxa said pretending innocence parmentier that european terrorist good god mrs hazzard you do need some direction in your studies wieland cast an accusing glance at me i have recommended the novels of mr charles curtis easton i said the spread of literacy is the problem here said palumbo oh im all in favor of a sensible degree of literacyas you must be mr hazzard given your career as a journalist but it has an infectious tendency it spreads and discontent spreads along with it admit one literate man to a coffle and hell teach the others the skill and what they read wont be dominionapproved works but pornography or the lowest kind of cheap publications or fomentive political tracts parmentier why mrs hazzard just a week ago i purchased a string of three hundred men from a planter in utica at what appeared to be a bargain price i kept them apart from my other stock for a time a sort of quarantine period and im glad i did for it turned out reading was endemic among them and parmentierist pamphlets were circulating freely that kind of thing can ruin an entire estate if it flourishes unchecked calyxa didnt ask what mr palumbo had done to check the flourishing of literacy among his stock perhaps because she feared the answer but her face betrayed her feelings she tensed and i worried that she was about to fling some new accusation across the table or perhaps a fork it was at this moment fortunately that the dessert plates were cleared away intoxicating drinks circulated freely after the meal including such expensive abominations as champagne and red wine i did not partake though the eupatridians went at it like horses at a trough deklan comstock briefly appeared from another indoor balconyhe preferred a commanding height julian saidand invited us to step into the ballroom adjoining where the band would play patriotic tunes we followed at the presidents bidding the music struck up at once and some of the aristos well lubricated with fiery fluids began to dance i didnt dance and calyxa didnt want to so we looked for genial company instead well distant from mr wieland and mr palumbo we found companyor it found usbut it was not congenial in the long run mr hazzard said a booming voice i turned and saw a man in clerical garb i gathered he was some high functionary of the dominion for he wore a broadrimmed felt hat with silver trimming a sober black jacket and a formal cotton shirt on which the legend john was stitched in golden thread i didnt recognize his face which was florid and round he carried a glass in his hand and the glass was halffilled with an amber fluid and his breath smelled like the coppercoil stills ben kreel used to discover and destroy in the indentured mens quarters back in williams ford his eyes glittered with intrigue or drink you know me but i dont know you i said on the contrary i dont know you at all but ive read your pamphlet on the subject of julian comstock and someone was kind enough to point you out to me he extended the hand which was not holding a drink my name is simon hollingshead and im a deacon of the diocese of colorado springs he said that as if it was a trivial thing it wasnt the simple title belied a powerful position in the dominion hierarchy in fact the only clergymen more elevated than the deacons of colorado springs were the seventy members of the dominion high council itself pastor hollingsheads hand was hot and moist and i let go of it as soon as i could do so without offending him what brings you to the east calyxa asked warily ecclesiastical duties mrs hazzardnothing you would understand on the contrary it sounds fascinating well i cant speak as freely as i would like but the eastern cities have to be taken in hand from time to time they tend to drift away from orthodoxy left to their own devices unaffiliated churches spring up like fungal growths the mixing of classes and nationalities has a wellknown degenerative influence perhaps the easterners drink too freely i couldnt help saying wine that gladdens the heart of man quoted the deacon though it appeared to be something more powerful than wine in his glass the quotation from psalms is authentic although it would never have been allowed into the dominion reader for young persons its sacred doctrine ive come to protect not personal sobriety drinking isnt a sin though drunkenness is do i seem drunk to you mr hazzard no sir not noticeably what sacred doctrines are in danger the ones that prohibit laxness in administering a flock eastern clergy will overlook the damnedest things pardon me lubriciousness licentiousness lust the alliterative sins calyxa said quietly but enough of my problems i meant only to congratulate you on your history of julian comstocks military adventures i thanked him kindly and pretended to be modest young people have very little in the way of uplifting literature available to them your work is exemplary mr hazzard i see it hasnt yet received the dominion stamp but that can be changed it was a generous offer which might result in an increase of sales and for that reason i thought we shouldnt offend deacon hollingshead unnecessarily calyxa however was in a sharp mood and unimpressed with hollingsheads ecclesiastical rank and powers colorado springs is a big town she said doesnt it have problems of its own you could be looking after surely it does corruption can creep in anywhere colorado springs is the very heart and soul of the dominion but youre right mrs hazzard vice breeds there as well as anywhere else even in my own family he hesitated then as if unsure whether he ought to proceed perhaps the liquor had made him distrust his tongue to my dismay calyxa wouldnt let the matter drop vice in a deacons family my own daughter has been a victim of it he lowered his voice i wouldnt ordinarily discuss this but you seem to be a thoughtful young woman you dont bare your arms like so many of the ladies present nor cover your skin with ugly vaccination marks my modesty is wellknown calyxa said though she had lobbied to wear just such a sleeveless costumemrs comstock had overruled her then i wont offend you by mentioning um unpleasant vices are offensive to me deacon hollingshead but the words describing them are not how can we eradicate a problem unless were allowed to name it she was baiting him but hollingshead was too virtuous or drunk to understand homosexuality he whispered do you know that word mrs hazzard the rumor of such behavior has occasionally reached my ears is your daughter a god forbid no marcy is a model child shes twentyone now but because she has yet to marry she drew the attention of a league of degenerate women in colorado springs yes such a thing exists and it continues to exist despite all my efforts to eradicate it what efforts have you made both the municipal police and the investigatory arm of the dominion have been put on the case needless to say i dont let marcy go anywhere unobserved there are eyes on her at all times though she doesnt know it is it really a wise thing to spy on your own daughter certainly if it protects her does it protect her several times it has saved her from absolute ruin marcy seems hardly able to leave the house without wandering by accident into some depraved tavern or other naturally when we discover such establishments we shut them down more than one degenerate woman has attempted to make marcy a special friend those women were arrested and interrogated interrogatedwhy because theres more than coincidence at work the bibulous deacon said clearly some group of deviants has targeted my daughter we interrogated these women in order to find out the connection between them has the effort succeeded unfortunately no even under extreme duress none of these women will admit that their interest in marcy was planned in advance and they deny all knowledge of any conspiracy interrogations arent generally so fruitless i take it said calyxa and i could tell by the reddening of her face that she didnt approve of the deacons enthusiastic approach to the knotty issues of vice and torture no theyre not our investigators are skilled at extracting information from the unwillingthe dominion trains them in it how do you explain the failure in this case then vice has unsuspected depths and profunditiesit hides by instinct from the light the deacon said grimly and it occurs so close to home calyxa said adding in a low tone on aurait peutétre dû torturer votre fille aussi i expected deacon hollingshead to ignore this incomprehensible remark he did not instead he drew himself up in a rigid posture his features hardened abruptly je ne suis ni idiot ni inculte mrs hazzard he said si vous vous moquez de moi je me verrai dans lobligation de lancer un mandat darrét contre vous i didnt know what this exchange meant but calyxa paled and took a step backward hollingshead faced me his put his smile back on though it seemed forced i congratulate you again on your success mr hazzard your work does you credit you have a fine career ahead of you i hope nothing interferes with it he took a noisy sip from his glass and walked away i dont mean to leave the reader with the impression that all the eupatridians we met at the presidential reception were boors or tyrants many perhaps most were entirely pleasant taken as individuals several of the men were yachtsmen and i enjoyed listening to their spirited discourse on nautical subjects though i couldnt reef a mainsail if my life depended on it mrs comstock knew a number of the wives many of them were astonished to see her here so long after the death of her husband but they were accustomed to the caprices of presidential favor and quickly accepted her back into their ranks sam spent his time with the military contingent including a handful of notable generals and major generals i suppose sam was gauging their attitude toward the commander in chief or trying to pick up clues about the presidents intentions toward julian but all that was beyond my ken julian himself was deep in conversation with what he described to me as a genuine philosopher a professor of cosmology from the newlyreformed new york university this man had many interesting theories julian said about the speed of light and the origin of stars and other such refined subjects but he was under the thumb of the dominion and could not discourse as freely as he might have liked nevertheless the man had enjoyed some access to the dominion archives and hinted at the artistic and scientific treasures concealed there the general hilarity occasioned by the drinking of grape wine etc soon reached fresh heights the musical band had adjourned for a short whilethey were out behind the stables calyxa suggested smoking hempen cigarettesbut they returned in relatively good order and better spirits just as deklan comstock made a third appearance on one of his marbled balconies this time the president called out recognition to the most elevated members of the crowd including the speaker of the senate deacon hollingshead several prominent landowners the surgeon general the chinese and nipponese ambassadors who had been eyeing each other uneasily from opposite ends of the room and other dignitaries then he smiled his unwholesome smile and said also present and home from his adventures defending the union in labrador is my beloved nephew julian comstock as well as his celebrated scribe mr adam hazzard and his former tutor sam godwin hearing my name pronounced by this man was unnerving and caused a shiver to rush up my spine mr hazzard the president continued has a very great and subtle literary talent and ive recently learned that his wife is talented as well mrs hazzard is a singer and it occurs to me to wonder whether she might favor us with a ballad or such now that the band is warmed up mrs hazzard he feigned shielding his eyes against the light mrs hazzard are you willing to entertain these ladies and gentlemen calyxas jaw was grimly setclearly this was deklan comstocks attempt to humiliate her and indirectly julian by exposing her as a cabaret singerbut at the same time it was an invitation she dared not refuse hold my drink adam she said flatly calyxa had not refused the champagne as consistently as i hadthen she climbed up onto the bandstand where the musicians were arrayed this turn of events had taken the bandleader by surprise as well he looked at her blankly perhaps expecting her to call out a familiar songtitlewhere the sauquoit meets the mohawk or some respectable piece like that but calyxa was never one to do the expected especially at the beck of a tyrant like deklan comstock she looked out at the sea of eupatridian faces confronting her it was an awkward moment she didnt speak or even smile but lifted her cumbersome skirt and began to stomp her right foot this activity amused some of the aristos and it didnt display her ankles to her best advantage but it established a terse martial beat which the drummer soon picked up then without prelude she began to sing by piston loom and anvil boys we clothe and arm the nation and sweat all day for a paupers pay and half a soldiers ration there was shock at first many of the eupatridians in the room knew this song or had heard rebellious servants singing it from kitchens and cellars if they didnt know it intimately they knew it by reputation in any case the lyrics were explicit in their sympathy for the common man the silence and gasps from her audience did not discourage calyxa though even the drummer faltered for a beat or two she finished the chorus and ran right through the first verse whichlike every other verse in this long and encyclopedic songdecried the suffering of some class of laborer at the hands of an industrialist or owner heads turned toward president deklan comstock as if to gauge his reaction was he enraged insulted would the republican guard bring out their pistols and end the show abruptly but deklan conqueror didnt appear to be angry he raised his hand instead in a kind of mock salute that small gesture broadcast a signal among the eupatridians that for tonight at least the usual proprieties had been suspended they drew the inference that calyxas performance was not a protest but a kind of show ironically intended piston loom and anvil sung at the executive palace it had the deliciously inverted logic of a bacchanal a few of the more astute aristos began to clap in time that caused the orchestra to take courage and join in the musicians were all familiar with the tune and began to work little trills and arpeggios around calyxas powerful voice calyxa herself carried on as if none of these nuances mattered it was the song she meant to sing and she was singing it bless her said julian who had come to stand beside me some in the room still didnt appreciate the incongruous performance mr wieland mr palumbo and deacon hollingshead stood in a single dour knot arms crossed because they worked directly with indentured men wieland and palumbo knew the song for what it was a dagger aimed at their livelihoods deacon hollingshead had no such direct interest though he was a stalwart supporter of the status quo and perhaps had tortured men who dared such verses in his presence even the presidents indulgence could not persuade these worthies to relax their vigilance in fact i began to worry about their health wielands already ruddy complexion deepened until his head came to resemble a beet embedded in a shirt collar and palumbo wasnt far behind in this competition julian had once told me a story about deepsea divers in recent times it had become possible for tipmen in sealed rubber suits supported by air pumped to them from the surface to descend into the murky waters around the ruins of seaside cities this was an occasionally lucrative but wildly dangerous pursuit it often yielded fresh treasure from sites that had on land been picked clean but for every valuable antiquity thus obtained a mans life was put at risk it is a peculiar quality of the oceans that the pressure of the water increases with depth there was a legend among these undersea tipmen julian had said that a diver if he came untethered in deep enough water might sink so far that the fist of the sea would squeeze him to death worse the water pressure would literally roll him up like a tube of toothpaste his body encased in rubber would be crushed and then forced into his enclosing helmet so that the whole of him would at last be concentrated in that steel shell like a bloody stew in an inverted bowluntil even the helmet itself exploded this was of course usually fatal i thought about that legend which for all i know may be true as i looked at wieland palumbo and hollingshead with every succeeding versethe one about the buried coalminer the one about the seamstress reduced to penury and prostitution by her employer the one about the railway porter bisected by a runaway trainyet more blood rushed to the crania of these indignant gentlemen until i wondered whether they would simply drop dead or whether their skulls would burst like pressed grapes calyxa if anything was slightly miffed by the genial reception she was now receiving she cranked out even more radical verses which named owners as tyrants and senators as fools im not sure this is especially decorous said mrs comstock from beside me but the president continued to grin though his grin was far from mirthful and the eupatridians by and large continued to mistake insult for irony and smirked at the joke of it i began to think calyxas inventive powers had been exhaustedwhich might have been a good thingwhen she stepped to the very edge of the bandstand aiming her gaze directly and unmistakably at the industrialist nelson wieland and still pounding the stage with her foot she sang i know someone a blacksmiths son who learned to mill old steel he cast the parts for rich mens carts but the heat took a toll and the fumes of the coal he was broken at the wheel oh broken at the wheel by piston loom and anvil boys we clothe and arm the nation if there was any doubt whether she had improvised this verse for the specific benefit of mr wieland he didnt share it his eyes started from their sockets he clenched his fistsin fact his entire body seemed to clench it was as if the deep ocean had taken him in its grip then apparently satisfied with the reaction she had produced calyxa finished the chorus and addressed the agriculturalist billy palumbo singing the indentured men in the owners pen are bought and sold like cattle but a mans got a mind and an owner might find that all he bought is an awful lot of revolutionary chattel oh revolutionary chattel mr palumbo was not accustomed to this kind of insolence any more than mr wieland was i watched with profound apprehension as the veins in and around his face stood forth the legend of the explosive diving tipmen came once more to my mind then inevitably it was deacon hollingsheads turn as she repeated the chorus the deacon glared viciously but calyxa had faced down job and utty blake and she was not to be intimidated by a mere dominion cleric no matter how powerful her voice was her cudgel and she meant to use it she sangcon brio as the composers say the colorado maid was not afraid when the deacons henchmen caught her she suffered in her pride but they beat her till she cried and when her courage grew thin she confessed her sin i was kissed by the deacons daughter oh kissed by the deacons daughter by piston loom and anvil boys there was a sudden flash of light and a thunderous reporti looked apprehensively at deacon hollingsheadbut the deacon was intactit was only that the fireworks had begun out on the great lawn the band abruptly ceased playing and we all adjourned outside with a certain sense of relief calyxa sat next to me breathless from her exertions and i was very proud of her though very worried as the independence day fireworks crackled through the hot night air above the executive palace she had probably just scotched any possibility that my commongold pamphlet would receive the dominion stamp of approval but that didnt matter muchthe pamphlet was doing well enough without it in any case if it had been deklan comstocks intention to humiliate calyxa i believed he had gotten more than he bargained for for the duration of the fireworks display we sat on wooden bleachers there was a special box reserved for the president and a few close allies including i was dismayed to see deacon hollingshead calyxa and i sat with julian and sam and mrs comstock among the lesser eupatridians there are portents to be read at any event like this sam said in a low voice who attends who doesntwho speaks to whomwho smiles who frownsit can all be read the way a fortuneteller reads a deck of cards what fortune do you divine i asked the admiral of the navy isnt here thats unusual there are no representatives from the army of the californiasominous indeed the dominion is favored the senate is ignored i dont know that i can parse such signs well learn more when the president speaks thats when the axe will fall adamif it does fall is the axe literal or metaphorical i inquired anxiously remains to be seen said sam that was alarming but the matter was out of my control and i tried to enjoy the fireworks while they lasted the chinese ambassador had arranged for the importation of some incendiaries from his own republic as a gift to the president the chinese are experts in armaments and gunpowder in fact the presence of that ambassador and his obvious largesse propelled a rumor that deklan comstock was attempting to buy advanced weapons from china as a sort of riposte to the chinese cannon of the dutch the chinese were officially neutral in the war in labrador thereby doubling their supply of potential customers certainly the celestial fire was an excellent advertisement for chinese workmanship i had never seen such a display oh we had had fireworks in williams fordfine ones and they had impressed me in my youth but this event was altogether more spectacular the warm summer air was alive with the smell of cordite and the sky crackled with occult starbursts blue fire whirling salamanders kegbreakers and other such exotic devices it was almost as noisy as an artillery duel and i had to restrain myself from flinching when the bangs and stinks provoked unhappy memories of the war but i reminded myself that this was independence day in manhattan not winter in chicoutimi and calyxa put a soothing arm around me when she saw that i was shaking the spectacle concluded after a good halfhour with a cross of fire that hung over lower manhattan like the benediction of an incendiary angel the band played the starspangled banner the assembled eupatridians applauded vigorously and then it was time for deklan comstock to make the final speech of the evening the executive palace was fully electrified powered by dynamos designed and operated by the unions most cunning engineers a fierce artificial light drenched the stage that was set up for the president this light attracted flying insects in brigade strength and they swooped back and forth as if bathing in it before long a number of bats joined in drawn by the plentiful prey it was as if another feast was being conducted in the air now that our own dinner had concluded he stepped up on the makeshift wooden platform and braced his hands on both sides of the podium then he began to speak he began with homilies and platitudes appropriate to the occasion he spoke about the nation and how it was formed in an act of rebellion against the godless british empire he quoted the great patriotic philosopher of the nineteenth century mr john c calhoun he described how the original nation had been debased by oil and atheism until the reconstruction that followed on the heels of the false tribulation he spoke of the two great generals who had served as presidents in times of national crisis washington and otis and flung about their names as if they were personal friends of his that eventually got him onto the subject of war here his voice became more animated and his gestures bespoke a personal urgency perpetual peace is a dream he said as much as we may yearn for itbut war war is an integral part of gods ordering of the universe without which the world would be swamped in selfishness and materialism war is the very vessel of honor and who of us could endure a world without the divine folly of honor that faith is especially true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty in a cause he little understands during a campaign of which he has little notion under tactics of which he does not see the use a fairly succinct description of the situation in labrador as i remembered it on the field of battle where a man lives or dies by the caprice of a bullet or the verdict of a bayonet life is at its best and healthiest thats a novel definition of health said julian but sam hushed him to date deklan conqueror declared we have had some notable successes in labrador and some regrettable failures failure is inevitable in any war i need not add not every campaign will be brought to a successful conclusion but the number of failures in recent months points to a dismaying possibility i mean the possibility that treason rather than fortune is at work in the army of the laurentians the presidents countenance became abruptly grim and judicial and his audience cringed for that reason i have today taken bold steps to consolidate and improve our armed forces several major generalsi will not name themhave been taken into custody as i speak they will undergo public trials and be given every opportunity to acknowledge and recant their plotting with the dutch sam groaned quietly for the unnamed major generals probably included men he knew and respected the places of these traitors deklan conqueror continued will be filled from the ranks of enlisted men who have distinguished themselves in battle because of this we can look forward to renewed success in our effort to establish control over this sacred continent as a whole and the strategically important waterway to the north of it he paused to sip from a glass of water absent fireworks the night seemed very dark but not all the news is bad far from it we have had our share of successes i need only cite the example of the saguenay campaign and the rescue of the town of chicoutimi from its mitteleuropan occupiers and let me repeat acknowledging a certain familial pride that a key role in that battle was played by my own nephew julian here the president smiled once more and paused in the way that invites applause which the nervous eupatridians hastened to give him come up here julian the president called out and stand beside me this was the humiliation deklan comstock had been storing up all evening putting calyxa on show as a singer was only the prelude to it he would have the son of the man he had murdered stand beside him as an ornament helpless to protest julian at first didnt move it was as if the command had scarcely registered on his senses it was sam who urged him out of the bleachers just do as he says sam whispered in a mournful voice swallow your pride julian this once and do as he saysgo on or hell have us all killed julian gave sam a vacant look but he stood up his journey to the presidential podium was visibly reluctant he mounted the steps to the stage as if he were mounting a scaffold to be hanged which was perhaps not far from the truth dear julian the president said and embraced him just as if he were a true and loving uncle julian didnt return the embrace he kept his hands stiffly at his sides i could see that any physical contact with the fratricidal chief executive was nauseating to him youve seen more of war than most of us though youre still a very young man what was your impression of the saguenay campaign julian blinked at the question it was a bloody business he mumbled but deklan comstock didnt mean to give his nephew the freedom of the podium bloody indeed the president said but were not a nation that flinches at blood nor are we a people constrained by feminine delicacy to us all is permittedeven cruelty yes even ruthlessnessfor were the first in the world to raise the sword not in the name of enslaving and oppressing anyone but in the name of freeing them from bondage we must not be miserly with blood let there be blood if blood alone can drown the old secular world let there be pain and let there be death if pain and death will save us from the twin tyrannies of atheism and europe some cheering erupted though not from our part of the bleachers julian knows firsthand the price and preciousness of liberty he has already risked his life anonymously as a soldier of the line sacrifice enough for any man you might say and in normal times i would agree but these arent normal times the enemy presses barbarous weapons are deployed against our soldiers the northeastern wilds swarm with foreign encampments and the precincts of newfoundland are once again in jeopardy therefore we are called upon to make sacrifices he paused at that ominous word we are all called upon to make sacrifices i dont exclude myself i as much as any citizen have to forego my own happiness if it contradicts the greater national purpose and as pleased as i am to have my brothers son back in the bosom of my family a soldier with julians skill cant be spared at this critical hour for that reason i have already relieved from duty major general griffin of the northern division of the army of the laurentians and i intend to replace him with my own beloved nephew the audience gasped at the boldness of the proclamation it was a great benevolence on the part of the president or so he wanted us to think the eupatridians burst into another round of applause encouraging shouts of julian julian comstock went up into the gunpowderscented night but julians mother didnt join in the bellowing she seemed to grow weak and put her head on calyxas shoulder first bryce she whispered now julian this is the axe i spoke of said sam act four a season in the land god gave to cain thanksgiving god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty first corinthians i will not exhaust the reader by narrating every incident that attended on our dispatch to labrador prior to the triumphant and tragic events surrounding the thanksgiving season of our departure that is and not just julians because the recalledtobattle order proclaimed by deklan conqueror also included sam godwin and myself in short i was compelled to leave my wife of a few months and my brief career as a new york city writer and to sail off to labrador as part of the staff of major general julian comstockand not to one of the pleasanter sections of labrador such as the saguenay river but to an even more inhospitable and unwelcoming region of that disputed state on a mission the true purpose of which was to turn julian from an awkward potential heir into a silent and untroublesome martyr in midoctober we left new york harbor on a navy clipper and sailed north this was a weathery time of year in the atlantic and we survived a ferocious storm in which our vessel was tossed about like a flea on the rump of an irritable stallion before we rendezvoused with a fleet of ships under admiral fairfield off the port of belle isle now in american hands the union navy is not as powerful a political entity as the nations two great armies to which it is attached as a nautical wing but just lately it had harassed the mitteleuropans more effectively than had our landbased forces deklan comstock in one of his few genuinely useful strategic initiatives had declared a comprehensive blockade of european shipping in the waters off newfoundland and labrador this had been attempted before with disappointing results but todays navy was larger that it used to be and better equipped to conduct such an ambitious project i was aboard the flagship of the armada the basilisk during the famous battle of hamilton inlet the dutch had been aware of our movements for an enormous battlefleet is a difficult thing to disguise but they had mistakenly assumed that we meant to attack them near voisey bay from which they export the nickel copper and cobalt ores that are mined so abundantly in labrador the many small islands and waterways in that region make voisey bay a haven for blockade runners even when its under heavy surveillance but we had been given a bolder objective than that we put in for hamilton inlet instead and while the dutch were hunting us farther north our guns silenced their fortress at the narrows and we quickly reduced their artillery emplacements at rigolet and eskimo island because the dutch defenses werent braced for us we suffered relatively minor casualties of the twenty gunships in our flotilla only one the griffin was altogether lost five others suffered damage the ships carpenters were able to repair and our ship was altogether untouched even though we had been in the vanguard of the battle a detachment of the first northern division was sent ashore to occupy and restore the captured forts it was a grand day and sunny though chill when we saw the sixty stars and thirteen stripes rise above the narrows signifying our command of all shipping through that milewide bottleneck ahead of us lay the immense body of water called lake melville which was fed by the naskaupi and churchill river watersheds to the south rose the gray blunttoothed mealy mountainsa daunting sight when not obscured by cloud invisibly distant were our true objectives the dutchheld towns of shesh and striver and the allimportant railhead at goose bay julian and sam were occupied during much of this time with military planning and consultations with admiral fairfield but on this particular afternoon julian came up to where i was planking the deck and joined me i had made it a point to befriend some of the sailors and i picked up a little of their salt slang which i thought would lend verisimilitude to the novels i planned to write it was the antique explorer jacques cartier julian said who had called labrador the land god gave to cain and cain went out from the presence of the lord to dwell in the land of nod in the eastern part of eden genesis it doesnt mention anything about lake melville or goose bay though it was colder then of course he added its not as barren as all that nowadaysthough i would dislike to be a farmer here no wonder cain was so sullen i said pulling my duffle coat more snugly around me for the wind was harsh and cutting and the sailors on watch had hunkered down among the rope coils where they could swear freely and smoke pipes in fact the land was not literally barren it produced rich crops of black spruce and white birch balsam fir and trembling aspen and in the chilly shadows of those trees lived caribou and such hardy creatures as that waterfowl were plentiful i had heard in the warmer months but labradors forests were bleak and the land in general was not a welcoming place for the race of man at least weve cut back the dutch and lived to tell about it i said the three of ussam julian and iunderstood that this expedition wasnt meant to be survived at least not by major general comstock but julian argued that any campaign even the most apparently hopeless might turn on a small contingency and produce unexpected results usually this observation worked to buoy my spirits but today despite our recent naval victory a little of november had crept into my soul i was a long way from home and apprehensive if i expected julian to repeat his reassurances on this occasion he did not the worst is ahead of us he admitted admiral fairfield has orders to land the infantry at striver for an attack on goose bayand goose bay wont be easy pickings theyll know were comingtheir telegraphs must already be chattering i looked out across the windy gray waters abaft of us its not myself im afraid for so much as calyxa shes alone in new york city shes already earned the enmity of deacon hollingshead and for all i know she may have offended other authorities in the meantime she has my mother to defend her julian said i thank your mother but i wish i could do the job myself youll be back at calyxas side soon enough if i have anything to do with it deklan conqueror had banked on julians youth and lack of experience to make him an easy target for the dutch but the president had almost certainly underestimated his nephew julian was young and many of the troops he commanded had initially balked at taking orders from a yellowbearded boy but julian had covertly arranged for copies of my pamphlet to circulate among the literate soldiers who read it aloud or summarized its contents for the nonreaders and his reputation had grown accordingly nor was julian as ignorant as deklan comstock might have hoped under sams tutelage he had long studied war in the abstract and during the saguenay campaign he had been able to compare theory with practice perhaps well return to manhattan in triumph i said yes and force my uncle to find a more prosaic way of killing me well outlast old deklan conqueror i said keeping my voice low sam believes we will i hope hes right in the meantime adam look at you youre shiveringshouldnt you be in your cabin recording the heroism of the hour my cabin was close enough to the bilge that fresh air was often desirable no matter how cold it might be but julian was right i had agreed to keep a narrative of events for publication in the spark the fall of eskimo island would make an exciting episode with little need for dramatic exaggeration i will i said i had already produced many thousands of words i hoped they would be in some sense useful but none of them would float the basilisk if she were holed below the waterline or deflect for a moment the enemys missiles i left julian on deck he continued to stand at the taffrail gazing back toward the narrows as if lost in his thoughts his eyes were shadowed by the brim of his major generals hat and his blue and yellow jacket flapped in the chill wind off the mealy mountains once the narrows had been secured we sailed for striver a town on the north shore of lake melville we found a handful of dutch warships anchored there they were formidable craft heavily armored and heavily armed but we came hard at them in the first light of dawn and before their anchors were well up we had already sheered their masts with cannonfire and put a few dents in their armored flanks the basilisk took heavy fire that day i sheltered with the infantrymen belowdecks while the sailors fought above and i was present when a solid shot struck us amidships such a projectile could not penetrate the plating that protected the basilisks engine room and boilers but it could and did pierce the wooden hull just where we sat i wasnt injured in the explosion but huge splinters speared several men who were situated near the bulkhead and a freshlydrafted kentucky leaseboy suffered a crushed skull which spilled his brains out on the deck and was fatal after that i could hear nothing but the sound of the artillery battle and the screaming of the wounded the basilisk fired one cannonade after another both shot and shell from its big guns at one point i risked a look through the newlycreated window in the side of the ship but i could see nothing save the hull of a dutch vessel very close byand i ducked back hastily when the business end of a dutch cannon still smoking hove into view several times our vessel shook in the water like a palsied dog until i was certain we must have lost our engines and i fully expected the deadly waters of lake melville to rush over us in an icy flood at any moment but that was only the stink of the blood and the gunpowder making me giddy eventually the battle ended then julian himself came down to the hold where the infantrymen were huddled to tell us that we had conquered the enemy and taken control of the harbor i went up with him to survey the results smoke still hovered over the lake for there was no wind to dispel it the sky was overcast one of the basilisks masts was down and a gang of sailors was busy casting the remnants of it overboard the damage we had sustained was not critical but other ships in our small armada had been more severely hurt the christabel was burning steadily and the beatrice rode perilously low in the water the dutch had had the worst of it however of the eight ships defending the town of striver fully six had sunk with only fractions of them showing where their hulls rested on the stony lakebottom the two still afloat were mastless and gouting black smoke we sent out boats to pick up survivors basilisk and her sister vessels had also placed a few strategic shots among the buildings and warehouses at the foot the towns main thoroughfare an action that caused white flags to be sent up where the defiant mitteleuropan banner had lately flown signifying a wholesale surrender weve reclaimed a little piece of america adam julian said the homeland is enlarged by a few square miles i dont know how you can be cynical after winning such a battle im not cynical the victory was tremendous but its admiral fairfields not mine ive done nothing useful on this expedition except drill my men on the quarterdeck but thats about to change this is where we land the infantry he explained that all the footsoldiers in our flotilla would go ashore this day two entire divisions would soon follow if the troopships were on schedule and our garrisons continued to hold the narrows when the army was landed and assembled julian would lead it to goose bay by road while the admiral and his flotilla shelled that town from a distance and kept the dutch defenders busy i promised i wouldnt get in his way if i could help it youre not in my way dont you know youre one of my most trusted advisors i dont recall giving any advice as such its not your advice i value so much as your sensibility you give me too much credit and youre my friend thats a scarce commodity in the circles weve moved in lately my friendship at least you can rely on and my pittsburgh rifle when it comes to fighting on solid ground itll come to fighting soon enough said julian turning his face away as from an ugly truth more than two thousand additional infantrymen were landed at striver over the next several days ferried in from bases in newfoundland under the admirals protection all the dutch soldiers in striver were taken captive and sent back in the emptied troopships to the warprisoner encampments on the gaspé peninsula harmless citizens of striver were advised to stay indoors if possible and a strict curfew was imposed on our part discipline was stern enough to prevent the sort of largescale theft rape pillage and arson that local citizens invariably find distressing we didnt lack for provisions since the rail line had been recently extended from goose bay with striver acting as an alternative offloading point for european goods bound for the interior of labrador the stadhouders like their luxuries dockside warehouses yielded slabs of smoked fish barrels of uninfested wheat flour huge wheels of odorous cheese and similar interesting items i walked with julian among the newlyarrived troops a few days after we landed i had been assigned the rank of colonel for the duration of my reenlistment mainly to justify my presence on julians immediate staff and i was just another faceless officer to most of these men though several of them had read my adventures of captain commongold and might have recognized my name had i announced it julian himself of course was famously recognizable by his rank his youth his yellow beard and his immaculate uniform men saluted him or attempted to shake his hand as we walked down a rank of bunks that had been installed in an empty stable daylight came through a gap in the roof made by an artillery shell and julian stood in that shaft of cold illumination like a saint in a painting he had mastered the art not only of appearing confident but of generating confidence as if courage were heat and julian was a hardcoal stove it made his men better and more loyal soldiers because they had come to believe in him as a military prodigy i expect they would have tugged his beard for luck if that impertinence had been allowed i looked about the sea of faces surrounding him hoping to catch sight of someone from our old montreal regiment lymon pugh would have been a welcome presence but i didnt see him the only face i did recognize was perhaps unfortunately that of the larcenous private langers who had not advanced in rank since our last meeting when i approached him he turned his cadaverously thin body away and tried to escape but the crowd was too thick for that maneuver to succeed private langers i called out he stopped short and turned back at first he was intimidated by my new rank and station and tried to pretend i had mistaken him for someone else but he relented at last and said is that sam samson around somewhere i hope not you were always decent to me adam hazzard but that old man had me pummeled for being a crookhe seems to have no faith in me at all his name is godwin now not samson and hes on julians staff but i doubt you have anything to fear from either one of them neither sam nor julian are disposed to hold grudges i expect youll do fine if you keep quiet and dont shirk from battle in any case you seem to be in excellent health though his nose sat a little more crookedly than i remembered it are you still selling battlefield trinkets he blushed at the question and said none to sell right at the moment dont mean to rule anything out of course i hope you dont continue to rob the dead and swindle the living im a reformed man private langers said not that im averse to a dollar here and there honestly extracted im glad to hear it i said about being reformed i mean ill pass that on to sam and julian thank you very kindly but please dont bother them on my behalf id just as soon remain anonymous tell me adami mean colonel hazzardis it true what they say about this expedition hard to say since i dont know who they are or what it is theyre supposed to be saying that we have a secret weapon to use against the dutchsomething deadly and chinese and unexpected i told him i knew nothing about it if so but im not sure he believed my disclaimers later in the command quarters we had established in upstairs chambers of the house of the former mayor of striver julian was philosophical when i told him private langers was among us if langers is a reformed man then my uncle is a philosopher but as long as langers can carry a rifle hes as good as the next soldier im more interested in this notion of a secret chinese weapon is there such a thing i asked hopefully no of course there isnt but it might be useful to morale if the army believes there is dont spread that particular rumor adam but dont discourage it if you hear it the next day i walked through camp once more i found private langers and a number of other infantrymen gambling at dice in an alley behind a looted tavern they didnt notice me and i didnt disturb them perhaps it didnt matter if they wasted their money i reasoned they might be dead before much longer and wouldnt be able to collect their back pay much less spend it sensibly of course gambling is a sin as well as a vice but they could make their own reckoning with heaven if a man arrived at the last judgment with bullet holes in him acquired in the defense of his country would he really be dismissed on account of a habit of dice or cards i didnt think so julian had made at least that much of an agnostic of me next morning the troopships stopped arriving at striver that was an ominous sign the ships had been coming down the narrows like clockwork prior to this time bringing men and goods and articles of war but we were still not up to the full strength allotted us in the general military planning it wasnt that the army already assembled was insignificant the navy had delivered two full divisions of three thousand men apiece including a detachment of cavalry along with their mounts also a fullyequipped field hospital and an artillery brigade with brandnew fieldpieces and ample supplies of ammunition on paper it was a formidable force although several hundred of those men were already suffering from complaints ranging from seasickness to contagious fevers rendering them unsuited for battle but we had hoped to face the enemy with ten thousand ablebodied soldiers altogetherbecause that was roughly the number of dutch troops believed to be defending goose bay a force that would be reinforced by rail very soon if it hadnt been already julian spent most of the day at the docks peering across the troubled waters of lake melville with the intensity of a sailors widow i had gone out to summon him back to a hot dinner and a conference with his subcommanders when a sail at last hove into view but it was only the basilisk which had been across the lake at the town of shesh a smaller locality than striver now also in american hands the admiral came ashore in one of the basilisks boats and joined us for the evening meal i havent described admiral fairfield before suffice to say that he was even older than sam godwin but active and alert a veteran of many sea battles and with the political indifference common among navy men for the navy unlike the two armies was seldom called upon to settle arguments over the ascension to power of commanders in chief the navy in short never marched to new york city for the purpose of making kings it simply fought the enemy at sea and took pride in that tradition and that was the way admiral fairfield liked it he wore a gray beard its great length commensurate with his age and station and tonight he frowned through his whiskers even though the beefsteak set before him was excellent the best the commissary could come up with where are my men was the first thing julian asked of the admiral as soon as we were seated the ships dont come through the narrows the admiral said bluntly do we still hold the dutch forts securely melville is an american lake now as far as naval power goes something must be interfering with the transit between newfoundland and hamilton inlet for all i know there might have been an ambuscade at sea or something of that nature but the news hasnt reached rigolet or eskimo island if so im not sure i can postpone the march to goose bay any longer we lose out advantage if we have any with every hour that passes i understand your concern the admiral said i wouldnt wait if i were you march with the thousands you have is my advice julian forced a smile though he clearly didnt like the way events were trending as long as the navy is there to support us with her guns i suppose the risk might be acceptable admiral fairfield said with all the gravity that was in him which was very much you have my word major general comstock that the basilisk will be offshore when you and your army arrive at goose bay the dutch might sink every other vessel in the flotilla but you wont be abandoned if i have anything to say about it i thank you said julian this is a bold campaign some might say foolish certainly the odds are long but a strike at the dutch vitals in labrador is overdue then we wont let it wait any longer julian turned to sam well march in the morning he said were still low on horses and mules dont short the cavalry if you can help it but make sure the fieldpieces arent left behind very well shall i give the news to the men no ill do it said julian after dinner the news of an imminent march quelled many appetites among the regimental commanders but julian ate heartily arrangements were made to bed down the admiral until morning then julian and his subordinates set out to communicate orders to the men i tagged along for journalistic purposes we went to each of the buildings that had been set aside as shelters for the infantrymen and to the cavalry quarters and finally to the general camp established in the town square the meetings were mostly uneventful and the men accepted the news cheerfully for they were eager for a fight we entered one structure formerly a sports arena in which five hundred veteran soldiers were sheltering from the cold night came early in the northern parts of the world at that time of year and november in labrador would pass for january in a more hospitable section of the country a number of coal stoves had been installed in the building and the men had gathered around these and they were singing piston loom and anvil in loud and imperfect harmony when we entered a colonel named abijah who had dined with us was embarrassed by their behavior and he shouted out orders to cease singing and stand to attention as soon as the men became aware of us they fell silent they were perhaps a little slow in their thinking for among the other luxuries imported by the dutch had been a few bales of cultivated indian hemp some of which had begun to circulate among the troops until sam had the contraband placed under guard julian stood up on a barrelhead and addressed them tomorrow the caissons roll for goose bay he said simply its a days march and we may see action by the end of it are all of you prepared they shouted yes in unison or cried out hooah or made similar martial exclamations for their spirits were high good julian said he looked hardly more than a child in the lantern lightmore like a boy playing soldier than a grizzled generalbut that just suited the infantry who had grown fond of the idea of being led by the youthful hero of the saguenay i believe you were singing when i came in please dont let me stop you there was some uneasiness over this these were men who had worked in industry before they were drafted or had herded horses on rural estates or were the living donations of landowners who held them in indenture for all their loyalty they remained conscious of julians status as an aristo and some of them were ashamed of what they had been singing as if it were an insult to his class which in a real sense it was but julian clapped his hands and began it for themby piston loom and anvil boys in his reedy but heartfelt tenor and before the chorus was finished the whole group had joined in and at the end of a few verses they cheered lustily and called out general julian or julian comstock orthe first time i had heard this formulation julian conqueror for reasons i couldnt fathom the sound of hundreds of men shouting julian conqueror caused a melancholy shiver to run up my spine and the night seemed colder for it but julian only smiled and accepted the mens regard as if it were his due the battle of goose bay has been much described elsewhere and i will not weary the reader with details of our maneuvers nor tease out the minutiae of those tragic days i rode near julian in the forefront of our army in the cold low sunlight of the morning we were by all appearances a formidable body of men julian rode a muscular grayandwhite stallion at the very forefront of the troops with the campaign flag carried by a mounted adjutant just behind him the flag of the goose bay campaign had been designed by julian himself it showed a red boot against a yellow orb on a starry black background and carried the legend we have stepped upon the moon most of the troops understood the story of americans on the moon as a fable rather than historical fact but it was a bracing boast and implied to the enemy that we were experienced at treading on things and that they might be next the road from striver to goose bay was a fine one paved in the dutch manner so that our carts and caissons were not bogged down even though the land around us was all icy fens and jagged rock and stands of spruce whenever we marched over a slight rise i made a point of looking back at the chain of men mules ammunition carts hospital wagons etc strung out behind us it was a heartening sight and if we felt invincible that morning perhaps the error was understandable the cavalry scouted ahead of us and every so often a man on horseback would report allclear ahead we made good time until the afternoon when the cavalry began to encounter pickets and there was some mild skirmishing almost simultaneously we came under attack from small groups of dutch riders who knew these woods and string bogs intimately and used them to their advantage none of this amounted to mucha few shots fired from cover a few horses frightened a few men nicked with lead one regiment or another would make quick work of the attackers or at least chase them away but if such fleabites did not damage us materially they did succeed in slowing us down julian and his subordinate commanders did their best to keep the army in good order our objective was a line of low ridges where he believed the bulk of the dutch army was encamped soon enough our scouts confirmed that suspicion the dutch entrenchments straddled the road on the outskirts of the town of goose bay their positions were wellchosen and dislodging them would not be simple we camped for the night just out of range of these enemy emplacements the infantrymen dug holes where the ground was yielding and after dark by subtle moonlight the artillerymen hauled their guns to forward positions once the moon was down a tenuous blue aurora shivered in the sky the temperature dropped and the breath of sleeping men rose up like luminous smoke in the morning the battle began julian had studied the way armies maneuver in the field and he had made sure his regimental commanders were up to the task of understanding and enacting his orders although he remained at a command tent in the rear of the actionand sam and i with himhe pored over maps all the while and messengers transited in and out of his headquarters as busily as ants at a picnic all morning the artillery roared relentlessly theirs and ours we were outnumbered but the dutch had not positioned themselves to their best advantage not knowing which way julian would attack they had reinforced their flanks and neglected their middle julian abetted their confusion by feinting left and right but stored up his big guns for a frontal charge this began about noon and was bloody we lost nearly a thousand men in the battle that came to be called goose gap and five hundred more were trucked away in dominion wagons with missing limbs or other disabling injuries by nightfall the battlefield resembled the wastebin of a remedial school for inept butchers i will not describe the odors that began to arise from it the mitteleuropans fled their positions as soon as we were close enough to bring our trench sweepers to bear we captured dozens of prisoners and after some mopping up of stray pockets of re sis tance the day was ours we had taken the low ridge that was the gateway to goose bay and we hastily occupied and strengthened the former dutch defenses there the dutch commander arranged under a flag of truce to remove his dead and injured from the battlefield that was a mournful sightforeign soldiers stumbling with carts among the corpses accompanied by the terrible groans of the dyingand no doubt disappointing to private langers who would be denied the luxury of looting the enemy dead julian relocated his headquarters and the campaign flag to an elevated position from which we could see the town and the harbor of goose bay as well as the surviving dutch forces who were hastily rolling out cutwire and building abatisses in anticipation of a siege julian used this perspective to mark his maps and he was still examining those maps by lamplight as midnight approached my typewriter had been brought up in a wagon along with other supplies appropriate to a mobile headquarters and i sat in a corner of the same huge tent recording the events of that notable day at last fatigue overcame me but before i departed for my own cot i told julian we had won a great victory and that he ought to rest now that it had been achieved i cant afford to rest he said rubbing his eyes he looked gaunt and distracted and i pitied him it might seem unjust to feel sympathy for a major general who had not lifted a rifle on a day when thousands of men had sacrificed lives and limbs on his behalf but it seemed to me that julian had lived the struggle of every soldier under his command at least in his imagination and suffered each loss as though the bullets had pierced his own body he identified closely with his men and always took pains to see that they were fed and rested and this had helped to make him popular among them but he paid for it now in stress and in grief of course you can afford to rest i said gently youll be a better officer for it he rose from his camp table stretching and together we stepped outside away from the portable stove the air was very cold and the fires of the enemy smoldered like coals in the flatlands ahead of us see all that weve won i said im content with what i see said julian apart from the number of the dead what worries me is what i dont see well its dark after all what dont you see the cavalry detachment i sent to tear up tracks behind the enemys lines for one not a man of them has reported back if the rail connection to goose bay remains intact reinforcements will begin to arrive and keep on arriving its no easy job bending rails and blowing up bridges probably the cavalry was just detained in its work and the harbor at goose bay what do you make out by this light adam it seems peaceful there was a glow in the skya dusty patch of the northern lights which waxed and wanedand i saw a few masts and ships at anchordutch commercial shipping i supposed they threw all their gunboats against us at striver and lost them i see the same what i dont see is any american ship of war i had hoped admiral fairfield would be shelling goose bay by now or at least positioning his vessels that was true and the absence seemed ominous now that he pointed it out to me perhaps theyll arrive in the morning i said perhaps said julian wearily i have not yet said very much about sam godwin and his role in these events thats not because his part was insignificant but because it was performed in intimate consultation with julian and i didnt participate directly in battleplanning i had learned all my strategy and tactics from the war narratives of mr charles curtis easton in which every attack is fierce and bold and nearly fails but finally succeeds by some combination of luck and american ingenuity these circumstances are more easily arranged on the printed page than on the field of battle but sam pored over the maps just as intently as did julian and brought his greater experience into play he did not attempt to take command but made himself sympathetic to julians suggestions and seldom contradicted them but only offered nuance in their refinement i supposed this was the role he had played with julians father bryce during the successful isthmian war and at times when the two of them put their heads together i could imagine that twenty years of history had been rolled back and that this was the command tent of the army of the californias though julians unusual yellow beard belied the daydream as did the cold november weather julian in any case succeeded in maintaining a fragile optimism about the campaign while sam though he tried not to show it was obviously less hopeful ever since we sailed from manhattan all humor had fled from him he didnt joke or laugh at jokes he scowled instead and there was a glitter in his eye that might have been fear sternly suppressed i expect sam had concluded that he might not see new york city or more importantly emily baines comstock ever again in this earthly life and it was my fervent wish that julian might succeed in proving him wrong but the events of the next day were not encouraging the dutch counterattacked at dawn perhaps they had done some scouting of their own and calculated that our army while intimidating was not as large as they feared or perhaps reinforcements had arrived by rail during the night whatever the case their resolve had grown firm and their courage was not lacking though the defenders of goose bay lacked a chinese cannon their field artillery outranged ours by several hundred yards they had figured that difference finely and used it to their advantage shot and shell pummeled our forward ranks and masked their first advance our men soon brought their own weapons to bear including the formidable trench sweeper but the dutch had come ahead too quickly for our fieldpieces to be of much use against them and an important hill along with an entire artillery battery was captured before julian or his lieutenants could react all that morning i heard the unceasing roar of cannonry and the cries of wounded men as they were carried back from the front dutch and american regiments went at one another like clashing sabers shooting off sparks of blood and mayhem messengers arrived and departed with desperation in their eyes and each one seemed more exhausted than the last an entire battalion collapsed on our right flank driven back by cannonade although reinforcements held the positionbarely noon passed and the smoke of the battle continued to rise like a crowcolored obelisk into the wan and windless sky panic is our greatest enemy now sam said grimly julian stepped away from his maptable throwing down a pencil in frustration where is the navy theres nothing happening here the shelling of goose bay wouldnt correct admiral fairfield promised us his armada sam said and i believe he meant it whatever keeps him it must be dire we cant count on him arriving do you suppose this was my uncles plan all alongto plant us here among the dutch and then withdraw the navy i wouldnt put it past him the point is that we dont have the navy and we cant expect to have the navy and without the navy we cant hold our position much longer we will hold them julian said flatly if the dutch flank us and take the road we wont be able to retreat to striverand thatll be the end of us well hold julian said until we know for a fact that fairfield isnt coming he doesnt strike me as a man who would abandon a promise he wouldnt though he might be unable to fulfill it for any number of reasons but julian refused to be swayed to the rear of the fighting there was a hill with an old spruce tree on it and julian posted an agile man atop this tree as if it were a mizzenmast on an oceangoing vessel and gave him a sailors chore to watch lake melville for ships thus any hint of admiral fairfields tardy arrival would be relayed directly to julians headquarters as soon as it was perceived in the meantime he bowed to sams suggestion and gathered his subordinates to plan an orderly retreat should it become necessary if we must withdraw julian said then it ought to be a fighting withdrawal making the enemy pay for every yard of mossy soil he gained julian described how troops could be placed along ridges and behind the humped earth of the railway embankment so that dutch soldiers in pursuit of a retreating regiment might be drawn into an ambush and killed messages were quickly sent out to battalion commanders to coordinate this strategy and to keep the planned fallback from turning into a general rout the scheme was successful in so far as it went our front buckledor so it was made to seemand mitteleuropan forces poured into the gap the dutch infantry were hooting and firing their rifles in triumph just as rows of hidden men turned trench sweepers on them and artillery shells began to burst in their midst their crossandlaurel flag which had been coming ahead at full speed was suddenly thrown down along with its bearer and dozens of common soldiers dutch troops continued to pour into the line of fire from the rear but they roiled over their dead comrades uncertainly and were slaughtered in turn it was a hideously costly advance for the dutch but in the end it was an advance hardwon or not sam argued that we should strike our headquarters immediately and get the wagons rolling back toward striver where we could at least supply ourselves in the event of a siege then julians crowsnest observer dashed into the tent and told us he had seen smoke across the water julian stepped outside taking a pair of captured field glasses with him his position was more exposed than it would have been even an hour agodutch shells burst dismayingly nearbybut he stood unmoved in his bright major generals uniform looking out over the leaden waters of lake melville smoke he confirmed when sam and i joined him a vessel approaching under steam burning anthracite by the look of it which makes it likely one of ours and after a moments pause a mast a flag our flag he turned to sam with a kind of fierce satisfaction in his eyes tell the men to hold their positions at all costs julian sam said none of your pessimism right now sam please but we dont know for certain we dont know anything for certainbattle is risk give the order and sam like a dutiful servant did so ten minutes later the whole ship was visible and it was the familiar basilisk admiral fairfields vessel we expected the rest of the american armada to follow in its wake but we were mistaken in that hope soon it became obvious that there was the basilisk and there was only the basilisk i cannot describe julians appearance as this unwelcome truth sank home his skin took on an additional pallor his eyes grew haggard his bright blue and yellow garb which he had worn so boldly clung to his slumped shoulders like an admonition admiral fairfield did what he could with his single ship the basilisk was one of the finest vessels of the navy and he worked it ingeniously he came in under full steam all sails reefed the ships stacks gouting smoke as if half the coal in all the world were burning belowdecks he slid obliquely past the dutch wharves at goose bay strafing the town with wellplaced cannon shots then he came up the shoreline and attempted to shell the mitteleuropan positions where we fought that bombardment would have helped us enormously had it succeeded but the dutch shore batteries were wellmanned and wellentrenched they raked the basilisk in return she withstood the barrage for many minutes trying to work in close enough to be of some use to us but the closer she got the more vulnerable she became her masts were nearly chewed away and flames had broken out on her forecastle by the time she finally gave up the attempt she could do nothing but limp away while her engines were still capable of turning her screws she seemed to be headed for striver or some other protected place uplake julian watched until she was nearly out of sight then he turned and ordered sam to call a general retreat his voice sounded as chill and eerie as if it emanated from a gap in some old hollow log sam was glum as well and walked off speechlessly shaking his head a retreat is not as glamorous a thing as an attack but it can be accomplished either well or badly and julian deserves credit for a careful withdrawal from the disaster goose bay had become still it was a costly and humiliating maneuver by the time we were in acceptable form for a forced march to striver the dutch were swarming at our backs julian assigned fresh troops in so far as we had any to the rear and their careful feintandfallback operations helped protect the bulk of the army much of our cavalry had been lost in the futile foray behind the mitteleuropan lines so we were vulnerable to sniping from dutch horsemen their detachments came at us from oblique angles attempting to cut away companies of american troops and take them in detail more than a few infantrymen were scooped up in this fashion but whenever such a firefight erupted julian would ride to the place like a human battleflag to shore up morale and we fought these battles with a ferocity that appeared to startle and unnerve our opponents by sundown we were within sight of the outskirts of striver messengers had warned the garrison that we would be arriving under dutch harassment and a defensive perimeter with abattises and lunettes and clean lines of fire had already been established these were a welcome sight for battered survivors the dominion wagons went in ahead of us so that their cargo of wounded men could be received by the field hospital julian and sam and i along with them helped fight the rearguard action while the bulk of our men sought the safety of the captive town this went well enough for a time for the dutch had straggled in their pursuit and couldnt put together a formal assault but as soon as their artillery came up we were in a ticklish situation explosive shells landing in a tight mass of men all of whom are within sprinting distance of safety are a perfect recipe for death and panic thats what happened in terms of actual losses it wasnt too badstrivers defenders silenced the dutch cannons as soon they could range in on thembut the mossy ground in front of our entrenchments was quickly watered with a great deal of patriotic blood and festooned with other patriotic body parts during that long cold and terrible dusk julian on his horse was a conspicuous target and i was astonished that he was not picked off immediately by some farsighted dutch rifleman butas in the battle of mascouche outside of montrealhe seemed wrapped in some cloak of invulnerability which warded off hot lead the miraculous protection didnt extend to those beside him our battleflag went down when a staff officers horse was killed by shrapnel from an exploding shell sam dismounted at once and stooped to retrieve the banner but he had barely raised it again when a dutch bullet took him and he toppled to the ground i dont remember exactly the events that followed except that i rallied two men who helped me carry sam to a dominion wagon where he was stacked with a dozen other wounded soldiers awaiting treatment the ambulance driver flogged his mules when i told him he had one of julians staff aboard and i rode along with him to the makeshift hospital in that wide street in striver called portage sams wound was in his left arm below the elbow i couldnt tell whether it was a bullet or shrapnel that had struck him whatever it was it had broken the narrow bones above the wrist and torn away so much flesh that what remained was little more than tags and tatters his entire left hand was nearly severed and kept its association with his body only by the merest hinge of bloody gristle he was conscious though groggy and pale and he told me to tie a tourniquet about his arm to staunch the prodigious bleeding i did so i was glad to be helpful and did not mind the blood which spattered across my already torn uniform so much of it that when we arrived at the hospital an attendant looked at me wideeyed and asked me where i was hurt the hospital was already crowded and quickly becoming more so as cartloads of injured men were unloaded at the door three medics were in attendance but two of them were already engaged in operations that couldnt be interrupted luckily there was a kind of triagebyrank being practiced and the third doctor came promptly at the announcement of sams high position the doctor made a hasty inspection of sams injury and announced that it wanted an amputation sam did not like this idea and began a feeble protest until the medic doused a cloth with liquid from a brown bottle and held it against sams mouth which caused the patients eyes to close and his struggles to abate it looked more like murder than mercy but the physician rolling up one of sams eyelids to inspect his pupils seemed satisfied with the result how does inhaling through that rag cure his wound i asked the doctor took notice of my presence for the first time it doesnt he said it only makes it easier for me to do my work what are you to this man his adjutant i said and added his friend well now youre an assistant surgeon i beg your pardon but im not yes you are my name is dr linch you colonel adam hazzard he grabbed a cotton smock from a nearby shelf and threw it at me cover yourself with this colonel hazzard have you washed your hands lately yes just a couple of days ago dip them in that bucket on the table the bucket contained an astringent chemical of some kind which burned the small cuts i had acquired over the course of the retreat from goose bay but it dissolved away most of the dirt it had been used for this purpose before me i deduced for the liquid was discolored with oily scum and old blood and rinse a bone saw there while youre at it linch said pointing at a nastylooking bladed thing which i dipped in the same bucket and dried on the cleanest part of an old towel now steady his arm while i cut dr linch was a brusque man and didnt brook debate i had never witnessed an amputation before at least at close range linch was not a young man but his hands were remarkably steady and i admired his quickness even as i suppressed an urge to flee i was fascinated in the least pleasant sense of that word by the efficiency of his bonecutting he was very neat about sealing the blood vessels which extended from the stump of sams forearm once the grisly surgery was complete linch kept a number of sewing needles in the lapel of his white jacket and each needle was fitted with a length of silk thread at intervals the doctor would pluck one of these needles and use it to stitch a leaking vein his hands moving with a brisk familiarity that made me think of a fisherman baiting a hook with a pulsing blue wormleaving a few inches loose so the thread could be pulled out again once the stump had healed he insisted on explaining these procedures as he worked even though the thought of it made me queasy and i resolved that i would never undertake a medical career even if the job of writing fiction failed to pan out it was as bad as boning beef it seemed to meworse in some ways since beef carcasses dont wake up screaming as theyre flensed and need to be sedated a second time i couldnt watch the surgery too closely without experiencing a degree of nausea and whenever possible i looked away though the room was full of beds occupied by men just as badly injured as sam if not worse and the sight of them offered little relief amputation was the chief cure being applied by the medics the grating sound of the bone saws never altogether ceased a blooddrenched orderly came through the room at intervals to collect severed limbs for disposal when he took what remained of sams left hand from the floor where dr linch had dropped it this unusual act brought home the horror of the occasion in a way the surgery itself had not i wanted to retrieve the handcarrying it off so casually seemed disrespectful and i couldnt silence the thought that sam might want it again in the future i had to clench my teeth to steady my nerves during one of these unsuccessful attempts to distract myself i caught sight of a face i recognized in a novel context a tall gaunt individual wearing a dominion hat moved among the wounded and the dying offering solace and words from the bible he recognized me too and tried but failed to keep his face avertedthis individual was none other than private langers i was outraged but said nothing until sams stump had had its skinflaps sewn together for fear of distracting dr linch from that important work as soon as he had wrapped the last bandage however i said dr linch theres an impostor here and pointed out langers to him that man is no dominion officer i know all about it dr linch said indifferently you do why dont you throw him out then because he serves a purpose there are no genuine dominion officers to be had julian conqueror barred them from the expedition and for the most part thats not a bad thing since we havent had to endure their sunday scoldings but a dying soldier generally wants a godly man beside him and seldom inquires into the pastors pedigree when i asked for a volunteer among the troopssomeone anyone even if his only religious office was passing the plate at churchthis man langers raised his hand the rest were afraid of missing the action or of appearing cowardly im sure those concerns werent foremost in private langerss mind what religious experience does he claim to have he says he used to be a colporteur distributing pamphlets on sacred subjects i explained that langerss pamphlets had been little more than pornographic guides to behavior not approved of by biblical authorities and that langers himself was a fraud and a habitual liar has a dominion officer ever been disqualified on those grounds dont bother about him colonel hazzardhe may be a cracked vessel but we dont own a better one just now i took dr linchs advice perhaps it wasnt as cynical as it sounded as i left the surgical ward i overheard langers giving solace to a man who had suffered a ghastly head injury the victims one good eye was fixed on langers while the larcenous private misquoted what were perhaps the only bible verses he had ever learned verbatim from the song of solomon mingled with passages from the banned poet whitman how much better is love than wine he intoned in a soothing voice one hand poised in a benediction and a sly sweet smile on his lips divine am i inside and out and i make holy whatever i touch or am touched from in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass awake oh north wind and come thou south and blow through this garden so that the spice of it might flow out deep waters cannot quench love nor a flood drown it set me as a seal on your heart for love is as strong as death and jealousy is as cruel as the grave these words were not the standard consolation but they were pleasant to hear at any time and in the privacy of my thoughts i forgave private langers for uttering them under false pretenses for the tear that formed in the single whole eye of the dying man was unquestionably a grateful and authentic one sam was awake the next day although the doses of watered opium that kept his pain at bay also interfered with his clarity of thought julian didnt visit him for he was too busy securing striver to withstand what might be a long siege we were well protectedour defensive perimeter was anchored against lake melville and the northwest river so we could not easily be outflanked and it would have been outrageously costly for the dutch to mount a frontal attack but they could starve us out given time and that was probably what they intended to do this meant that food and medical supplies had to be itemized guarded and rationedand that was some of the business julian was about i sat by sams bed in his place for the most part sam was silent when he was not sleeping but occasionally he spoke and i tried to be an encouraging audience he mentioned his father once or twicehis judaic rather than his adopted fatherand i attempted to draw him out on the subject when he seemed to need distraction what work did your father do i asked him sam was very gaunt beneath the blankets that covered him it was a cold day outside and a small snow was falling we had to be chary with coal because of the siege and the stoves in the hospital did little to dispel the chill whenever sam spoke his words became visible as mist as if he were emitting his immortal spirit directly from his mortal lungs he was a scrapper sam said he fought for a living no adama scrapcollector he prospected in the houston ship canal down in texas thats the territory where i was born is it a good place sam the canal the canal is hell on earth its a poisonous trench as large as a city rich in copper and aluminum made not for human beings but for oil and machines back in the days of the secular ancients in the canal a prospector can make good money in a short time if hes smart and lucky but the risks are terrible the waters are vile and breed disease when i was very small i saw scrappers come back from the canal with blood running freely from their noses or with their skin turned black and shriveled by contamination my father was always careful to protect himself with boots and gloves and leather aprons there were days when he carted out copper or aluminum very nearly by the ton or soil that could be treated to recover arsenic cobalt lead and other valuable elements which sell for a premium at the galveston exchange by the time he was thirty he had saved enough money to take his family east but the canal killed him the way it killed so many others only more slowly he died a year later in philadelphia choked on tumors that filled his chest and neck my mother was already frail and consumptiveshe survived him by less than a month and you were adopted by a christian family by a kind but aloof man who was a friend of my father he and his wife provided for me until i was old enough to be sent for military training on the stipend my father left for my education but you had to renounce your religion rather to pretend it had never existed which had been my fathers strategy all along in my family adam all we had of piety was the lighting of candles on certain winter days and the pronunciation of a few incomprehensible prayers the family that adopted me knew nothing of it nor ever would that was a melancholy confession and i blushed at the memory of how i had mistaken his prayers for sorcery back in williams ford when i was younger and less worldly would you like me to pray for you sam i can say a jewish prayer if you teach me the words no prayers please neither jewish nor christianthey wont do im not one thing or the other i told him i understood his predicament for i was equally a mixed creature neither a handler of serpents like my father nor as ecumenically pious as my mother i was east of skepticism and north of faith with an unsettled compass and variable winds but i could offer up a prayer as well as the next man and leave it to heaven to judge the result i hope i dont need praying over just yet said sam his voice losing some of its momentary clarity i wish i had my hand back though i seem to feel it there stillclenched and burning adam he called out suddenly his eyes gone watery and vague wheres julian wheres admiral fairfield we need to repulse the damned dutchmen calm downyoull aggravate your wound damn my wound julian will want to send me away dont let him do it he needs my advice more than i ever needed my lost left hand tell him that adamtell him sams agitation attracted the attention of dr linch who forced a preparation of opium down sams throat and not long after that sams anxiety yielded to silence and he fell asleep again is he recovering i asked the doctor his fever is increased thats not a good sign there may be some putrefaction in the wound judging by the smell hell get better soon though this is a poor excuse for a hospital colonel hazzard and bound to deteriorate as supplies run low nothing is certain i wanted more reassurance than that but dr linch was stubborn and wouldnt yield it up i did not expect that julian would really send sam away but in fact thats what happened admiral fairfields battered basilisk anchored a little away from the harbor at striver and the admiral came ashore in a launch we still controlled the harbor which was beyond the reach of the dutch artillery and we would have welcomed the american fleet had it arrived but as at goose bay there was only admiral fairfields ship the basilisk although a noble craft looked small and forlorn against the chilly waters of lake melville and the distant spine of the mealy mountains as sailors swarmed over her rigging repairing the damage she had taken in battle the admiral arrived at the dock in a bitter mood and he was silent as i accompanied him to julians headquarters in the privacy of that building which had once housed the dutch mayor of striver in the upstairs bedroom julian had commandeered for his office admiral fairfieldwhose initial skepticism of julians abilities as a commander had yielded to grudging and finally enthusiastic approvalexplained that his entire fleet had been ordered out of lake melville ordered out julian exclaimed why the command came without explanation admiral fairfield said with patent disgust from new york from my uncle you mean i suspect so though i cant say for certain and all obeyed it but you officially the basilisk is covering our retreat against any dutch attack that was my excuse for remaining behind long enough to contribute what i could at goose baywhich was little enoughand to come here to consult you but youll have to leave shortly julian surmised and obviously you cant deliver reinforcements i cannot though it pains me to say so all i can do is offload what extra provisions the basilisk is carrying and take away those of the wounded who need better treatment than a field hospital can supply leaving us here julian said besieged until the day comes when we yield to starvation or surrender ourselves to the mitteleuropan forces which is no doubt what my mad uncle intends my oath of loyalty prevents me from acknowledging the truth of it in extremis general comstock you might attempt to break out to the east a road runs through to the narrows though its unimproved and the fortifications there ought to remain in american hands long enough to receive you but it would be a desperate attempt at best desperate indeed since were considerably outnumbered the decision is yours of course admiral fairfield stood up leaving you in these circumstances is inexcusable but ive already stretched my written orders past the limits of interpretation i understand julian said taking the admirals gnarled hand in his own with a touching sense of occasion i hold no grudge against you admiral and i thank the navy for everything its done on our behalf i hope the gratitude is not misplaced the admiral said grimly julian and i went down to the docks where sam and dozens of other seriously wounded men were carried to boats for removal to the basilisk i delivered several typewritten sheets to that vessels quartermastermy war dispatches to the spark which the quartermaster promised to post from newfoundland we caught up with dr linch who was supervising the proceedings and he led us to sam who rested in a litter with a woolly blanket wrapped around him and the fitful snow collecting in his beard his eyes were closed and feverroses flourished on his weathered cheeks sam said julian laying a gentle hand on his mentors shoulder sams eyelids peeled back and he gazed up into the rolling clouds a moment before his gaze fixed on julian dont let them take me he said in a shockingly frail voice its a question of need not wish said julian do as the doctor tells you sam and soon youll be well enough to resume the fight sam wasnt soothed by these homilies however and he reached up from the blankets with his good right arm and took julian by the collar you need my advice i can hardly do without it but if you have any advice sam give it to me now for the boats are preparing to cast off use it sam said cryptically but insistently use it use what i dont understand the weapon the chinese weapon julians eyes grew wide and his expression mournful sam there is no chinese weapon i know that you young fool use it anyway perhaps he was the victim of a febrile delusion in any case if he had more to say we didnt hear it for the litterbearers carried him off and before long he was tucked aboard the basilisk and bound for the naval hospital at st johns i think i had never felt quite so alone as i did when the basilisk weighed anchor and sailed eastnot even on the snowy plains of athabaska with williams ford and all my childhood standing behind me like a closed door then at least i had been in the familiar company of sam and julian now sam was gone and julian in his blue and yellow uniform slightly tattered seemed hardly a ghost of the julian i had once known among the goods admiral fairfield left us was a bag of mail these packages and letters were distributed to the troops the same day one of julians adjutants brought me an envelope with my name written on it in calyxas hand night had fallen so i took the letter close to a lamp and opened it with trembling hands calyxa had never been much of a correspondentno one would call her wordy the letter consisted of a salutation and three terse sentences dear adam the dominion threatens me please come home soon preferably alive also i am pregnant yrs calyxa much could be said about the days leading up to thanksgiving as i experienced them but i wont belabor the reader with trivialities those were dark and hungry times i kept a careful record sitting down each night with lamp and typewriter before i permitted myself the luxury of sleep the pages are still in my possession and in the interest of brevity ill confine myself to quoting passages from them viz thursday november it has become necessary to exclude what remains of the civilian population of striver from the town in order to conserve supplies the residents of striver were no more or less hostile to us than might be expected of any group of otherwise comfortable men and women subjected to occupation and forced from their homes at gunpoint many were relieved to be handed back into mitteleuropan custody for thats their preference irrational though it might seem to a sane american despite the wellknown cruelty and atheism of mitteleuropa that principality nevertheless inspires in its subjects a kind of patriotism which resembles in almost every particular the real thing i stood on the roof of our headquarters this afternoon and watched the men women and children of striver trudge across a frosty nomansland between the opposing trenches protected by nothing more than a flag of truce their hunched figures limned in an early twilight tumbling now and then by accident into artillery craters made me feel sympathetic and i could almost imagine myself among them perhaps any man is potentially a mirror of any otherperhaps thats what julian means by cultural relativism though the term is reviled by the clergy at least in the hands of the dutch these unfortunates will be guaranteed a daily meal we are not rationing is in effect dutch luxuries taken from the dockside warehouses are counted as carefully as the salt beef and cornmeal and apportioned along with those familiar foods strange as it seems for american soldiers to be dining on calculated portions of edam cheese sturgeon roe and mashy gooseliver along with their trailcake and bacon in any case these delicacies serve only to postpone the day when our hunger becomes absolute given our numbers and the accounted supplies julian calculates that well be tightening our belts by midmonth and thoroughly starved by december the men still speculate about a chinese weapon and expect julian to deploy it soon he refuses to dispel these rumors and smiles with a sort of mad recklessness whenever i mention the subject my mind of course is generally on calyxa and her troubles with the dominion and the other astonishing news contained in her letter i am to be a father will be a father assuming calyxa carries the child to term even if im killed in this desolate corner of labrador for even a dead man can be a father thats a small but real comfort to me though i cant hold back from worrying tuesday november the wind blows steadily from the west and is very cold though the sky remains clear dusk comes early we burn few lamps to conserve fuel tonight the aurora borealis does a chill and stately dance with the north star its not unfortunately a silent night for the dutch have brought up their heavy artillery and shells fall into the town at irregular intervals half the buildings of striver are already blown up or burned down it seems chimneystacks stand like upraised fingers along empty shattered streets julian is moody and strange without sam to guide and advise him he insists on compiling a list of goodsnot food but dry goodscontained in the dockside warehouses today i assisted at one such inventory and brought the list to julian at the mayors house the dutch and their luxuries the stadhouders are not just gluttons they insist on all the subtler fineries of life it seems julian carefully perused the lengthy catalog of textiles tortoise shells pharmaceutical compounds cattle horns musical instruments horseshoes ginseng plumbing supplies et alia ours by right of pillage his expression as he examined the list was thoughtful even calculating you dont itemize these bolts of silk he remarked there was too much of them i told him the silk is all crated and stacked highi expect it had only just arrived when we took the town but you cant eat silk julian i dont propose to eat it inspect it again tomorrow adam and report back about the quality of it especially the closeness of the weave surely my time could be better spent than by counting threads think of it as following orders julian said sharply then he looked up from his lists and his expression softened im sorry adam humor me in this but keep quiet about it pleasei dont want the troops thinking ive lost my mind ill knit you a chinese robe julian if you think it might help us survive the siege thats exactly my planto survive i meanno knitting will be requiredthough a little sewing perhaps he wouldnt discuss it further wednesday november it occurs to me that thanksgiving is coming we have not given very much thought to that universal christian holiday perhaps because we can find so little to be thankful for in our current situation were more likely to pity ourselves than to count our blessings but that is shortsighted my mother would surely say in fact im thankful for many things im thankful that i have calyxas letter however terse and brief folded in my pocket next to my heart im thankful that i might be blessed with a child the product of our possibly hasty but blessed and bountiful marriage im thankful that im still alive and that julian is still alive though our condition is provisional and subject to change of course no mortal creature knows the hour or the day but were unusual in being surrounded by dutch infantrymen eager to hasten the unwelcome terminal event im thankful that despite my absence life goes on much as it always has in williams ford and in every other such simple place within the broad borders of the american union im even grateful for the cynical philosophers grimy tipmen pale aesthetes corrupt owners and feckless eupatridians who throng the streets of the great city of new yorkor anyway grateful that i had the chance to see them at close proximity im thankful for my daily ration though it shrinks from day to day thursday november today our troops overran a mitteleuropan trench which had been dug too close to our lines five captives were taken and in an act of christian charity they were allowed to live though it will diminish our own supplies to feed them julian hopes they might be traded for american prisoners already in dutch handshe has sent that suggestion by flagoftruce to the dutch commander but as yet no reply has been received i went to see the captives as they were being interrogated in part to satisfy my curiosity about the enemy whom i know only as faceless combatants and as the authors of incomprehensible letters only one of the men spoke english the other four were questioned by a lieutenant who has some dutch and german the enemy soldiers are gaunt stubborn men they offer little more than their own names even under duress the exception to this is the single englishspeakera former british merchant sailor conscripted out of a barroom in brussels while he was insensible with drink his loyalties are mixed and he doesnt mind giving estimates of the enemys strength and positions he said the dutchmen were confident that they would prevail in the siege they were cautious about initiating any attack however for rumors of the unfortunately imaginary chinese weapon have reached them the prisoner said there was no detailed information concerning this weapon nor could there have beenbut speculation about its nature suggested something profoundly deadly and unusual i carried that news to julian tonight he greeted it with grim amusement just what i hoped the dutch were thinking good maybe we can find a way to deepen their fears again he wouldnt explain what he had in mind but he has sequestered one of the warehouses by the docks out of range of enemy artillery and is converting it into some sort of workshop men have been recruited and sworn to secrecy he has requisitioned countless bolts of black silk also sewing machines hooks and eyes strips of lathing from damaged houses bottles of caustic soda and other peculiar items maybe its good for the dutch to believe in this imaginary weapon i said but unfortunately our own troops believe in it too in fact they imagine youre preparing to activate it perhaps i am there is no chinese weapon and you know that as well as i do julian unless hunger has driven you entirely mad of course i know it im a firm believer in its nonexistence all it means is that were forced back on our ingenuity you mean to build a weapon out of silk and fishhooks please keep that thought to yourself the rest will become clear in time saturday november the pace of activity in julians sealed warehouse increases the secret weapon is now so commonly spokenof that i fear the men will be bitter or even vindictive in their disappointment when the truth is finally revealed more shells fell today causing heavy casualties among one particular regiment i volunteered at the field hospital in the afternoon assisting dr linch in the chopping paring and stitching of shattered limbs the work is almost unbearable for anyone of a sensitive nature and i count myself among that number but necessity knows no excuse our gravest enemy dr linch says is less shrapnel than dysentery at least a quarter of our soldiers are down with it and it spreads with the infectiousness of a fire in a kindlingyard corncake and salt cod for dinner in small servings sunday november extraordinary events i mean to set them down before i sleep though it is already very late after the evening meal julian summoned me to his quarters and asked me to bring along my typewriter i carried the machine no small task in my weakened and hungry condition to the upstairs study of the former mayors house and julian instructed me to keep it ready for there was a message he wished to dictate then to my astonishment he summoned an adjutant and ordered private langers to be brought into his presence langers i exclaimed as soon as the adjutant had gone out what do you want with langers has he committed some fresh outrage i saw him at the hospital perpetrating his clerical fraud but i dont suppose thats what this is all about it isntor only in part and please adamyou might be startled by some of what i have to say to him but its essential to the success of my plans that you dont interrupt or correct me while langers is in the room with us this was a sterner tone than julian usually took in my presence but i reminded myself that we were at war and under siege and that he was a major general and i was not i promised not to speak out of turn of course my curiosity was profoundly aroused we shivered for most of half an hourjulian heated his quarters parsimoniously to conserve the supply of coalbefore langers arrived langers was shivering too as he stumbled into the room perhaps not entirely from the cold he looked at julian apprehensively sir he said julian put on his most imperial manner a skill every eupatridian of julians class has mastered it consists of regarding the world and all its inhabitants as if they emitted a faint offensive odor please sit down private langers inserted himself into a chair by the stove you called for me sir obviously i did and here you are ive received a complaint about you langersno doubt recalling what had happened to him when sam gave out the truth about his lucky mug during the saguenay campaignseemed almost to shrivel with dismay and his expression grew even more furtive and wary its ungrounded he muttered you havent heard the charge yet i know its unjustified because my conduct has been above reproach these past weeks ive labored exclusively at the field hospital sir consoling the sick and the dying i know all about that said julian and i would commend you for it but for one thing what thing langers demanded feigning indignation not very successfully one of my regimental commanders discovered several suspicious items hidden under your bedroll these included a large number of gold rings and leather billfolds well langers said though he reddened a man can harbor a few keepsakes cant he no he may not not if the same items have been reported as missing from the mortally wounded i have a corroborating statement from one of the doctors who saw you at the field hospital your right hand raised over an injured man in a benediction while the left hand stripped a wallet from the victims pocket as for the rings ordinarily such ornaments are sent to grieving widows not squirreled away under the bedrolls of counterfeit deacons well i langers began but he faltered the evidence against him was shocking and he had lost the opportunity to mount a defense his naturally long and equine face seemed to grow even longer sirthe hospital is an awful placeit affects a mans mind over timeperhaps the circumstances drove me to irrational acts perhaps they did or perhaps it was just your acquisitive nature but dont worry private i didnt call you here to scold you or punish you i mean to give you an opportunity to redeem yourself langers was not so naive as to grasp that straw without squinting at it first im sure i thank youredeem myself how exactly be patient before we go on i need to dictate a letter adam will you write it down on that machine of yours i suppressed my astonishment at these unfolding events and said yes certainly juliani mean general comstock good are you ready i applied paper to platen hastily put in a top line with the date and mark it as from my headquarters army of the laurentians northern division town of striver lake melville eastern labrador etc i clacked away at this task my typewriting skills had improved since i first acquired the machine and i was proud of my speed though it set no records address it to major walton general headquarters newfoundland i did so then julian dictated the body of the text which i will set down here while it remains fresh in my mind including the unusual capitalizations which julian demanded this is to let you know that after much solemn deliberation and in the face of continuing enemy encirclement and bombardment i have resolved to deploy the mechanism we earnestly hoped would never be used in civilized warfare i do not take this decision lightly it is no easy thing to enter into a war as brutal as this one and to make it yet more inhuman by the employment of such a cruel device it is not the prospect of the immediate death of countless enemy soldiers which pangs me for that is the nature of war so much as the knowledge of the lingering effects in which death comes only after hours or even days of intolerable suffering you know that in councils of war i have argued against the deployment of this weapon which is so vicious in its workings that any christian trembles at the mention of it but i find myself in a position that allows no other outcome my army has been besieged and we are sent no supplies or reinforcements thousands of loyal men confront starvation and i dare not surrender them to the mercies of the mitteleuropan army therefore i have resolved to do everything in my power to deliver the troops or some fraction of them to safety even if the conduct of this war is made that much more hellish and satanic you may pass this information to the general staff and to the chief executive god help me for taking this decision pray for us major walton we act within days add the usual salutations julian said ignoring my gapjawed amazement not only at the contents of the letter but at the unusually ecclesiastical tone of it and give it to me to sign thank you adam i did as he asked though i could hardly contain my questions and anxieties what does this business have to do with me private langers demanded i dont know anything about these dreadful things of course you dont but a message to be useful has to be delivered thats your task private langers the letter will be sewn into a satchel you will carry the satchel past the dutch lines to the american fortifications at the narrows and personally hand it to the ranking officer there across enemy lines the privates eyes were as wide as comstock dollars thats correct impossible langers exclaimed and i was inclined to agree with him though i kept my silence as instructed perhaps it is julian said but i need someone to make the attempt youre healthy enough and it seems to me you have a powerful motive for succeeding at it the choice is stark private langers you can accept the assignment or you can stay here and face exposure for robbing wounded men you wouldnt tell the infantry about my indiscretion i wouldat the next sunday meeting the men dont like to think of a tractpeddler stealing from them in their most vulnerable moment but theyll kill me if they find outtheyre prudish about things like that i dont doubt that theyll be unhappy the choice is yours i object its blackmailface certain death here or be shot by the enemy you might not be shot if luck is with you youll have to be very quiet and move by moonlight if i thought your capture was a certainty i wouldnt send you out at all langers hung his head morosely an acknowledgment that he could see no way out of the trap julian had sprung on him let me add julian said that if you do accept the task you must not under any circumstances allow the document to fall into the hands of the dutch it would nullify our purpose entirely if they learned of our plans and the enemy are slyeven if they capture you even if they attempt to bribe you with promises of protection or great rewards you must not succumb this was precisely the wrong thing to say to langers i thought it was no use appealing to langerss consciencewhich if it existed at all must be a particularly feeble and anemic specimenand i longed to correct julians mistake but i remembered his instructions and bit my tongue langers seemed to brighten a little after julians admonition i dont doubt that he was calculating the angles of the situation in which he suddenly found himself attempting to discover a geometry more suitable to his goals he made a few more small objections just to keep up the seeming of the thing but finally agreed to expiate the potential stain on his military record caused by stealing from the notquitedead yes he agreed he would brave the mitteleuropan lines and make a run for the narrows if that was what duty demanded but if im killed he said and if that news reaches you general comstock i ask you to make sure im listed among the honorable dead so as not to bring shame to my family what family i couldnt help exclaiming you always said you were an orphan those who are as close to me as family i mean langers said and julian gave me a poisonous look which reminded me to keep silent i promise julian said incredibly he extended his hand to the larcenous private your reputation is safe mr langers in my eyes you redeem yourself simply by accepting the commission i thank you for your confidence youre a generous commander sir and a christian gentlemani have always said so if this did not cease i thought i would soon shred my tongue entirely from the biting of it its essential that you leave at once one of my adjutants will conduct you to the forward trenches and give you your final instructions youll be provided with an overcoat and a fresh pair of boots along with a pistol and ammunition julian summoned a young lieutenant who tucked the message into the lining of a leather satchel and escorted langers away i looked at julian aghast now that we were alone well he asked with an insouciant note in his voice you have something to say adam i hardly know where to begin butjulian is there really a chinese weapon can you think of some other reason i might send that note to major walton but thats just the absurdity of it using langers as a messenger and then telling him that the dutch would reward him for betraying us you accuse me of naïveté from time to time but this tops it allyou might as well have invited him to defect do you really think he might succumb to the temptation i think he could hardly do anything else then we share the same opinion you mean you expect him to betray us to the enemy i mean that if my plan is to succeed it will be better if he does i was naturally confused and i suppose my expression showed it for julian took pity on me and put an arm about my shoulders im sorry if i seem to trifle with you adam if i havent been entirely frank its only for the purpose of preserving absolute secrecy report to me in the morning and ill make it all clear that dubious promise was the most i could extract from him and i left his headquarters in a whirling state of mind now i must stop writing if i want to sleep at all before reveille the air is cold but clear tonight the wind as sharp as scissors i find myself thinking of calyxa but she is awfully far away monday november julian has explained his plan tonight we perform an essential test i can confide the truth in no onenot even in these notes which i keep for myself its a thin chance but we have no other here the diary concludes and i resume the narrative in the customary style julian took me into his confidence at last and during the afternoon of the st of november he conducted me on a tour of the warehouse where the weapon was being prepared it soon became obvious that what i had overlooked about julian was his persistent and unconquerable love of theater that aspect of his personality had not been much manifest during his tenure as major general comstock but neither apparently had it been wholly suppressed the interior of the warehouse illuminated by freshlyscrubbed skylights and a generous number of lanterns resembled nothing so much as the backstage shambles at some colossal production of lucia di lammermoor a revival of which had been popular in manhattan the summer past i know it only by reputationwith julian as the propertymaster men in uniform had been made into seamstresses working bolts of black silk at feverish speed often while cutters slashed at the same cloth carpenters had busied themselves sawing wooden poles or lathing into supple strips as tall as a man cordage from a wholesale spool the size of a millwheel was carefully measured out and segments of it rewound onto smaller hubs this was only a sample of the vigorous business taking place the huge room stank of various chemical substances including caustic soda and what julian claimed was liquid phosphorous in several pitted metal barrels my eyes began to water as soon as the door was closed behind me and i wondered whether some of what i had mistaken for fatigue in julians countenance was simply the result of long hours spent in this unpleasant atmosphere i was impressed by the industriousness and scale of the work which filled the enclosed space with a fearsome noise but i confessed i could not make sense of it come on adam cant you guess is it a game then i assume youre assembling some weaponor at least the seeming of one a little of each said julian smiling mischievously a soldier came past carrying a wrapped assemblage of lathes and black silk which julian briefly inspected i told julian the bundle resembled one of the fishingkites he had got up at edenvale though much enlarged very good said julian well observed but what is it really just what you imagine it is a kite the soldier in question stood the object upright among many others similar to it folded they resembled so many sinister umbrellas fashioned for the use of a fastidious giant but there must be a hundred of them at least what use are kites though julian any explanation i could give you would be beggared by the truth tonight we test the product when you see the result perhaps youll understand his coyness was aggravating but i supposed it was another manifestation of the showman in him not wanting to describe a stage effect for fear of diminishing its impact he said he wanted me as an unbiased observer i told that i had no bias but impatience and i went to the field hospital in a mixed humor and made myself useful there until after dark when night had fully fallen and after our meager evening rations had been doled out julian and i once more made our way toward the docks the warehouse though still heavily guarded was less busy at this hour the men julian had chosen as his workforce had been sworn to secrecy and they slept apart from the other soldiers so as not to risk unwise conversation most of the recruits julian said knew only the particular task assigned them and had been kept ignorant of the whole outline of the business but there were a hundred or so men who had been made to understand our ultimate objective and this elite group was in the warehouse tonightor rather on top of the warehouse for we climbed an iron stairway to the roof of the building which was securely tiled and only gently sloped the kite brigade as julian called them awaited him there the night was moonless the stars obscured by high fastrunning clouds apart from a few campfires and lanterns in odd windows the town of striver was entirely dark the huge kites i had seen before had been brought up here they were still furled but their bridles had been attached to reels of hempen twine which were nailed to wooden bases and equipped with hand cranks each kite also had a bucket tied to its bridle with a short string and as we arrived a man was just finishing the work of pouring a measured amount of sand into each of these buckets whats that for i asked julianquietly since the eerie atmosphere of the rooftop seemed to discourage anything beyond a hushed whisper ive calculated how much weight each parafoil can carry julian said to night we discover whether my calculations were correct i didnt ask how one estimated the lifting power of a parafoil or with what kind of arithmeticno doubt it was something else julian had learned from one of his antique books if it depended on the wind we were in luck the breeze was brisk but it was very cold and i kept my hands in the pockets of my overcoat and wished i had my old packle hat on top of my head instead of the thin army cap i was wearing everything seemed ready for the test flight as julian called it except for the darkness how can you see whether they fly when the moon is down and even the northern lights arent operating julian didnt answer but beckoned to a man nearby this soldier carried a bin with some liquid in it and a brush the liquid as it turned out was a compound of phosphorous which radiated an unearthly green light the dutch use it for military signaling but it also serves in theatrical effects the soldier employed his brush to splash a little of this on each bucket until they had all been so marked and glowed like demonic jackolanterns in the darkness stringmen prepare julian called out abruptly dozens of men jumped to their stations at the anchored kitereels furlers stand ready an equal number of men positioned downwind along the rim of the roof grasped the huge furled kites and held them at presentarms ready to be unrolled so that their wings might catch the wind launch cried julian the reader should understand that a black silk kite taller than a man lofted into the stygian darkness of a labrador night while the wind comes skirling from the arctic regions like a madman with a knife in his teeth is not the same beast as a childs kite bobbing in the sunlight of a summer day the immense black kites though not easily visible made their presence known as soon as the first one caught the icy breeze and opened with a concussive bang as loud as a gunshot each kite as the wind filled it made the same deafening report which reminded me of the popping of sails aboard the basilisk when that vessel began to trim for heavy weather until it sounded as if an artillery duel was under way and we were in the middle of it then the kites rose to the limit of the strings which bound them to the buckets they were meant to carry each with its weighed portion of sand and its glowing green insigne evidently julians calculations had been correct with only a moments hesitation and an encouraging tug from the stringmen the buckets soared aloft mere words cannot convey how unusual and strange this looked all that was visible from any distance was the phosphorescent paint that marked each rising container these unearthly lights as they seemed rose and bobbed and rose again like angels or demons sailing in close formation i was suffused with awe even though i knew the explanation for what i was seeing an unenlightened observer might easily have been terrified not every american soldier in town is asleep i said might not someone see this and alert others i hope so it will brace up the men to think that this is a sample of what weve been preparing theyll take it for supernatural let them take it according to their beliefsit makes no difference butas impressive as this isa kite isnt a weapon julian even if it flies at night and glitters like an owls eye sometimes seeming is as good as being julian busied himself with a sort of sextant performing an act he called triangulation by this time the kites had come to the end of their measured lengths of tether the tetherlines were taut in fact the stringmen had to struggle to keep the reels in place so powerful was the force generated by the wind upon the parafoils the hempen lines strained ferociously and made a singing noise eerie in the darkness julian spent some time instructing the stringmen on how to buck and lax their lines so that the kites could be made to drop and rise again they performed the task crudely but julian reckoned that even a little experience was better than none then the stringmen began the slow and laborious task of reeling the kites back from the sky an impressive display but it wasnt finishedjulian had one more theatrical effect he wished to test tubemen ready he shouted another group of soldiers who had previously been huddled at the chimneybrace for warmth suddenly separated and formed into a row each of them carried a length of rubber tubing perhaps originally intended to transport water in some dutch governors mansion when they had room enoughmuch to my amazementthey began to whirl the tubes above their heads the way a cattleherder might whirl a rope though less elegantly the result was that each tube and they had been cut to various lengths began to sing much the way an organpipe sings when wind is blasted through it what the performance yielded in this circumstance was not music however but a kind of unearthly dissonant hootingthe sound a chorus of loons might make if they were inflated to the size of elephants i had to clap my hands over my ears julian the whole town will be awakeyoull wake up the dutch infantry though their trenches are miles away good said julian or at least thats what he appeared to say the keening of the rubber tubes drowned him out somewhat but he smiled contentedly and after a time made a hand signal that caused the tubemen to cease their whirling by this time the black kites were almost reeled in and before long the whole production was over no more than an hour had passed my astonishment was boundless but i told julian i still could not see the point of it the dutch troops if we tried this trick on them would no doubt be impressed quite possibly frightened but it didnt seem to me they would be materially damaged in any way wait and find out said julian the next day rather than attack the mitteleuropan forces we exchanged prisoners with them julian went to the trenches to oversee the exchange which took place under a flag of truce and i went with him the dutchmen scurried across nomansland with their white flag fluttering and an equal number of our men passed them going the other way there was no ceremony only a brief ceasefire and when the business was complete the dutch snipers resumed their deadly practice and the dutch artillery geared up for more pointless volleys the prisoners we returned i said to julian as we stood shivering in a rear trench are they aware of last nights test i made sure their quarters faced the right direction they would have had a fine view and your objective is to add their narrative to the rumors already circulating among the dutchincluding that note you dictated assuming private langers has yielded to temptation thats the goal exactly well this is all fine theater julian psychological warfare all right if thats the name of it but sooner or later the psychological has to yield to the actual it will ive given the order to prepare for battle we sleep in forward positions tonight the attack will begin before dawn we have to strike while the dutch panic is still fresh i grasped the sleeve of julians tattered blue and yellow jacket to make sure i had his full attention it was cold in that trench and despite the cutting wind the air stank of blood and human waste and desolation was all that i could see in every direction tell me the truthwill any of this charade make a difference or is it only a show to bolster the courage of the men julian hesitated before he answered morale is also a weapon he said and i like to think ive increased our arsenal at least in that insubstantial way we have an advantage we lacked before any advantage we can take we sorely need are you thinking of home adam im thinking of calyxa i admitted and the child she was carrying though i had not mentioned that news to julian i cant promise anything of course but theres hope certainly there is julian said hope yeshope alwayshope if nothing else i wrote another letter to calyxa that afternoon and buttoned it into the pocket of my jacket so that it might be found on my person if i died in battle perhaps it would eventually reach her or perhaps it would be buried along with me or become the souvenir of some mitteleuropan infantrymanthe calculation wasnt mine to make i thought about praying for success but i wasnt sure god could be coaxed to intervene in such a remote and desolate land if i were him i might be tempted to suppress my power of omniscience when it came to labrador and focus my attention on the worlds warmer and greener places in any case i doubted my prayers would be altogether wellreceived given my ambiguous denominational status i was not in an easy state of mind and wished i did not have to face death quite so soon because it was almost thanksgiving julian ordered extra rations for everyone including the last of our meat strips of salt beef plus whatever we could spare of horsethe mules had already been eaten it wasnt a proper thanksgiving dinner as my mother would have prepared it back in williams ford with a baked goose perhaps and cranberries purloined from the duncan and crowley kitchen and raisin pie with stiff cream but it was more than we had had for many days the feast depleted our larder all it left was hardtack and we would need that for the march if we succeeded in breaking the siege of striver the field hospital was a gloomy place when i visited it that evening a group of orderlies sang sacred songs in keeping with the spirit of the season though somewhat halfheartedly many of the wounded men were unable to travel and dr linch said they might have to be abandoned to the mercies of the mitteleuropan army the choice of who would be hauled off and who left behind rested in his hands and he disliked the obligation and was in a sour mood about it at least dr linch said the men are a little warmer tonightthat intolerable cold wind has finally stopped blowing it took a moment for the significance of what he had said to register on my mind then i ran outside to see for myself dr linch was entirely correct the wind which had been keening steadily for almost a month had suddenly ceased to blow and the air was as still as ice we are becalmed i wrote in my journal no food but trail food and we must be parsimonious with that julian cant tell the men why the attack has been delayed without betraying the secret of the black kites which of course cannot fly without wind the troops are restive and grumble constantly thanksgiving day bitter and disappointing another cold and windless day julian frets over the question and is constantly scanning the horizon for meteorological clues and auguries none are perceived though tonight the aurora shimmers like a cloth of gold just north of the zenith dutch shelling increases and we have had to put out a number of fires in the eastern section of town fortunately the fires do not spreadno wind no wind we are in danger of losing any advantage julians plan might have given us he suspects the mitteleuropans have already been reinforced were greatly outnumbered and the chinese weapon begins to seem like an empty threat if it was ever anything more nevertheless julian has dreamed up another addition to the charade his male seamstresses have hastily produced nearly two hundred protective masks for the men at the vanguard of our envisioned advance on the dutch these are essentially black silk sacks with holes cut for the eyes large enough to drape over a mans head the eyeholes are circled in white paint and they present a fearful appearance from a distanceup close they seem slightly clownish but a phalanx of armed men in such garb would surely be intimidating to a wary enemy still the wind does not blow no wind but snow it falls gently and softens the gaps and angles of this broken town a few gusts today not sufficient for our advance wind but the snow obscures all we cannot march clear skies this morning gusts fitful but freshening as the afternoon wears on will it last until dawn julian says it will he says it must we advance in the morning he says wind or no at last after a dark midnight and much surreptitious preparation i stood with julian and the rest of the general staff in an earthen breastwork near the front lines we sat at a crude table where two lamps burned while julian read a letter from the dutch commanderreceived that afternoonoffering terms of surrender given your present unsustainable occupation of a town the jurisdiction of which is bound to pass to us sooner or later the mitteleuropan general whose name was vierheller perhaps the mitteleuropans know how to pronounce this jawcrackeri do notsaid that we would all be welltreated and eventually exchanged back to american territory at the cessation of hostilities so long as our surrender was not conditional hostilities which had not ceased for decades and showed no sign of doing so now which weakened the argument somewhat they grew back their spine a regimental commander commented julian had been forced to brief his staff on the nature of the chinese weapon though he kept some details to himself they understood that it would terrify the dutch but that any weakness or confusion it excited would have to be quickly and efficiently exploited for most of these commanders the attack would be purely conventional conducted along traditional military lines they still fear us a little i think said julian perhaps we can remind them why they should thus there was a small overture to the drama he had planned an hour after midnight he sent his crew of tubemen as close to the front as they could safely go the dutch army was encamped on the plain beyond the hills where we had built our defenses we had seen their fires burning like countless stars in the darkness and heard the sound of their threatening maneuvers tonight they slept but julian meant to wake them he ordered the tubemen to begin their ruckus orchestrating them as if they were a musical act the eerie noise did not commence abruptly but started with a lone man generating a single hollow note soon joined by others and others still and so on until the whole blended chorus which suggested the cries of unquiet souls hired out for temporary labor by entrepreneurial demons was carried to the ears of the enemy infantry who no doubt stirred from their sleep in profound consternation all across the lowlands the dutch soldiers must have startled awake and grasped their rifles and peered anxiously into the wintry darkness though there was nothing to see but a few chill stars in a moonless sky let that keep them for a while julian said with some satisfaction when the noise at last faded what do you suppose theyll make of it something dire i mean to play on their imaginations what do you suppose a dutch infantryman pictures when he contemplates the rumor of a secret chinese weapon im sure i dont know nor do i but i expect his imagination will have been shaped by stories of ancient european wars which were fought with all sorts of fanciful and terrifying weapons including aircraft and poison gas i hope the sound of the tubemen gives some vague inspiration to these nightmares and that the black kites will confirm them well know soon enough in any case i cleaned and oiled my pittsburgh rifle by lamplight while we waited and i kept a generous supply of ammunition handy for even the major generals staff would not be exempted from the coming battleevery ablebodied american soldier in the vicinity would be pressed into action before the day was done julian could not give orders from the rear echelons the kites were to be launched from behind a low rill set about with earthen lunettes and perilously close to the dutch lines the effect would be most useful coming in utter darkness so we had to launch well before dawn even before the false glow that precedes the rising sun and our regiments were prepared to advance at first light julian stood in our frozen trench or paced back and forth in it consulting his army watch and an almanac for the precise hour of sunrise he muttered to himself at length and with the collar of his coat turned up and his yellow beard flecked with motes of ice he looked far older than his years his adjutants and subcommanders waited impatiently for julian to read the auspices at last he looked up from his watch and gave a pallid smile all right he said better too early than too late with that he went up to the very edge of the battlements and ordered the stringmen to stand by their reels and the furlers to loft up the effort proceeded much as it had on the rooftop in striver though with certain important variations at the warehouse the kites had been loaded with buckets of sand tonight there were heavy skin bags attached to their bridles i asked julian what the bags contained anything noxious we could find he said some contain pure caustic soda or industrial solvents some are filled with liquid bleach some with waste from the tannery or the field hospital some have lice powder in them and others are stuffed with ground glass the bags had been broadly daubed with luminous paint just as the buckets had been otherwise there would have been nothing to see nor any way to judge the kites ascent i had worried about the wind which was capricious but just lately it had picked up speed and was blowing gustily the kites unfurled with loud crisp bangs they rose tested their luggage hesitated then the glowing cargo swept skyward with terrifying speed julian quickly called on the tubemen to begin their whirling again to make sure the dutch were on alert i cannot say to what height the kites flew but their clever design kept them level with one another and stable in flight they appeared as a hundred and more eerie bobbing green lights risen above the crowded mitteleuropan army camp like rogue stars to an enemy infantryman it would have been impossible to gauge the true size or proximity of the phenomenonwhich was why julian had worked so hard to fertilize the dutch imagination with hints and legends certainly the kites didnt go unnoticed almost immediately enemy trumpets began to sound loudly enough that the howling of the tubemen did not entirely drown them out peeking through an embrasure in the earthen embankment where we sheltered i saw lanterns flicker in the staff tents of the mitteleuropan camp a few stray shots were fired in haste i cupped my mouth in my hands and leaned toward julians ear wont they shoot down the kites julian not yettheyre too high and when they do shoot adam they wont aim at the kites which are more or less invisible but at their cargo the chief stringman called out numbers from his immense twinereel which had been calibrated to gauge the amount of line paid out the other stringmen presumably kept pace while julian worked numbers with a pencil and a paper pad to this day i dont understand how julian was able to estimate the kites position by noting their apparent height above the horizon and the amount of string paid out it seemed like black magic though it involved numbers not spells or toadsfeet or any such occult contrivancesand the hempen twine bucked and sang at the anchored reels at last julian reached the conclusion of his figuring and sent out the order to lax line the stringmen let their cord play out freely a moment longer then braked the reels with wooden chocks the luminous toxic cargo glided closer to the enemy infantry and fresh rifle shots rang out these increased in volume and intensity peering across the flat expanse of darkness where the dutch were encamped i could see the flash of rifle fire as if it were the play of lightning inside a thunderclouda vast wide crackling of rifle fire shockingly intense the tubemen increased their hooting to a high unholy pitch i expect all this show intimidated the mitteleuropansin fact it was beginning to intimidate me those dutch rifles though aimed at the kites were pointed roughly in our direction and bullets began to drop out of the sky around us not entirely harmlessly hails of them fell against the earthen embankments in the sky to the east of us the luminous floating targets jerked and danced as they were struck and struck again i pictured in my mind what must be happening on the field of battle i reminded myself that the dutch had intercepted the letter julian entrusted to private langers and that what they perceived was not a theatrical effect but the actions of in julians words as i had transcribed them a hellish and satanic device insidious in its lingering effects as the skin bags were perforated and finally obliterated by volleys of bullets they released into the night air their unpleasant contents which descended onto the fearful infantrymen like a ghastly dew light on the eastern horizon sir an adjutant soon reported to julian i looked and detected a brightening there the airglow of the coming dawn reel in julian ordered even such feeble first light soon made the battlefield more visible a few of the black kites had been battered beyond utility or had their strings cut by rifle fire and these had fallen like enormous wounded bats among the dutch but the mitteleuropan troops werent paying much attention to the fallen kitesin fact they were running aimlessly many of them i tried to put myself in the shoes of one of those soldiers and imagine it from his point of view woken from a troubled sleep by an unearthly keening hes called out into the darkness and finds a great number of peculiar flying lights descending on his encampment all manner of fears and fancies compete for his attention hes grateful when the order to fire freely rings out and he lifts his dutch riflelets say hes a marksmanand discharges round after round at the eerie targets above him if his aim isnt accurate it doesnt matter a thousand men like him are doing just the same thing the shooting bolsters his courage but before long he perceives a certain rank scent unpleasant but unidentifiable composed though he doesnt know it of all the poisons julians men have sent aloft powders for killing rats solvents for paint lye for soap offal from the field hospital a drop of something touches his exposed skin and tingles or burns there he squints once more into the night sky his eyes are doused with caustic agents he weeps involuntarily and cannot see there was not enough of toxins and poisons in those bags to kill an army of dutchmen perhaps not enough to kill even one dutchman barring a lucky chance but our hypothetical soldier chokes he sweats he fancies himself murdered or at least mortally tainted its not a threat he can contain or confront it comes out of the night like a supernatural visitation all he can do in the end is run from it hes not alone in reaching this conclusion i looked out on the dutch encampments and saw chaos first light could do nothing to dispel the fears julian had so adroitly conjured and julians conjuring wasnt finished fire canister he cried and the order was swiftly conveyed to our artillery emplacements evidently julian had ordered certain canister shells to be filled with as he later described it to me a combination of flea powder and red dye these exploded in huge clouds of amber dust which the wind carried among the dutch infantry in swirling cloudsharmlessly but the dutch reckoned the shells to be full of potent poison and they fled from them the way they would never have fled a conventional artillery barrage the mitteleuropan commanders rode among the men on horses trying to rally their troops but it was soon clear that the dutch middle had collapsed creating an opening for an american advance julian ordered the attack at once moments later an entire regiment of american infantry wearing black silken hoods over their heads stormed out of our trenches and lunettes hooting ferociously and wielding pittsburgh rifles and a few invaluable trench sweepers the dutch commander panicked and threw all his forces against us in an attempt to hold the center julian had anticipated this and quickly directed our cavalry to ride against the dutch flanks the american cavalry were hungry men on hungry horses but their charge was effective more trench sweepers were brought to bear the watery sun when it finally broached the horizon peered down on bloody carnage our entire army was poised to break out the infantry and cavalry in front supply wagons and the portable wounded behind them more infantry and cavalry at the rear for protection ride with me adam julian cried and two slatribbed stallions were brought up with saddles and provisions and ammunition bags and we galloped eastward behind a brave flourish of regimental flags i had seen desperate battles before of course but there was something especially gaudy and terrible about this one we came down behind the advance regiments into a tumbled and ravaged land the dutch emplacements now abandoned were a hazard to us and many horses stumbled into trenches or craters and died of their injuries the aftermath of that first advance along with the residue of julians black kites had created a charnelground abandoned by all but the dead dutch troops cut down by trench sweepers lay in place their bodies contorted by their dying exertions the coloredpowder canister barrage had painted the trampled snow with scarlet plumes and the stink of the various aerial emoluments combined into one acrid excremental chemical vapor which even in its dissipated state caused our own eyes to water freely julian rode past companies of footsoldiers toward the front pausing at one point to take up the battle flag of the goose bay campaign this was an ennobling sight in spite of or because of the tattered condition of the flag we have walked upon the moon the banner declared and we might have been marching on the moon right now for all the desolation around us though the moon i suppose is not pockmarked with crude abattises and open latrines every infantry company we passed took pleasure in the sight of the banner and cries of julian conqueror were commonplace we came into a lightly forested complex terrain the wind for which we had prayed so fervently and which we had so eagerly welcomed became a nuisance as the day progressed low clouds raced across the sky in gusts and gales scouring old snow into the air and bringing fresh squalls the dutch army had fled before us but we didnt pursue them our objective was escape not confrontation and for a time the only fighting was sporadic as we encountered straggling mitteleuropan infantrymen and overwhelmed them but the mitteleuropan commander was no fool and as the snow impeded our progress he was busy rallying his troops in their fallback positions our first hint of this was the sound of gunfire in the snowy haze to the east of usi took it for just another skirmish though julian frowned and pressed his mount to greater speed in our eagerness to escape striver we had allowed our forces to disperse somewhat and now it seemed our vanguard had fallen into a trap the sound of rifle fire swelled rapidly and as we galloped toward it we began to see casualties flowing back on us in limping lines full battle ahead one soldier warned us and the dutch arent running anymore sirtheyre standing fast julian established a rough command headquarters near the fighting and quickly organized his staff scouts reported that the american vanguard had marched into a declivity on the road and come under sustained fire from protected positions before they could entrench or retreat shells exploded in their midst they were falling back by companies in a state of confusion julian did what he could he ordered his artillery up he consulted his maps and tried to anchor his lines securely though the terrain was flat and unsuitable before long one of his adjutants announced that the sparse american right wing had entirely collapsed and the mitteleuropans were rolling it up i could hear the artillery and the rifle fireit was noticeably closer now dutch shells began to fall perilously near to us we were in danger of being overrun by our own troops should the battle become a rout julian barked ferociously at the lieutenant who first counseled retreat it was not at all certain that we could return to striver safelyand then we would only be under siege again with our numbers depleted and our provisions exhausted striver was a prison and our whole purpose had been to break out of it but more messengers arrived with increasingly bad news and when a shell knocked down the crude shelter around us julian finally admitted the impossibility of sustaining the advance the dutch had regained all their courage and had checked us effectively and there were no more pantomime weapons to throw at them the realization that his plan had failed drove julian to his lowest ebb he had been fed no more generously than the rest of us and several times i had to stand beside him as he consulted with his adjutants and take his arm to support him when his physical weakness crested there was in julian a fierce almost supernatural strength i had seen it sustain him through terrible battles before this one but even that strength had its limit which he seemed to have just about reached im cold adam he whispered to me as the day advanced and the dead are all aroundso many dead we have to extract all the survivors we can i told him so they can have the privilege of dying later rather than sooner he muttered but the admonition worked to brace him he reached down into the deepest part of himself as it seemed and discovered there a last reserve of courage bring me the campaign flag he told the nearest adjutant and my horse and sound a general retreat i wish i could paint a wordpicture vivid enough to convey the nightmare of our retreat to striver i have neither the skill or the stomach for it however it isnt that these images are lost to me for they return on a regular basis in my sleep and i often awake sweating or shouting from their thrall but i cannot bear to set them down on the page with minute fidelity suffice to say that we rode through tartarus with the devil at our backs fighting all the way days were short in labrador at that time of year the light we had greeted so optimistically at dawn grew thin and watery julian still drawing on his deepest wells of strength carried the battle pennon high and fought alongside the rearguard i fought beside him on horseback as we gave up land that hours earlier we had won and watered with american blood dutch bullets flew around us like lethal insects andas at the battle of mascouche so long agojulian seemed at first invulnerable to them but only at first he could not remain wholly unperforated in a flurry of lead that made his campaign banner a tattered and illegible rag i was next to him when a bullet pierced the cloth of his uniform coat about the shoulder the wound was not grave but it numbed the arm and the banner with its proud boast slipped from his grasp the faded image of the moon was trodden on by his horses hooves as he slumped in the saddle julian i called out he turned to the sound of my voice an apologetic expression on his face then a second bullet struck him and his mouth filled with blood after dark the dutch were in no hurry to chase usthey knew where we were going and would be content to mop us up at their leisure thus some fraction of the army that had marched out of striver arrived back by moonlight battered and hungry and took up positions along their old defensive lines and in the town itself dr linchthe only one of our physicians to have survived the attempted breakoutset up a diminished version of his old field hospital his only supplies were a handful of knives and saws a few bottles of medicinal brandy and liquid opium and some needles and thread scavenged from the ruin of a tailors shop he boiled water over a stove in which he burned scraps of broken furniture he looked at me vaguely when i brought julian to him his own exhaustion had just about overcome him i had to remind him of the urgency of his work and of the necessity of saving julians life he hesitated then nodded i carried julian into the shell of the old field hospital past corpses piled like cords for a bonfire linch examined julians wounds by lantern light the shoulder is only a flesh wound he said the wound to his face is more serious the bullet tore away a part of his cheek and two of his molars are shattered at that hes lucky it wasnt worse he paused and smiledit was a mirthless bitter smile such as i hoped never to see again id say he might recover if we had food to give him or real warmth or shelter will you sew his cheek in any case no said dr linch there are men whose suffering is more intense and they deserve my attentionand dont mention the name comstock as if that had any claim on my sympathies if you want him sewn up adam hazzard do it yourself youve assisted me often enough you know how its done he gave me a needle and thread and left a lantern for me julian remained insensible with shock as i worked on him though he moaned once or twice it was not pleasant to press a threaded needle through his lacerated skinto dab the blood away in order to judge my own workand then do it againand yet againuntil a rough seam drew the tissues together effectively if not handsomely i could do nothing about his cracked and shattered teeth except at dr linchs suggestion to pack the damaged area with cotton much blood was spilled during this exercise it covered my clothing and the loss of it left julian breathless dr linch returning gave him a weak preparation of opium i sat with julian through the dark hours and stoked the stove when the night wind cut too close in the morning the shelling resumed with fresh vigor as if the dutch meant to punish us for the impudence of our attempted escape or perhaps they were just anxious to finish the work of killing us and get on with their regular business julian spat clotted blood until noon his distress was palpable but he couldnt speak eventually he gestured for a paper and pencil i kept these items with me habitually as a writer should even one who owns a typewriter for those machines are not convenient to carry in ones pocketand handed them to him he wrote in quavering capitals a demand for more opium i went and canvassed dr linch but the news i carried back to my friends bedside wasnt good theres very little opium left julian the doctor is reserving it for the worst cases more wrote julian there is no morecant you hear me he was an awful sight twigthin linenwhite his injuries brown with stale blood blood congealed on his dusty yellow beard his eyes rolled in their sockets i should have died he wrote but after a while he slept the next day our surviving troops retreated to their final defensive position in a close perimeter around the town the noose had fully tightened on us in other words the word surrender was mooted about but it had not yet come to that not while there were still trailcrackers to eat but those wouldnt last long i softened hardtack in water until it was soggy and dropped small morsels of it into julians mouth which was the only way he could eat in his present condition he took some nourishment that way but refused it when the pain became intolerable i asked him whether he had any orders for the men no orders he wrote nothing left why would they want my orders because youre their commander julian even if our attack didnt succeed the men recognize it as a noble attemptbetter than they could have made without you failure the dutch were reinforced its no ones fault we couldnt overwhelm them it was a glorious effortit will be remembered as such foolish no one to remember we wont leave here alive dont say so i pleaded with him we will go homewe must calyxa needs meshes having problems with the dominion perhaps that deacon from colorado wants to torture her also shesthat isi havent told anyone yet julian butshes going to have a child he stared at me then he took up the pencil and paper again your child of course my childwhat else would it be he wrote after another pause good news congratulations would smile if i could of course youll go home thank you julian youll come home with me and well see that baby born youll be its uncle in effect and you can hold it on your knee and feed it mashy apples if you like godfather yes if youll accept the nomination close to god as ill get he wrote and then laid back against the wooden slats that served him as a bed his eyes closed and his wounds seeped pinkish fluids the next day looked to be our last despite the optimism i had tried to impress upon julian the shelling of striver intensified the dutch barrages reached every part of the town and i was often bathed in plaster shaken from the ceiling while i tended to julians needs his adjutants and junior colonels had stopped begging him for ordershe was too badly hurt to lead and anyway there were no useful orders to give the army of the laurentians northern division had become a sort of automaton firing reflexively whenever a target presented itself that couldnt continueour last supplies of ammunition had been tapped it was a cold day clear and windless julian slept fitfully whenever the cannonade permitted and i slept often enough on the chair beside him i was awake however and julian was asleep when a freshlypromoted lieutenant rushed into the room general comstock the man exclaimed quiet lieutenantthe generals napping and he needs his restwhats the matter sorry colonel hazzard but i was sent to reportthat is weve seen what some new dutch outrage if our defenses have collapsed theres no need to trouble julian comstock about it hes in no position to help though he would if he could its not that sir sails i beg your pardon sails sir weve sighted sails coming down lake melville from the east dutch sails sir its hard to be sure but the lookouts think notin fact it looks like admiral fairfields fleet the navy has come for us at last sir i found i couldnt speak there is a species of release from fear that in its effect is as unmanning as fear itself i covered my face with my hands to conceal my emotion sir the lieutenant said arent you going to tell the general as soon as its confirmed i managed to say i wouldnt like to disappoint him but i couldnt wait for an adjutants word i left julian sleeping and climbed up to the top of the hospital the hospital in better days had been a dutch shop with apartments overhead located at the shoreward end of portage street it had lost its roof in the battle and the second story had become an open platform exposed to the elements it afforded a good view of the harbor i stood in the empty casing of a shattered window gazing off across the lake the sails hove into view soon enough without a spyglass i couldnt discern the colors they were flying and i feared some new mitteleuropan attack despite the lieutenants encouraging words then the outline of the nearest vessel began to seem familiar to me and my heart fluttered a little she was the basilisk the beloved basilisk admiral fairfields flagship i was grateful and i addressed my prayerful thanks to the slategray sky and the surging clouds or whatever lay beyond them lake melville was too salt to freeze entirely but fringes of ice had formed at the edges of it and the navy couldnt anchor as close to shore as they might have liked but there were gaps of open water where her boats could freely move an advance party quickly gauged the extremity of our situation and communicated details to the basilisk by signalflags and before long that ship along with the others of the fleet began to fire shells which flew above striver and dropped into the dutch lines with telling accuracy the bombardment was continuous it drove the mitteleuropans back a mile or more from their forward entrenchments and the sound of it was what finally woke julian from his profound sleep he was afraid we were about to be assaulted by the enemy and i soothed him by giving him the good news he was less cheered by it than i expected he took up pencil and paper and wrote are we saved yes julian thats what ive been trying to tell you the men are coming into the streets cheering useless then i mean our attempt to break through well but how could we have known how many dead for no purpose hundreds thousands still alive if only i had waited thats not the way to think of it julian blood on my hands noyou were magnificent he refused to be convinced an adjutant arrived with word that the admiral wanted to see julian in order to begin to plan the evacuation of our troops from striver tell him im not in julian wrote but he didnt mean itit was only his injuries speaking the admiral was promptly admitted it was so heartening to see the old naval officer again that i nearly wept his uniform was so bright and bold compared to our tattered rags that he seemed to have descended from a distant valhalla wellsupplied with patriotic tailors he looked at julian with the knowledgeable sympathy of a man who had seen injured men and worse many times before dont rise he said as julian struggled to sit straight up and essay a salute and dont try to speak if your wounds make it difficult i can write julian hastily set down and i read the message to admiral fairfield on his behalf well said fairfield there is not much to say that cant wait a short while the important thing is that your men have been rescuedthe siege is lifted too late wrote julian but i couldnt communicate anything so pessimistic to the admiral julian thanks you i said ignoring the looks he shot in my direction the expression was all in his eyes since julians jaw was too badly hurt to moveeven a frown would have wounded him no thanks are called for in fact i apologize for delaying as long as we have deklan meant for me to die herea welllaid planwhat changed julian says he can hardly accept your apology he does wonder what circumstances made this rescue possible of coursei forget youve been cut off from all news the admiral said the order that kept us out of lake melville was rescinded deklan must be dead julian asks about the health of his uncle thats the key to it admiral fairfield said nodding the plain fact is deklan conqueror has been deposed in part it was because of the reports of the goose bay campaign you sent out when the basilisk last saw these shores colonel hazzard the spark published them in the ignorant belief that deklan conqueror would want julians heroism widely publicized but it was obvious enough reading between the lines that julian had been betrayed by the executive branch the army of the laurentians was already profoundly unhappy about deklans misrule and arrogancethe balance was finally tipped did they kill him was deklan conquerors abdication wholly voluntary i asked it wasnt voluntary at all a brigade came down from the laurentians and marched on the presidential palace the republican guard chose not to resisttheir opinion of deklan comstock is no higher than anyone elses does the murderer yet live was julians uncle injured in the process hes a prisoner in the palace for the time being who takes command of the presidency has a successor been named here admiral fairfield looked somewhat abashed i wish i had a more ceremonial way to convey the information he said and a venue for it grander than this ruined building butyes he said looking julian hard in the eye a successor has been named pending my confirmation that he has survived that successor is you general comstock or i should say president comstock or julian conqueror as the infantry like to style you julian sank back into his rude bed his eyes clenched shut all color fled from his face i expect admiral fairfield took this as an expression of pain or shock due to his injury there was an embarrassed silence then julian gestured for the pad and pencil again this is worse than death he wrote i wish the dutch had killed me oh god no tell him go to hell all of them go to helli will not serve julian is too feverish to express his astonishment i said hes humbled by the honor so unexpectedly bestowed upon him and hopes hell prove worthy of it but hes tired now and needs to rest thank you the admiral said to me and thank you mr president to julian act five julian conqueror including the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin christmas christmas ever the virtues blush to find the vices wearing their badge behind and graces and charities feel the fire wherein the sins of the age expire whittier it falls to me now to write the final chapter of my story which is an account of the reign of julian conqueror commander in chief of the armed forces and president of the united states as i experienced it with all its attendant tragedies and conciliatory joys those events are still close to my heart though considerable time has passed since their conclusion my hand trembles at the task of describing them but the reader and i have come this far which is no small distance and i mean to bring the project to completion whatever the cost it occurs to me that one virtue of the typewriter as a literary invention is that tears shed during the act of composition are less likely to fall upon the paper and blot the ink a certain clarity is preserved not otherwise obtainable manhattan was all got up for the celebration of the nativity when we arrived at the docks and such a frenzy of decoration i had never seen as if the city were a christmas tree decked with candles and colored tinsel with the sacred day less than fortyeight hours distantbut all of that meant little or nothing to me for i was anxious to discover the fate of calyxa julian and i along with the other survivors of the goose bay campaign had recuperated for three weeks at the american hospital in st johns fresh food clean linen and boiled water restored us to health as effectively as any medicine could and julians facial wound though my stitching of it was inexpert had nearly healed evidence of my inadequacy as a physician would persist in the form of a scar that curved between julians jawhinge and his right nostril like a second mouth primly and permanently shut but that was little enough as war wounds go and julian had never been vain about his appearance his mood had also improved or at least he had wrestled down his pessimism whatever the reason he had given up his initial resistance and submitted to all the plans the army of the laurentians had laid for him he was willing he had told me to assume the office of the presidency at least for a time if only to undo a fraction of the wickedness his uncle had committed the appointment to the executive was none of his doing of course it had come about in his absence and his name had been put up as a compromise my early dispatches to the spark carried out of striver on board the basilisk after the battle of goose bay may have played a role in these developments no doubt deklan comstock would have preferred to have the news of julians survival suppressed but the editors of the spark didnt know that and assumed they were doing the president a favor by publicizing his nephews heroism and hard times those news items were widely reprinted the american public at least in the eastern half of the country had become enamored of julian comstock as a youthful national hero and his reputation was equally golden among the forces of the army of the laurentians meanwhile in the higher echelons of the military resentment of deklans war policies had heated up to the boiling point deklan had mismanaged so many audacious but illdesigned campaigns and jailed so many loyal and spotless generals that the army had resolved to unseat him and replace him with someone more sympathetic to their goals the publication of my reports helped stoke that smoldering fire to a whitehot intensity i did not in my dispatches condemn deklan conqueror by name or even mention him but it was possible to infer from what i wrote that the lake melville campaign had been mismanaged from new york i did record a few cynical comments of julians directed toward those who cut orders without considering them first and would make history without having read any i thought this barb at the president would be blunted by its obscurityi may have been mistaken all that stood in the way of a military overthrow of julians uncle was the choice of a plausible successor always a ticklish business an acceptable candidate can be difficult to procure a tyrants overthrow by military action doesnt admit of any formal democratic choice and important contesting intereststhe eupatridians the senate the dominion of jesus christ on earth even in some sense the general publichave to be addressed and mollified the army of the laurentians could not meet all these conditions nor could it readily obtain the consent of its distant partner the army of the californias which was much more a creature of the dominion than the eastern army but the necessity of replacing deklan conqueror was admitted by all the solution eventually reached was a temporary one succession by dynastic inheritance was allowed under the nd amendment to the constitution not the rdthats a common mistake it was the nd amendment that allowed succession by inheritance the rd was the one that abolished the supreme courtand since deklan was childless that mantle could be construed as falling to his heroic nephew julianwho at the time was caught up in the siege of striver and wouldnt complicate matters either by accepting or by declining thus julian had become a figurehead almost an abstraction and acceptable in that form until the tyrant was hauled out of his throne room by soldiers and clapped into a basement prison now that julian had survived the siege however and since he had been rescued by the singleminded efforts of admiral fairfield the abstract threatened to become uncomfortably real had julian been killed some other arrangement would have been made perhaps to everyones greater satisfaction but julian conqueror livedand the public sentiment on his behalf had grown so clamorous that it would have been impossible not to install him in the presidency for fear of triggering riots for that reason he had been surrounded both during his recovery and on the voyage back to new york city by a phalanx of military advisors civilian consultants clerical toadies and a thousand other brands of manipulators and officeseekers my opportunities to speak to him privately had been few and when we arrived in manhattan he was quickly enclosed in a mob of senators and beribboned soldiers and borne away toward the presidential palace and i could not even say goodbye or arrange a time to meet once more but that wasnt a pressing problemit was calyxa who was foremost on my mind i had written her several letters from the hospital in st johns and even telegraphed her once but she hadnt responded and i feared the worst i made my way from the docks to the luxurious brownstone house of emily baines comstock where i had left calyxa in the care of julians mother it was heartening to see that familiar building apparently unchanged bathed in the glow of a manhattan dusk as sturdy a habitation as it had ever been with lantern light glinting sweetly at the curtained windows but as i approached the walk a soldier stepped out of the shadows and raised his hand no admittance sir he said that was astonishing and i was outraged as soon as i was sure i had understood the man correctly get out of my way thats an order i added since my colonels stripes were intact and plainly visible the soldier blanched but didnt stand down he was a young man probably a fresh draftee a leaseboy hauled out of some southern estate judging by the accent in his voice sorry colonel but i have my ordersvery strictno one to be admitted without authorization my wife is in this house or was or ought to bewhat under heaven are you doing here preventing exit or entry sir by what authority writ of ecclesiastical quarantine thats a mouthful whats it signify dont precisely know sir the soldier confessed im new at this well where do these orders emanate from my superior officer down at the fifth avenue headquarters most directly but i think it has something to do with the dominion ecclesiastical means church dont it i expect it does who is inside that youre guarding so adamantly only a couple of women my heart beat twice but i pretended to keep aloof your dangerous prisoners are women i deliver food parcels to them now and again women sir yes sir a young one and an old one i dont know anything about their crimes they dont seem hateful or especially dangerous though theyre a little shorttempered now and then especially the younger femaleshe hardly speaks but it bites theyre in there now yes sir but as i said no admittance i couldnt contain myself any longer i shouted calyxas name at the greatest volume i could muster the guard cringed and i saw his hand stray to the pistol on his hip i dont think thats allowed sir do your orders say anything about preventing a uniformed officer from shouting in the street i guess they dont specifically but then specifically follow your orders as they were writtenguard the door if you have to but dont improvise and dont pay any attention to whats going on the sidewalk the sidewalks of new york are not your kingdom right at the moment sir the young man said blushing but he didnt contradict me and i called out calyxas name several more times until the head of my beloved wife at last appeared at an upstairs window i could hardly contain my happiness at the sight of her how often i had imagined seeing her again during the long goose bay campaign calyxas form recalled in the interlude between waking and sleep had become a deity to which i inclined as predictably as any mohammedan to mecca framed in the upstairs window of mrs comstocks stone house she looked at least as lovely as any of my visions of her though a little more impatient which was not surprising i called out her name once more just to feel the throb of it in my throat yes its me she called back im home from the war i see that cant you come in theres a guard on the door well thats the problem calyxa turned away for a moment then reappeared mrs comstock is here also though she doesnt like to shout at the windowshe sends her regards why are you locked up is it the trouble with the dominion you wrote to me about its too long a story to bellow into the street but deacon hollingshead is in back of it julian wont let this go on i hope he hears about it quickly then the soldier on guard during this exchange peered at me with a frank curiosity his jaw agape i didnt enjoy his close attention i wanted to ask calyxa about our childi wanted to proclaim my love for herbut the draftees blunt stare and the public circumstances in general made me feel awkward about it calyxa i called out i have to tell youmy affectionate feelings are not diminished cant hear you undiminished affection mine for you please dont waste time adam she left her place at the window i turned to the guard my cheeks burning are you enjoying the show soldier but he was immune to irony or had been raised somewhere outside its orbit yes sir he said thank you for asking its quite a distraction this is tedious work as a rule im sure it is you look cold wouldnt you rather go someplace warm take a meal perhaps this close to christmas i surely would but my relief isnt due for two hours why dont i relieve you i know i cant go insidethat would violate regulationsbut i believe a ranking officer can assume an enlisted mans duties for a short period of time as a kindness on a cold december night thank you colonel but that dodge wont work i cant afford to eat at my own expense i havent been paid since last month with the turbulence in the government and all theres a place around the corner that serves beef tongue and lozenged pork piping hot here i said pulling a pair of comstock dollars out of my pocket and pressing them into his palm go on enjoy yourself and merry christmas to you the recruit looked at the money with wide eyes then clapped the coins into the pocket of his duffel coat i suppose i could leave the ladies in your custody for an hour or sono more than that though i appreciate it and ill make sure theyre safe when you get back delicacy prevents me from recounting every detail of my reunion with calyxa but it was a warm and at times tearful meeting and i made many demonstrations of my affection and perceived with amazement and a melting pride the way her feminine form had softened and enlarged mrs comstock watched these displays with uncomplaining indulgence until our intimacies began to embarrass her then she said there are important subjects we need to discuss adam hazzard unless you mean to carry calyxa off to the bridal chamber instantaneously i might have liked very much to do just that but i submitted to the implied suggestion and left off kissing my wife for a time ive bribed the guard away i said we can escape now if you like if it were a matter of bribery said mrs comstock we would have been away long agobut where do you imagine we would go were not criminals and i at least dont propose to behave like one this is confusing to me i confessed im less than two hours off the boat from newfoundland and ive had no answer to the letters i sent they didnt arrive or were turned back and julian is here as well thats what the ringing of the city bells was all about he was carried off to the executive palace to be inaugurated or whatever they do with new presidents mrs comstock was relieved to hear the news so much so that she had to sit down and compose herself it was a long moment until she took notice of me again im sorry adam she said take a chair and keep still while i explain the situation then we can discuss the important question of what to do about it her explanation was discursive with much backtracking and heated interjections from calyxa but the gist of it was this since deacon hollingsheads arrival in town last july the dominion had been hard at work cleansing new york city of moral corruption corruption is a popular word with the enthusiasts of the dominion usually uttered as a prelude to the knife the docket or the noose in the present case it referred to the growing number of nontithing churches in this citychurches that is which were not just unrecognized by the dominion but disdained that recognition for they regarded the dominion as a worldly institution feeding on forced donations while it suppressed genuine apostolic brotherhood and individual salvation in christ i had heard of these renegade churches they existed in all the large cities but were especially common in manhattan where several varieties of them catered to the poor and malcontent to the lowest echelons of mechanical workers or to the egyptians and other newlyarrived immigrants but i could make no connection between these institutions and the confinement of calyxa and mrs comstock we were found in calyxa said bluntly interrupting mrs comstocks more nuanced narrative what do you mean found in found in what its a legal term mrs comstock said we were arrested with a dozen other people when one of these institutions was raided by hollingshead and his clerical policefound in attendance in other words you were attending a renegade church that surprised me since mrs comstocks religious devotions in the past had been wholly conventional and calyxa who was educated in a catholic institution often told me she had garnered from that experience just as much religion as she expected to need and then some not for religious purposes calyxa said the church allowed its premises to be used for political meetings i had been telling mrs comstock about the idea of the parmentierists and she was interested and we went there so she could take a sample isnt that an extenuating circumstance not in deacon hollingsheads eyes said mrs comstock parmentierism hardly constitutes an alibi under the current regime i almost suspect the deacon pursued us for the explicit purpose of incriminating us it may have been part of some scheme he worked up with the executive before deklan was deposed but deklan is deposed and youre still confined to the house deacon hollingshead is as powerful as ever and a writ of ecclesiastical quarantine isnt so easily suborned once issued it tends to stick were only here and not in jail along with all the other foundins because i am a comstock and calyxa is pregnant the law preventing pregnant women from being jailed on suspicion or prosecuted for proven crimes dates from the era of the plague of infertility for many years after the fall of the cities it seemed as if our human numbers might drop below some critical levelthat we would become an extinct species as so many other species had become extinct during the efflorescence of oil that threat has receded of courseour numbers are steadily increasingbut the law along with a host of other laws and customs protecting female virtue and fertility remains firmly in effect julian will fix it i said i expect he will mrs comstock said once he learns about it he wont be easily reached however now that hes installed in the executive palace i can find a way to him i expect it wont be necessary julian has never failed to join me for christmas if he was in manhattan and im sure hell send for me this year in any case calyxa isnt due until april which means hollingshead cant act until then no adam i have another commission for you if youll accept it i could hardly refuse though this was all a surprise to me and disorienting in its effects my commission mrs comstock said involves sam godwin sam i havent seen sam since labrador he was sent home with an injury we asked after him at the military hospital in st johns but he had already passed through bound for new york he must have arrived long sincehave you seen him i would like to shake his hand again his remaining hand i thought but did not say i made similar inquiries mrs comstock told me and i know he arrived safely in the city and spent some days at the soldiers rest but he was releasedand promptly vanished or at least hasnt bothered to contact me this isnt like him adam i agreed that it was not perhaps i can find him and solve the mystery i hoped you would say so she beamed thank you adam hazzard you dont need to thank me but what about the guard on the door hell be back before long and i cant stay never mind the guardhes harmless and as prisons go this one is comfortable enough once im out of the house it might be difficult to get back in i said i didnt like the idea that i might be barred from my marital chamber for some indefinite time it was cruel if not unusual stay at the soldiers rest if you have to and say your goodbyes to calyxa for the time being well be together again on christmas day im sure of it welcome home adam calyxa added and she embraced me again and we exchanged intimacies once more until mrs comstock indicated by the clearing of her throat and the rolling of her eyes that the time had come for me to leavetoo soon the guard was returning as i came down the steps into the damp december air thank you colonel he said that was a fine meal much appreciated and merry christmas to you keep a firm watch on the house i told him be sure you dont let any villains in i passed the night at the soldiers rest near the docks my rank entitled me to better accommodations than a common soldier would have received though in practice this was just a cubicle containing a yellow mattress and a threadbare blanket the bed and the blanket were infested with fleas who took the opportunity to cavort at will and dine at leisure and i slept fretfully and hurried out as soon as the sky grew light sam godwin was in new york or recently had been that much was an established fact i went to the regimental headquarters and the clerk there showed me a ledger which said sam had been discharged as a wounded veteran it listed a new york address where mail could be forwarded the address was in a disreputable neighborhood not far from the immigrant district i went there directly the houses in that location were mainly wooden frame structures crowded shouldertoshoulder most of them divided up into rooms for rent with here and there a tavern or hemp shop or gambling den in which degraded men could indulge their vices without traveling very far out of their way smoke poured from every chimney for the day was cold the thought of all those coalgrates and woodstoves made me wary of fire for these buildings were little more than tinder and brown paper putting on airs of architecture i knocked at a ramshackle door and after a while an elderly woman with pox scars on her face answered when i asked for sam godwin she said i dont know any but i pressed her with a description and proclaimed him as my friend and she relented and showed me to an upstairs room at the end of a lightless corridor the door was a little ajar i pushed it and entered calling out sams name he was asleep on a narrow bed no better than the one i had occupied during the night he wore a ragged shirt and he had pulled an old overcoat around himself to serve as a blanket his face was drawn and haggard even in repose his hair was thinner than i remembered it his beard unkempt and almost entirely white his left arm was curled under him and pressed against his belly as if to shelter his missing hand there was a bottle on the floor beside him and on the battered nighttable a longstemmed pipe and a wooden box with a few crumbs of dried hemp flowers in it i sat on the bed beside him sam i said sam wake up if you can hear me its meits adam hazzard a few repetitions of this and he began to stir he groaned and turned on his back and sighed and opened one eye warily as if he anticipated bad news at last the light of sensibility seemed to penetrate all the way to his inward parts and he struggled to sit up adam he mumbled in a hoarse voice yes sam its me adamoh i thought for a moment we were back in labradoris that the sound of shelling no sam this is new york city though not a very attractive neighborhood of it the sound is just freight wagons out on the street he stared at me afresh as comprehension dawned adam but i left you at striver you and julian the basilisk carried me away it carried us away too sam a few weeks later and after considerable tragedy and fuss i thought what the situation was hopeless striver was meant to be a slaughterhouse and seemed to serve the purpose i thought that we had been killed that you had been killed yes and that i had failed in my commission of protecting julian is that why youre living in these circumstances but were alive samim alive and julian is alive have you looked at a newspaper lately he shook his head not for weeks i suppose you mean to say admiral fairfield reinforced the divisions at striver i mean to say that deklan comstock is no longer president if you had poked your head out of this ugly den you might have seen the army of the laurentians marching to depose him sam in his amazement stood up suddenly and then blushed as he didnt have his trousers on he took a crumpled pair from the floor and buttoned himself into respectability with a shaking hand damn me for my inattention deklan comstock deposed and have they installed a new president yes sam they have but perhaps you had better sit down again before i tell you about it i helped sam dress himself and comb his hair and when he was relatively presentable i took him to a nearby tavern where we ordered eggs and toast from the kitchen it wasnt gourmet farethe butter was maggotybut it was filling sam admitted that he had been alone since his return to manhattan it wasnt just his grief over julians presumed death that had caused him to hide himself away it was the loss of his left hand or the sense of wholeness and manliness that went with it he ate efficiently with his right hand but kept his left forearm immobile in his lap and he was careful at all times not to show the stump he kept his chin down and avoided the eyes of other customers i didnt mention his condition to him or act as if i noticed it and i thought by that strategy to distract him while he ate i shared the story of my adventures with julian in striver and julians unexpected ascension to the presidency sam was greatly interested and thanked me repeatedly for relieving his mind about julian not that the presidency is any kind of safe haven god knows im glad you came to me adam and i thank you for the meal but you had better leave me alone after this i dont care to see people as things stand im not what i used to be im of no value to julian anymore im a useless appendage the problem is more pressing than that sam deacon hollingshead has been making trouble for calyxa she and julians mother are both confined under guard pending prosecution sams eyes which until now had worn a moist narcotized glaze narrowed to a fine point emily is in danger potentially yesand calyxa it was mrs comstock who asked me to find you emily he spoke the word in a tormented voice i dont want her to see me like this understandably but we can buy you a bath and a haircut as soon as you finish your breakfast i dont mean that but it might be a good idea in any case mrs comstock is particular about the odors of things what im ashamed of adam is nothing i can bathe away he was talking about the stump of his arm of course emily comstock doesnt care about that sam perhaps she doesnt i do he lowered his voice though the pain in it was impossible to disguise there was a time after i left striver when i prayed for the infection to kill me that kind of prayer isnt welcome in heaven and im not surprised it wasnt answered im less than a whole man did you feel that way about oneleg willy bass back when he was chasing us through the wilds of athabaska seems to me you had considerable respect for him though he lost more of his leg than you did of your arm the comparison appeared to startle him willy bass was nobodys cripple but is that what you imagine i want adama career in the reserves i dont pretend to guess what you want as a career but dont you want to help mrs comstock when she needs you thats the issue right now of course i want to help her but what use is a drunken cripple noneso you must stop drinking and you certainly must stop thinking of yourself as a cripple show me your injury he bristled and kept his arm below the table and refused to speak i worked alongside dr linch at the field hospital in striver i said ive seen amputations before and worse things than amputations you have always been a kind of second father to me but it seems the role is reversed dont be a child sam show me his cheeks burned crimson and for a long moment he sat stiff in his chair i hoped he would not take offense and strike me with his good right hand for he was still a powerful man despite his recent debauches but he relented averting his eyes he raised his arm until it was just visible above the rim of the table well thats nothing i said though in fact it was an unsettling sight the stump of his forearm terminating in an old bandage rusty with stains it still weeps from time to time he whispered we all do well sam i suppose you have to decide which you value moreyour wounded pride or emily baines comstock if the former go back to your hovel and drink yourself to death if the latter come to a barber with me and have a bath and let me change that bandage and then well get our women out of the trouble theyre in or die trying there was a risk in saying this he might have walked away but i had never known sam to refuse a challenge bluntly presented i suppose a bath wont kill me he muttered though the look he gave me was vicious and ungrateful the towns barbers and bathhouses had already begun to close for christmas eve but we managed to find one of each still willing to serve us we also visited a clothing shop and exchanged sams military rags for a more presentable civilian outfit these purchases just about exhausted the pay i carried with me and sam had only pennies in his pockets but he wouldnt go to emily comstocks house right away he wanted to recover from his debauches first so we spent a night at the soldiers rest he slept soundly while i fought a series of skirmishes with the invertebrates gamboling among the bedclothes christmas morning came we woke about dawn and refused the offer of a charitable breakfast we should go directly to mrs comstocks i said if youre ready im far from ready he said but i wont get any readier by waiting there was a carriage at the brownstone house when we arrived there it was a fine full carriage with three horses to pull it and gilt embellishments and the crest of the presidential palace on the doors it was accompanied by a number of republican guards who had overpowered the single posted sentry not the same man i had treated to a meal and who were escorting mrs comstock and calyxa to the vehicle calyxa and mrs comstock caught sight of us as we approached they beckoned us aboard the carriage the republican guards initially resisted this suggestionit wasnt part of their detailbut relented after a tonguelashing from julians mother as quick as that the four of us were confined together in the cabin of the conveyance sam looked at mrs comstock and she looked at him and there was a protracted and uncomfortable silence then mrs comstock spoke up you lost your left hand she said i blanched and calyxa winced and sam turned red emily he said in a husky voice was it a war injury or just carelessness lost in battle cant be helped then i suppose your beard is whiter than i remember it i suppose that cant be helped either and you look frailsit up he straightened emily its good to see you again im sorry it had to be under such circumstances the circumstances are about to be altered were off to the executive palace at julians request is that your best shirt my only shirt i dont think the war has done you very much good sam i guess it hasnt or you adamis that a flea on your trouserleg speck of dirt i said as it leapt away i hope there are no photographers at the palace mrs comstock said grimly we were escorted through the main public chambers of the executive palace past the wainscoted rooms where we had been entertained during the presidential reception of the previous independence day to a series of cozier rooms in which lamps glowed on polished tabletops and fires burned in ventilated iron stoves and at last to a spacious but windowless sitting room in which a fir tree had been set up and decorated with colored glass bulbs of intricate design julian was waiting for us there and he dismissed the guards at once it was an emotional christmas morning all around considering half of us had nearly given up hope of seeing the other half alive julian embraced his mother tearfully sams haggard face regained some of its former animation whenever he gazed at emily baines comstock and calyxa and i were inseparable on a settee near the fire hasty narratives and explanations were delivered by all hands julian had only just learned of his mothers confinement at the hands of deacon hollingshead and he was seething with anger but he suppressed those feelings for the sake of the holy occasion and tried to focus his conversation on pleasanter things but it was impossible to ignore the changes in julians manner and appearance since the last time we had all gathered together both calyxa and mrs comstock gave him troubled glances it wasnt just the scar on his cheek or the immobility of his mouth on that side of his face though those things lent him a new and uncharacteristically sinister expression there was a coolness about hima deliberation that appeared to mask great turbulence the way a calm sea conceals the peregrinations of the whale and the appetites of the shark julian asked about his mothers confinement to the brownstone house and what sort of case deacon hollingshead had made against her and calyxa he was startled to learn that they had been found in at an unaffiliated church and he asked his mother whether she had given up methodism for incense and prophecy we were there for a political meeting of parmentierists even worse but the church of the apostles etc is not that kind of institution in any case i spoke at length with the pastor a mr stepney hes a thoughtful young man not entirely a fanatic and very presentable and handsome sam frowned at this description but said nothing what does he preach death to the aristocracy like his parmentierist friends pastor stepney isnt a firebreather julian i dont know all the details of his doctrine except that it has to do with evolution and the bible being written backward or something like that evolution in what sense he talks about an evolving godi dont understand it to be honest i think i might like to meet pastor stepney one day and debate theology with him julian said it was a genial remark not seriously intended though it turned out to be prophetic in view of the continuing harassment of mrs comstock and calyxa by deacon hollingshead it was sensibly resolved that they could not return to the brownstone house there were a number of luxurious guesthouses on the property of the executive palace not currently in use and julian designated one of those for his mother and another for calyxa and me we would be safe there he said until he could settle this row with the dominion for the rest of the day and well into the evening julian turned aside any courtiers who came calling and devoted all his attention to his old friends and family until at last full of good food from the palace kitchen we retired it was a blessing to lie down on a bed that was soft and not an invertebrate playground and to share it with calyxa for the first time in many months we celebrated christmas in our own fashion once we were aloneill say no more about it julian was busy too though we didnt know it i had only just finished breakfast the following morning when he summoned me to attend a meeting he had arranged with deacon hollingshead christmas had fallen on a sunday that year a sort of double sabbath which accounted for some of the unusual calm at the executive palace monday marked a return to the customary bustle servants and bureaucrats were everywhere as well as a number of highranking military men they brushed past me as i went to keep my appointment with the president alternately ignoring me or eyeing me with suspicion but julian was alone in the office where he was scheduled to meet the deacon any conference between the executive branch and the dominion he explained is closed to the bureaucracy then what am i doing here hollingshead is bringing a scribe presumably to write down anything i say that might be turned against me i insisted on the same privilege im not much of a scribe julian the politics of the situation are opaque to me i understand and all i expect you to do is sit quietly with a pad and pencil if at any point deacon hollingshead begins to seem uncomfortable write something downor at least pretend to write something down so as to compound his discomfort im not sure i can remain complacent if he begins to talk about calyxa you dont have to be complacent adam just silent it wasnt much longer before the deacon arrived he came with a cortege of ecclesiastical police which he parked in the anteroom he was dressed very formally in his dominion vestments and he bowed his way into julians presence with all the pomp of an oriental king he nodded at julian and shook his hand and smiled unctuously and congratulated him on his swearingin as deklans successor he could not have been sincere in this but his acting was firstrate entirely suitable for the broadway stage apart from a single glance he ignored me altogether and i wasnt sure whether he recognized me as calyxas husband his own scribe was a meanlooking little man with gimlet eyes and a fixed scowl this creature set himself down in a chair opposite the chair where i sat he glared at me and i glared back we did not speak the formalities and pleasantries continued for a time between julian and deacon hollingshead they spoke not as princes but as principalities each of them we alluding to the separate fiefdoms they represented the executive branch and the dominion they didnt launch immediately into a discussion of the difficult subject at hand but warmed up with generalities julian talked about his plan for greater cooperation between the navy and the army of the laurentians in the conduct of the war in labrador deacon hollingshead talked about the need for a pious and prayerful foreign and domestic policy and about the dominions role in fostering that happy outcome commonplace as these sentiments might seem they were at bottom disguised assertions of power julian was boasting that he controlled the military and hollingshead was reminding him that the dominion held a sort of veto power exercisable through the nations pulpits they were like two tomcats each one puffed up to make himself seem larger in the eyes of the other though they smiled they growled and the growls were an invitation to combat it was julian who finally raised the subject of mrs comstocks house arrest the deacon responded with a conciliatory smile mr president youre talking about the incident at the socalled church of the apostles etc in the immigrant district you know im sure that the raid captured a whole school of parmentierists and radical apostates it was the result of a collaborative investigation between civil authorities and the ecclesiastical police and were proud of the success of it because of that raid there are now people in jail who would otherwise be spreading seditionnot just against the dominion but against the senate and the presidency and there are others suffering under forced confinement who are guilty of nothing at all said julian i dont mean to be disingenuous sir i know your mother was caught up in the matter yes and i had to send the republican guards to wrench her out of your grasp just so we could be together on christmas and i apologize for that im happy to say the writ against her has been annulled shes free to come and go as she likes that took some of the wind from julians sails though he remained wary i think ill keep her on the palace grounds for now deacon hollingshead im not sure shes entirely safe elsewhere thats up to you of course and i thank you for the annulment but shes not the only one under arrest as a result of the affair ahwell that raises a different and more troublesome question your beloved mother could hardly have been part of any conspiracy could she either ecclesiastical or political thats selfevident as for any other persons theyll have to undergo the customary trial if they want to establish their innocence im talking about a woman who is currently my guest on the palace grounds here deacon hollingshead looked directly at methe first and last glance he gave me during this entire encounter i expected to find either open hatred or concealed shame in his face but his features were entirely relaxed and indifferent it was the look an alligator might give to a rabbit who stopped to drink from his pool if the alligator had recently dined and didnt consider another meal worth taking he turned back to julian frowning mr president dont misunderstand me he said mistakes happen i know thati freely admit it we made a mistake in the case of your mother and we corrected it as soon as it was brought to our attention but the dominion is a rockimmovablewhen it comes to matters of principle i think we both know better than that deacon hollingshead excuse me no if you and i were ordinary men with a worldly disagreement some compromise might be worked out but this is an ecclesiastical matter above all else the threat of the unaffiliated churches isnt trivial or ephemeral we take it very seriously and im speaking here for the entire dominion council in other words you can find a way to excuse a high eupatridian but not a common person hollingshead was silent for a moment i hope you dont doubt my loyalty he said at last in a flat and uninflected voice my loyalty to the nation is tempered only by my faith eventually the whole world will come under the government of the dominion of jesus christ and after a thousand years of christian rule the savior himself will return to make his kingdom on earth this is the core doctrine of the dominion to which every participating church must commit itself i believe that revealed truth as wholeheartedly as a man believes in his own existence i hope you believe it too i know youve made statements in the past that could be interpreted as skeptical even blasphemous i doubt that you know any such thing said julian well sir i have sworn affidavits from a dominion officer a major lampret who was attached to your unit during the saguenay campaign and he testifies to that charge its a charge is it but i dont think you ought to take major lampret so seriously he did a lamentable job of discharging his duties in battle perhaps he did or perhaps he was defamed by jealous officers what im telling you sir is that your faith has been impugned in some circles and it might be a good idea to publicly demonstrate your confidence and trust in the dominion and if i do that if i make some fawning statement to the press will mrs calyxa hazzard be redeemed from her ecclesiastical writ that remains to be seen i believe the chances are good but the writ remains in effect until i make such a gesture deacon hollingshead was wise enough not to affirm a positive threat mrs hazzard can remain on the palace grounds as far as were concerned until her child is brought to term and a trial can be arranged you insist on a trial the evidence against her is substantialit warrants an airing a trial and then what do you really propose to imprison her according to the records weve obtained hollingshead said it wouldnt be the womans first time in prison the rest of the session was a blank to meall i could think about was calyxa and it took a profound exercise of personal will to restrain myself from leaping at the deacon and taking his throat in my hands hollingshead was a large man and i might not have succeeded in choking him to death but it would have been very satisfying to make the attempt and i gave it much thought julian cut the meeting short and asked a republican guard to escort deacon hollingshead and his man off the grounds then he told me to take a deep breath or else i might explode like a diving tipman he means to keep the writ on calyxa i said so he says but shes safe for now adam and we have enough time to work up a strategy strategythat sounds too flimsy its as if hes holding her hostage thats exactly what hes doing he means her to be a hostage and even if i capitulate i expect shell remain a hostage as a check on my behavior what good is strategy if thats the case clearly said julian tugging his yellow beard which made the scar on his cheek dance to the motion what we need to do is to take a hostage of our own i didnt know what he meant by that and he wouldnt explain he asked me to keep the details of the meeting secret especially from calyxa until he had worked out certain notions about how to proceed he said he was determined that the writ would not stand and he assured me calyxa would be safe i tried very hard to believe him on january st a detachment of republican guards surrounded the ancient building on fifth avenue that served as the dominions warehouse of forbidden secular books and documents they forcibly evicted the dominion curator and his staff and took possession of the building in an official decree published in that days spark and other city newspapers julian announced that security concerns had made it necessary to federalize the dominion archives the dominions effort to protect the public from the errors of the secular ancients by barring the doors of this great library while laudable has become unproductive in the modern era when knowledge itself is a weapon of war he wrote and so i have ordered the army to secure that institution and in time to make it accessible to both military and civilian scholars in order to ensure the continued success and prosperity of these united states we had our counterhostage in other words only it was a building not a person hollingshead sent julian a fiery protest on dominion letterhead which arrived by courier the following day julian read it smiling then he crumpled it and tossed it over his shoulder the months between christmas and easter though i spent them mainly on the grounds of the executive palace and under unnerving circumstances were nevertheless happy ones in many ways mainly this was because i could be close to calyxa she remained under the ecclesiastical writ and could not leave the enclosure but her pregnancy would have kept her largely confined in any case and we had julians assurances that he would shelter her from the deacons henchmen and that she would receive the best medical attention doctors of the eupatridian class could provide at the same time i was working on the novel i had promised to mr john hungerford the publisher of the spark the title i settled on was a western boy at sea or lost and found in the pacific in part i had taken the advice theodore dornwood gave me after the battle of mascouche to write what you know and i had made the hero a young man much like myself if somewhat more innocent and trusting much of the narrative however concerned pacific islands and pirates and sea adventures in general for these passages i employed what i had learned of sailing from my time aboard the basilisk along with some generous borrowing from the work of charles curtis easton whose stories had taught me all i knew about the business of asiatic piracy the book was a pleasure to write and i thought it both original and good though what was original about it was not necessarily good and what was good about it was not always original the chapters i showed to mr hungerford pleased him and he declared that the finished product would probably sell briskly given the popular taste in such things most mornings i wrote until noon and then took lunch with calyxa during the afternoon i would walk for exercise sometimes in the streets of manhattan but more often as the weather improved on the palace grounds the ancient park as some of the groundsmen still called it was full of peculiarities to interest the casual stroller there was for instance an elderly male giraffelast descendant of a family of those unlikely creatures donated by an african prime minister during the days of the pious presidentswho was allowed to wander freely eating leaves from trees and hay from the lofts of the horsebarns it was best not to approach the animal too closely for he was eviltempered and would stampede anyone who annoyed him but he was beautiful when apprehended from a distance where his shabbiness and bile were less distinct he especially liked to pass time on the statuary lawn and it was fascinating to see him taking the shade of cleopatras needle or standing next to the copper torch of the colossus of liberty as if he expected it to sprout green and edible shoots which of course it never did on rainy days he sheltered in the ailanthus grove near the pond there were fences to keep him out of the hunting grounds so he wouldnt be accidentally shot his name the groundskeepers told me was otis he was a noble bachelor giraffe and i admired him there were occasions that winter when julian weary of the distractions of the presidency came to the guest house and asked me to go rambling with him we spent several sunny chilly afternoons walking the preserve with rifles pretending to hunt but really just reliving the simple pleasures we had shared in williams ford julian continued to talk about philosophy and the fate of the universe and such thingsinterests which had been rekindled by his exploration of the dominion archive and deepened by the tragedies he had experienced at war a certain tone entered his conversationmelancholy almost elegiacwhich i had not heard before and i put this down to his experiences during the goose bay campaign which had hardened him considerably he visited the liberated archive often one saturday in march i went with him to that contested building at his invitation the buildings marbled facade one of the oldest standing structures in the city was still ringed with armed guards to prevent any attempt at reoccupation by the ecclesiastical police we arrived under the careful escort of the republican guard but once inside we were able to roam unaccompanied in what julian called the stacksroom after room of tightlypacked and closelyarranged shelves on which books from the days of the secular ancients were arrayed in startling numbers its a good thing for us the ancients were so prolific in their publishing julian said his voice echoing among the dusty casements during the fall of the cities books were often burned for fuel millions of them must have been lost in that wayand millions more to neglect mildew floods and so on but they were produced in such numbers that many still survive as you can see the dominion did us a noble service by preserving them and committed a heinous crime by keeping them hidden the titles i inspected seemed random and the books long neglected by their dominion caretakers had not been arranged according to any rational scheme though julian had initiated the work of having them catalogued and itemized here julian said drawing my attention to a particular shelf which his small army of clerks and scholars had begun to arrange labeled scientific subjects it held not one but three copies of the history of mankind in space all of them pristine covers and bindings intact he took one down and handed it to me keep it adamyour old copy must be getting ragged by now and there are duplicates it wont be missed this book unlike the one recovered from the tip at williams ford possessed a brightly colored paper wrapper with a picture of what i recognized from previous study as the plains of mars dusty under a pinkish sky the printed image was so crisp and clear it made me shiver as if the ethereal winds of that distant planet were blowing out of it but it must be very valuable i said there are things in this building far more valuable than that authors and texts from the efflorescence of oil and before think about the dominionapproved literature we were raised on adam all that nineteenthcentury piety the clergy admire sosusan warner and mrs eckerson and elijah kellog and that crewbut the dominion readers dont include hawthorne from that era or melville or southworth just to begin with and as for the twentieth century theres a whole world we havent been allowed to seescientific and engineering documents works of unbiased history novels in which people curse like sailors and fly in airplanes do you know what we found locked away in the cellar adam im sure i dont movies he grinned at least a dozen of themmovies on celluloid film in metal canisters from the days of the secular ancients i thought none had survived i thought so too until we uncovered these have you seen any of them not yet theyre fragile and they dont run in the simple projection machines we use but i assigned a group of mechanics to study them and work on the problem of duplicating them for posterity or at least rendering them into a form more easily viewed this was all wonderful and daunting i took books from the shelves and handled them reverently fully conscious that they had not been regarded by sympathetic eyes since before the fall of the cities later julian would give me another book he had culled from among the archival duplicates a short novel called the time machine by mr h g wells about a marvelous but apparently imaginary cart which carried a man into the futureand it fascinated mebut the archive itself was a time machine in everything but name here were voices preserved on browning paper like pressed flowers whispering apostasies into the ear of a new century it was dark by the time we left and i was dazed by what i had seen we were silent for a time as the carriage and its military escort passed along broadway and into the grounds of the presidential palace but i had been thinking about what julian had said regarding movies and i was reminded of that project he used to talk about so passionately namely the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin what about your movie julian i asked have you made any advancement on that front julian was busy these days with matters of state but in his spare time he had admitted to me he still contemplated the project which might now be within practical reach and he had begun writing a script for it on this occasion he was evasive certain things are difficult to work out details of plot and so forth the script is like a horse with a nail in its hoofit isnt dead but it wont move forward what are the problems exactly i make darwin the hero of it and we see his fascination with beetles as a child and he talks about the relationship of all living things and then he gets on a boat and goes looking at finches finches for the shape of their beaks and such which leads him to certain conclusions about heredity and environment all this is important and true but it lacks drama i suggested drama possibly well the boat is a good touch you cant go wrong with a boat the heart of the thing eludes me it wont settle down on paper the way i want it to perhaps i can help you with it thank you adam but no i would rather keep the business to myself at least for now if julians cinematic workinprogress lacked drama the incidents of daily life did not especially regarding his increasingly hostile relations with the dominion of jesus christ in general and deacon hollingshead in particular sam told me he feared julian was involving himself in a battle he could never win the dominion had a devious history and deep pockets he said and julians best bet would be to ingratiate himself with the senate and be sure to keep the army on his side which would give him greater leverage in any political wrestling match with colorado springs but that was strategy for the long run in the short term it was the threat to calyxa that concerned us julians capture of the dominion archive did not result in the withdrawal of the writ against calyxa nor did it seem that julian would be willing to surrender his prize now that he had it in his possession even if such a bargain had been offered but he continued to insist that calyxa was safe and i could hardly believe otherwise since it would require a wholesale revolution before the dominion could march onto the grounds of the executive palace and take her into their custody in all likelihood julian said deacon hollingshead wouldnt even issue a summons to court if he did julian would see that it was quashed in light of all this he began to take a greater interest in the events that had resulted in the writ of ecclesiastical quarantine in the first place this church where you were found in he asked calyxa is it still in operation or did hollingshead shut it down completely the parmentierist friends calyxa had made in the city continued to keep her informed of developments she sat on a sofa in the guesthouse this was late in march on a windy night her swollen belly prominent under a maternity dress mrs comstock had obtained for her she looked beatific i thought with her coiled hair for a halo and i could not so much as glance at her without smiling to myself the glances she returned were not always equally warm for carrying a child to term is a cumbersome job which can wear down a persons good spirits its former location has been seized and put up for auction she said but pastor stepney managed to avoid arrest the church of the apostles etc continues to meet at a new location and with a different congregation since the first batch are still in prison im curious about this church we might do ourselves a favor by learning more about the case as a way of anticipating any new move hollingshead might make stepney seems like a good man mrs comstock remarked though i only saw him from a distance i was impressed with him despite his radical doctrines she said this even though she knew the words would make sam who was also visiting us that evening shudder and scowl she gave him sidelong glances to gauge his reaction which i suspect she found entertaining i could take you there calyxa said if i were allowed to travel freely in the city she was far too close to her term to entertain any such idea and julian quickly demurred then mrs comstock said well i for one would like a chance to speak to pastor stepney and get to know him perhaps i could go with you julian if calyxa will tell us the current address the last thing we need sam growled if for you to be found in a second time i wont sanction it i didnt ask for your sanction mrs comstock said stiffly julian forestalled the argument with a wave of his hand im the one whos curious he said and im the one deacon hollingshead wouldnt dare to arrest perhaps adam and i can go to this mans church with enough republican guards to warn us if the dominion tries some trick it would be dangerous even so said sam is it hollingshead youre afraid of sam or the charismatic mr stepney sam didnt respond to julians impertinent question but lapsed into a brooding silence it might be a fascinating expedition julian repeated will you come with me adam tomorrow say i said i would in fact i wasnt much interested in pastor stepneys apostate church but i was interested in julians interest in it stepney is just the type to intrigue julian calyxa said as i climbed into bed beside her that night march breezes rattled the big bedroom windows and it was pleasant to huddle under the thick blankets with my arm around my wife probably a fraud like most of these unaffiliated pastors and his doctrines dont interest me but he was generous to the parmentierists who met at his church and he talked a good line whenever i happened to overhear him not the usual smallchurch fanaticism much about time and evolution and such topics the sort of thing julian likes to babble about and hes as eloquent as any aristo julian thinks of it as philosophy more than babble i said maybe so either way its thin gruel for a working woman or a mechanic with a grievance here fold yourself around me adamim cold i did as she asked and we grew warm together pastor stepneys former church in the immigrant district having been seized and sold he had moved his enterprise to the loft of a crumbling warehouse alongside one of the canals of lower manhattan julian disguised himself in the clothing of an ordinary working man and i wore the same and we walked up the wooden steps to the loft by ourselves though there were republican guards in plain clothes outside ready to warn us if the dominions men arrived in any force a sign had been tacked to the door at the top of the stairs engraved in an ornate script with the words church of the apostles etc god is consciencehave no otherlove your neighbor as your brother thats a noble sentiment i said i suppose it is more often honored in the breach though i imagine well see julian knocked at the door it was answered by a woman in a tight red dress and a heavy shawl in appearance she resembled one of the less virtuous women who frequented the neighborhood perhaps a few years past her peak of desirability but i dont meant to insult her character only to offer a description yes she said we would like to meet pastor stepney said julian theres no service on at the moment thats all right we dont require one well come in the woman admitted us into a small barelyfurnished room ill tell him youre here if you tell me who you are pilgrims in search of enlightenment julian said smiling we get five or six of those a day the woman said pilgrims are cheap as fleas around here sit down ill find out if he has time for you she vanished through another door and we perched ourselves on the small bench that was the only available seat a few pamphlets had been left on the rough pine table in front of us the evolving god was the title of one he takes an interest in evolution i said thats unusual for a clergyman i doubt he knows what hes talking about these impostors seldom do but perhaps hes sincere even worse said julian then the adjoining door opened and pastor stepney himself came into the room he was a handsome man mrs comstock and calyxa had already testified to that effect and i could not say they were wrong stepney was a tall slender youthhe looked no older than julianwith lustrously dark skin and wiry hair but his most arresting feature was his eyes which were penetrating opulent and of a shade so dark it was almost umber he gave us a benevolent smile and said in a soothing voice how can i help you boys come for some spiritual wisdom have you im at your service as long as you dont forget the donationbox on the way out julian stood up at once his demeanor had utterly changed his eyes grew wide with astonishment my god he exclaimed of all the stepneys in new york cityis that you magnus magnus stepney yes the pastor said backing off warily dont you know me magnus though were both years older now the young pastor frowned a moment more then his own eyes expanded in astonishment julian he cried a grin breaking out on his face julian comstock by the grace of god but arent you president now it took me a while to sort out this unexpected development but i wont compel the reader to share my own confusion it was obvious that julian and stepney had met before and from listening to their conversation i garnered a few salient facts stepney invited us into his sanctuarywhich was the greater part of the warehouse loft fixed up with benches and a makeshift altarso that we could talk more comfortably i use the collective we but in fact it was julian and the pastor who talkedi kept out of it they had embarked on a series of reminiscences even before julian remembered to introduce me this is magnus stepney an old acquaintance of mine he said eventually magnus this is adam hazzard another friend pastor stepney shook my hand and his grip was strong and genial pleased to meet you adam are you also some high functionary in the executive branch operating in disguise no just a writer i said julian explained that he had gone to school with this man boy in those days before he was sent to williams ford to protect him from his uncle the school they had attended was a eupatridian institution in which bright aristo children were taught whatever it was considered decorous to know about arithmetic and literature julian and magnus had been fast friends i gathered and a continual terror to their overseers both had been intelligent in advance of their years and impudent in their relations with authority the friendship had been prematurely severed by julians evacuation to athabaska and julian had lost track of his former acquaintance how on earth did you come to be a pastor of a scofflaw church julian asked my father wouldnt toady to the senate in some conflict over a dockside property stepney said and he was punished for it and forced to flee to mediterranean france for his own safety my mother and i would have followed after a prudent time but his ship was lost at sea my mother was all the family i had after that and smallpox took her in i was reduced to accepting any work i could find or making it for myself and this is the result julian asked the church of the apostles etc by a long and winding road yes said stepney he gave julian an abbreviated account of those difficult years while i listened with half an ear i supposed all this meant that pastor stepney was a fraud and his church nothing more than a vehicle for extracting cash donations from gullible parishioners but stepney spoke modestly and apparently sincerely about his religious beliefs and how they had moved him to create the apostate sect of which he was the master this caused julian and stepney to launch into a vigorous discussion of theology the existence of god evolution by natural selection and such topics as that which i inferred had been the subject of their childhood conversations as well i was necessarily left out of such talk and i passed the time by looking over the crudelyprinted pamphlets pastor stepney had left scattered about the place between the pamphlets and the conversation i began to assemble an outline of magnus stepneys unusual doctrines he was a true apostate in that he denied the legitimacy of the dominion of jesus christ as a worldly power and his ideas about god were profoundly unorthodox god he asserted was not contained in any book but was a voice which every human being could hear and which most of us chose to ignore the common name of that voice was conscience but it was a god by any reasonable definition stepney claimed what else could you call an invisible entity who said the same thing to members of every diverse branch of humanity regardless of class geography or language because that voice was not contained in any single mind but experienced consistently by all sane minds it must be more than merely human and therefore a god gods the pamphlets asserted were not supernatural beings but tenuously living things like ethereal plants that evolved in concert with the human species we were simply their mediumour brains and flesh the soil in which they sprouted and grew there were other gods beside conscience but conscience was the one worth worshipping because its commandments if universally obeyed would usher us into a veritable eden of mutual trust and universal charity i dont offer these notions to the reader with my endorsement but only as a sample of magnus stepneys peculiar doctrines at first encounter the ideas seemed to me both eccentric and alarming julians discussion with stepney covered much of the same ground though at greater length julian was obviously entertained by these airy abstractions and enjoyed pressing the pastor with logical objections which stepney for his part equally enjoyed parrying but youre a philosopher julian exclaimed at one point this is philosophy not religion since you rule out supernatural beingsyou know that as well as i do i suppose it is philosophy looked at from one angle stepney conceded but theres no money in philosophy julian religion is far more lucrative as a career yes until the dominion takes your church away my mother and adams wife were caught up in that trouble you know were they are they all right stepney asked with a concern that did not seem feigned yes but only because i took them under my wing the presidents wing must be a reasonably reliable shelter not as sturdy as it could be dont you fear the dominion at all magnus youd be in prison yourself if you hadnt escaped the raid pastor stepney shrugged his broad shoulders im not the only unaffiliated church in town the business is only dangerous when the dominion is in a vindictive mood and the deacons take up these crusades just once or twice in a decade a few weeks or months will pass then theyll declare the city sanctified and the rogue churches will spring up again like mushrooms after a rain the chapel of the church of the apostles etc contained one single high window and through it i could see the daylight beginning to ebb i pointed this out to julian and reminded him that i had promised to be back with calyxa by nightfall as she preferred during the nervous last weeks of her pregnancy julian seemed reluctant to leavehe was enjoying the pastors company and sat so close to him that their knees touchedbut he looked at the window and nodded julian stood up and pastor stepney stood up and they embraced as two old friends you ought to come to the palace julian said my mother would be pleased to see you do you think that would be wise i think it might be fascinating said julian ill send you a note discreetly pastor magnus stepney did come to the executive palace more than once in the ensuing months often for overnight visits and julians renewed acquaintance with his old friend produced two immediate and unanticipated results one was that julian was moved to meddle even further in the relations between the civil authority and the dominion he summoned lawyers and made himself knowledgeable about ecclesiastical law and came to certain conclusions the fact was he said the dominion had no real jurisdiction over the nonaffiliated churches except to deny them membership in its organization what gave the deacons their power was the legal consequence of that denial a rogue church could not be a registered charity nor were its tithes and properties taxexempt in fact its possessions were taxed at a punitive rate forcing such institutions into bankruptcy if they attempted to comply with the law or into an outlaw existence if they did not those regulations had been put in place by a compliant senate and they were enforced by civil not religious authorities julian objected to such laws believing they conferred an undue power on the dominion to remedy the injustice he composed a bill to moderate the levies on such churches and place the burden of proof of apostasy on the complainant deacons he felt he had enough popularity to shepherd the bill through the senate though he knew the dominion would oppose it bitterly for it constituted nothing less than an assault on their longstanding clerical monopoly sam didnt approve of this maneuverit was sure to rake up another fightbut julian would not yield to argument and tasked his subordinates with introducing the measure before the senate as soon as possible the second visible result worked indirectly by the visits of pastor stepney was a change in sams relationship to emily baines comstock mrs comstock was attentive to magnus stepney during his visits although he was only a fraction of her age complimenting his appearance within the hearing of others and saying she was not surprised that he came of eupatridian stock and making other such flattering comments as that this effusive praise wore on sam like a sawblade on a piece of rough lumber sam did not care to see mrs comstock so patently charmed by another and younger man her affections ought to be channeled more in his direction he believed therefore after what must have been much deliberation he summoned up his courage and suppressed his embarrassment and barged into her presence one night while she was dining with calyxa and me he arrived trembling and sweating mrs comstock stared at him as if he were a strange apparition and asked what was wrong with him conditions he beganthen he hesitated shaking his head as if he was appalled at his own effrontery conditions mrs comstock prompted him what conditions and what about them conditions have changed be specific if its within your power before julian assumed the presidency i could neverthat is it wasnt within my compass to askalthough ive always admired you emilyyou know ive admired youour stations in life are differenti dont have to tell you some a soldier and you highbornbut with the recent changes in all our fortunesi can only hope that my feelings are reciprocatedi dont mean to presume to speak for youonly to askto ask hopefullyto ask humbly ask what arrive at a point sam or give it up youre incoherent and were ready for dessert ask for your hand he finished in an uncharacteristically meek and breathless voice my hand in marriage good lord said mrs comstock standing up from her chair will you give it to me emily what an awkward proposal but will you give me your hand she reached out to him frowning i expect ill have to she said since youve gone and lost one of your own sam and emily set their wedding date for midmay and it was to be a quiet ceremony since she was a widow and he was of uncertain lineage as the eupatridians would say i would forever mark that ceremony as the end of a brief golden era in the reign of julian conquerorbut not before the advent of some events even more historical at least from my point of view on tuesday april th two days after we celebrated easter i finished writing a western boy at sea or lost and found in the pacific i presented the typewritten manuscript in person to mr hungerford at the offices of the spark he thanked me and told me he would bring the book to press quickly to capitalize on the recent success of the adventures of captain commongold it might see print by midsummer he said even more significantly calyxa went into labor on the sta friday afternoon as sunny and pleasant as any day that season with a high blue sky and a warm wind blowing the doctor who attended calyxa was a man named cassius polk dr polk was a whitehaired venerable of the highest respectability who carried himself with immense dignity and didnt smoke or drink toward the end of calyxas term he began to spend much of his time at the guesthouse even sleeping there on occasion julian had enrolled him to attend exclusively to calyxa and paid him generously for his time on that particular afternoon he was sitting with me at a table in the kitchen of the house calyxa was resting upstairs as she did most days we knew her hour was near her belly was drumtaut and when i held her at night i could feel the child kicking and moving about inside her with surprising vigor and determination its entrance into the world seemed if anything slightly overdue dr polk sipped a glass of water i had given him he was a discursive man and liked to talk about his work he specialized in obstetrics and female problems and kept an office in a desirable section of manhattan when he was not attending the births of high eupatridians many of his clients he told me were young women of wealth the kind who insist on daring the devil by patronizing vaccination shops i give them my advice on the subject but of course they ignore it i told him i knew very little about the business of vaccination oh its fine in principle vaccination has been a useful preventative for certain diseases since before the efflorescence of oil but it has to be scientifically applied you see the problem with fashionable vaccination is precisely that it is fashionable a scar on the arm is imagined to make a woman more attractive to suitors and it advertises her wealth in addition since the shops charge absurd amounts of money for their services still if its an effective treatment sometimes it ismore often its fraudulent a syringe full of creek water and a sharpened knitting needle the field is rife with profitable fraud and more likely to spread disease than prevent it just this month a new pox has broken out especially severe among the highborn probably as a result of just such unhygienic practices cant the senate make a law against it against vaccination shops i suppose it could but the senators are wedded to the idea of free trade and the invisible hand of the marketplace and all those shibboleths of course they feel the consequences tooor will when their daughters begin to sicken fifteen cases this week alone ten the week before not a pox thats familiar to me either a little like dog pox a little like denver pox in its signs and indications is it very deadly fewer than half my patients have recovered that was alarming do you fear an epidemic then ive seen pox sweep through this city half a dozen times in my career i fear an outbreak of it every day of my life mr hazzard we dont know where epidemics come from and we dont know how to stop them if it were up to me but i never learned what the doctor would do if it were up to him for calyxa called out anxiously from upstairs her labor had begun and polk dashed off to attend her i didnt follow him he had told me to keep clear during the delivery it wasnt a difficult promise to make all i knew of the act of birth was what i had learned as a stableboy in williams ford i understood abstractly that calyxa would be enduring the same trials the brood mares in the duncancrowley barns suffered when they foaled but i could not juxtapose those memories with my intimate knowledge of calyxathe resulting image was distasteful at best the sound of calyxas cries came down from the bedroom at increasingly frequent intervals dr polk had sent for a female accoucheur as the eupatridians called their midwives as soon as the labor began and when this nurse arrived she took note of my anxiety and tried to ameliorate it by giving me a tincture of hemp oil and opium in a glass of water i wasnt accustomed to the medication it took effect within the hour and the result was not altogether calming i lost direction of my thoughts and before long i had invested all my attention in a survey of the doors of the kitchen cupboards the oiled oaken doors became a kind of movie screen to my eyes on which the grain of the wood evolved into images of animals steam engines tropical forests scenes of war etc these impressions were elastic and each one flowed into the next like water in a rocky stream i laughed at some of the visions and recoiled at othersan observer might have mistaken me for feebleminded and while the effect was distracting it was less than reassuring dr polk and his nurse passed in and out of the kitchen like wraiths during this interval drawing pans of water or rinsing out towels hours passed though they might have been minutes or months in so far as i could calculate time in my intoxicated state i did not entirely wake from my reveries until i heard a prodigious scream from the upstairs bedrooma deep masculine scream in the voice of dr polk i stood up shakily i hadnt forgotten my promise to keep out of the doctors way but this seemed like an exceptional circumstance had dr polk really cried out in terror or had i imagined it uncertainty retarded my step then there was another cry neither calyxas nor the doctorsthe nurse had joined the chorus a cold dread came over me and i rushed to the stairs dire fantasies played about my imagination monstrous births and miscarriages had been common during the plague of infertility and they still occurred from time to time even in the second half of the twentysecond century i refused to permit myself the thought that calyxa might have given birth to some creature so unusual that even a hardened physician would cry out and recoil from it but the possibility haunted me the stairs seemed absurdly steep and i was breathless by the time i reached the landing i found the bedroom ajar unsteadily i lunged for it the cause of the excitement was immediately obvious though at first i doubted what i was seeing dr polk and his nurse stood with their backs to the wall expressions of stark terror distorting their faces they were staring at the bedrooms large double window earlier in the day dr polk had thrown open the shutters as he often did in the belief that fresh air is an invalids best friend just now that same window was filled with an enormous foulsmelling bestial head i was not so intoxicated that i didnt grasp what had happened the head belonged to otis otis being a bachelor giraffe must have been attracted by the unusual sounds and smells of childbirth wandering close to the house he had put his head inside the open window as a natural means of satisfying his curiosity but dr polk didnt know that an adult giraffe was allowed to roam the palace grounds and he was understandably startled by such a development his nurse shared his astonishment and terror calyxa was well enough acquainted with otis not to be frightened but his arrival had unfortunately coincided with the penultimate moments of her labor her face was red and dewed with perspiration and she shouted virezmoi cette girafe dici in a fierce and desperate voice i went as close to the window as i dared and made remonstrances with otis by shouting and waving my arms this annoyed him enough that he eventually obliged me by withdrawing i quickly closed the windows and latched the shutters otis bumped his nose against these barriers once or twice then abandoned his inquiries in disgust only a giraffe i said to dr polkapologetically though i was not responsible for otis keep it away please he said struggling to recover his dignity otis is his name he wont bother you any more if you keep the window shut i wasnt warned about giraffes the doctor growled then he regained a degree of composure and told me i was the father of a baby girl readers hoping for a political chronology of julians career as president of the united states with all the minutiae and details of his legislation will be disappointed by my narrative there are several such accounts in print by various authors some of these are quite accurate and others have received the dominion stamp of approval the weeks between easter and independence day of as important as they were in the evolution of the executive powerwere consumed for me by the considerable work and fuss attendant on fatherhood authors who discuss the period generally portray julian as a haughty and implacable enemy of religion or as a broadminded and indulgent friend of liberty as their convictions dictate perhaps both characterizations contain some element of truth for julianespecially in the presidencywas more than one man its true that during this time his hostile relations with the dominion reached the boiling point with consequences familiar to historians its also true that his relations with the unaffiliated churches were warm and generous uncharacteristically so for one who has been labeled the agnostic or the atheist these were not contradictions of policy so much as contradictions of character julian loathed power but couldnt resist the urge to use it for what he considered benevolent ends he had disdained the scepter but now it was in his hands and he made a tool of it his vision expanded and his perspective narrowed i saw him often during these months though not in any official capacity he stopped by the guesthouse often and he was always delighted to see and handle flaxie we had named the child flaxie in honor of my lost sister but also because of her crop of fine wheatcolored hair by the time she reached her first birthday flaxie had lost that baby hair and wore an ebony crown just as lush and tightlycurled as her mothers we kept the name however despite the apparent contradiction flaxie a goodnatured baby enjoyed his attentions and it pleased me to watch them together he was equally attentive to calyxa and made sure she had all she wanted of luxuries and kindnesses during her recovery the only thing he hasnt given me calyxa remarked at one point is an exemption from that damned ecclesiastical writbut he would have done so had it been in his power and he continued to vex deacon hollingshead about it among other weighty issues sam was equally absorbed in the domestic business of his marriage to emily baines comstock now godwin and i was afraid that julian would grow lonely without the kind of close companionship sam and i had formerly offered him for that reason i was glad of his burgeoning friendship with pastor magnus stepney of the church of the apostles etc the two of them had lately become inseparable and their amiable arguments over god and destiny and such topics were for julian a welcome relief and a distraction from the burdens of the presidency in the military realm julian won accolades for consolidating the few gains his uncle had made for withholding further ground initiatives until the army of the laurentians had been restored in strength and spirit and for pursuing the battle with the dutch at sea rather than on land admiral fairfield conducted several successful naval maneuvers during this time and the strategic mitteleuropan coaling station at iqaluit was shelled into submission if it wasnt the final crushing blow to european aggression so many had expected of julian conqueror it was at least enough to satisfy patriotic sentiment in truth that spring and summer season i gave little thought to the future except on those nights when flaxie slept soundly in her crib and calyxa and i lay in bed together talking well have to leave you know calyxa said on one such night in june a warm breeze came through the bedroom window which we had equipped with sturdy screens to discourage insects and giraffes we cant stay here i know i said though its been pleasant enough i would miss the preserve the statuary lawn the respite from urban noise and clutter but we couldnt make the palace grounds a permanent home we can find a place in the city as soon as julian has that writ annulled she shook her head the dominion wont annul it adam its time we admitted the truth of the thing the writ is a point of honor with deacon hollingshead he wont relinquish it until hes in his grave and he has the whole weight of the dominion behind him institutions like the dominion of jesus christ on earth dont surrender power willingly thats pessimistic unless the writ is annulled we cant leave the palace grounds calyxa turned her head away and the moonlight made a reflection in her pensive eyes how long do you think julian will keep the executive if he insists on picking fights with senators and deacons hes only just become president what guarantee is that presidents have had shorter terms it was true that in the course of history certain presidents had been removed or murdered after a brief term of office but only under unusual circumstances most famously young varnum bayard had been deposed after less than a week when he inherited the executive in but that was because he was twelve years old and not experienced enough to defend himself against a coup i said that julian seemed safe enough for now thats an illusion sooner or later adam well have to leave if we want to live out our lives in safety six months from nowa year maybealmost certainly not more than that well but where would we go we would hardly be more anonymous in the city with my career as a bookwriter and the city isnt a safe place either given the new pox thats going around in the worst case adam we might have to leave the city altogether maybe even the country the country to keep flaxie away from harm wouldnt it be worthwhile of course it would if that was the only practical way to protect her but i hardly think it iscertainly not yet not yet calyxa agreed but her mouth was pursed in a frown and her eyes seemed focused on some point well beyond the encompassing walls of the guest house no not yet but time passes adam things change julian is on a dangerous path i dont mind him tackling the dominionhes brave to do itbut i dont mean to let anything happen to flaxie no matter the politics of it of course we wont let anything happen to flaxie tell me again say it again adam and then i might be able to sleep nothing will happen to flaxie i promised her thank you she said sighing she did sleep then i couldnt for the same conversation that settled her fears had aggravated mine after an hour of restlessness i put on a robe and went to sit on the porch of the guesthouse the broad swathes of lawn and forest that comprised the palace grounds lay dark under a clear and moonless sky the appointed hours of the illumination of manhattan had passed and the city cast no special glow summer constellations performed their calendrical marches overhead and i reminded myself that the same stars had shone indifferently over this island back when it was inhabited by secular businessmen or unchurched aborigines before that or even mammoths and giant sloths if julians evolutionary narratives were to be believed because my wife and child were sleeping in the house behind me away from immediate danger i prayed that this particular moment of time would linger indefinitely and that nothing would happen to change it but the world would change one way or anotherit couldnt be stopped from changing julian had preached that homily to me in williams ford long ago and events since then had only driven home the truth of it the stars set the stars rose i went back to my summer bed mr hungerford had wanted a western boy at sea published by the fourth of july in the belief that the patriotic emotions of that universal holiday might boost its sales his printers achieved the goal he set for them the book was impressed and available for purchase by the first of that month i attended a small event at the offices of the spark to celebrate the release apart from mr hungerford i hardly knew any of the persons present in the room some were authors of other books in hungerfords linegenerally a seedy bunch the authors i mean not necessarily their novels many displaying the visible effects of dissipative living present as well were certain manhattan businessmen who distributed books or shopkeepers who sold themalso a roguish crew but less hopelessly inebriated than the writers and more genuinely enthusiastic about my work i said polite things to all these people and reminded myself to smile whenever i detected a witticism copies of a western boy had been stacked on a table they were the first i had seen in finished form i remember to this day the nervous pleasure of holding one of these specimens in my hand and inspecting the twocolor blindstamped illustration on the front of it the illustration showed my protagonist the western boy isaiah compass with a sword in his right hand and a pistol in his left battling a pirate beneath a sketchy palm tree while an octopusinexplicably out of his native elementlooked on menacingly i had not included an octopus in my story and i hoped the general reader his interest aroused by this illustration would not be disappointed by its absence from the text i mentioned my concern to mr hungerford who said it didnt matter there were better things than octopuses in the novel he said the octopus was only there to snag the attention of potential customers in which role it admittedly performed a useful service still i wondered if i ought to put an octopus or some other exciting and deadly form of oceanic life into my next book in order to compensate readers who might feel cheated by this one one new york city writer who was not present at the event nor expected to be since hungerford wasnt his publisher was mr charles curtis easton i asked mr hungerford whether he had ever met that famous author charles easton met him in passing once or twice hes a decent enough old man not at all haughty about his success he lives in a house off nd street i have always admired his work why dont you go see him if youre curious i hear hes willing to entertain fellow writers if they dont take up too much of his time i was intrigued and dismayed by the suggestion im a complete stranger to him hungerford dismissed this objection as trivial he took out one of his personal cards and wrote on the back of it an introduction to me and my work take this with you when you visititll get you in the door i wouldnt like to disturb him do or dontsuit yourself john hungerford said of course i wanted to meet charles curtis easton but i was also afraid that i might embarrass myself by fawning or exhibit my greenness in some other way i could not visit him i decided without some better pretext than a first novel and a scribbled introduction on a calling card as it happened it was julian who provided that pretext julian was visiting calyxa when i arrived back at the guesthouse flaxie sat in his lap flailing at his beard with her tiny fist flaxie was tremendously interested in julians beard which depended from his chin like a hank of yellow twine on the occasions when she managed to get hold of it she yanked it as enthusiastically as a boatcaptain sounding a steam whistle and laughed at the screeches julian inevitably gave out it was a game they both seemed to enjoy though it left julians eyes watering i showed off my new book and gave copies to julian and calyxa they admired it and praised it though uncomfortable questions arose about the illustration on the cover eventually flaxie grew restive and calyxa carried her off for a feeding julian took advantage of her absence to confide in me that his work on the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin remained stalled and incomplete i always meant to make this movie he said now i have the means within my graspwho knows for how much longerand it still wont settle on the page im serious about this adam i need helpi admit it and since youre the author of a novel and have some understanding of these things i want to beg your assistance he had brought the manuscript with him it was a thin stack of pages battered and dogeared from his constant handling of it he seemed abashed when he handed it to me will you look at it he asked with genuine humility and give me any advice that occurs to you im only a novice i said im not sure ill be able to help but i could think of someone who might i waited until monday the third day of july to ride out to nd street to find the residence of mr charles curtis easton the house where he lived was clearly numbered and easy enough to identify in the summer sunlight but i passed it once and passed it twice and passed it yet again working up the courage to knock at the door when i finally knocked however tentatively the door was opened by a woman with a young child tugging at her skirt i showed her hungerfords card with its referral she looked at it and smiled my father generally naps between three and five but ill see if hes available step in please mr hazzard thus i entered the easton house that temple of story which enclosed a cheerful din and where the air was rich with the odors created by good food and perhaps less good children after a brief interval during which three of those same children stared at me with relentless interest mr eastons daughter returned down a flight of stairs dodging wheeled toys and other impediments and invited me up to her fathers study he would be happy to meet you go on in mr hazzard she said indicating the open door dont be shy charles curtis easton was inside i recognized him instantly from the portrait which was embossed on the backs of all his books he sat at a crowded desk under a bright window dappled with ailanthus shade the very picture of a working writer he wasnt a young man his hair was snowy white and it had retreated from his forehead and taken up a defensive position at the back of his skull he wore a full beard also white and his eyes which were embedded in networks of amiable wrinkles gazed out from under ivory brows he wasnt fat exactly but he had the physique of a man who works sitting down and dines to his own satisfaction come in mr hazzard he said glancing at the card his daughter had given him im always happy to meet a young writer the adventures of captain commongold that was yours wasnt it yes i said pleased that he had heard of it a fine book although the punctuation was somewhat eccentric and you have a new one it was in my hand i had brought an inscribed copy as a gift stammering out my purpose i passed it over a western boy at sea he read examining the boards and it has an octopus in it well no the octopus was the illustrators conceit oh too bad but the sword and the pistol they make several appearances my embarrassment was almost painful why hadnt i put an octopus in the story it wouldnt have been hard to do i ought to have thought of it in advance thats fine said mr charles curtis easton concealing any disappointment he might have felt he put the book aside sit down you met my daughter and my grandchildren i fitted myself into an upholstered chair we werent fully introduced but they seem very nice he beamed at this modest compliment tell me about yourself then mr hazzard you dont appear to be one of the high eupatridiansno insult intendedand yet youre associated with the current president isnt that right i told him as briefly as possible about my origins in the boreal west and about the unexpected events that had led to my residing on the palace grounds i told him how much his work had meant to me when i was a young leaseboy eager for books and how i remained loyal to his writing and frequently recommended it to others he accepted the praise gracefully and asked more questions about the war and labrador and such topics he seemed genuinely interested in my answers and by the time half an hour had passed we were old friends but it was not my intention just to flatter him much as he may have deserved the flattery before long i mentioned julian comstocks interest in the theater and his intention of developing a movie script on a subject close to his heart thats an unusual ambition for a president mr easton observed it is sir but julian is an unusual president his love of cinema is genuine and earnest hes hit a snag though which his storytelling skills cant surmount i went on to describe in general the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin darwin and biological evolution are difficult topics to dramatize mr easton said and isnt he worried that the result wont receive the dominions approval very religious persons arent keen on mr charles darwin if i remember my lessons you remember them correctly julian is no admirer of the worldly power of the dominion however and he intends to overrule their objections in this case can he do such a thing he says he can but the problem is with the script it wont spring to life the way he wants it to he asked my advice but im only a beginning writer i thoughtof course i dont mean to presume on your generosity i wouldnt ordinarily look at a novices screenplay a commission from a sitting president of the united states is a different matter however ive worked on a few cinematic translations of my own stories in the past i suppose i could examine president comstocks material and offer some advice if its wanted its very much wanted sir and im sure julian will be grateful for anything you can tell him as will i have you brought the script yes i said drawing the folded pages out of my vest pocket handwritten im afraid for i saw that mr easton owned a typewriter even more sleek than the machine i had obtained from theodore dornwood but julians cursive is legible mostly id like to read it will you wait downstairs while i do so you mean to read it right now sir if youll oblige me i assured him i would then i went downstairs and spoke for a while with his daughter who was named mrs robson she shared the house with her father while her husband was up in quebec city commanding a regiment during this conversation mrs robsons four children if i counted correctly bounded through the room at irregular intervals shouting for attention and wiping their noses on things whenever they passed i favored them with a smile though they mainly grimaced in return or emitted disrespectful noises then mr easton himself came hobbling down the stairs a cane in one hand and charles darwin in the other his age had made him slightly infirm and mrs robson hurried to his side and scolded him for attempting the staircase without help dont fuss he told his daughter im on presidential business mr hazzard your evaluation of your friends work was exactly correct its obviously sincere and wellresearched but it lacks certain elements indispensable to any truly successful cinematic production what elements are those i asked songs he said decisively and a villain and ideally pirates i was eager to communicate this news to julianthat the famous writer mr charles curtis easton had agreed to help him develop his scriptbut there was a telegram waiting for me when i came home to calyxa i had not received a telegram before i was alarmed when i saw it and guessed in advance that it contained bad news that intuition was correct the telegram was from williams ford it had been sent by my mother dear adam it said your father gravely ill snakebit come if you can i made the arrangements at once and secured a ticket on an express train but he died before i reached athabaska the train rolled over half of america that fourth of july it seemed to me past small towns thriving and many abandoned past vast estates worked by shirtless indentured men past countless tips and tills and ruins into a sunset that burned like slow coal on the horizon and on into the prairie night there were no fireworks that evening though there was some impromptu merrymaking in the dinner cari didnt join in i was asleep by moonrise late the next day the train entered the state of athabaska its border marked by a landscape of enormous pits where the secular ancients had once strained the tarry earth for oil i saw the ruins of a machine the size of a cathedral its rusted treadwork embedded in scabs of calcified mud wherever there was open water geese and crows flocked up to salute the passing train julian had wired the duncancrowley estate to tell them i was coming that presented a social difficulty to the aristos there seen from one angle i was a recreant leaseboy of no account come home to visit his illiterate fathers grave from another i was the scribe and confidant of the new president the nearest thing to an emissary from the executive power that williams ford was ever likely to receive the duncans and the crowleys whose fortune was all in ohio farmland and nevada mines and whose new york connections were tenuous had resolved their dilemma by sending ben kreel to meet me he came down to connaught in the estates best rig drawn by two highstepping horses the train had arrived with the dawn i hadnt slept well but ben kreel was an early riser by habit and he shook my hand as cheerfully as the occasion permitted adam hazzard or should i call you colonel hazzard he had not changed much though i had new eyes it seemed to see him with he was still bluff stout redcheeked and utterly in control of himself im out of the army nowplain adam will do i said not so plain as when you left us he said we all thought you and julian must have been running from conscription but you distinguished yourselves in battleand in other waysdidnt you what a person runs run from and what a person runs to arent always as different as we hope and youre an author now and speak like one i dont mean to put on any airs sir a justified pride is never out of place very sorry about your father thank you sir the estate physician did what he could but it was a bad bite and your father wasnt a young man the carriage moved away from the clutter and noise of the train depot past woodframe hostels and the many barrooms and hempdens my mother used to call the curse of connaught onto the pressedearth road leading north to williams ford it was a warm and windless morning and the rising sun picked out the peaks of the distant mountains devils paintbrush grew in colorful thickets along the verge of the road and the sparselywooded land gave out its old familiar summer odors the duncans and the crowleys ben kreel said are prepared to welcome you to town and no doubt would have put on some sort of public reception if the circumstances were less unhappy as it is theyve set aside a room for you in one of the great houses i thank them kindly but i was never uncomfortable in my mothers house and i expect she would like me to stay there and thats what i mean to do probably thats wise ben kreel said with something that might have been a suppressed sigh of relief when at last we came through the fields where the indentured men worked into the low rolling hills near the river pine and reached the outskirts of williams ford i mentioned that the independence day fireworks must have been extravagant this year they were ben kreel said a peddler brought in a handful of chinese rockets from seattle for the event blue firewheels and some very colorful salamanders how did you know the air still smells of gunpowder i said it was a sensitivity i had picked up in the war i wont dwell on the details of my grief the reader understands the delicacy of these painful emotions or if the reader doesnt understand it right now he will before very long thats the contract life makes with nature and time and were all bound by it though none of us consented to the bargain i put in a brief appearance at the estate for the sake of politeness and i was politely received by the duncans and the crowleys but i didnt stay long it was more important for me to see my mother i passed the stables on the way from the estate to the leaseholds and i was tempted to find out whether my old tormentors still worked there and whether my new rank had made them afraid of me but that was a petty urge not worth indulging the cottage where i had grown up stood just where i had left it the creek behind it still ran dappled and cheerful toward the pine and my sister flaxies grave was where it had always been modestly marked but there was another grave beside it now a fresh one with a white wooden cross above it on which my fathers name had been burned though he was illiterate he had learned to recognize his written name and could even produce a plausible signaturehe would be able to read his own gravepost i supposed if his ghost sat up and craned its neck graves are best visited by sunlight the warm july weather was soothing and the bird sounds and the faint chuckling of the creek made the idea of death more bearable i hated to think of next years snows weighing down this freshturned sod or the january winds blowing over it but my father was next to flaxie now so she wouldnt be alone and i didnt suppose the dead suffered very badly from the cold the dead are immune to seasonal discomfortsthere is at least that much of heaven in the world my mother saw me standing by the grave and came out from the back door of the cottage she took me by the arm wordlessly then we went indoors and wept together i stayed five days my mother was in a fragile condition both because of her grief and because of her age her eyes were poor now and she was no longer useful to the aristos as a seamstress but because she was of the leasing class and had served faithfully all her life she continued to receive chits with which to buy food at the leasestore and she would not be forced out of her home her eyesight had not dimmed so much that she wasnt eager to see a copy of a western boy at sea and of course i had brought one for her she handled it with exaggerated care smiling a little then she put it on a high shelf next to the adventures of captain commongold which i had also sent her she would read it she said chapter by chapter in the afternoons when the light and her eyes were at their best i told her that i couldnt have written either of these books if she had not been so determined about teaching me to readteaching me the love of reading that is and not just the names of the letters as most leaseboys were taught on sundays i learned to read from my own mother she said and she learned from her mother before her all the way back to the secular ancients according to family legend there was a schoolteacher in our family long ago perhaps another writer toowho knows your fathers greatest shame was his illiteracy he felt it deeply though he didnt show it you could have taught him the art of it i offered to he wouldnt try too old and set for that he always said i expect he was afraid of failing i taught a man to read i said when i was in the army that made her smile again she was keen for news about calyxa and the baby by a fortunate coincidence julian had arranged to have a photograph of us taken shortly before independence day and i showed it off here was calyxa in a chair her coiled hair shining flaxie sat in her lap slightly lopsided baby dress askew goggling at the camera i stood behind the chair with one hand on calyxas shoulder she has a forceful look my mother observed your calyxa good strong legs the baby is pretty my eyes arent what they used to be but i can still spot a pretty baby and thats one your granddaughter i said yes and shell learn to read too wont she when shes ready no doubt of it i said eventually we talked about my fathers deathnot just the fact but the circumstances of it i asked whether he had been bitten during a signs service there arent any services of that kind anymore adam church of signs was never popular except among a few of the indentured and not long after you left the duncans and crowleys decided it was a cult and ought to be suppressed ben kreel began preaching against the sect and the most enthusiastic members of the congregation were sold off or sent away your father was the only leaseman among them so he stayed but there was no congregation to preach to anymore but he kept the snakes i had seen them in their cages out back writhing unpleasantly they were pets to him he couldnt bear to stop feeding them or destroy them any other way and it wouldnt have been safe to set them loose im not sure i can bring myself to kill them either although i despise them she said this was a vehemence that startled me i do despise them very much i always have i loved your father dearly but i never loved those snakes they havent been fed since he died something has to be done about them we didnt discuss the matter any further that night however after she had served a modest stew and dumplings and gone to bed i left the house very quietly and went out to the cages a bright moon hung above the distant mountains it cast a steady pale light on my fathers family of massasauga rattlers the serpents were in a bitter mood no doubt from hunger there was a slashing impatience in their motions nor would they have been milked of their venom recently this was something my father used to do secretly before services especially if he thought children might participate in the handling he would stretch a bit of thin leather over the mouth of an old jar and let the serpents bite it it took the poison out of them for a period of time that was his own private apostasy i supposean insurance policy against any momentary lapse of attention on the part of higher powers the snakes were aware of my presence they twined and curled restlessly and i imagined i could feel a cold fury in their blank and bloodless eyes a man who submits himself wholeheartedly to god might handle them and not be harmed that was the faith my father had professed certainly he trusted god in his own case and believed god manifested himself in the rolled eyes of his congregants and in their babble of incomprehensible tongues trust and be saved was his philosophy and yet in the end it was the snakes that killed him i wondered which element of the calculation had ultimately failed himhuman faith or divine patience i was not a faithful man by most definitions i wasnt a devotee of the church of signs and i had never adopted its doctrines as my own nevertheless i lifted the latch and opened the door of the nearest cage i didnt wear gloves or any such protection my hands and arms were exposed and vulnerable i reached inside i had entered some wordless principality of grief and anger there was no logic to the act only the memory of the advice my father had given me years ago when i watched him feed living mice to his snakes while dodging their strikes and lunges it shouldnt be necessary to kill a serpent he said in the ordinary course of things if you know what youre doing but unexpected events happen perhaps a stray viper threatens some innocent man or animal then you have to be decisive you have to be quick dont fear the creature adam grasp it where its neck ought to be behind the head ignore the tail however it may thrash and crack its skull hard and often enough to subdue it and that is what i didrepetitively mechanicallyuntil a dozen serpentine corpses lay stiffening at my feet then i turned back to my familiar old home and went to the bed that had comforted me through many winters and slept for hours without dreaming in the morning the wire cages were bright with beads of dew and the carcasses i had left behind were gonesome hungry animal had carried them off i supposed the day before i left williams ford i asked my mother whether she believed in god and heaven and angels and that sort of thing it was a bold question and it took her by surprise thats not the sort of thing a polite person ought to ask she said outside of church perhaps not but its the kind of question julian comstock enjoys asking almost every chance he can get and it gets him in trouble i expect often enough you can take a lesson from that and you know the answer in any case havent i read to you from the dominion books and told you all the stories in the bible as a parent to a child not as one adult to another you never stop being a parent adam no matter how old or wise your child becomesyoull see im sure youre right do you though believe in god i mean she looked at me as if to gauge my earnestness i believe in all sorts of things she said though i dont necessarily understand them i believe in the moon and the stars though i cant tell you what theyre made of or where they come from i suppose god falls into that categoryreal enough to be felt from time to time but mysterious in his nature and often confusing thats a subtle answer i wish i had a better one what about heaven though do you think we go to heaven when we die heaven is generally regarded as having strict admission requirements though no two faiths agree on the details i dont know i expect its like chinaa place everyone acknowledges as real but which few ever visit there are chinamen in new york city i volunteered and a great many egyptians besides but hardly any angels i expect next to none that was as much theology as she would tolerate so we dropped the subject and spent our last day together discussing more cheerful matters and in the morning i said goodbye to her and left williams ford behind me for the second and last time in your many travels since we last met ben kreel said to me as we drove back down the wire road to connaught did you ever get as far as colorado springs no sir i said it was another sunlit day the telegraph wires hummed in a warm breeze the train that would take me away from my childhood home and all its memories was due in just three hours mostly i was in various parts of labrador well north and east of colorado ive been to colorado springs five times ben kreel said for ecclesiastical training it isnt at all like the pictures in the dominion readers you know what i meanthe dominion academy is all they show with its white pillars and those big paintings of the fall of the cities its very impressive and worth a photograph certainly it is but colorado springs is more than just the academy and so is the dominion im sure they are sir colorado springs is a town full of pious prosperous men and women who are loyal to the union and to their faith and the dominion isnt strictly a building nor even an organization but an idea a very bold and ambitious idea an idea about taking the battered and imperfect world we live in and making it over fresh and newmaking a heavenly kingdom of it pure enough that the angels themselves wouldnt be reluctant to tread there unlike manhattan i thought to myself it seems as if were a long way from that we havent taken labrador yet much less the world its a chore for more than one lifetime but we cant commune directly with heaven until we perfect the world and we cant perfect the world until we perfect ourselves thats the job of the dominion adam to make us all more perfect its a stern duty but it arises out of the common instincts of charity and good will those who chafe under it are generally too attached to some imperfection of their own which they love with a sinful stubbornness yes sir thats as you used to tell us at holiday services im pleased you remember our enemy is anyone who rebels against godperhaps you remember that aphorism too i do what form do you suppose that rebellion generally takes adam sin i guessed sin yes certainly and plenty of that to go around but most sin only sabotages the sinner some sin is more insidious and aims directly at impeding the dominion in its work im not sure i know what you mean though i had my suspicions dont you when you were in the army did your regiment have a dominion officer in it yes and was he universally loved it wasnt a unanimous sentiment no nor could it have been since it was his job to elevate virtue and excoriate wrongdoing thieves do not love prisons and sinners dont love the church my point is that the dominion stands in relation to the united states as that pastor stood to his troops his purpose wasnt to be loved for himself but to coax and herd a recreant population into the corral of divine love for some reason i had a recollection of lymon pugh and his description of the meatpacking industry the dominion takes a profound interest in the destiny of this nation and every nation ben kreel said compared with that institutional interest the whims of presidents are fleeting this conversation is too cryptic i complained is it about julian if thats what you mean just say so who am i to stand in judgment of the chief executive im just a country pastor but the dominion watches the dominion judges and the dominion is older than julian comstock and ultimately more powerful julian has nothing against the dominion except in some particulars i hope thats true adam but if so why would he attempt to sever the ancient and beneficial connection between the dominion and the armies what did he ben kreel smiled unpleasantly for many years this man had seemed to me a minor deity above reproach he was a kindly voice a useful teacher and a sturdy peacemaker when there was conflict in the community but looking at him now i detected something sour and triumphant in his nature as if he delighted in having stolen a march on an upstart leaseboy why thats exactly what he did adam dont you know the news came by wire from colorado springs this morning julian conqueror socalled has ordered the dominion to withdraw its representatives from the nations armies and cease participating in military counsels thats a bold step i said wincing its more than a bold step adam its very nearly a declaration of war he leaned close to me and said in an oily and confiding tone a war he cannot win if he doesnt understand that you ought to enlighten him ill be sure to tell him what you said yes thank you said ben kreel youre a good friend to julian comstock i try to be but you shouldnt walk in the footsteps even of your best friend adam hazzard if the road hes following leads to hell i was tempted to tell ben kreel that my belief in hell was even shakier these days than my confidence in paradise or i might have said that i had met a man in new york who claimed the only god was conscience have no other under which standard the whole dominion was an apostasy if not something worse but i didnt want to engage him in any further discussion and i sat sullenly the rest of the way to connaught shortly thereafter i boarded the train that would take me back to manhattan it was a more comfortable ride than the caribouhorn train had been the first time i left williams ford but i felt no less afraid as i traveled in it after i had arrived back home and made my reunion with calyxa and flaxie and bathed away the grime of travel and slept a night i went to the palace to see julian the executive palace was still in the main a mystery to me it was an immense structure finely divided into labyrinthine rooms and chambers it housed servants bureaucrats and a small army of republican guards in addition to the president himself it rose three stories above the ground and sheltered extensive basements and cellars beneath it was the most wainscoted draped sashed carpeted and furbelowed building i had ever been inside and i was never comfortable in it the minor officials i passed regarded me with a disdain bordering on contempt while the republican guards scowled and fingered their pistols at the sight of me julian did not inhabit this entire spacesurely no one man could have done sobut spent most of his time in the library wing the library wing contained not just the presidential library which was extensive though mainly dominionapproved and to which julian had added many items culled from the liberated archives but a large reading room with high sunny windows and an enormous oaken desk it was this room julian had made particularly his own and that was where i visited him magnus stepney the rogue pastor of the church of the apostles etc was also present lounging in a stuffed chair and reading a book while julian sat at the desk applying pen to paper pastor stepney had been julians close companion for many weeks now and both of them smiled when i entered they asked about williams ford and my father and mother and i told them a little about that sad business but not much time had passed before julian once more raised the question of his movie script i mentioned to him that i had discussed the script with mr charles curtis easton i was afraid julian might be unhappy that i had taken the matter out of the family and gone to a stranger with it he did seem a little nonplused but magnus stepneywho was as much an aesthete and devoted follower of drama as julian was stepney though sincere about his pastoral duties made no secret of the fact that he might like to play the part of charles darwin when the production eventually began this was not as vain as it sounds for he was handsome and had a talent for striking poses and putting on amusing voicesclapped his hands and said i had done exactly the right thing thats what we need julian a professional opinion possibly so did mr easton render an opinion julian asked me he did in fact would you care to mention what it was he agreed that the story lacked some essential ingredients such as i cleared my throat three actsmemorable songsattractive womenpiratesa battle at seaa despicable villaina duel of honor but none of those things actually happened to mr darwin or had any connection with him well i suppose thats the point do you want to tell the truth or do you want to tell a story the trick i said remembering theodore dornwoods commentary on my own writing is to steer a course between scylla and charybdis fine talk for a leaseboy magnus stepney said laughing where scylla is truth and charybdis is drama or the other way around i dont remember exactly julian sighed and rolled his eyes but stepney gave a little cheer and cried out thats just what ive been telling you julian it was good advice from me and its good advice from adam hazzard and mr charles curtis easton julian said nothing more about it that day initially of course he was skeptical but he didnt resist the idea for long for it appealed to his sense of theater and by the end of the week he had adopted it as his own the rest of july was devoted to producing a final script some scholars have suggested that julian fiddled with cinema while his presidency was collapsing around his head but thats not how it seemed in the summer of i think julian saw the possibility of redemption in art after all the horrors he had experienced in war though war is more customarily the business of the commander in chief and i think there was a deeper reason why julian ignored the protocols and entanglements of political supremacy i believe he had genuinely expected to die in labradorhad accepted it as his fate once the black kite maneuver failedand was shocked to find himself still alive after he had led so many others to their deaths his order to sever all formal connections between the dominion and the military had sent shockwaves through both armies colorado springs was in a state of virtual rebellion and deacon hollingshead had ceased to visit the executive palace or to acknowledge julian in any way the dominion still kept a firm grip on its affiliated churches however and julian the atheist was denounced from pulpits all over the country which made the eupatridians and the senate uneasy in their support of him but if deacon hollingshead did not pay us any visits he was welcomely replaced by mr charles curtis easton who was invited to the palace to meet julian and discuss modifications to the darwin script julian was charmed by mr easton this is what you might become adam if you live to a ripe old age and grow a beard and delegated him to work alongside me as a screenplay committee we met on scheduled occasions and julian or magnus stepney often joined us and within weeks we had sketched out a completely new outline of the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin which i will briefly describe act one was called homology and it dealt with darwins youth in this act young darwin meets the girl with whom he is destined to fall in lovehis beautiful cousin emma wedgwoodand discovers he has a rival for her affections in the form of a young divinity student named samuel wilberforce the two boys enter into a beetlecollecting and interpreting competition sponsored by the local university which is called oxford and miss wedgwood in a coy moment mentions that shell save a kiss for the winner wilberforce then sings a song about bugs as specimens of the divine ordination of species while darwin retorts with musical observations on homology that is the physical similarities shared by insects of different species wilberforce a ruthless and cunning conspirator tries and fails to have darwin disqualified from the contest on the grounds of blasphemy but oxford is deaf to his pleadings darwin wins the contest wilberforce comes in a bitter second emma kisses darwin chastely on the cheek darwin blushes and a simmering wilberforce vows ultimate vengeance act two was entitled diversity or an english boy at sea my suggestionand it covered charles darwins exciting voyages around south america aboard the exploratory vessel beagle this is where darwin makes some of his many observations about turtles and finches beaks and such things though we kept the scientific matter to a minimum so as not to strain the audiences attention and enlivened it with a scene involving a ferocious lion out of all these unusual experiences darwin begins to formulate his grand idea of the diversity of life and how it arises from the effects of time and circumstance on animal reproduction he resolves to communicate that insight to the world though he knows it wont be welcome in ecclesiastical circles back home however wilberforcenow a junior bishop at oxford and grimly determined to achieve even greater ecclesiastical powerhas drawn on his family fortune and hired a gang of nautical pirates to hunt down the beagle and sink her at sea the act culminates in a closelyfought nautical battle in which young darwin flailing about on the foredeck with sword and pistol speculates musically on the role of chance and fitness in determining the ultimate outcome of the conflict the battle is bloody but as in nature the fittest survivedarwin happily is one of them by the beginning of act three called the descent of man all en gland is caught up in a fierce religious controversy over darwins theories darwin has published a book about the origin of species and wilberforce now oxfords head bishop has made a point of denouncing that work and ridiculing the author he hopes by this strategy to create a conflict between darwin and emma wedgwood who have postponed their marriage under pressure from emmas family until darwins respectability is more firmly established in the public mind it seems a distant goal at a time when english churches resound with antidarwinian rhetoric torchbearing mobs threaten oxford and emma herself is torn by the conflict between romantic love and religious duty the tempest culminates in a public debate in a crowded london hall where darwin and wilberforce argue over the ancestral relations of ape and man darwin expounds sings that is his doctrine eloquently with gentle humor while wilberforce under the fierce lamp of logic is revealed as a jealous poseur darwin a true scholar a headline in the next mornings london times proclaims calming the general excitement and smoothing the way for emma and darwin to marry but wilberforce wont suffer himself to be humiliated in such a manner he accuses darwin of blasphemy and personal insult and challenges him to a duel darwin reluctantly accepts seeing this as his only chance to rid himself of the meddlesome bishop and both men climb to a craggy meadow high in the wild and windblown mountains that loom over oxford university the climax of the movie is essentially that duel with ruses and low tricks attempted by wilberforce and thwarted by darwin there is singing and pistolshooting and some lively screaming from emma and more pistolshooting and wrestling about on cliffedges until darwin stands wounded but victorious over the cooling corpse of his ruthless enemy followed by a wedding ceremony bells rung cheerful noises and so forth julian gave his approval to this outline though he took a certain pleasure in pointing out the distance between our dramatic liberties and historical truth in the strictest sense if oxford has alps he liked to say then perhaps new york city has a volcano geography being so flexible a science but these were amicable objections not serious ones and he understood our motives in remodeling the obstinate clay of history as for the songs and their lyricsso important to the success of any such enterprisewhat could we do but recruit calyxas formidable talents julian supplied her with a biography of darwin recovered from the dominion archives along with works discussing the taxonomy of beetles the geography of south america the habitat and lifecycle of pirates and such subjects calyxa undertook her assignment very seriously and read all these books with close attention several times when the household help was absent i was delegated to attend to flaxies infant requirements which were numerous and urgent while calyxa continued her creative work at the desk or the piano in a few days she had sketched out arias and melodies for all three acts of charles darwin she presented these to julian on a night when he arrived along with pastor stepney for our weekly script conference julian leafed through the music and lyric sheets with deepening appreciation judging by the expression on his face then he turned to calyxa and said you ought to sing some of it for us magnus doesnt read music but i want him to hear it most of the arias are male parts calyxa said though emma wedgwood has a song or two thats understood here julian said handing over one of the first sections in which the young charles darwin during a beetling expedition outside oxford spots his cousin emma in the woods the english in those days were not particular about wooing and marrying cousins it was a practice as acceptable to them as it is to our own eupatridians calyxa sat down at the piano and picked up the song at the point where darwin is inspecting the contents of his bugnet singing these creatures yet are all alike in several ways that i find striking six legs fixed on a tripart body external shells some plain some gaudy some have wings or hooks or hair distinctions yes eight ten a dozen and yet in general structure theyre as like as i am to my cousin here comes my cousin now and as she pauses in the shady hedgewood i hope shell turn her eyes to me that young and pious emma wedgwood white summer dress blue summer bonnet a red coccinellid clinging on it stop cried julian whats a coccinellid ladybug said calyxa tersely very good carry on all life intrigues me without doubt and yet in truth for truth will out i find miss emmas pretty legs more interesting than skateleech eggs there were a few more interruptions from julian when he needed some point clarified but for the most part calyxa sang without interruptionthe whole score except for one duet which she couldnt manage by herself and the final choral medley she sang the male parts with gusto and the female parts in a fine contralto and banged the piano with great enthusiasm and skill little flaxie could not sleep through all this noise of course and her nurse eventually brought her down to join us in the end we had nearly an hour of calyxas wonderfully entertaining performance at the end of which she sat back from the piano with a satisfied smile on her face she undid the scarf she was wearing and down her slender form there spread black ringlets rich and rare while julian clapped his applause and the rest of us joined him for a long ovation even flaxie attempted to clap though she was inexpert at it and her flailing hands passed in midair more often than they collided it was altogether the finest time we had had for quite a while and we might have been some large family joined together after a long absence taking delight in one anothers company and never heeding the griefs and dangers that circled about us like carrion birds over a tubercular mule it was late that summer when an assassin crept into the executive palace and hid himself in the library wing for the purpose of putting a pistol to julian conquerors head and killing him august had just given way to september and the production of the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin was well under way julian had not been idle during the preparation of the book and music all the power of the presidency and much of the wealth he controlled as a comstock had been devoted to it he had renovated a set of unused stables at the west th street end of the palace grounds turning them into a movie studio as modern as anything in manhattan and he had recruited the talents of the citys finest production company which was called the new york stage and screen alliance this combination of players singers noisemakers cameraoperators filmcopiers et alia had been responsible for many wellregarded movies including eulas choice previously described in the past however they had always been bound by the rules of the trade and the strictures of the dominion in this case julian had taken charge of them directly and they were bound to his instructions and no one elses on this particular day i was down at the studio watching some incidental photography not involving the major actors it was a day off for magnus stepney who was playing darwin and julinda pique the screen actress representing emma wedgwood had gone to visit relatives in new jersey but the players interested me less than the technical work of the business which continued without them i had befriended the camera operator in charge of illusions or effects shooter as he was called for short and i was helping him arrange shots for the south american montage in act two he had set up a painting the size of a wall of jungles and mountains uncanny in its realism and he had placed in front of it some very convincing paper imitations of tropical plants and bushes as well as wildlife in the form of tame dogs dressed as tigers and a number of armadillos sent by mail from texas mainly living julian had instructed him not to keep the camera still but to move it around some giving a more lively impression and he was doing so as i watched trying to keep the restive animals in the frame without inadvertently revealing the artificiality of the backdrop this was warm work on a sultry september day and it called forth some unusual curses before he achieved the result he aspired to he was just wrapping up this business when an executive page in green livery came hurrying toward us the man was obviously agitated and he had to recover his breath before he could gasp out theres been shooting major hazzard shooting at the palace sir i rushed there without waiting to hear more it wasnt easy getting past the republican guards who had cordoned off the library wing and i was alarmed when i saw the court physician hurried in ahead of me i remonstrated with the guards until sam godwin appeared then we both proceeded together i feared the worst julians position as president had become increasingly insecure as his battles with the dominion escalated just last week he had declared all ecclesiastical writs of replevin null and void pending new legislation this meant that the authorities could no longer claim seize or imprison fugitives on complaints issued solely by the church it had the effect of releasing calyxa from her confinement but it also set free countless jailed apostates the congregations of various unaffiliated churches a number of parmentierist radicals who had been scooped up on ecclesiastical charges and a few of those unfortunate lunatics who insist on proclaiming their personal divinity the voiding of that law added to his ongoing attempt to separate the church from the military amounted to an emasculation of the dominion the dominion could still collect tithes from affiliates and could pronounce anathema on dissenters but without legal traction it would soon begin to lose groundor so julian hoped in response it seemed they had sent an assassin into our midst for i did not doubt that the dominion was behind this treachery is julian killed i asked sam as we pressed through the crowd in the library wing dont know said sam has the physician been called for yes i saw him go in but julian wasnt killed once we attained the reading room we found him sitting in a chair upright and alert although a bandage had been wrapped around his head he called us over as soon as he spotted us how badly are you hurt sam demanded julians expression was grim not badly or so the doctor tells methe bullet took a piece of my ear how did it happen the assassin hid behind a chair and came out at me unexpectedly he would have killed me completely except that magnus caught sight of him and called out a warning i see said sam where is magnus now lying down the event was alarming for himhe has a sensitive nature i guess an attempted murder would alarm most anyone what about the assassinwheres he mauled by the republican guards said julian and taken into confinement in the basement the basement of the executive palace included a set of cells in which prisoners could be detained the cells were installed during the reign of the very first comstock and had been used by every comstock since including julian julians uncle deklan since his deposition had been languishing in that same internal prison has he said anything useful sam asked apparently his tongue was cut out years ago and he cant or wont write the dominion chooses its assassins carefullyit knows how to break men and tries to make its men unbreakable you dont know for certain it was the dominion that sent him is there any evidence to the contrary i dont need certainty in order to act on a wellgrounded suspicion sam said nothing to this but shook his head unhappily for he believed and often said that julian in his argument with the dominion had set himself on a course for destruction just as certainly as if he had plunged into the rushing waters above niagara in any case julian said the mans motivation is plain enough he was carrying a crudelyprinted leaflet demanding the restoration of deklan conqueror to the executive but if he cant read or write i expect the leaflet was a prop meant to draw suspicion away from the clergy though who but the clergy would want my murderous uncle back in the executive seat still i dont like to have deklan used as a nail on which assassins pin their hopes ill have to do something about him there was a cold glint in his eye as he said this and neither sam nor i dared to pursue the matter though julians manner filled us with foreboding and theres the question of the republican guards julian continued what about them it seems as if they acted as soon as the assassin revealed himself but they ought to have acted before the assassin revealed himself otherwise what purpose do they serve it was luck and magnus stepney that saved my life not the guardsmen i dont see how the man could have got this far without a collaborator among them i inherited those men from the previous regime and i dont trust them again sam said in a conciliatory tone you dont know im the president sam isnt that clear to you yet im not required to know only to act how do you propose to act then julian shrugged if he wanted advice from us he didnt ask for it sam eventually went off to attend to ancillary business once the atmosphere of crisis began to cool i stayed to keep julian company while the doctor removed the temporary bandage in order to dab the wounded ear with iodine and stitch what remained of its ragged edges the court physician was as smoothly professional as dr linch had been back in striver but there would still be a scar when the injury healed my head has been pared more often than a pieapple julian complained it gets tiresome adam im sure it does you ought to rest now not just yet i have business to take care of what business he gave me a look that was almost metallic in its indifference presidential business he said no mention was made of the attempted assassination in the city press for it was a delicate subject but julian arranged to make public his response to it as i discovered the following morning when i left the palace grounds for a walk down broadway a crowd of pedestrians thronged the street beyond the th street gate gazing upward with wide eyes it was not until i reached the sidewalk outside the great walls that i could see what had attracted all their attention high on the iron spikes that surmount the stone wall two severed heads had been mounted one to the left of the gate and one to the right this was as gruesome a sight as anything i had seen in labrador more shocking for its presence in an otherwise peaceful city however it was not without precedent the heads of traitors had been displayed here in earlier years and other conflicts though seldom since the turbulent s from groundlevel it was difficult to discern the identity of the victims since the heads were contorted by death and had been pecked at by pigeons but some of the curious onlookers had fetched operaglasses in order to satisfy their curiosity and a consensus had emerged among the crowd the head on the left was not familiar to anyone present nor could have been for it belonged to the assassin captured in the library wing the head on the right however was the one that had recently rested on the shoulders of deklan conqueror the former president who had once feared his nephew as a usurper and had nothing to fear now but the judgment of a righteous god the unpleasant trophies remained there most of a week rotting small boys gathered every day to toss pebbles at them until the ghastly ornaments at last came loose from their spikes and tumbled back onto the palace grounds julian wouldnt speak of the beheadings saying only that justice had been done and that the event was finished i hoped he had not ordered the executions but had only sanctioned themthough that was bad enough i did not of course feel any sympathy for julians uncle or the anonymous assassin since the former had committed many murders and the latter had attempted at least one but the cutting off of their heads without benefit of trial did not seem to me entirely civilized and i could not help thinking that the public display of their remains served no better purpose than to make julian appear brutal and imperious during that same week in another imperious act julian dismissed every serving member of the republican guardsome five hundred altogetherand replaced them with members of the army of the laurentians selected by julian personally from a list of those who had fought by his side at mascouche chicoutimi and goose bay many of these men were my comrades as well and it was startling to walk down the halls of the executive palace and find myself greeted not with the malign stares and suspicion to which i had become accustomed but by hearty hails from old friends and acquaintances that feeling was compounded one friday evening when i went to join julian and magnus stepney to plan out the next weeks efforts on charles darwin the new captain of the republican guards whom i had not met was standing watch over the library wing when i turned a corner in one of that buildings long halls and nearly collided with him watch out the new man cried im not a door you can swing wide and walk throughstate your business misterbut be damned if it isnt adam hazzard adam you bookworm ill shake your hand or know why not he did shake my hand and it was a bruising experience for the new captain of the guard was mr lymon pugh perhaps i shouldnt have been so glad to see him but at that moment he seemed like an envoy from a simpler and easier world i told him i hadnt expected to meet him again and that i hoped the palace was a good place in which to find himself employed better than a slaughterhouse he said and you last time i saw you adam you had just married that tavern singer from the thirsty boot i did and we have a daughter nowill introduce you you wrote a book too somebody told me a pamphlet about captain commongold and a novel which is selling adequately well and ive met mr charles curtis easton and worked beside him but you must have accomplished things just as significant he shrugged i lived to my present age without dying he said thats enough to boast about by my lights calyxa kept her distance from the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin as well as from julian himself having supplied the score and lyrics she felt no need to involve herself in the minutiae of moviemaking especially during a time when she was instructing flaxie in the fundamentals of eating and standing upright and such useful skills as that she continued to meet with parmentierist friends from the city however and mrs comstock or mrs godwin as i could not get accustomed to calling her pursued certain of her contacts among the lesser eupatridians more importantly the two women consulted one another and formulated plans to deal with any crisis that might arise out of julians political situation do you know very much about mediterranean france calyxa asked me with a certain affected casualness one september night as we lay in bed only that mitteleuropa claims it as a territory while it insists its an independent republic the weather there is very clement and mediterranean france has cordial relations with other parts of the world i expect thats so what about it nothing at all except that we may have to live there one day i didnt dismiss her assertion out of hand in fact we had discussed the possibility several times before in the event of a disaster such as the collapse of julians presidency and the ascension to the executive of hostile agencies all of us including julian might need to flee the country but i fervently hoped those conditions would not arise or if they did that it would happen far in the future when flaxie was older and better able to travel i didnt like to think of taking an infant on a transatlantic journey i was not even willing to let flaxie be taken for rides in the streets of manhattan especially not now with a new pox circulating and half the citizens going about with paper masks over their noses you cant leave these arrangements to the last hour calyxa said things need to be set up in advance we decided on mediterranean france wait who decided emily and i between us i consulted the local parmentierists and they say its an ideal refuge emily has connections with people in the shipping businessright now she would have no trouble arranging passage for us though that might change with a changing situation i still hope to spend my life in america and write books i said you wouldnt be the only american author in marseilles you can send manuscripts by mail im not sure my publisher would agree to that if things get much worse in manhattan adam you may not have a publisher perhaps that observation was true but it didnt cheer me up or help me sleep all the filming of the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin was finished by thanksgiving of that wasnt the end of it of course what had been captured on film was only the visual portion of the show to be presented in a theater it still needed voiceactors noisemakers intensive rehearsals and a suitable venue but a large part of the hardest work was done especially for the technicians and screenactors and julian thought it would be appropriate to commemorate the moment by hosting what he called a wrap party the grounds of the executive palace had not been a social magnet during julians reign especially so after the unannounced beheadings julian was not discomfited by this since he didnt much care for the companionship of high eupatridians including even members of the senate although the senate had been generous toward his regime in the beginning there had been friction with that branch of the government as well as with the dominion julian did not enact any radical labor legislation much to calyxas disappointment and disgustbut he had refused to dispatch troops during the servile insurrection in the thread trades in july of a rebellion among indentured laborers at an ohio broadsilk mill had spread to neighboring ribbon factories and dye shops over one hundred men died in the resulting siege his implied sympathy for the rebels enraged those senators who had connections with the trade and stronglyworded protests had been issued from that body so we did not have friendly eupatridians to invite to our wrap party but that wasnt a drawback in julians opinion increasingly julian had chosen to surround himself with a crowd of aesthetes and philosophersnot just the movie crew but a motley assortment of wellborn radicals religious reformers musicians parmentierist tractwriters artists with more ambition than income and people of that stripe the party took place on the last warm evening of the year the temperature was nearly tropical though thanksgiving was almost on us and after dark the celebration spilled out onto the great lawn of the executive palace the efficiency of the new york city hydroelectric dynamo had lately been improved and julian had extended the hours of the illumination of manhattan so that the cumulative light shed by the citys electric lamps gave the clouds overhead an eerie glow the pond and the hunting grounds were wrapped in shadow and looked very mysterious and romantic and the guests and film crew were soon giddy with champagne they strolled or capered about on the lawn or shared hempen cigarettes in secluded places and as the evening wore on their behavior became more flagrant and less discreet i sat on the marble steps of the palace watching the revelry from a safe distance after a time pastor magnus stepney came and joined me its a cheerful event adam he said settling his lanky frame onto the step just to the left of me its a spectacle anyhow i said dont you like to see people enjoy themselves that was a subtler question than he seemed to realize i had come to be friendly with many of these revelers especially the crew who had worked on the filming of charles darwin and i knew them to be goodsouled and wellintentioned people for the most part but the event was beginning to surpass anything i would have recognized as civilized celebration back in williams ford men and women not related by marriage were dancing to lewd songs or chasing one another amidst gales of laughter or indulging in intimate caresses regardless of the observation of those around them some of the crew were so intoxicated that they began to press such intimacies even on members of their own sex and often enough these attentions were willingly received to be fair many of these same individuals defied expectations in matters of masculine and feminine deportment even when fully sober its a common failing among theater people i have found well i said that depends i dont disapprove of anybody having a good time and i dont like to set myself up in judgment but what about you magnus you being a church pastor and all even if your church is an eccentric one is this how you encourage your congregation to behave my only god is conscience adam i put that statement up on a sign to warn the unwary your conscience is happy to sit here and watch your friends debauch by moonlight the moons not up quite yet thats a dodge pastor you misunderstand my doctrine perhaps i can give you a pamphlet i encourage people to obey their conscience and follow the golden rule and so forth but conscience isnt the meanspirited overseer so many people seem to think it is genuine conscience speaks to all people in all tongues and it can do so because it has just a few simple things to say love your neighbor as your brother and do all that that entailsvisit the sick refrain from beating wives and children dont murder people for profit etc you know how i think of conscience adam i think of conscience as a great green godliterally green the color of spring leaves with a garland of laurels perhaps or some leafy underwear as in the greek paintings he says trust one another even if you arent trusted he says do as i tell you and youll be back in eden in no time do you know anything about game theory adam hazzard i said i did not magnus stepney explained that it was an obscure science of the secular ancients and that it dealt with the mathematics of bargains and mutually beneficial exchanges and such matters basically adam game theory suggests that there are two ways for human beings to operate you can be trustworthy and trust others or you can be untrustworthy to your own advantage the trustworthy man makes a deal and keeps it the untrustworthy man makes the same deal but absconds with the cash conscience tells us be the trustworthy man thats a tall order for the trustworthy man is often cheated and exploited while the untrustworthy man often occupies thrones and pulpits and revels in his riches but the untrustworthy man if we all emulated him would hasten us into an eternal hell of mutual predation while the trustworthy man if his behavior became general would throw open the gates of heaven thats what heaven is adam if its anything at alla place where you can trust others without hesitation and they can trust you i asked pastor stepney if he had been drinking he said he had not well i said is this a sample of paradise thenthis raucous party conscience isnt a brutal taskmaster conscience has no argument with kisses in the dark if theyre freely given and freely received conscience offers no cavils to our taste in music clothing literature or amative behavior it smiles on intimacy and banishes hatred it doesnt scourge the reckless lover that was an interesting doctrine and it seemed sensible if heretical so then yes he said waving his hand at the champagneand hempfueled festivities proceeding about us you can think of all this as a rehearsal for paradise i meant to ask him what conscience in his leafy underwear might have to say about julians conflict with the dominion or the posting of severed heads on iron spikes but pastor stepney rose and went off to pursue his own unspecified pleasures before i could pose the question so i took his advice and tried to look at the revelries unfolding before me as if they were a foretaste of that reward to which we all aspire and i had some success at this effort until a drunken cameraman stumbling up the palace stairs paused and vomited at my feet which diminished the illusion considerably conspicuous by his absence from these revels was julian himself he had appeared briefly at the opening of the wrap party waving at us from one of the indoor balconies where his murderous uncle used to address independence day gatheringsbut he had absented himself shortly thereafter and i hadnt seen him since that was not unusual for his moods were mercurial and he was increasingly inclined to brood alone in the library wing or in some other part of the labyrinthine executive palace in truth i didnt give it much thought until lymon pugh came down the marble stairs sparing a disgusted glance for the gamboling aesthetes and said i ought to come see to julian why where is he in the throne room with sam godwin theyve been shouting at each other for most of an hour ferociously you might need to interfere if it comes to blowsif you can walk straight im completely sober that makes one of you then do you find this shocking lymon he shrugged ive seen drunker parties though where i come from they usually end in a murder or a mass arrest i followed him to the executive office which lymon and other members of the republican guard called the throne room perhaps they can be pardoned for the exaggeration the executive office was a vast square tiled room at the very heart of the palace windowless but forever ablaze with electric lamps its high ceiling was painted with a panoramic picture of otis the former president not the giraffe which was named after himon his gunboat fighting the battle of the potomac long ago this was the room in which presidents signed their proclamations or met with foreign consuls or senatorial delegations on formal occasions as such it was set up to emphasize the dignity and power of the presidency the presidential chair wasnt quite a throne but approached that description as closely or more closely than any respectable republican chair really ought to have it was carved from the heart of some noble oak upholstered in purple cloth and plastered with gold leaf and raised on a marble dais just now julian sat sidelong on it while sam paced before him in short angry strides all yours lymon pugh whispered ducking out of the room before i could announce myself neither sam nor julian took any notice of my presence for they were too busy arguing their voices echoed from the ornamental tile floor and bounced back from the high ceiling i didnt like to see the unhappiness so obviously written on julians face nor was it pleasant to hear sam berating him the argument concerned some decision julian had given out without sams knowledge or approval do you have any conception sam was asking of what youve doneof what the consequences of this will be the consequence im hoping for said julian is the extinction of an old and ugly tyranny what youll get is a civil war the dominion is a noose around the neck of the nation and i mean to cut the rope a noose is what youre staring at if you dont desist you act as if you can proclaim any doctrine you like and enforce it with soldiers cant i isnt that exactly what my uncle did and where is your uncle now julian looked away the enemies of a president hold daggers in their hands sam went on the more enemies the more daggers you offended the dominionwell that cant be undone youve defied the senate which doubles your danger and if these orders reach the army of the californias the orders have been dispatched they cant be withdrawn you mean you wont withdraw them no julian said in a softer but no less hostile tone no i wont there were smaller chairs arrayed before the throne presumably for lesser dignitaries to sit in sam kicked one of these chairs with his foot and sent it screeching across the tiled floor i will not let you commit suicide youll do as youre told and be quiet about it the fact that you married my mother doesnt make you my master i had but one father and he was killed by deklan conqueror if i protected you all these years julian it was out of my loyalty to your father and my affection for you and for no other reason i dont have any ambition to sit on a throne or meddle with the man who does so but you didnt protect me sam and you do meddle by all rights i should have died in the goose bay campaign everything thats happened since then is just a ridiculously prolonged last gasp cant you see that thats not the sort of thing your father would ever have said or allowed you to say your debt to my father is your own business mine was paid in full with deklans head you cant salve your conscience with an execution bryce comstock would tell you the same thing if he was here julian had ceased shouting but his anger had not abated it had run underground instead and glittered in his eyes like a rushing torrent glimpsed through the crevice of a glacier thank you for your advice but theres nothing more to discuss youre dismissed sam looked as if he might kick over another chair but he didnt his shoulders slumped and he turned to the door defeated talk to him if you can he whispered to me on his way out i cant im sorry you had to hear that julian said as sams footsteps faded down the corridor i advanced to the foot of the throne lymon pugh tipped me off he was afraid it might come to blows not quite what did you do julian that offended sam so much declared a sort of war in his view havent you had enough of war yet its nothing to do with the dutch theres been a rebellion in colorado springs yesterday the council of the dominion told their parish deacons to disobey any presidential mandate that conflicts with ecclesiastical regulations is that what you call a rebellion it sounds more like a lawyers brief it amounts to an expressed wish to overthrow me and i suppose you cant tolerate that tonight i declared the city of colorado springs a treasonous territory and i ordered the army of the californias to capture it and establish military law a whole army to occupy one city an army and more if thats what it takes to overthrow the council and burn the dominion academy to the ground traitorous deacons should any survive can be tried in court for their crimes colorado springs is an american city julian the army might not like to raze it the army has many opinions but only one commander in chief wont innocent civilians get killed in the fighting though what fight ever spared the innocent julian scowled and glared do you think i can sit in this chair and not imagine blood adam hazzard blood yes blood granted blood on all sides blood past present and future i didnt ask for this job but i dont deceive myself about the nature of it well i said not wanting to provoke him into another outburst i expect itll work out all right in the end if you say so he stared at me as if i had contradicted him there are rules about entering this roomdo you know that adam i dont suppose you do visitors customarily bow when they cross the threshold senators bow ambassadors from distant nations bow even the clergy is obliged to bow the rule doesnt exempt athabaska leaseboys to my knowledge no well its a fine room but im not sure it requires any genuflection on my part i didnt bow down to you when we were shooting squirrels by the river pine and i dont think i could get in the habit of doing it now ill leave if you like perhaps i sounded sharp julians face was immobile for a long moment then his expression changed yet again incredibly he smiled he looked for a moment years younger adam adam i would be more insulted if you bowed than if you didnt youre right and im sorry i mentioned it no offense given or taken in that case im tired and im tired of quarreling you ought to go to bed then noit wouldnt work its been days since i was able to sleep but at least we can put colorado springs out of our minds would you like to see something unusual adam something from the days of the secular ancients i suppose so if you want to show it to me if anything had lately alarmed me about julians behavior it was the way his moods and whims darted about as unpredictably as minnows in a fishpool the tendency had first become obvious when he was producing the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin he would appear on the set unannounced and stalk around like an oriental tyrant demanding petty changes to the scenery or harassing the actors then the intemperance would pass from his mind as quickly as a cloud shadow crosses a prairie meadow and he would smile sheepishly and offer apologies and praise sometimes he wears the crown magnus stepney once remarked and sometimes by the grace of god he takes the damned thing off i wished he wouldnt wear the crown at all for it plagued him and made him imperious and confused his mind he came down from his high chair and put his arm across my shoulder a fresh discovery from the dominion archives do you remember when i told you there were ancient movies hidden there yesbut not in any form we could see you said and i said i would assign a technician to work on the problem well theres been some success in the project come downstairs adam and ill a show you a movie that hasnt been seen for two hundred yearspart of one at least it turned out julian had established a cinema room in the lower section of the palace useful for work on darwin as well as the restoration of ancient moving pictures i didnt like to go into the basement of the palace as a rule for it was a cold place even in warm weather and i had heard of the prison cells and interrogation chambers located there but the cinema room was a new installation wholly modern and tolerably warm unusual machines and chemical baths had been installed there along with a pristine white movie screen at one end and an elaborate mechanical projector at the other most of the films we found were crudely stored and eroded beyond repair said julian even the best of them were only partially recoverable but what a treasure nonetheless and i heard in his voice an echo of the julian comstock who had pawed through books in the tip outside williams ford with just such rapt fascination lately i like to come down here at night when its still and quiet and watch these fragments here he said picking up a can the size of a pieplate this is a film called on the beach from the twentieth centuryabout half an hour of it the original was longer of course and had recorded sound and such refinements i took a chair as he threaded the ancient movie which had been copied onto modern celluloid into the projecting machine midnight had come and gone and calyxa would be expecting me home but i sensed that julian needed my company just now and i was afraid that if i left him he might fall into a deeper funk or declare yet another war whats it about the projector driven by the palaces unsleeping electrical generators hummed and clattered to life boats and things youll see he dimmed the lights i confess that i didnt understand most of what played out on the screen before me it was riddled with gaps and lacunae many of the scenes were terribly faded almost ghostly our inability to reproduce recorded sound interfered with the intelligibility of the film since much of it consisted of people talking to one another but there were many striking and unusual things in it there was an underwater boat for instance which julian said was called a submarine boat the interior of it looked like the engine room of a modern steamer but more complex decorated with countless clocks levers pipes buttons blinking lights etc and the ships crew wore uniforms that were perpetually clean and starched but only a few of the scenes were nautical some took place in a city of the secular ancients there were automobiles in the streets at least in the earlier portion of the film though not as many as i might have expected and then none at all the people of the city behaved in ways that suggested great wealth but even greater eccentricity there was also as the title suggested a beach scene in which men and women socialized in clothing so abbreviated as to approach blatant nudity a glimpse of this i thought to myself would have confirmed deacon hollingshead in all his prejudices about our ancestors inexplicable events happened there was an automobile race with casualties the city was evacuated and a newspaper blew down an empty street i asked julian whether this was about the false tribulation but julian said no on the beach had been produced nearly a century before the end of oil the events it dramatized must have been purely local in nature or purely imaginary julian paid close attention to the fragmentary film though he had watched it many times before but it seemed very sad and elegiac to me and i wondered if julians repeated viewing of it had not further depressed his mood it ended abruptly julian shook his head like a man recovering from a trance and stopped the projector and turned up the lights well i dont know what to say julian i wish there had been more scenes of that underwater boat in operation i suppose its a good movie im surprised the people in it seemed so unhappy though since they lived in a world full of automobiles and submarine boats its a dramapeople in dramas are seldom happy it didnt end with a wedding or any uplifting thing such as that well its incomplete we dont know what the whole of it was like certainly its a rare glimpse into the lives of the secular ancients they dont seem as bad as the dominion histories make them out to be though clearly they were imperfect i dont deny that they were imperfect julian said in a distant voice im not uncritical of the secular ancients adam they had all sorts of vices and they committed one sin for which i can never bring myself to entirely forgive them what sin is that they evolved into us he said clearly it was past time for me to go home the sun would be up before very many more hours passed i told julian he ought to try to sleep and see if the presidency wasnt more tolerable to a rested mind i will he said unconvincingly but before you go adam i want to ask a favor of you anything if im able to grant it my mother has been making plans for all of us to leave the country ive told her repeatedly we wont be forced into such a drastic retreat but i may be wrong its true that ive made enemies ive gambled with history and i cant guarantee the result adam do you see those three film canisters on the table by the door hard to miss them what are they some fresh discovery from the archives no thats the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin all three acts a master print of it plus the performance script perhaps its childish but i dont like to think of it being permanently destroyed if the political situation gets worse or if anything unpleasant happens to me i want you to take darwin out of the country with you of course i willi give you my wordbut youll come to mediterranean france along with us if the necessity arises and you can bring the canisters yourself yes adam but it would please me to know im not the only one thinking of it i put all the best part of myself into that film it deserves to be seen all manhattan will see it the debut is only a few weeks away of course but you promise to do as i ask it was an easy guarantee to make i gave him my hand on it then i left the room without bowing as i walked off i heard the projector start up again the enclosed grounds of the palace make up a rectangle two and a half miles long by half a mile wide carved out of manhattan by a man named olmsted in ancient times pleasant and rustic by day in the small hours of the night it was a lonely place it hosted a large permanent population of bureaucrats servants and republican guards but the majority of them had been asleep since midnight now even the revelries of the wrap party had ceased little evidence remained of what had taken place earlier in the evening apart from a pair of aesthetes snoring in wicker chairs along the palaces great piazza not every member of the republican guard was allowed to sleep however they kept the watch in shifts like sailors they manned the four great gates at all times and patrolled the high walls for intruders lymon pugh was one of them and he met me as i was leaving the palace on duty still i asked him just coming off it felt like walking a little before going to bed the night air being so warm the moon was up a mist rose from the nearby pond and put its pale fingers into the ailanthus groves edging the lawn this weather seems strange to me i said in athabaska we often had snow by thanksgiving and in labrador too of course not here though not this year let me walk a little way with you adam i have no other business and i doubt i could sleep to be honest sleep is an elusive quarry some nights i agreed do you enjoy doing this work for julian i guess i dont mind it it was kind of him to select me and theres no heavy lifting involved i dont expect it to last though no offense to julian commongoldcomstock i meanbut im not sure hes altogether suited to the presidency why do you say so from what ive seen its one of those jobs like being a line overseer at a packing factoryit rewards ruthlessness and it kills whatever goodness a man might have in him i knew a seattle man who was hired up to be a line overseer at the factory where i worked a generous man saintly to his children wellliked all around but they made him a line boss and after a week in that job i heard him threaten to cut a mans throat for slowness he meant it too began to carry a razor in his hip pocket flaunted it from time to time thats how you see julian its not that hes bad by nature he isnt thats just the problem a truly bad man would have an easier time as president and probably make a greater success of it must a president be bad then it seems so to me but i dont know much historymaybe it hasnt always been that way we walked a little farther listening to the soft sound our shoes made on the gravel path my point though lymon pugh said is that julians not succeeding in the presidency whatever the reason for it i know you and your family are planning your getaway who told you that nobody told me anything but i hear things i dont repeat what i hear if thats on your mind nowhat you say is true i hope it isnt necessary to flee the country but it never hurts to know where the back door is come with us lymon if the worst happens god forbid calyxa has good things to say about mediterranean france thank you for asking adam thats very flattering to me but i wouldnt know what to do in a foreign country i dont know france from canaan if it comes to that i mean to steal a horse and head west maybe as far as the willamette valley we came to the guesthouse where calyxa and flaxie and i had made our temporary home i felt unaccountably sad but i didnt want lymon pugh to see that emotion or hear it in my voice so i did not speak you have a fine family adam hazzard he said you make sure nothing unpleasant happens to them thats your task if you dont mind taking advice from a plain republican guardsman and now im off to bed he turned away goodnight goodnight i managed i paused at the door as lymon pugh headed back toward the palace the night had that unusual calm which marks the hour before the dawn silence brooding like a gentle spirit oer all the still and pulseless world off in the darkness i saw a huge silhouette lumbering among the treesthat was otis who seemed well on the way to becoming a nocturnal giraffe perhaps he especially enjoyed the lonely hours of the morning or perhaps he couldnt sleep any better than the rest of us i looked into the darkness for a good long while then i went indoors and crept into bed with calyxa just as the sky was lightening and curled into the warmth of her sleeping body less than a month passed between the night of the wrap party which marked the end of the filming and editing of the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin and its debut in a plush broadway theater a short time by ordinary reckoning but it was a dire eternity in julians reign as president sam godwin who maintained close contact with the military had taken on the thankless duty of conveying bad news to juliana role he was forced to play increasingly often it was sam who told julian that the army of the californias had been met with fierce re sis tance by ecclesiastical forces at colorado springs it was sam who told him how the rocky mountain division of that army had rebelled and swung its support from the executive power to the dominion of jesus christ on earth it was sam and i envied him this task least of all who was obliged to tell julian that after extensive but ineffectual shelling and burning army commanders had worked out a truce with the dominion council and declared a unilateral ceasefireall in violation of julians direct orders sam emerged from that session ashenfaced and shaking his head at times adam he confided in me i dont know whether julian even understands what i say to him he acts as if these reverses were inconsequential or too distant to matter or else he storms and rages at me as if i were the author of his defeats then he hides away in that projection room of his mesmerizing himself with moving pictures there was worse to come a mere three days before the debut of charles darwin news reached us that the joint leaders of the army of the laurentians had declared solidarity with their comrades in california and had raised the possibility of a march on new york for the purpose of unseating julian conqueror the name of admiral fairfield who had been so successful at sea was mooted as a possible successor that might have been the keenest cut of all for julian admired the admiral and they had got along well during the goose bay campaign these small and large insurrections shook the foundations of his presidency but julian continued to make plans for the broadway opening of his film local churches had begun calling for a boycott of it and it would be necessary to cordon the theater with republican guards to prevent riots nevertheless julian invited us all to the premiere and made sure the finest carriages were available and told us to dress in our best clothes and make a grand occasion of it and we did so because we loved him and because we might not have another chance to pay him such an honor a phalanx of gilded carriages surrounded and preceded by armed guardsmen on horseback made its way out of the palace grounds on the appointed afternoon calyxa and i rode in one of the central carriages following the vehicle that carried julian and magnus stepney with sam and julians mother in a third conveyance behind us it was near christmas but the streets of manhattan were not merry banners of the cross had been pulled down in order to clear a line of sight for the sharpshooters julian had placed on all the rooftops between tenth and madison avenue but the streets werent crowded in any case in part because of the new poxthe same pox dr polk had worried about last summerwhich had been communicated by fraudulent vaccination shops to young eupatridian ladies and which had spread from there into all walks of life in the great city of new york it was not an especially virulent diseasenot more than one in forty or fifty new yorkers had come down with itbut it was unpleasant and deadly it began with fevers and confusions followed by the appearance of yellow pustules all over the body especially the neck and groin and culminated in bleeding lesions and a rapid decline into death as a result many people chose to keep at home despite the season and many of the pedestrians we passed wore paper masks over their noses and mouths all that plus a chill wind blowing from the north lent a certain bleakness to the citys christmas fear of pox had not altogether prevented public gatherings however since the disease seemed to be transmitted by something more than casual contact the theater as we approached it was brightlylit its sidewalks swarming with patrons and curiosityseekers and the roastchestnut vendor was doing a roaring business the theaters grand marquee proclaimed the title of the movie and added a banner announcing the world debut of julian conquerors brilliant and startling cinematic masterpiece a bold boast but thats how showbusiness operates a cordon of republican guards kept out wouldbe troublemakers mobs of whom had been dispatched by church committees as an obeisance to the dominion the film of course was not attractive to especially pious or conservative people but there were more than enough aesthetes philosophers agnostics and parmentierists in manhattan to make up the deficit these people were julians constituency if he could be said to have one and they had turned out in force julian left his carriage just as ours was pulling up he would watch the movie from a protected box above the gallery along with magnus stepney who was accorded that privilege as the star of the film sam and julians mother had a similar box assigned to them while calyxa and i held reserved seats in the orchestra section we were only halfway through the enormous lobby however when a man i recognized as the theater director came up to us in a rush mrs hazzard he cried recognizing her for she had had some dealing with him in her role as lyricist and composer what is it calyxa asked ive been trying to reach you we have an unexpected and serious problem mrs hazzard as you know candita bentley a broadway voiceactress famous for her silvery voice and impressive girthvocalizes the role of emma but candita is illa sudden attack pox he confided in a scandalized tone her understudy is down with it too the show is canceled dont even whisper it no certainly not but we need a new emma at least for the songs i can call up someone from the chorus but i thoughtsince you wrote the score and since everyone says you have the voice for iti know this is absurdly short notice and i know you havent rehearsed calyxa took the startling invitation very calmly i dont need to rehearse just show me where to stand youll sing the role then yes better me than some chorister but thats wonderful i cant thank you enough you dont have to adam do you mind me voicing emma nobut are you confident you can do this theyre my songs and i can sing them as well as any of these broadway women better i expect calyxa had been offered the vocal part of emma early in the planning of the production but she had reluctantly refused it since she was preoccupied with flaxie and the ceaseless duties of motherhood tonights unexpected opportunity obviously pleased her stage fright wasnt one of her faults i wished her well and she hurried off to prepare there was a general announcement that the curtaintime had been postponed by fifteen minutes i milled in the lobby in the meantime until sam godwin approached me his expression was somber wheres your wife he asked recruited into the show wheres yours gone back to the palace back to the palace why shell miss the movie it cant be helped there have been fresh developments adam shes packing for france sam said in a very low voice adding we leave tonight to night keep your voice down it cant be that great a shock to you the army of the laurentians is moving on the city the senate is in open revolt all that was true before this evening and now a fire has broken out in the egyptian district from what ive heard most of houston street is in flames and the burning threatens to cross the ninth street canal the wind spreads it quickly and if the flames reach the docks our only avenue of escape may be cut off butsam im not sure im ready youre as ready as you need to be even if you have to sail with just the shoes on your feet and the shirt on your back our hand has been forced but flaxie emily will make sure the baby gets to the boat she and calyxa calculated everything well in advance theyve been ready a week now listen our ship is the goldwing docked at the foot of nd street she sails at dawn what about julian though have you told him about the fire not yet hes sealed himself in that box above the balcony and ringed himself with guards but ill speak to him before the movie is finished if i have to knock heads together to get at him i dont expect he would be willing to leave before the end of the show nor would calyxa be now that she had been recruited into the business probably not sam said grimly but as soon as the curtain rings down we must all leave at once look for me in the lobby between acts if you dont see me or if were separatedremember the goldwing at dawn a bell rang signaling us to take our seats of course my head was whirling with these plans as the curtain rose on charles darwin but apart from the fire in the egyptian quarter none of it was entirely unexpected though i had hoped the need for flight would not arise so soon there was no immediate active role i could take however so i tried to focus my attention on the event at hand the orchestra played a lively overture combining the films major musical themes the excitement in the audience was palpable then the lights went down and the projection began a grandly ornate title card announced the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin famous for his theory of evolution etc produced by mr julian comstock and company with the assistance of the new york stage and screen alliance featuring julinda pique as emma wedgwood and introducing magnus stepney in the title role that faded to a simpler card reading oxford in the country of england long before the fall of the cities thus the scene was set and now young darwin appeared for the first time strolling through the oxford countryside which was really the game preserve of the executive palace dressed up with signs reading forty miles to london and watch out for fox hunts and such to create a general impression of englishness i had not seen any of the finished footage of the movie before tonight and i had entertained some doubts about pastor stepneys acting skills but he performed a respectable darwin somewhat to my surprise perhaps a career in the pulpit is acceptable training for an actor in any case he made a handsome naturalist and the famous julinda pique though nearly twice his age portrayed a suitably attractive emma with makeup to conceal any cosmetic imperfections i have already given the outline of the story and i wont repeat it here except to mention certain highlights act i held the audiences attention in a merciless grip darwin sang his aria about the resemblance between insects of disparate species voiced by a powerful tenor the oxford bug collecting tournament was portrayed with emma cheering from the sidelines i was unfailingly aware that while it was julinda piques form and figure on screen the voice that seemed to issue from her mouth was in fact produced by calyxa in a sidebooth i had been afraid that calyxas inexperience would betray her but from her first refrain i had not entertained the thought that i could love a scholar for they read from books an awful lot and seldom spend a dollarshe sounded strong and straightforward and there were murmurs of appreciation from the audience of course the audience was disposed to be sympathetic being composed mainly of apostates and rebels still it was shocking to hear heresies so openly proclaimed when the villainous wilberforce sang only god can make a beetle he was repeating exactly the orthodoxy i had learned in dominion school and darwins riposte i see the world always changing unforced unfixed and rearranging would have earned me a stern lecture or worse if i had offered it up to ben kreel in my youth but was darwin wrong i had seen too much of the unfixed world to deny it the insect tournament concluded with victory and a kiss for charles darwin darwins subsequent vow to travel the world in search of the secret of life and wilberforces jealous pledge of vengeance formed the subject of a rousing duet which rang down the curtain on act i to riotous applause a dry december wind blew steadily from the north that night fanning the flames in the egyptian quarter the spark had hurried out a special edition and newsboys were already hawking copies of it outside the theater doors big blaze hits gyptown was the vulgar but accurate headline this was dismaying news for an uncontrolled fire in a modern city can quickly become a general disaster but the theater was far from the flames and there was no panic in the crowded lobby only some excited conversation i looked for sam and found him coming down a stairway from one of the high balconies damn julian he said as i came up beside him he wont open that theaterbox to anyone including mesits in there with magnus stepney and armed guards on the doorsno exceptions i expect hes nervous about the success of his film i expect hes half madhes certainly been acting that waybut its no excuse hell have to come out eventually you can speak to him at the conclusion of the last act perhaps ill speak to him before that if i have to pull a gun to do it adam listen ive had a report from the guardsmen i sent along with emily to the palace they say she had two wagons ready to go and that she set off for the docks along with flaxie and several nurses and servants and a fresh contingent of guards it was all very neatly and efficiently done i didnt like the idea of flaxie being spirited through the streets of manhattan on a perilous night like this without me to protect her but i knew julians mother loved the baby as if it were her own and would take every possible precaution and theyre safe as far as you know im certain theyre safe probably snug aboard the goldwing by now but theres trouble at the palacethats the bad news the servants and guard troops saw her drive away with all her possessions and theyre bright enough to divine the reason for it lymon pugh is doing his best to preserve order and prevent looting but the news will get around quickly that julian conqueror has abdicated the office of the executiveand he has whether he knows it or notand the palace grounds might yet be invaded by rioters or a rogue army detachment what does that mean it means the hounds are at our heels and i hope this damned movie comes to an end soon with that the bell rang for act ii act ii was the story of darwins travels at sea a stark contrast to the rural idyll of act i as such it mirrored the tempests and turmoil taking place in my own mind here was the beagle actually an old schooner hired by julian for the production anchored off long island bound for south america with its crew of hardy sailors here was emma wedgwood back in en gland refusing the courtship of the increasingly bitter and wealthy wilberforce here was wilberforce in a low dive by the sea paying a drunken pirate captain to pursue and sink the beagle here too was south america with all its peculiar tropical beauty here was darwin discovering seashells in cliffsides and prying up the bones of extinct mammals from ancient marl all the while singing a meditation on the age of the earth and fleeing from unusually aggressive armadillos here he was on the galapagos islands collecting mockingbirds and confronting a ferocious lion really a mastiff dressed up in a carpet and a wig but very convincing for all that jungles mostly paper stretched to distant mountains painted and a giraffe appeared fleetingly giraffes strictly speaking are not native to south america but we had a giraffe and we used it the beagle encountered wilberforces cutthroats on the return voyage to en gland the beagle was boarded and the ensuing battle was very realistic for pirates julian had recruited a number of men from new york waterfront dives who suited the part in perhaps too many ways they had been told how to strike blows and wield swords without killing anyone but their grasp of the technique was often uncertain or impatient and some of the blood in the scene was more authentic than the professional actors might have liked darwin proved to be a surprisingly skilled swordsman for a naturalist he leapt up on the beagles windlass and defended the forecastle against dozens of assailants singing now we see in miniature the force that shapes creation ill slay a piratethis one hereand stop the generation of all his heirs and all their heirs and all the heirs that follow just as the longbeaked bird outlives the starving shortbeaked swallow some pious men may find this truth unorthodox and bitter but nature chance and time ensure survival of the fitter it was as good a scene of fighting as had ever been filmed at least in my limited experience the attending crowd of aesthetes and apostates was not easily impressed but cheering broke out among them and triumphant shouts when darwin pierced the pirate captain with his sword the beagle reached london battered but unbowedwatched from the shore by emma and from the shadows by wilberforce now a bishop who gritted his teeth and sang a reprise of his murderous intentions in the lobby waiting for the third and final act to begin i moved through the crowd to the great glass doors of the theater i could see that the wind had gained strength for it tore at the awnings and banners along broadway and the taximen at the curb were huddled together struggling to keep their pipes alight a twohorse fire wagon came rattling by its brass bell ringing no doubt headed for the immigrant quarter messengers in republican guard uniforms came and went in flurries shouldering past the ushers and ascending and descending the stars to the high balcony where julian kept his box sam did not appear in the lobby however and i went back into the auditorium for act iii without being further enlightened it was during this final act as darwin and bishop wilberforce sang at one another relentlessly during their great debate that the truth of my situation began to sink in even as the audience showed its appreciation for the dramawith cheers and whistles for darwin boos and catcalls for wilberforcemy spirit was weighed down by the knowledge that i would soon be leaving my native country perhaps forever i considered myself to be a patriot or at least as patriotic as the next man that didnt mean i would bow down to just any individual who assumed the presidency or to the senate for that matter or even to the dominion i had seen too much of the imperfection and shortsightedness of such people and institutions i loved the land howevereven labrador as much of it as i had seen though with a tempered love and certainly new york city but above all the west with its sundered badlands open prairie lush foothills and purpled mountains the boreal west was not rich or greatly inhabited but its people were kind and gentle and no thats not what i mean i dont suppose westerners are humbler or nobler than anyone else i knew for a fact there were crooks and bullies among them though fewer perhaps head for head than in manhattan no what i mean is that i had grown up in the west and learned the world from it from its wideness i learned the measure of a man from its summer afternoons i learned the art and science of repose from its winter nights i learned the bittersweet flavor of melancholy all of us learn these things one way or another but i learned them from the west and i was loyal to it in my fashion and now i was leaving it all behind these feelings gave a particular edge to darwins aria on the subject of time and the age of the earth though the sermon was not a new one to me for i had heard these sentiments from julian often enough the mountains i admired were not eternal the wheat i fed on grew from the bed of a primeval ocean and ages of ice and fire had passed before the first human beings approached the rocky mountains and discovered williams ford everything flows in the words of some philosopher julian liked to quote and you would be able to watch it do so if you could hold still for an eon or so that idea was as disturbing to me this night as it was to bishop wilberforce up on the screen i did not approve of wilberforce for he was a villain to charles darwin and a menace to poor emma but i felt an unexpected sympathy for him as he climbed the crags of mount oxford actually some headland up the hudson hoping to gun down evolution and murder uncertainty into the bargain it was calyxas voice that brought me out of my funk emma wedgwood sang its difficult to marry a man who wont admit the master plan in natures long exfoliation but finds a better explanation in natural law and chance mutation his theories shocked a christian nation but i love him nonetheless yes i love him nonetheless and she sang it so wholeheartedly and in such a winsome voice that i forgot that it was julinda piques image on the screen and saw calyxa in my minds eye and i became darwin battling for his bride it wasnt a trivial analogy for calyxa was in as much danger from the collapse of julians presidency as emma wedgwood ever was from the bishops bullets and schemes those bullets and schemes were cunningly portrayed and the audience gasped and cheered at each turn and reversal and it seemed to me that julians life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin was a great success and that it would play to packed houses wherever it was allowed to be seen if it was allowed to be seen but by the end of it i was so wrought up with anxiety over current events that i didnt wait for the endcredits to finish showing but jumped the orchestra and cut around the screen to the hidden booths where the voiceactors and noisemakers did their work that might not have been a wise act for rumors of fire and abdication had already made the audience nervous ticketholders were startled by the sight of me dodging in such a hurry past the screen and casting awkward shadows on it and when i tripped over a snare drum of the sort used to mimic the sound of gunshots causing a racket that might have been the opening cannonade of a military attack the audience finally gave up applauding and cleared the auditorium endangering an usher in the process calyxa was surprised to see me and a little miffed that i cut short the curtaincalls but i caught her by the arm and told her we were forced to leave manhattan this very evening and that flaxie and mrs godwin were already aboard the goldwing she took the news stoically and accepted a few compliments from her fellow players then we left by a stage door at the rear the crowd in front of the theater was already welldispersed but a cordon had been kept for members of the presidential party and we were admitted through those lines sam hailed us as soon as he saw us but his expression was grim where is julian i asked gone he said gone to the docks you mean no i mean gone plain gonegone in the general sense he sneaked out of the theater with magnus stepney during act iii and left this note with my name on it with a disgusted expression sam passed julians note to me and i unfolded the paper and read it it had been written with obvious haste in an unsteady hand but the penmanship was recognizably julians the note said dear sam thank you for your repeated attempts to reach me with news of the imminent departure of the goldwing for foreign waters please tell my mother and calyxa that i admire their extensive and thoughtful planning for this eventuality i regret that i cannot join them and you and adam and all for the voyage i would not be safe in europe nor would those i love be safe as long as i was among them and there are more personal and pressing reasons why i must stay behind as unsatisfactory as this explanation is it will have to do please dont attempt to seek me out for nothing can change my decision and i would only be endangered by the attempt i thank you all for the kindnesses you have shown me over so many years and i apologize for the hardships those kindnesses too often caused you thank you especially sam for acting in the place of my father and for guiding me usefully even when i defied your guidance your lessons were not wasted and never more than briefly resented please be kind to my mother as i know she will be upset by my absence and please emphasize my love for her which is everlasting if anything is also thank adam for his boundless friendship and many indulgences and remind him of the promise he made to me yours julian comstock never really a conqueror do you know what he means adam i think i understand it i said in a small voice thats more than i do damn julian its just like him to throw a shoe into the works but about the promise he mentions its nothing much do you care to tell me about it its only an errand escort calyxa to the goldwing and ill join you there calyxa made some objection to this but i was adamant and she knew me well enough to hear the steel in my voice and she yielded to it though not gracefully i kissed her and told her to kiss flaxie on my behalf i would have said more but i didnt want to increase her anxiety only an errand sam repeated once calyxa was settled in the carriage it wont keep me long it had better not they say the fire is spreading quicklyyou can smell the smoke on the wind even here if the docks are threatened we sail at once with you or without you i understand i hope so i might have lost juliani cant do anything about thatbut i dont want to lose you as well his statement made me feel very emotional and i had to turn my head away so as not to embarrass myself sam took my hand in his good right hand and gave it a sturdy shake then he followed calyxa into the carriage and when i turned back they were gone all the crowd had gone away before them except for a few republican guards still keeping a vigil the street was nearly empty only a single horse cart remained at the curb it bore the insigne of the executive branch lymon pugh was holding the reins drive you somewhere adam hazzard he asked a few trucks and carriages passed us as we rode up broadway all of them headed away from the burning egyptian quarter a brisk wind blew steadily along the empty sidewalks lofting up loose pages from the special edition of the spark and inconveniencing beggars in the darkened alleys where they slept sams parting words had touched me and i have to admit that julians unexpected letter caused some turmoil as well i supposed he had his reasons for doing as he did or at least imagined he had good reasons but it was hurtful that he hadnt lingered long enough to say goodbye facetoface we had survived so many harrowing turns together that i thought i was owed at least a handshake but julian had not been himself latelyfar from itand i tried to excuse him on those grounds he was probably just in a big hurry lymon pugh said divining something of my thoughts you saw the note i carried it to sam myself how did julian seem when he passed it to you cant say it was handed out from behind that curtained box of his all i saw was a gloved hand and all i heard was his voice which said see that this gets to sam godwin well i did if i unfolded it on the way and had a quick read of it i guess thats your fault my fault for teaching me my letters i mean perhaps it was true as the eupatridians believed that the skill of reading shouldnt be too widely distributed if this was the general result but i passed over his indictment without comment what do you make of it im sure i dont know its all above my station but you said he might be in a hurry perhaps because of deacon hollingshead what about deacon hollingshead rumor among the guard is that hollingshead holds a personal grudge against julian and is hunting him all over the city with a body of ecclesiastical police to help him i know the deacon is hostile to julian but what do you mean by a personal grudge well because of his daughter the deacons daughter the one who famously shares intimacies with females of her own sex thats more delicate than ive heard it put but yes the girl was an embarrassment to hollingshead and he locked her up in his fancy house in colorado springs to keep her out of trouble but deacon hollingsheads house was blown up during the trouble with the army of the californias the deacon was safe here in new york of course but he blames julian for his daughters death and means to take his revenge on julian directly a noose or a bullet it dont matter to the deacon as long as julian dies how do you know these things no offense adam but news that circulates in the guard barracks dont always reach the upper echelons all of us that julian hired to be republican guards are fresh from the army of the laurentians some of us have friends in the new york garrison and talk goes back and forth you told julian about this no i never had an opportunity but i think the rogue pastor magnus stepney might have said something stepney has contacts among the political agitators who pay attention to questions like this or it might all be hearsay and exaggeration i remembered how back in williams ford a headcold among the duncans or the crowleys became the red plague by the time the grooms and stableboys told the story still that was unhappy news about hollingsheads daughter i had always felt sympathy for the girl though all i knew of the situation was what i had learned from calyxas pointed verses at the independence day ball a year and a half gone any particular reason were heading back to the palace lymon pugh asked for that was the destination i had given him a few things i want to pick up then off to south france i suppose or somewhere foreign like that you can still come with us lymonthe offer stands im not sure what your prospects are in manhattan just now you might have a hard time drawing your wages after tonight no thank you i mean to take my wages in the form of a breed horse from the palace stables and ride the animal west if any horses remain that is the republican guards are fond of julian and remember him as conqueror but they can read the writing on the wall as well as the next man many of them have pulled out already probably some of the presidential silverware has gone with them though i name no names we call people rats who desert a sinking ship but in some cases the rat has the wisdom of the situation lymon pugh was correct about the looting and the reasons for it ordinarily the republican guard is a nonpartisan group and survives these flurries of regime change without much trouble simply by transferring its loyalty to the next man in the chair but julian had made the current guard his own animal and it would sink or swim along with his administration we came to the th street gate apparently some members of the local chapter of the army of the laurentians had heard about the sacking of the palace and felt they ought to be allowed to join in since their northern comrades would be marching on manhattan any day now a group of these vultures had gathered at the gate and were clamoring for admittance and firing pistols into the air enough guardsmen remained on the wall to act as warders however and they kept out the mob and the mob retained enough respect for the presidential seal to allow us to pass through though they did so grudgingly and with some shouted sarcasm i asked lymon pugh to make two stops on the grounds of the executive palace one was at the guesthouse where until this evening i had lived calyxa had packed up our most treasured possessions days earlier in anticipation of the necessity of flight and these had already gone to the docks only a few odds and ends remained behind one such was a box of souvenirs and mementos which i had put together without calyxas knowledge and i took it out of the sadly empty building with me from there we went to the palace itself lymon pugh had been correct in his description of the republican guards paradoxical behavior some men still occupied their traditional places at the portico stubbornly on duty while others sallied freely up the marble stairs and down again burdened with cutlery vases tableware tapestries and every other portable object i didnt blame them for it however as of tonight they were effectively unemployed with poor prospects and entitled to back pay in whatever form they could get it i hoped no one had already taken what i had come to retrieve in that regard i was lucky few of these men some of whom gave me a sheepish salute as i passed them had ventured into the underground section of the palace which still had an unsavory reputation they had not breached the projection room and the master copy of the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin was just where julian had left it divided among three pietins along with the score script stage instructions etc i didnt linger once i had retrieved these things i suppose if there had been a prisoner in the palaces underground jail i might have paused to release him but there werent any prisoners to release the only prisoner julian had kept was the one he had inheritedthat is his murderous uncle deklanand deklan had since taken up a new residence in hell or atop an iron post depending on how you look at it lymon pugh was waiting when i emerged from the palace he had made good on his word and taken a pedigreed horse from the palace stables and fitted it up with a fine leather saddle and saddlebags and i could hardly rebuke him for the theft for he had brought along a second horse just like the first and similarly equipped for me even if youre only riding as far as the docks you ought to ride in style he said the saddlebags were a convenient way to transport the three reels of charles darwin as well as my other souvenirs and i packed these things carefully but im not going straight to the docks i said no where first then down to the rough part of towna certain address he was interested in this plan wont that be near the fire very nearperilously nearbut still accessible i hope whats there i shrugged i wasnt ready to confide my awkward hopes in him well let me ride with you at least that far whatever your purpose is youd be putting yourself in danger it wouldnt be the first time if i get nervous ill shy awayi promise it was a welcome offer and i accepted it just before we remounted i fetched from among my own goods a spare copy of a western boy at sea i had packed half a dozen and gave it to lymon to keep he marveled at it by the light that leaked from the palace doors this is the one you wrote it has my name on the front just up from the octopus the octopus doesnt appear in the book he seemed genuinely moved by the gift ill read it adam i promise just as soon as i come to a slow spot in my life here he said reaching into his pocket heres something for you in return something to remember me by call it a christmas present i accepted his gift which he had made himself and solemnly thanked him for it we nearly had a disastrous adventure even before we left the palace grounds on the way to the th street gate we rode through the statuary lawn where sculptures and relics from the days of the secular ancients were preserved it was an eerie place even by daylight and eerier still in the diffuse nightglow of the city with the copper head of the colossus of liberty listing perpetually to the south the angel of the waters gazing in solemn pity at christopher columbus and simon bolivar frozen in a cavalry raid on the needle of cleopatra the road twined among these bronze enigmas from ancient times as through a maze we seemed to be alone in it but we were not a small group of men on horseback who must have forced their way through one or another of the gates was lurking among the statues perhaps on the theory that they could rob any eupatridians or unaccompanied guardsmen departing the property with loot and i suppose they imagined they could get away with this outrage in the general atmosphere of chaos and abandonment whatever their plan they saw us coming and rode at us from their hiding place in a tight group i counted six of them the lead man did not disguise his intentions but pulled a rifle from his saddleholster this way lymon pugh cried and we spurred our mounts but the thieves had calculated their attack very finely they were about to cut off our escape route and probably kill us for our modest treasure when the rifleman suddenly looked past us his eyes wide and shouted an obscenity as his horse reared up under him i turned in my saddle to see what had frightened him so it was nothing hostile it was only otis the elderly bachelor giraffe who liked to spend his evenings among the statues all the nighttime activity at the palace had made him nervous i suppose and when otis was nervous he was apt to charge which was just what he didhe came out from behind libertys battered diadem with his long neck swaying majestically and galloped straight at the bandits i think he would have roared if nature had blessed him with such a talent the thieves scattered in several directions lymon and i took the opportunity and fled the scene without looking back not slowing until we saw the lights of th street i heard some gunfire as we passed out of the gate i dont know whether otis was injured in his confrontation with the bandits i believe he was not though i cant produce evidence giraffes are as mortal as any other creature of course and entirely vulnerable to bullets but i didnt think otis would let himself be killed by such low men as thoseit wasnt in his nature i didnt tell lymon pugh our destination until we were much closer to it for i was constantly unsure of the wisdom of going there but i thought julian deserved a final opportunity to change his mind about staying in manhattan especially now that the city was burning down and if i found him or so i reasoned i could ask him why he had not offered his farewell by some means less impersonal than a short scrawled note i wasnt entirely sure i could find him but i had a firm hunch as to his whereabouts and i calculated there was enough time left to pursue the matter if only just if anything would stymie us it would be the fire in the immigrant district depending on how it had spread as we crossed ninth street we were nearly borne back by a tide of fleeing egyptians they were a troubled people despised by the majority many of them had left their native country to escape the poverty and warfare of suez and the sickness that haunts the terrible ruins of cairo they had seen destruction before and they didnt seem surprised by this fresh catastrophe but were resigned to it and trudged along with their packs on their shoulders and their carts dragged behind them as if it were not the first apocalypse they had witnessed or the last they expected to see they paid us no attention but we were riding against a human avalanche and it slowed our progress soon we could see the fire itself leaping above nearby rooftops the flames had already consumed most of the immigrant district where the flimsy houses often appended to old concrete ruins and built from whatever debris could be dug out from makeshift excavations burned like tinder all manhattans firewagons and waterengines had been brought to bear on the problem or so it seemed the pumpers took their water from the houston canal a freight canal and from the delancey canal a sewage canalthough in practice there was little to choose between them debris of the most noxious sort often plugged the firemens hoses and the stench of smoke char and boiling human waste nearly turned us back fortunately lymon pugh had brought along an assortment of paper plague masks some dipped as was the eupatridian custom in oil of opoponax and we each donned one of these and they were modestly useful in impeding the unwelcome odor of the conflagration the wind was fierce and carried sparks and embers with it at least so far however the waterengines had succeeded in keeping the houston canal as a sort of firebreak and the flames had not spread beyond it that was fortunate for the address i was seeking was just this side of that canal you might as well break down and tell me where were going lymon pugh said the church of the apostles etc whatmagnus stepneys old barn it was raided last year i thought he keeps a smaller version of it in the loft of a building on ninth street you think julian went there despite the fire its an intuition i muttered and it was and probably a mistaken one but the idea that they had come here once fixed in my mind had been impossible to dislodge maybe more than that lymon said suddenly reining up his horse and gesturing to me to follow him into an alley look there we kept to the shadows as a group of horsemen rode by not away from but toward the fire the same direction we were going shortly i realized what had alarmed lymon about them the man at the head was deacon hollingshead himself with a body of ecclesiastical police in gilded uniforms trailing behind i was sure it was the deacon for he was close enough to be easily recognized and i could not forget the hateful face of the man who had attempted to put calyxa on trial he glanced at us as he passed but the plague masks served to disguise us and he was too intent on his business to spare us any closer attention his destination was ours by the time we reached the warehouse which contained the attic church of magnus stepney hollingshead and his men were dismounted in front of it the halfdozen ecclesiastical police quickly surrounded the building blocking every entrance lymon and i watched from a safe distance as they performed their evolutions there were no firefighters nearbyin fact the street was deserted its residents had long since fled the street had changed some since my last visit mainly due to julians lifting of the ban on apostate churches just a year ago it had been a furtive neighborhood of hempshops and boarding houses and other low businesses it still was but newlyestablished temples and mosques and places of worship had sprung up among the taverns and slatternly hotels many of them painted in gaudy colors or decorated with fanciful symbols and slogans as if a carnival of faith had arrived in town the firewagons were all down at the canal itself behind and to the west of us the immigrant district burned freely and windblown embers floated down but neither the warehouse containing the church of the apostles etc nor any of the nearby structures was actually burning yet julian must be inside as you guessed said lymon pugh or else the deacon wouldnt be here look how they cover the entrancesvery professional for dominion men though any army patrol would do it better and theyre wellarmed i added for the ecclesiastical troopers carried gleaming pittsburgh rifles in their hands if only we had got here first no adam youre wrong about that if we had got here first wed be inside with julian and subject to the deacons whims as it stands we have a chance of taking the enemy by surprise just the two of us calls for stealth lymon pugh admitted but it can be done i dont have even a pistol to use against their weapons leave that part to me they divide their forces adam see six men plus the deacon and he just sent three of them around the back to cover the exits even three armed men dominion police why i could have brought down a dozen such men even before i joined the army often did despite what lymon had told me about his streetfighting and beefboning days it struck me as a risky proposition but he was firm about it he told me to stay where i was and soothe the horses while he circled around back of the warehouse once the rear guards were out of action he would commandeer their rifles and when we were both armed we could assault the frontif i thought it was worth doing i told him i had come this far and might as well finish the journey so long as we had a reasonable chance of escaping death he smiled and dashed off into the darkness keeping to the shadows and circling wide the horses were made nervous by the fire across the canal and they wanted to whinny and stomp i tethered them to an alley post and spent considerable time calming them down the flames were so high in the sky that they cast a red twilight over everything and the smoke was so thick that even my plague mask couldnt keep it out and it was all i could do to keep from coughing explosively then there was the sound of a gunshot followed by a second stuttering volley of rifle fire all my work calming the horses was instantly undone i looked across the street to the warehouse the ecclesiastical thugs remaining there took up their weapons and hurried around the side of the building to find out what had happened leaving the deacon by himself the deacon didnt linger however he entered the warehouse by the front door alone and seeming very determined and with a pistol gripped tightly in his hand lymons plan was not developing as expected and i was forced to act on my own recognizance i hurried across the empty street past overturned trashbarrels and flakes of ash newlyfallen from the sooty sky and followed deacon hollingshead into the building treading very lightly so he would not be aware of my presence it took me a while to make my way up the stairs for the only illumination was the glare of the fire as it came through the landing windows at every moment i feared hearing another gunshot and expected to arrive at the upstairs chapel to find julian dead at the deacons hands but no such shot was fired and when i came to the sign at the top of the stairs church of the apostles etc god is consciencehave no otherlove your neighbor as your brother i was able to hear the sound of voices a few more steps brought me to the door of the large attic room which magnus used for a chapel with its benches for parishioners and its high round window under a peaked roof there were no parishioners inside however as i discovered when i put my head around the door what i saw was deacon hollingshead with his back to me aiming a pistol at julian comstock and magnus stepney who sat sidebyside on the nearest bench this was about all i could make out for the only light was from the high window facing the egyptian district everything was bathed in shades of umber orange and smoldering red and this light was not steady but trembled and wavered and waxed and waned i had not yet been seen and i stopped where i was of all the crimes you committed hollingshead was saying and theyre too numerous to account the one that brings me here since you ask is the murder of my daughter magnus and julian leaned into one another on their bench their faces were shadowed and obscure and julians voice when he spoke was hardly a whisper then youre here on a useless mission he said whatever else i may have done i havent harmed your daughter in any way the deacon gave a wild laugh havent harmed her you ordered the attack on colorado springs didnt you julian nodded slowly then you killed her as surely as if you had driven a dagger into her breast her house my house was demolished by artillery fire it burned to the ground mr president no one survived im sorry for the destruction of your property my property and for all the lives that were lost in the attackpointlessly i supposethough history will have the final word on that the dominion could have yielded you know and all that bloodshed would have been prevented but as far as your daughter is concernedyour daughter is alive deacon hollingshead the deacon had probably expected some fumbling denial or perhaps a plea for mercy but this mild retort took him by surprise he lowered his pistol a few degrees and i thought about tackling him and fighting him for it but the risk seemed too great just now do you mean something particular by that he asked or are you completely mad the story of your daughters troubles circulated widely thanks in part to that vulgar song your friends whorish wife performed at last years independence day celebrations and i admit i took an interest in her i investigated her situation very carefully not long before the attack on colorado springs i sent two of my republican guards to interview her to interview her is this true my men apprised her of the pending military action and offered her a means of escape hollingshead took a step closer to his captives lies no doubt but i swear to you julian comstock if in fact you took my daughter as a hostage tell me where she is tell me and i might let you live a while yet your daughters not a hostage i said she was offered a means of escape by that i mean relocation to another cityfar from the heart of the dominion and far from you deacon hollingsheadwhere she can live under an assumed name and associate freely with anyone she likes sin freely you mean if thats true you might as well have killed her youve murdered her immortal soul which is just the same thing just the same to you the young lady has a different opinion that cranked up the deacons rage another notch he took a menacing step forward and so did i coming up behind him by this time julian and magnus had seen me but they were wise enough to give no sign if you imagine youve achieved some sort of victory the deacon said think again president comstock julian conqueror hah wheres julian conqueror now when you think about it hiding in an apostate church with his presidency down around his head and the city burning not a hundred yards away what i did for your daughter i did for her sake not on account of you your daughter carries scars from the whippings you gave her if i hadnt intervened i doubt she would have lived to see thirty years of age under your tutelage i wondered if julian was trying to get himself killed he vexed the deacon so i took another quiet step forward ill have her back before long the deacon said i expect you wont shes pretty carefully hidden shell live to curse your name shes cursed it more than once already i should kill you for that alone do so thenit wont make any difference it makes every difference youre a failure julian comstock and your presidency is a failure and your rebellion against the dominion is a failure i guess the dominion will stagger on a while longer but its doomed in the long run you know such institutions dont last look at history there have been a thousand dominions they fall and are forgotten or they change beyond recognition the history of the world is written in scripture and it ends in a kingdom the history of the world is written in sand and it evolves as the wind blows tell me where my daughter is i wont ill kill your sodomitic friend first in that case and then but he didnt finish his speech i took from my pocket the christmas gift lymon pugh had given me it was a knocker of course lymon had continually improved his technique in the art of knockermaking and had honored me with one of his best the hempen sack was stitched and beaded in a cunning pattern and the lead slug inside it might have been forged in an ostrich egg i lunged forward and employed this useful gift in knocking the pistol out of the deacons hand he got off a shot in the process but the bullet went wild and lodged in the floor hollingshead whirled around gripping his injured hand and stared first he stared at me i suppose he recognized me as calyxas husband and then he stared at the device in my hand what is that thing he demanded its called a knocker i said and i gave him a brisk demonstration of its uses and before long he was lying at my feet inert lymon pugh came up the stairs just then i had some trouble he began but i put away all the ecclesiastical police one by onebut i heard a shot from up heresay is that the deacon he looks all caved in keep a guard on the door please lymon i said for i wanted to hold a private conversation with julian lymon took the hint and left the room julian didnt stand or otherwise alter his position he sat propped against magnus stepney who was likewise propped against him and they looked like a pair of rag dolls tossed aside by an impatient child i stepped around the fallen deacon and walked toward them not too close julian said i hesitated what do you mean magnus stepney answered this time instead of julian i nearly failed to recognize you in that plague mask but you had better keep it on adam hazzard because of the smoke you mean no magnus reached down to pick up a lantern which was at his feet he lit it with a match and held it high so that the light fell over him and julian i understood instantly what the problem was and i admit that i gasped and fell back a step julian was pale and his eyes were halflidded and feverspots burned on both cheeks but that wasnt the telling symptom the telling symptom was the crop of pale yellow pustules like snowdrops in a winter garden that rose above his collar and descended down his arms oh i said oh the pox julian said i wasnt sure until tonight that i was infected but when the lesions appeared i couldnt fool myself any longer thats why i kept myself separate in my box at the theaterthats why i left without warning and thats why i cant join you aboard the goldwing in case you were about to ask i might infect the whole crew and passengers kill half the people i love and die myself into the bargain so you came here its as good a place to die as any i think the fire will kill you before the plague does he only shrugged at that what about you magnus i asked youre sitting there right next to himarent you afraid of getting sick in all likelihood i already am he said but thank you for asking adam i mean to stay with julian as long as i have the strength in me it was a saintly thing to say julian took the hand of magnus and stretched himself out on the pew moaning a little at the pressure on his sores and rested his head in magnuss lap i had always hoped julian would find a woman who loved him so he could experience some of the pleasures in life that had been granted to me and denied to him that didnt happen but i was consoled that he would at least have his friend magnus beside him in his extremity he might not have a wife to give him solace or to smooth his dying pillow but he had magnus and perhaps in julians eyes that was just as good i missed the third act curtain julian said wistfullyi think his mind had begun to wander was there applause applause and cheering and plenty of it it was hard to tell in the dim light but i think he smiled it was a good show wasnt it adam a fine show none better and ill be remembered for it do you think of course you will he nodded and closed his eyes is it true i asked him what you told the deacon about his daughter shes safe in montreal on my orders that was a noble act it offsets the stink of war and death my own small offering to conscience do you suppose its good enough he asked turning his feverish eyes to magnus conscience isnt particular magnus said he accepts most any offering and you made a generous one thank you for coming adam julian said and i could see that he was tiring quickly but you had better make for the docks now the goldwing wont wait and the flames are spreading i expect the wind carries embers over the canal this very building will be on fire soon if it isnt already i expect youre right said julian but neither of them moved and i couldnt turn away im afraid i wasnt a very good president julian whispered but you were a good friend see to that baby of yours adam hazzard do i hear her crying i think id like to sleep just now he closed his eyes and paid me no more attention i thanked magnus for his kindness and left without turning back in the hot and cindery air outside the building i said my goodbyes to lymon pugh lymon took my hand a final time and said he was sorry about julian and wished me well in foreign places then he rode away uptown a lone horseman on a vacant street all strewn with windblown embers i made the docks by midnight i took the saddlebags from my breedhorse and donated the animal to a passing family of egyptians to whom it probably represented the wealth of croesus the goldwing had not sailed i came aboard and found my cabin calyxa was there tending flaxie in her crib calyxa was impatient over my absence and wanted to know where i had been but i didnt explain myself only took her in my arms and wept against her shoulder the goldwing left harbor at dawn ahead of the flames she came through the narrows and anchored in the lower bay to wait for a favorable breeze a bright december sun was shining we could see the smoke rising from the city the fire took lower manhattan almost up to the palace grounds before the wind turned the blaze back on itself the smoke rose in a wide canted column up to where the upper air caught it and fanned it over the ocean i had the macabre idea that this cloud of ash and soot contained must have contained by scientific reasoningparticles of what had once been my friend julian his own atoms i mean transfigured by fire and cleansed of disease and finally allowed to rain down over an indifferent ocean the thought was painful but i supposed julian would have approved of it for it was philosophical in nature or as close as i could come by midday the captain of the vessel elected to get under way this was not a single act but involved the raising of anchors and the setting of sails and the rotating of winches and several such actions as that the goldwing had only a small boilerengine for close navigation at sea she was a schooner and at the mercy of the wind calyxa and i left flaxie with a nurse and came up on the aft deck to watch the sails loft and we found sam and julians mother already there and the four of us fell together in a groupnot saying much for we shared a grief that was literally unspeakable the captains orders were shouted down the chain of command in serial echoes and the results reported back in reverse order ship the capstan bars dinned about our ears and heave in the cable to a short stay as the anchor was brought apeak sunlight heated the planked deck and made it steam sam went to the taffrail to look back at the burning city we joined him there keeping out of the way of the busy sailors the topsails were shaken out sheeted home and neatly hoisted the goldwing gave a little stir like an animal turning in its sleep sam turned to emily do you think it would be all right he asked appropriate i meanif i saidwell a prayer of course she said taking his good hand in hers one of my prayers i mean yes sam she said theres no dominion here to punish you for it and i imagine the crew have heard stranger thingshalf of them are european heathens sam nodded and began to speak the prayer for julian which he must have preserved in memory from distant childhood the nautical shouting continued over his solemn chant saltwater slapped the vessels wooden cladding and gulls cried out above us he lowered his head yit

emily and calyxa said amen and so did i then we stood at the rail and watched america slip away over the western horizon epilogue spring doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye mr herman melville in a book rescued from the dominion archives by julian comstock it has been my purpose in this book to give the reader a true and authentic portrait of the life and career of julian comstockor where truth was in doubt or unobtainable to err on the side of drama to the best of my ability that is what i have done and i lay down my pen with mixed feelings of pride and shame love and guilt sixteen years have passed since these events the goldwing anchored safely at marseilles in the new year of and although we were strangers in mediterranean france and of the bunch of us only calyxa spoke the language and that in an accent which made the natives wince and curl their lipsnevertheless we have prospered here the weather is generally pleasant the local population is mixed but peacefulthe moslems and the christians maintain a rivalry but they havent killed one another for decades at least not in large numbers when we first arrived we lived at the expense of emily godwin who had imported enough of the comstock fortune to pay for a villa in a small town by the sea but neither sam nor i was content to be kept in that fashion sam eventually found his way into the horse business he borrowed enough of emilys money to import a selection of brood mares from east of the caspian sea and with these he built up a brisk local trade and made a considerable reputation for himself calyxa regularly sings at the local taverns and is sometimes called upon to perform in the port of marseilles her accent which provokes such contempt in ordinary conversation is considered charming when she applies it to music and out of this paradox she has forged a respectable income she also finds occasional work voicing american women in french movies for the movie industry has a strong presence in mediterranean france it has no dominion to quash its originality though the government interferes from time to time and recorded sound is becoming commonplace lately calyxa provided the voice for a french translation of julians life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin which was mechanically recorded and copies of the film were smuggled into the mitteleuropan mandates north of lyon where it reportedly played to enthusiastic audiences news came just yesterday of a riotously popular exhibition in brussels flaxie is a young woman now she was taught to read at an early age in english and in french and shes a master of both languages and popular among the village boys none of whom are suitable for her in my opinion although she disagrees she loves books and music and her hair is as glossy and dark and tightly coiled as her mothers was before the gray set in she assists sam at his stables out of a fondness for horses not inherited from me and she also enjoys long rides in the hills north of town but not for the purpose of carrying supplies to the parmentierist rebels who hide out in the caves thereshe was cleared of that charge we are very proud of her as for me i earn my bread by means of my pen typewriter literally though mr dornwoods machine is old and welltraveled and missing some of its parts the presses of new york city survived the fire and the american book trade thrives under president fairfield despite the edicts of an enfeebled dominion i am a mainstay of that trade im told though my manuscripts are delivered by atlantic mail and frequently lost at sea my last book before this one was american boys on the moon which sold well even without a dominion stamp sam had a few criticisms of that work he argued that a space rocket buried for a century and a half under the sands of florida could not be put into working order by a mere band of boys even if some of them were students of the mechanical arts perhaps not but they could hardly have got to the moon by any other means and i let the improbability stand the book was praised by mr charles curtis easton who also survived the fire though he is even older than my venerable typewriter and is drawing his career to a close i took inspiration for american boys on the moon from my copy of the history of mankind in space that antique book sits on my desk now along with a number of other mementos salvaged from the palace groundsa faded letter which begins lieftse hannie a train ticket validated from montreal to new york city a comstock dollar with deklan conquerors face on it julian didnt last long enough to mint his own coins a playbill from the broadway debut of darwin a decorative knocker badly stained and other such items as that tomorrow ill pack them away again as if in silent commentary the breeze flaps the pages of a calendar hanging on the wall hard to believe that in only eight years well be entering the twentythird century time is mysterious to mei cant get accustomed to how it passes perhaps ive become oldfashioned forever a twentysecond century man now calyxa comes through my study on her way to the garden our villa sits on a high bluff and the property grows little more than seagrass and sand but calyxa has long since walled off a square of good soil and she plants it every year with lavender mimosa and sunflowers she has been an invaluable resource in the writing of my julian memoirfilling out exact french phrases from my memory of a few dim words and copying the sentences for me with accents grave and aigu and such frills today she pauses and gives me a cryptic smile tu es lhomme le plus gentil et le plus innocent que je connaisse she says tu rends les laideurs de la vie supportables sans toi elles seraient insoutenables no doubt this is some mild joke at my expense for calyxa is skeptical by nature and often couches her ironies in french which after sixteen years in this country i still do not confidently understand thats what you think i tell her and she laughs as she walks away her white skirt swirling about her ankles i mean to leave my typewriter and follow her the afternoon is too tempting to be denied it isnt paradise here or even close but the mimosa is in bloom and the air from the sea is cool and pleasant on days like this i think of poor old magnus stepneys evolving green god harking us all up to eden the green gods voice is faint enough that few of us hear it clearly and thats our tragedy i suppose as a speciesbut i hear it very distinctly just now it asks me to step into the sunshine and i mean to do its bidding acknowledgments julian comstock could not have been written without the generosity and support of people too numerous to list including once again my endlessly patient wife sharry of the legions of usedbook dealers i consulted in the course of my research two deserve special mention jeffrey pickell at kaleidoscope books collectibles in ann arbor who first drew my attention to the work of oliver optic william taylor adams and terry grogan at bmv books in toronto who has an absolutely uncanny talent for finding the right book at the right time many thanks also to mischa hautvast peter hohenstein mark goodwin and clairegabriel robert for help with the dutch and french passagesany errors are of course all mine and not least my sincere thanks to peter crowther of ps publishing whose handsome chapbook edition of
