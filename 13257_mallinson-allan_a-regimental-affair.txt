allan mallinson a regimental affair to the late colonel george stephen sometime commanding officer thth royal hussars queen marys own and from time to time in such other regiments and corps as her majesty directs a cameronian and a grey what a go authors note soldiers in peace are like chimneys in summer wrote william cecil lord burghley at the end of every war a grateful british nation has dismissed its surplus soldiers and usually with indifference one has only to look back not ten years to the end of the cold war to see how illused a soldier can be when his arms are no longer required invariably too the calculation proves wrong and a shortage of soldiers soon follows as was the case with the reductions after waterloo there was a wholesale disbanding of regiments unlike however when the cavalry or more properly the royal armoured corps was all but eviscerated the duke of wellingtons horsed regiments escaped the worst for a time because they were needed to deal with civil disturbances at home there being no proper police force on the whole they found it disagreeable work as soldiers still do one of the reasons was that their legal position was often ambiguous i commend two books on this fascinating subject to those who would read more first is military intervention in democratic societies croom helm a scholarly collection of essays edited by peter rowe and christopher whelan second is military intervention in britain from the gordon riots to the gibraltar incident routledge its author anthony babington is a retired circuit judge with wartime military service and it is a most authoritative and lively account of the soldiers tribulations in aid of the civil power i am indebted to the staff of the prince consorts library at aldershot who have been most generous in searching out books and material again i owe many thanks to the two retired officers who keep the small arms collection at the school of infantry in warminster lieutenantcolonel tug wilson and major john oldfield i gratefully acknowledge as before my wifes equestrian advice and now my younger daughters help with the early manuscript fortune continues to smile on me with editors too for after ursula mackenzies leaving transworld for greater things my publishers took on strength selina walker a woman of such apt cavalry credentials that the departure of ursula who taught me a great deal was in the end bearable and simon thorogood persists in his patient painstaking way to serve the manuscripts and me admirably while i was writing this book the man who gave my military life the greatest turn and without whom matthew hervey would therefore never have been died prematurely i dedicate a regimental affair to him with thankfulness and fond memories at the commencement of the present reign and indeed thirty or forty years ago peace officers were seen keeping order among the crowd but now not a courtday passes without a strong military force being stationed on the public highway henry brougham mp future whig lord chancellor the kings peace i found myself obliged by every tie of duty and affection to my people to suppress in every part those rebellious insurrections and to provide for the public safety by the most effectual and immediate application of the force entrusted to me by parliament his majesty king george iii debate on the kings speech from the throne parliament june part one the brevet chapter one the privilege of rank the horse guards march five major generals so much scarlet and gold that the usually sombre meeting room of the commanderinchiefs headquarters was for once a place of colour sat in comfortable upholstered chairs at a long baizecovered table their chairman sir loftus wake bart the vice adjutant general at the head while on upright chairs at the wall perched the duke of yorks military secretary and two clerks the atmosphere was somnolent despite the morning hour in front of each general officer lay a blue vellum portfolio tied with red silk as well as paper pencils and a coffee cup of delicate pink rockingham rather out of place some of the cups were empty and were being attended to by a footman in court livery majorgeneral the lord dunseath a dyspepticlooking man with a purple nose waved him aside without a word intent on some detail in his copy of the times the footman next proffered his coffee pot to sir archibald barret kg a kindfaced man in spite of his eyepatch who merely sighed and declined with the same breath majorgeneral the earl of rotheram noblebrowed a picture of decency lit a cigar instead but sir francis evans kt crabbed and lacking any appreciable chin with an ear that was turned forward like a tailors tab accepted more of the strong araba and took out his snuffbox the footman hesitated by the next empty chair and then moved to replenish sir loftuss cup sir loftus wake resembled a small garden bird in both looks and animation his frame was spare indeed and his eyes his whole head darted from papers to watch from watch to door and then back again with the speed and regularity with which small birds must search about constantly for predators he stared again at the empty chair and then at his halfhunter it is a quarter past where can sir horace be lord dunseath his nose always a beacon of his disposition put down his newspaper and made a loud huffing sound well if hes trying to come through the city hell never get here theyre hanging that caitiff cashman at newgate this morning the times says a crowds expected a mob more like ill warrant i trust youve a line of cavalry between them and whitehall wake oh come said sir loftus more agitated still that will be no occasion for trouble dont you imagine it huffed dunseath again i was ere last december when those damned radicals at the spa fields marched on the tower as close to revolution as i ever saw stuff and nonsense sir said the earl of rotheram blowing a cloud of smoke ceilingwards i was at st jamess the whole time it was all wind and wine hunt and his like rabblerousers yes but i hardly fancy they have the stuff of a robespierre in them the earl was ever a man in whom the moderation of the shires found a faithful voice i wouldnt be so sure rotheram warned dunseath theres radicalism seething all about in some parts the machinebreakers are as active as ever and theres a deal too many discharged soldiers and sailors as well all a prey to jackanapes like hunt on this latter i would not dissent and where might we seek to lay blame on that account i think it truly ignoble that this government has discharged its fighting men in so mean a fashion there are beggars in scarlet in every lane lord dunseaths nose seemed darker still what would you have had liverpool do then exalt pitts income tax another penny to provide sturdy beggars with pensions we want done with it lord dunseaths voice was rising in both pitch and volume but the earl of rotheram remained unperturbed i very much doubt we shall see an end to the income tax now that it is so expeditiously collected and i should not have thought it too great a burden on men who stand to profit so much from peace and indeed who have profited so much already from war at least they might rid us of the wretched corn laws now that sir is radical talk spluttered dunseath gentlemen gentlemen pleaded sir loftus wake i hardly think the horse guards is the place for politics the military secretary had moved towards the chairman meanwhile and he now whispered something in his ear sir loftus looked relieved well gentlemen it seems that since we are five there is a quorum so let us begin without sir horace and if he does arrive at this point majorgeneral sir horace shawcross kcb did indeed arrive flushed and angry in gods name whats become of this country he boomed insolent devils holding up every carriage in the city and not a constable in sight it wouldve been the same along the strand an all had there not been regular horse there see rotheram the times warned as much said lord dunseath his nose almost glowing with satisfaction at the news the earl of rotheram merely raised his eyebrows sir horace shawcross ignored the exchange as he halfflung his cloak at an orderly when in gods name is parliament going to grasp the nettle if we dont have proper police soon therell be no peace for the keeping anywhere and the armyll be ruined doing the work sir loftus though well acquainted with sir horace shawcrosss choleric disposition was taken aback by his vehemence and the strains of the latters pronounced lancashire vowels were permitted for the moment to continue unchecked damme id the very devil of a job in the midlands with them luddites he pronounced ludd to rhyme with hood sir francis evans smiled to himself even had sir horace seen it it would not have mattered for his hero robert peel chief secretary for ireland pronounced the word in the same way now if we had a peace preservation force as peel has got himself in ireland he boomed again we could stop all this nonsense in a trice the earl of rotheram set aside his cigar peelers in england rather them than us having to do the work replied sir horace gruffly rather would i be under an albura saw again than chase round doing police business he pulled aside the chair with his right hand his left having been the object of the surgeons blade after that bloody battle and slammed his hat on the table setting the cups and saucers atremble for what seemed an age sir loftus stared intently at the hat for it was the old service shako of sir horaces beloved fortyseventh wolfes own rather than a major generals plumes sir loftus as vice adjutant general was most punctilious in these matters indeed he seemed quite oblivious now to the growing ruction about his committee said thered be trouble muttered the purple nose from behind the times everyone as been saying thered be trouble growled sir horace but whats the good of that if we had proper police we might do something about it the earl of rotheram sighed ay rotheram well might ysigh complained the voice of lancashire for its your party that wont see sense the earl of rotheram had indeed spoken against the proposal for such a force when last it had been debated in the lords i should sooner trust to the good sense of the magistrates than have some damnable system as they have on the continent weve not fought bonaparte these past twenty years just to have a score of little fouchés in every town sir horace looked startled until he recognized the french he drank his coffee in one go and held out his cup for more rotheram youre as good a man as ever walked them broad acres o yours but you underestimate the seething there is and the dissatisfaction of folk who are a prey to violence every day in town and country alike i grant you the odd poacher might disturb your peace but thats nothing to having yer livelihood and property ay and yer very life itself a hostage to the mobs whim the two men looked across the table at each other incomprehendingly as if it were the great divide of the pennine range itself for sir horaces family was cottonrich and whig whereas lord rotherams was landrich and tory in their own counties the families were as well regarded by the poorest of their workers be it in factory or farm as any could be and these two sons had served england dearly in its late trial sir horaces hand being matched by the earls right leg yet each saw the future as differently as might two horses see the same fence sensing exhaustion on the subject of a professional constabulary sir loftus wake sought to regain his authority well gentlemen perhaps we should adjourn this debate and be about our proper affairs this day to his considerable relief there was a general murmur of agreement we all want to be ome afore dark added sir horace gruffly well therefore let us begin the proceedings of the twentythird meeting of the army brevets committee he replaced his pincenez firmly and turned over a page of his portfolio may i first respectfully remind you that the purpose of a brevet we all know what the purpose of a brevet is wake rasped sir horace lets be having the business sir loftus looked pained once more my dear general i have no reason to suppose that you are anything but in the right however it has ever been my practice to proceed on the supposition that not everyone should be expected to retain each and every detail of horse guards administration in that way we may be sure to avoid any profound error sir horace looked unconvinced as you please then very well gentlemen the purpose of brevet rank is to advance those officers of exceptional merit who might otherwise find their promotion retarded by lack of means to purchase the next higher rank or indeed by a lack of regimental vacancy in such a rank he paused it does not carry with it the additional pay of course neither is it recognized regimentally but only in the army as a whole he glanced about the table for confirmation that the purpose was understood no one seemed to be paying much attention but sir loftus was pleased he had been able to read through his brief so far without further challenge these the nominations asked sir horace pulling at the ribbon on the portfolio in front of him yes confirmed the chairman anxiously but do permit me to explain more fully sir horace raised his eyebrows a little petulantly and gave up fingering the silk our work this morning continued sir loftus quickly is in two parts the most important is to recommend ten lieutenant colonels brevets but first there is the same number of majors brevets the duke of yorks military secretary would be obliged if all our recommendations were done by the dinner hour so that he might take them for the commanderinchiefs approval this evening well lets be about it then demanded sir horace how many names are there for each brevet two replied the chairman and so gentlemen if you would please open now the portfolios before you you will see the summaries of service and the letters of nomination for each of twenty captains in the usual manner we shall each of us award a mark out of six and when i ask you for that mark i should be obliged if you would all at the same instant indicate it to me by the dies which the military secretary is now distributing the lieutenant colonel placed an ebony die half as big as a sword basket in front of each member of the committee and may i respectfully remind you gentlemen that the die has two blank faces for any lesser score than three would be unseemly all nodded and then at sir loftuss bidding they began the task of assessing the twenty claims to a coveted brevet an hour passed in varying degrees of silence from time to time a clerk was sent scurrying away on some errand or other but the seven major generals laboured in the main with little need for clarification when all were done sir francis evans the last to finish but only by a minute or so sir loftus motioned a footman to bring madeira and seedcake to the table and as smoke from assorted cigars began to fill the room once more he invited the committee to declare their marks for each contender let us begin then with number one captain lord arthur fitzwarren first guards the dies each showed six except sir loftuss own and sir horace shawcrosss which showed four the clerks took note captain sir aylwin onslow second guards the scores were as before except that sir horaces die showed three the chairman made a thoughtful um sound before naming the third captain the lord collingbourne royal horse guards the scores were as before except that sir loftuss die now showed three as well as sir horaces we seem to be in a fractional degree of disparity said the chairman diffidently seems to me youre both marking meanly said sir archibald barret even i can see that he adjusted his eyepatch pointedly meanly be damned huffed sir horace all ive seen so far are men with more than adequate means to buy their own advancement none of them has seen campaigning service all theyve seen is the inside of st jamess and got themselves a good patron sir horace began sir archibald kindly it is not the good fortune of every officer to hear the sound of the guns every day these are diligent young men with much to offer the staff especially now that peace is come perhaps conceded sir horace but there is ever a need for men on the staff who know what it is to fight if peace is indeed come then its even more important that there are officers in positions of influence who know what is the true business of war peace will not be with us for ever and the devil in a long peace is that the army forgets how to fight prettily said sir horace acknowledged sir archibald but let us not be overly fastidious let us just suppose that in ten brevets we shall turn up ten officers as can with honour serve their country best sir loftus wake now showed something of the quality for which he had been entrusted with the committees chairmanship suggesting that the military secretary make a note of those nominations where there was a disparity of more than two points as members saw them and then perhaps we may look again at those names in the light of our findings as a whole the members of the committee were content and the next nine names passed without much comment captain john daniells sixtyninth foot said sir loftus for the thirteenth sir horaces mark was six sir loftuss five the others threes and fours now this i dont understand sighed sir horace daniells is described by sir charles alten who did after all command the division at waterloo in which that regiment was as the most able captain in his command and certain to rise to general rank but you see replied sir archibald barret rubbing his eyepatch a shade wearily he scarcely needs a brevet to secure that prediction hell fight his way there in the usual way as you did and i did we are trying to place men in positions of responsibility on the staff now i am very much afraid that if a major general says he wants someone as his brigade major then that is greatly more to the point than one who simply predicts a man will reach high rank once again sir loftus managed to stay sir horaces protest gentlemen what we are meant to be about is the advancement of officers who will serve their country with distinction this i believe is what we are trying to do we each perhaps perceive that service to be rendered differently but not the ultimate effect the process is not science though i do beg a little forbearance from members calm returned to the table as three more names were marked broke of the rifles lord henry lygon of the bays and sir idris llewellyn of the rd foot number seventeen said sir loftus sounding a little tired captain matthew hervey sixth light dragoons sir horace displayed five sir loftus six the others fours and one three oh come now sir horace complained lord uxbridge writes that this officer has one of the best cavalry eyes in the service and colquhoun grant says he did sterling service lately in india for the duke what more dye want sir francis evans answered this time his chin for the moment out of sight below his collar and his tabear like lord dunseaths portwine nose reddening as it always did when he was perturbed by something we cannot go awarding brevets just because someone is a waterloo hand the rest of the army is becoming impatient of the dukes habit of favouring men so hervey has no experience of the staff and he is not proposed for any special appointment that i grant you but its not merely waterloo the man it seems did extraordinarily well on his own in india india muttered lord dunseath from his lately silent corner of the table my noble lord sighed sir horace forcing himself to measure his words if we continue to think of india in that manner we shall waste much experience of fighting that we can ill afford to mark my words these indiamen have things to teach us i never heard such nonsense brown faces is all they see how can a brown face teach an officer more than a frenchman lord dunseaths own face had turned red and his nose almost violet please gentlemen sir loftus appealed let us not disparage any of these candidates they are all worthy men let us proceed to the remaining three very well said sir horace but i must have the floor if daniells and hervey do not show when the count is made of course of course i have said already that it will be a members prerogative conceded the chairman when the declarations and the counting were all done sir loftus announced the preliminary brevets daniellss name was not one of them neither was herveys then i must protest most strongly said sir horace striking the table with the stump of his absent hand sir loftus was an officer who sought concordance in the committees of which he was chairman but although he had risen by his skill on the staff rather than in battle he shared sir horaces opinion of daniells and hervey he did not know however if his staff skills would extend to converting the other members of the brevets committee to that view he summoned the footman to bring more madeira earlier that morning captain matthew hervey had found himself once more at the horse guards in the yard below the room where the major generals would discuss his fitness for a brevet shall we walk there directly or take a chaise through the park lets walk said hervey with a smile lets see your guardsmen at drill captain the lord john howard in full dress smart as a carrot newscraped the buckles of his shoes were gleaming so bright that hervey knew they could not be pinchbeck returned the smile and picked up the step as they struck off towards the horse guards parade and st jamess park a company of the grenadiers as they were now calling themselves howards own regiment was wheeling in slow time at the furthest corner of the parade ground by the judge advocate generals garden at the end of downing street but they were too few and it was too dull an evolution to merit more than a passing observation though their band made a pretty noise the dismounted sentry at the arch from the oxford blues had brought his sword from the slope to the carry as they passed and hervey had returned the salute with a hand to his shako thrilling more than a little to the compliment for the duke of yorks headquarters was the place from which all the kings men no matter how farflung their post had their fortunes ordered it did not fall to every officer to walk thus shall you tell me what was said asked howard unable to contain himself any longer did the duke of york have laurels for you i didnt see him said hervey simply howard looked at him with disbelief but that is why you were come here yes agreed hervey absently for the sight of the parade ground had brought to mind the last occasion he had walked here then howard had been his arresting officer and the future had looked black indeed until the confusion leading to his arrest was suddenly revealed the revelation and the honours that had come with it seemed as yesterday but he made himself rally you would scarce expect though that the duke of york would be able to spare the time to see a mere captain of light dragoons that is deliberately to demean yourself to degrade your station as aidedecamp to the duke of wellington lately aidedecamp as i told you before i was discharged by the duke lord john howard sighed hervey i am truly astonished you are appointed aidedecamp to the first soldier of europe of the world indeed and you ask to be relieved theres no profit in doing a job which is better fitted to others but you scarce served beside the duke might you not have given the prospect a chance at least you are in the right there my dear lord john said hervey looking straight ahead still i didnt serve directly on his staff but india resalted my appetite to be with troops and not just any troops howard shook his head again you have a most uncommon attachment to your dragoons no good to you may come of it if you persist and you in the guards have no such attachment herveys frown implied scepticism i confess i was never able to recognize my company unless the serjeants had taken post that is the way in the guards it would not do for an officer to know a private mans name stuff and nonsense i never heard its like laughed hervey you are beginning to sound like darcey jessope i know for a fact that you visit the chelsea hospital every week and have seen to pensions for half a dozen who were at waterloo the captain of grenadiers stayed his argument abruptly how hervey knew of his charity he could not imagine but there was no doubting that his friend had detected his pretence at guards insouciance i was not there you see he replied simply and if you werent at waterloo the point had not occurred to hervey quite so plainly before i listen to rees gronow in whites he never boasts of course or says anything that might promote his part in things but i know that being at waterloo has changed the entire way in which he thinks is that not so the band had broken into quick time encouraging both men to step out hervey was keen to leave the subject behind he liked lord john howard a good deal and thought he might even come to like him as much as he had darcey jessope though he could never be a true intimate because like jessope howard did not wear a blue coat and a buff collar and the roman six on his shako howard he announced i shall be pleased to breakfast with you he took his arm only let us avoid mention of things which are now properly in the past there is more before us than behind of that you can be sure after their breakfast and a change into plain clothes the aidedecamp and the former aidedecamp took a chaise to the city for hervey was determined now that there was no duty to detain him in london to secure a seat on the first coach for wiltshire the last occasion he had had for one had been the better part of three years ago when with bonaparte despatched to elba and peace seemingly come at last to europe he had been given his first leave in as many years to return to horningsham and his people and there he had met henrietta again he would have a very great deal to speak about with henrietta he had rehearsed it the better part of his passage home from india and the delight he was taking in the prospect of seeing her was now and again marred by the darker parts of those litanies however that she might throw him over or that she might indeed have done so already could not take away the pleasure just in seeing her again for it had been all but two years since their hasty affiancing and his even hastier departure but for the time being at least hervey had only practical concerns and these were welcome as a distraction from those others on that last occasion for posting to wiltshire he had gone to the saracens head in skinner street the offices of the universal coach and wagon company to pay over the odds for an inside seat on one of their mails a balloon coach which had conveyed him at a full nine miles an hour to salisbury thence after a nights fitful sleep at the red lion he had taken the bath stage for warminster and although he hoped the demand for seats had slackened in the intervening two years this was his intention again now lord john howard was minded to go with him to horningsham for herveys sister elizabeth had become the object of his considerable admiration but which fact he had not yet been quite able to tell his friend duty at the horse guards however would delay that pleasure a further while as the chaise got closer to snow hill its progress was checked to an unusual degree even allowing for the habitual congestion of the narrow thoroughfares of the city lord john howard stuck his head out of the window and called to the driver for his opinion of the delay cashman sir theyre hangin im at noon outside beckwiths gun shop in skinner street i doubts as ill be able to get the carriage through to the saracens at this rate from both windows they could see men and women in the main respectably dressed walking with grim purpose in the same direction they were heading though with more ease i think it better if we alight said howard this will never do they stepped down from the chaise not without difficulty and hervey paid the driver straight on up here then sir on across grays inn road and youll be there soon enough and mind gentlemen therell be pickpokes and nippers all over the place they thanked him and joined the flow of people eastwards who is this cashman asked hervey fastening tight his coat i heard speak of him at the united services this morning ah replied howard raising an eyebrow its a very rum affair indeed there was a big gathering of radicals on the spa fields at clerkenwell last december the crowd was whipped up by agitators and the like and then a couple of hundred of them marched into the city breaking into some gun shops on the way what happened when they got there oh the mayor had things properly seen to they couldnt make any mischief at the exchange so they set off for the tower instead and then the mayor had sent for the cavalry and they dispersed them without too much trouble and cashman was one of the ringleaders heavens no he was just one of the poor sots to be taken in by the likes of hunt hunt hervey had been little enough in england these past five years to know anything much of the troubles let alone the names of the ringleaders orator hunt they call him a fearful rabblerouser makes mischief all over the country at present what with his calls for reform he and others like him are the real villains of the piece but it was cashman who broke into beckwiths and he stands convicted of stealing arms for the purposes of insurrection hes being hanged outside the very shop hervey sighed a sigh of cruel necessity howard caught his meaning and was to herveys surprise not wholly in accord there are many who believe his former service was not taken in mitigation and that he was illused what service asked hervey now intrigued he had it seems served bravely for some years in the navy and theyd discharged him without arrears of pay or prizemoney according to the morning post hed applied to the admiralty for redress on several occasions and hed been there in person on the morning of the spa fields meeting its at the very least a possibility that his actions that day were more in anger and frustration than in any spirit of revolt such as the quantity of gin hed consumed allowed them to be in any way his own what a devil of a business then hervey conceded the court hangs a man for mutiny who has proved his loyalty under more trying conditions i tell you hervey said howard lowering his voice and glancing to left and right it makes a fellow ashamed the way these men are treated by a supposedly grateful nation there are men with stripes on their arm cleaning out gutters for a few pence waterloo stripes too i can scarce look them in the eye as they came to snow hill they found the streets blocked by posts and chains allowing only those on foot to pass and in skinner street itself the pavements were railed off with sturdy wooden planks a large press of people seemed set to topple the barriers at any moment but somehow they were holding the crowd brooding rather than clamorous though there was no doubting the sympathy for the gallant tar about to be hanged and the crowd was indeed a thorough mix of people of both good appearance and bad for to the clerking classes and the respectable poor of hackney were added the sweepings of st giless the rookery of rookeries the special constables from each of the city wards were here in force though hervey thought them hardly sufficient to deal with a crowd turned ugly in whisken street there were firemen on alert ready to assist with subduing disorder if need be in the yard of newgate prison were threescore militiamen and in the streets adjacent to the route of cashmans procession were yeomanry cavalry while in a nearby courtyard out of sight a halftroop of regular cavalry stood as the force of last resort there are rumours howards voice was hushed plans to rescue him as he arrives to bustle him away to broad street there are so many irish there hed never be found you didnt mention he was irish no i didnt that confounds things too does it not hervey sighed again a great roar went up from the crowd followed by booing and cries of shame as workmen drawing the wheeled gibbet arrived from newgate the special constables looked about anxiously tapping their staves nervously on a shoulder or hand i dont fancy they might do aught but save themselves if this crowd makes ugly said hervey it will be the cavalry that has to deal with it and theyll get no thanks no matter how bloodlessly they manage howard agreed i hate the business with magistrates i had enough of it in ireland the sooner theres a proper constabulary the better my dear friend i could not agree with you more our guardsmen are never so disquiet than when theyre deployed for the civil power a company of grenadiers who stood fast throughout at waterloo were close to insolence when they were turned out during the corn law bill they pushed a little further up the street in the press of people still arriving making for the scaffolding which the newgate men had trundled to the front of beckwiths shop howard stopped look here hervey he frowned ive never seen a man hanged before and i dont think i care to ive seen it not a great many times myself hervey assured him and though each time the man had committed the foulest murder i could take no satisfaction in it howard shook his head lets away then said hervey putting a hand to howards shoulder the press was too great for any quick escape however so they decided to work their way along past beckwiths shop its windows stoutly boarded and out towards the wider essex road beyond but this they found not easy either for many of the onlookers were resentful of what they presumed was an attempt to get closer to the gibbet after a full halfhour they had advanced scarcely fifty yards suddenly there was a roar from the crowd behind them as the carriages carrying the sheriffs rounded the corner and then the cart bearing cashman himself hervey climbed onto a window ledge to see what was the cause i think its our man he said unable to balance there for more than a few seconds and hes dressed in his sailors best cashman was indeed a sight offensive to every right instinct he stood proud and erect with not a sign of fear he had on his blue jacket and white trousers and a black silk handkerchief tied smartly about his neck bareheaded as if mustered on deck for divine service he was calling to the crowd now muted by the appearance of their hero this is not for cowardice hervey heard him call defiantly i have done nothing against my king and country but fought for them the crowd roared its approval putting to flight the roosting pigeons on st botolphs spire two streets away i always fought for my king and country and this is my end the noise grew louder and the constables had the greatest trouble keeping a way clear for the procession huzza my boys ill die like a man shouted cashman as he reached beckwiths shop if i was at my quarters i would not be killed in the smoke id be in the fire the crowd was now as angry as ever hervey had seen men away from the battlefield the constables had to make free with their staves to get the sheriffs and clergy to the scaffold hurrah my hearties in the cause hervey wondered for a moment in which cause though he hardly expected that a man in cashmans position could be expected to say anything of sound mind success cheer up the gallant tar scaled the scaffold ladder as surely as if he had been climbing to the yards waving aside the minister who was attempting words of comfort and inviting him to repent dont bother me its no use i want no mercy but from god hervey and howard were now but twenty yards from the scaffold and could see everything perfectly this fellows a cool customer howard whispered is it gin or rum speaking do you think he treads the boards but he does it bravely for sure replied hervey shaking his head in doubt the hangman put the rope around cashmans neck the crowd gasped and then groaned then he tried to put a nightcap over cashmans head but the sailor would have none of it no thank you mr ketch ill see till the last here was courage indeed thought hervey he had seen bravado turn to nothing when the moment came but cashmans resentment seemed to get the better of him and he began a tirade against beckwith himself whom he supposed was cowering behind the boarded windows of his shop ill be with you there he shouted my unquiet spiritll walk your floors oh god sighed howard the hangman had come down the steps and was standing by the lever which would trip the hatch beneath cashmans feet i cannot see this deserving or no hervey was about to turn away too when cashman called out again i am the last of seven of them that fought for my king and country my father was killed too in the service i could not get my own and that has brought me here this is too much howard muttered and i who have never heard a shot fired in anger am stood gawking come then said hervey turning but cashman called for the crowd to give him three cheers making them both turn back once more and then in the language the sailor knew best he called to the hangman to let go the jibboom suddenly his words were choked off his body swung crazily in midair he struggled only briefly but it silenced the crowd when his writhing was no more several of the onlookers muttered god rest his soul some made the sign of the cross for a while as the sheriffs men took down the body there was scarcely a word but as quickly as the silence had come the clamour returned and everywhere there were shouts of murder murder shame shame the constables looked about anxiously as hervey and howard took the opportunity to push their way to the end of the street there was the sound of splintering timber and then a terrific roar as some of the rougher elements mounted the scaffold and pulled down the gibbet the pavement boards outside beckwiths shop gave way and the crowd surged into the middle of the street the constables quickly abandoning their attempts to hold them back and running to the west end where one of the city magistrates stood with an armed guard wed better leave them to it this is no place for either of us said hervey having to fend off one of the ladies of the district business always increased after a public execution the magistrate looked nervous too more people and a sight less respectablelooking than before were coming from the rookeries the crowd in skinner street was now in a distinct tumult he clearly feared for property and life hervey saw him signal to one of his deputies at the end of the street and then take out his pocketbook our sovereign lord the king he began though the tumult was so great that none beyond a dozen yards could have heard him chargeth and commandeth all persons being assembled immediately to disperse themselves and peaceably to depart a piece of rotten fruit struck the magistrate square in the face but he faltered only for a second before continuing peaceably to depart to their habitations or to their lawful business upon the pains contained in the act made in the first year of king george for preventing tumultuous and riotous assemblies god save the king but this magistrate was not going to wait a full hour for the crowd to disperse as the riot act required in less than a minute there was a sudden roar and then the clatter of hooves above it as the city officials force of last resort appeared from around the corner great gods exclaimed hervey the facings were unmistakable it is the sixth and i recognize some of those dragoons what a place to see them jeered by their own countrymen when only a year ago they had been cheered to the eaves he balked at the prospect of what they had to do but he wanted to be with them nevertheless go to it the sixth he called before he could think better of it howard had turned the colour of the sixths facings his eyes were empty my dear fellow said hervey grasping his arm i think wed better get you some brandy no no it is all right i want just to walk that is all he replied shaking his head hervey glanced back over his shoulder at the dragoons why dont you stay said howard ill make my way back to whitehall theres no chance of getting to the saracens head by the looks of things hervey was not of a mind to leave him but howard protested he was perfectly well enough to find a chaise very well then hervey conceded but lets dine as we said a little later though say eight at the united services and he reached for his hunter to see how long he had it was gone twisted from the chain for it had no safety swivel oh in heavens name he groaned lord john howard raised his eyebrows as if to apologize for his city it saw me through belgium and india and now a wretch from howard stayed his protest with a hand on his arm i think i should remain here with you no said hervey shaking his head theyll not have another thing from me go back to the horse guards you have duties to be about hervey turned back to see the dragoons already beginning to advance with sabres drawn the flats mind the flats only called their cornet a face new to him he thought it odd that a halftroop on duty such as this was under command of so junior an officer he could see the serjeant noakes a steady sort but never a man for troop work behind the rear rank a fat lot of good hed do there with a greenhead cornet in front but hervey was relieved to see that the right marker was sound what a welcome sight was collins his old coveringcorporal collins had galloped for him in the peninsula and at waterloo and eighteen months ago now to boulogne and from there to le havre with henrietta on that illstarred chase to reach his ship why collins had but two chevrons still hervey couldnt imagine hed back his wits in an affair any day against those of auntie noakes the sight of drawn swords served notice to the crowd to some it was a signal to be off and hervey was pleased that the cornet had sense at least to advance slowly enough to give them plenty of room but to the roughs at the far end of the street the appearance of the cavalry was a signal to increase their mischief and to open a steady fusillade of brickbats these dropped well short of the dragoons however onto the front of the crowd not yet managed to get away soon there were men and women fallen to the cobbles some bleeding from gashes about the head it would be an even uglier sight from astride a horse thought hervey and bewildering too since the innocents were now in the way of any effort to quell the more violent rioters but it was not a time for too much thinking if the line of dragoons stood still theyd positively encourage trouble another hail of stones fell closer to the line this time turn about turn about hervey shouted the hindquarters of a troophorse would he knew be a powerful street sweeper and would do no lasting damage there was certainly no room now for the flat of the sabre underhand the cornet must have seen this for he shouted to his dragoons to raise swords this only made the roughs bellow defiantly and increase their fusillade of stones some of the braver ones climbed to the roofs of the buildings either side of the street and it was not long before they began hurling slates down at the dragoons one of the first casualties was the cornet himself a piece of guttering hit the brow of his shako and then his chargers head he managed at first to stay in the saddle but before his coverman could close to support him the horse reared full upright paddling with his forelegs as if at a prizefight the cornet half dazed already had no chance he fell heavily to the ground hitting his head hard on the cobbles the dragoons behind tried desperately not to trample him but more than one iron struck christ cursed hervey as he pushed through the crowd to reach him some dragoons had stopped trying to shield the cornet where he lay some were still pushing forward at the crowd and those behind were falling into confusion not knowing what was happening in front serjeant noakes looked at a loss while hervey could see corporal collins shouting something to the front rank whose dragoons began returning sabres to the carry and kicking their horses flanks to urge them forward good thought hervey get the front rank forward five lengths to make space corporal collins was now a length ahead of the others he turned his trooper sideways and put him into a trot close along the edge of the crowd it seemed to do the trick panic for a second or so silenced the missilethrowers and allowed collins to redress the front rank so they could press forward knee to knee keep them swords sloped he shouted the while well done well done corporal collins said hervey one of the crowd eyed him suspiciously he had better be careful this was not the place to be taken for an agent the solid line of horses pushed the crowd steadily back until the missilethrowers on what remained of the scaffold suddenly realized they were within range of being captured and started to scramble down the far side collins called to the corporal of the second rank to show a front to the newgate end to discourage reinforcements in another ten minutes they had reached the essex road and skinner street was clear serjeant noakes now reasserted command he could scarcely pretend any longer that the confusion prevented his getting to the front and posted videttes to which the city constables could rally cursing to himself hervey pushed through the looser knot of onlookers to the picket line of dragoons at the ingress to sekforde street where the unconscious cornet and injured dragoons had been taken he had a mind to take the command himself but seeing order restored among the ranks pressed on down the street instead several of the men recognized him and called out with the enthusiasm that always came with the end of a bloody affair good day mr hervey sir we thought you was gone for good hervey raised his hat and smiled as best he could but did not stay to exchange banter round the corner in sekforde street a constable pointed to the crown and mitre theyve taken the injuries in there sir hervey entered the low gloomy taproom of the city alehouse scarcely able to make out who was where its mr wymondham sir said an nco indicating the motionless figure on a long table ive sent a dragoon to fetch that doctor from the anging hervey did not know cornet wymondham he supposed he must have joined in the past eighteen months he nodded approving to the nco and put an ear to the cornets mouth can i go and find another doctor sir asked wymondhams coverman whom hervey recognized as a handy dragoon from f troop yes he said though i very much fear it will be of no avail his breathing is so shallow as to be unnoticeable he said it with sadness rather than certainty and without thinking a young cornet green probably his first time out what an impious waste hervey was as angry with whoever it was that had sent him here as with the crowd which had done the mischief find a doctor as fast as you can its his only hope he urged suddenly cursing himself for conceding defeat in the dragoons hearing and hoping his agitation might make up for it hervey put his ear to the cornets mouth again for there was no rise or fall in the chest he was reluctant to believe this finelooking youth could succumb to a stone hurled by a street rough something told him he ought to turn him on his side he called to the nco for help they turned him ever so carefully but hervey felt the blood and the pieces of splintered bone at the back of the skull and it made him so qualmish he almost let go good day captain hervey sir came a voice from the doorway we none of us knew you were back im sorry you had such a poor show of us sir how is his lordship pride a bit bruised sir not good corporal collins not good at all collins looked abashed sir i am truly very sorry i thought hed just be thrown and winded i dont think hell live frankly oh jesus mary if i had ridden next to him you looked to me exactly where the right marker should have been corporal collins theres no call to be chastising yourself hes only been with us a couple of months said collins shaking his head did you say his lordship yes sir cornet the marquess wymondham duke of huntingdons son there was no doubting that it seemed to make matters worse at that moment the sheriffs physician arrived in a sociable hervey showed him the wound but the physician took only a brief look and shook his head ive no vulnerary skill im afraid wed better have him to guys hospital theyre used to dealing with steeplejacks falling there they carried wymondham outside on a door and laid it on the floor of the sociable ill go with him my assistant will have to manage the others send any of them on to the hospital that you see fit but only if you must theyll be safer away a dismal prognosis that said hervey as the chaise drew off i suppose i had better write to the duke this evening and the lieutenant colonel i suppose you better had sir what a terrible thing to have to do and so soon back lord george is still the lieutenant colonel corporal collins shook his head the earl of towcester sir hervey looked puzzled his is not a name ive heard corporal collins was he a heavy i dont rightly know sir replied collins gathering up cornet wymondhams swordbelt i think his lordship has been on halfpay a little while sir im not sure what was his last active regiment ah said hervey that explained it with your leave then sir ill resume my duties but may i ask if you are returning to us or are you still with the staff of course you may ask corporal collins i am no longer with the staff but i dont yet know when therell be a vacancy for me lets hope theres one soon sir hervey looked him straight in the eye there was a note of something in collinss reply which suggested it was more than the politeness of the ranks but collins volunteered nothing i wish we were meeting at a better time sighed hervey theres a lot we might talk about forgive me if i seem less than pleased to see you again corporal collins it is certainly not intended no sir replied collins simply tell me though before you go are there heavy calls on the regiment at present no sir the rising cadence indicated that collins had not guessed his mind i mean i was surprised to see a new cornet in so susceptible a command collins remained silent unlike serjeant armstrong or private johnson he was always guarded with his opinions hervey rephrased his enquiry so that it did not require so obvious an opinion where is the rest of your troop before he could answer a runner came up with an urgent request by the magistrate to be escorted back to bow street very well at once collins replied and then glanced at hervey with your leave sir hervey nodded his frustration obvious i think all the other officers are engaged today sir he added touching his shako peak discreetly as he turned for the escort chapter two novelties albemarle street that afternoon when hervey returned to the united services club there were two letters awaiting him the first was brief and very much to the point albany the most hon the earl of sussex returns captain herveys compliments and would be favoured if he would call upon him at ten am tomorrow march hervey had left his card at the london residence of the colonel of the regiment the day before as custom had it but he had scarcely expected that the colonel would receive him it was as well he had not made it to the saracens head for in seven years and more with the sixth he had still to meet its colonel and by all accounts the earl of sussex was a most agreeable man and such a meeting could not serve anything but well surely to his getting a troop sooner rather than later the second letter was an altogether different proposition a most intriguing affair he smiled as he read its obsecrations longs hotel new bond street march esteemed sir i have the honour to present myself as one who has with true humility learned of your service at the late battle of waterloo and of your interest in all things that are novel and advantageous to the execution of his majestys business and if you will forgive the presumption of my writing to you then i feel assured that i might be of inestimable service to you in your most distinguished profession for i have lately manufactured a repeating carbinepistol such that will multiply the usefulness of its possessor a full sevenfold honoured sir if you will give word to my man by whom this letter is brought then i may attend on you at once to demonstrate the ease and utility of this device whose invention is awaiting patent in conditions of utmost secrecy believe me sir i am yours most faithfully elisha haydon collier this was an invitation he could not overlook a repeating carbine the possibilities were great indeed at three oclock therefore he found himself in the company of elisha collier on the heath at hampstead on their way there collier who professed himself an american citizen but one who was as loyal to king george as it was possible in his circumstances to be spoke loquaciously but omitted anything of substance until hervey began to think that the engagement would prove futile but once they arrived collier set about his demonstration with such purpose that hervey was soon able to imagine that he was indeed to see something singular from the boot of the chaise colliers assistant removed a pallet three feet by two and six inches thick and attached it to a tree some thirty paces away pinning a roundel target to it he then beat the cover beyond the tree for as far again when he was finished collier turned to hervey i believe you have sir faced many an enemy at such a range and i hazard that many was the time when you felt the want of handiness in your service weapon hervey made no response both propositions were palpably certain for a soldier then sir you may have no fear ever of finding yourself in such a predicament again collier declaimed raising his hat and bowing the gesture was so theatrical as to make hervey smile but at once colliers expression turned almost demonic he pulled open the portmanteau at his feet pulled out a long singlebarrelled pistol took rapid aim at the target and with scarcely a pause to recock and close the pancover between each fired seven rounds hervey though startled watched the making of holes in the roundel and clapped his hands in admiration a very effective display of musketry indeed mr collier not merely of pyrotechny colliers benign expression returned he looked pleased by the acclamation i think i may safely wager sir that every round may be accounted for in that target do you wish to inspect it closely no i do not think there is need for the present replied hervey eyeing the weapon keenly i have read about such guns mr collier they are hardly new but the cylinders or barrels were always turned manually and they were prone to jamming yours very evidently has some mechanical means of rotation and a reliable one at that indeed sir just so that is its ingenuity you may readily suppose of its handiness to mounted men in particular hervey was ready to acknowledge it not least in the thought of how it might have served in serjeant stranges hands that day with the french lancers stranges sacrifice still visited him and all too often no one had managed to persuade him that his actions that day could not have been other than they had been perhaps it was simply that he had galloped away from the lancers and strange had stayed that he had had to gallop away he could not reasonably doubt that strange had had to stay to delay the lancers he could not doubt either but still there was something that gnawed at him and impressive for its being a flintlock he said finally gathering up his thoughts again as if loose reins collier eyed him curiously and hervey wished at once he had said nothing but was there any reason why this american should have known of the percussionlock which had saved his life at waterloo may i explain that mechanism sir collier continued hervey was now all attention you have noted of course sir the cylinder arm of seven chambers it is driven to rotate by a coiled spring which is first put into tension by rotating the cylinder anticlockwise the opposite direction from which it turns in firing hervey was not so overawed by the earlier spectacle as to be at a loss with such mechanical principles and he frowned a trifle impatiently forgive me sir said collier hastily i did not wish to impute no matter said hervey it has been a long day please go on the very essence of this action as you will appreciate sir is to have absolute alignment of chamber and barrelbreech after each rotation it is this which has defeated all gunmakers until now hervey nodded again there were a number of other things too but he was content now to acknowledge that the alignment was the most crucial a cone shall we call it a male is formed at the breech and mated as it were successively with a female countersink cut in the mouth of each chamber locking the chamber and barrel into alignment but how is the chamber held fast against the barrelbreech since you have just shown me that you pull back the cylinder in order to rotate into tension collier smiled yes yes indeed sir a rare grasp of mechanical detail if i may say so he pulled back the cylinder again two means there are first a helical spring not the same as for the rotation mind and second is this he indicated a small sliding bolt which is sent forward by the fall of the cock to butt against the rear of the cylinder it locks it quite sound and acts too as a safety device since it prevents the cock from falling fully unless the barrel and cylinder are correctly engaged that is i declare ingenious nodded hervey trying it for himself and the rotation how does the cocking advance the cylinder see this hook sir linked to the hammer said collier handing the arm to him it is engaged with a skirt on the rear of the cylinder see when the cock is drawn back the hook pulls back the cylinder from the breech and the spring does its work as soon as the next chamber comes into line the hook finds a notch in the skirt and is disengaged and the helical spring forces the cylinder forward again hervey smiled it was very ingenious indeed so ingenious that he almost forgot about the actual initiation of the charges now that much i am assured of mr collier but how are the chambers fired let me demonstrate sir said the american taking back the arm it is if i may say so myself a particularly tidy method each time the pancover is shut down for discharge this ratchet and pawl here puts successive deposits of priming powder into the flash pan by turning a feed plug you cant quite see it with the arm assembled sir at the bottom of the steel hervey shook his head and smiled in admiration again may i fire it myself why of course captain hervey let my assistant load the chambers first and fill the priming magazine and then you shall put the spring under tension and fire at will colliers assistant handed hervey the loaded arm and asked if he wished the roundel to be replaced hervey replied that this should not be necessary since they were sure that there were seven hits there already shall i fit the butt to it sir so that you may fire it as carbine asked collier holding up the extension no thank you i should like to feel its balance as a pistol for the barrel is uncommonly long do i presume it is rifled indeed it is with nine lands that is what gives it its accuracy i wager i could have placed five marks on that roundel at twice the distance hervey was surprised by the ease with which he could hold the aim for the barrel was in excess of two feet he squeezed the trigger the gun jumped back in his hand more than would the service pistol but it was not excessive he cocked again close the pan sir prompted collier hervey fired again there was not as much smoke as he expected and he saw at once that the second round had struck the target too on the outer ring again he adjusted his aim and repeated the action and then a fourth and a fifth time it was extraordinarily handy he could scarce believe it the sixth and seventh rounds he fired with equal address how perfect the weapon would be were it percussionfired as his own special carbine was what odds then might a dragoon accept you are much impressed with it yes captain hervey asked collier yes yes indeed but i must admit to one doubt however and that is the hardiness of the mechanism as a whole for campaign service i mean i have doubts that it would stand up to a dragoons rough handling and might it not be susceptible to dirt causing the rotation to jam colliers response was eager when clean and with a little oil on the working parts there is no reason for it to do so though i concur that to allow a great ingress of dirt would be to risk such an outcome i have fired fortytwo rounds in rapid succession pausing only to reload the cylinder without interruption hervey was to some extent reassured but there was no doubting the danger in having a weapon which might fail in the exigencies of campaign service damp powder was a bad enough risk already with the service flintlocks but you must not accept my word alone for it sir i would be most honoured if you would take the arm for a months trial and at the end of that period i would beg the favour of your recommending it if you were to feel inclined as im sure you shall to the duke of wellington so here at last was colliers purpose revealed but no matter thought hervey if the weapon were to prove as capable as it now seemed then he would have every wish to recommend it yes he replied i should be most happy indeed though i must tell you that i am no longer on the dukes staff neither might my opinion be of any moment with him i am content with that sir i would send it myself to the ordnance but i believe it would be the better for having an advocate hervey was enjoying his celebrity very well mr collier we shall see how it fares on salisbury plain next day hervey woke early though the curtains were fullclosed he could see it was not yet light although there was already a noise of carting in the street he thought to light a candle to see the time but with a sick feeling he recalled that he no longer had a watch he had ordered tea and shaving water to be brought at a quarter to seven and a bath at a quarter past so there seemed no great need for him to do anything but enjoy the remaining repose such as might be with the noise of the carting traffic and the chorus of birdsong growing by the minute dominated as the latter was by the far from melodious starlings he lay musing at how queer it was that so unbecoming a bird should have so pretty an egg what had happened to his collection of them he wondered he had amassed so many in horningsham before going to shrewsbury there were only two more days to the ides now such a time it would be in wiltshire for natural history the woodpigeons would have begun their soaring and their clapping and diving there would be redwings and fieldfares getting ready to go north again after winter and very soon perhaps already they would be replaced by sand martins come from africa these would be feeding high still above the wylye and the lake at longleat before returning to the crags to dig out last years nest holes might he get home in time to see the first swallows the beginning of april was their habitual season how dull might seem the village plumage after india though those garden birds would even now be courting a mate and threatening their rivals for tomorrow was a full month after st valentines day it was the better part of two years since his own affiancing and he had not been able to make even one valentine gift to henrietta since his arriving in paris on the second of the month where the duke had given him leave to proceed home he had sent three expresses to horningsham or rather one to horningsham and three to longleat the most recent only this last evening but he had had none by return there again he had perforce changed his quarters so frequently and without notice that none could have found him and in this latest express he had been able to say only that he fervently hoped to be in wiltshire soon and depending only on the earl of sussexs pleasure not that he truly expected a significant delay beyond that what could he do but trust in henriettas patience and say his prayers and think of her over and over again think of when they had enjoyed the woods and meadows of longleat first in childish innocence and then in faltering courtship she had teased him when a child and tormented him when fullgrown horningsham was henrietta as much as it was his family meanwhile the morning was fast advancing his bath had not been as warm as he had hoped and the fire for which he had tipped one of the clubs servants handsomely to have banked up was more smoke than flame and certainly very little heat perhaps it was not really so chill but his blood was still accustomed to the warmth of madras and a fresh march morning in london was not to be underestimated he had shivered more than once but a breakfast of kidneys and eggs and toasted bread and coffee exemplary hot had set him to rights and he left for albany feeling comfortable enough without a surtout the earl of sussex received him promptly my dear captain hervey i am very glad we are met at last he said holding out his hand and despite his years and a leg which a musket ball at the helder had rendered half useless closing briskly with him sit you down sir sit you down a footman placed a chair adjacent to the earls and hervey did as he was bid i generally have sherbet at this time my digestion is not what it was but yours i should imagine is plenty robustious would you care for madeira hervey most certainly did it was a taste to which he had become happily accustomed in captain petos company to and from the indies i am very glad you are come this morning you will not have heard of huntingdons son killed in the streets yesterday with the regiment trying to quell a riot it has saddened me more than i can say i did know colonel indeed i saw the riot he thought it of no purpose to add that he had gone to guys hospital that evening too shall you stay to luncheon and tell me of it said the earl with evident sadness young wymondham was my godson hervey accepted readily it was a handsome invitation even with so sorrowful a purpose let us postpone talk of it until then and stay instead with pleasanter thoughts the earl suggested we have not met before and i much regret it but it is not perhaps so curious these last tumultuous years and all i do though make it a rule to receive my officers on gazetting in fact before they are gazetted preferably indeed your lordship it is well known the earl of sussex was an assiduous colonel in this respect as every other only the exigencies of war had distanced him from his beloved sixth i remember your nomination for a cornetcy well by pembrokes hand no little recommendation that if i remember rightly he said words to the effect that he did not think wilton house had ever had a better pupil hervey felt himself redden lord pembroke was very kind sir he allowed me much time in the company of his riding master foreign i suppose yes sir austrian hervey smiled noting the sigh in sussexs question now when did that occur the cornetcy i mean eighteen hundred and eight sir i was but seventeen the earl took a sip of his sherbet so you were at corunna i was sir did you see anything of moore oh yes sir he was everywhere so i heard tell i wonder if wellington would have got the army had he lived it was a question posed often enough but not one hervey felt able to address in his circumstances i saw rather more of general crauford sir for we were with his division some of the way through the astorgias black bob and was he as fearsome as his name i think his men were more terrified of him than of the french the officers especially the earl of sussex seemed to be deep in thought and then you were at ciudad rodrigo and saw the lines of torres vedras hervey nodded this much was what all of them in the sixth had seen and then at albura and you greatly distinguished yourself at salamanca hervey proud to be so recognized and by the colonel whom he had never before met was nonetheless discomfited by the approbation but the earl of sussex had not finished and you showed great dash and no little resolve at vitoria at toulouse you were commended for your action by the duke of wellington himself and you crown all these at waterloo with plaudits from lord uxbridge captain hervey this is a record to be proud of thank you sir hervey replied wondering how the earl had been able to recall what were in any scheme of things trifling affairs and then there was ireland the word came as a cold douche hervey swallowed and opened his mouth to speak but before he could the earl of sussex raised a hand there is nothing for you to say on the matter for i have it in every detail from lord george irvine sir i captain hervey there really is nothing for you to explain and let me say this to you the courage you displayed so many times in the field is that which i should expect every officer of mine to demonstrate given the requirement and the address with which you have dealt with matters of tactics is that which i would hope for in those same officers though it is not given to all to be capable of exercising such percipient judgement hervey felt somewhat at ease again there seemed to be an agreeable purpose in the earls words and he wondered what it might be but the course you followed in ireland was an instance of rare valour i have known many brave men men who have defied shot and shell to go at the enemy when all seemed lost who have seemed incapable of standing up for what they believed was the right course in the comfort and safety of an office indeed they had rather face certain death than confront a superior with an unpalatable truth believe me captain hervey such courage exercised soundly is a diamond of considerable worth thank you sir said hervey it seemed quite evident now that the earl of sussex was not merely receiving him with the usual formularies and he felt himself greatly flattered all of which brings me to the ultimate purpose of my asking you to call this morning said the earl signalling his footman to withdraw have you had any communication from the horse guards in the last twentyfour hours i had to call on the duke of yorks military secretary yesterday forenoon sir but since then then you do not know that you have been given a brevet hervey had been promised a captains brevet before india it seemed strange that lord sussex should have heard of it only now i mean a majority hervey the brevets committee approved it yesterday hervey was dumbstruck not only did he not know of it he would never have thought it possible since by his reckoning his substantive rank was lieutenant and promotion to field rank required at least one year in the lower rank to qualify have not your agents informed you the earl persisted you have been gazetted captain for almost eighteen months no sir in truth i have not yet been to see them well then make sure that when you do you collect what must be healthy arrears of pay the earl of sussexs eyes were kind and the lines on his brow and about his mouth curved upwards so that when he smiled as he did now his whole face was a beacon of his pleasure why yes sir indeed hervey was almost lost in reflecting the smile but he managed to keep a hard head for the particulars my first enquiry though shall be what vacancy there is in the regiment but i confess that i am more than a little confused by what this brevet may mean with regards to it in that i may certainly be of help by now the earl was positively beaming let me explain a little of what has transpired on this account hervey was intrigued it was a nearrun thing im told the earl took another sip of his sherbet but you shouldnt let that dull the satisfaction of the brevet it seems you had some strong supporters in that assembly of major generals once theyd heard your record hervey felt intensely gratified a superiors approval was every soldiers pleasure particularly it seems sir horace shawcross a splendid man as bluff as harry hes to go to india and hes asked for you to be his deputy adjutant general what say you to that sir i i am conscious of the high honour the general does me but but i had very much set my heart on a troop lord sussex smiled again this time almost paternally you dont know how glad i am to hear you say that hervey its not every man that would turn down advancement and valuable patronage to be at regimental duty and you shall not be disadvantaged by it i promise you ill explain he settled back into his chair as if the explanation was to be a long one great heavens how it shall give me pleasure lord george irvine as you may know relinquished command on promotion about a year ago he has the east coast district hervey confirmed that he had recently learned of it there was no major in the sixth who could replace him lord sussex continued for of the four on the regimental list escrick had been on halfpay for innumerable years and was not inclined to leave his estates and nor am i sure he would have been entirely suitable nasmyth would have been unable to find the purchase his interests on the baltic exchange were cruelly ruined by the blockade sir digby willesey is frankly too old and infirm he must spend half the year at least by the sea and joynson is hopelessly illfitted for command though by all accounts he is an able administrator hervey was astonished by the candour but held his peace nonetheless the agents had received bids of up to twentyfive thousands the regulations forbid it i know but since the overprice would go indirectly to the widows fund i was of a mind to nod to it twentyfive thousands hervey was speechless it was not only a prodigious sum but four times the regulation price what chance might he ever have of commanding the sixth by purchase i had hoped of course that joseph edmonds would have command but the prices have grown so much of late throughout the cavalry that even had he lived i doubt he would have had the means having known something of the edmonds situation in the settling of the late majors estate hervey had no doubt that he could never have afforded it it was doubtful that the majors means had been any greater even than his own peace had an odd price he rued the earl of towcester bid the highest and indicated to me that he wished to make a generous investment especially in horses and given the hard service the regiment had seen i thought it welcome towcester has been on halfpay more years than i should have cared for but he seemed anxious to return to the line all this i discussed with lord george of course it was curious to say the least to be taken into the colonels confidence so and hervey evidently showed it oh come now captain hervey it will be no earthly good if you do not know what has been our reason lord sussex then seemed to hesitate before pressing to an observation that intrigued hervey even more i am of a mind that towcester will wish to sell in but a year or so and at that point i should not wish to bring in another extract hervey thought it would be highly improper to make any enquiry as to why lord towcester would sell out though he could applaud the sentiment concerning an extract but was it a realistic one when there was no major to succeed i have discussed this particular with lord george at great length too and he and i are wholly in accord you shall have command hervey herveys mouth fell open sir i how the earl of sussex was smiling broadly again much satisfied with the effect a step at a time your brevet was the first one and i am very pleased to say that our efforts in that direction were successful you will be aware that the regulations require that you complete twelve months service on the active list in the rank of major before you may be promoted lieutenant colonel hervey knew the regulations well enough and then there would be the matter of the purchase price just so sir hervey saw no cause to waste the colonels time in this respect i have not the means to raise a fraction of that price yes i know as much if you were to find yourself somehow in possession of that sum would you be desirous of the command there was not the slightest hesitation of course sir then let us trust that you shall find it or and it would not be fitting that we speak of particulars that the means shall otherwise be found i hope i make my meaning clear hervey nodded make no mistake captain hervey i am determined that you shall have the regiment ere next year is out which means as you very well know that you must receive your recommendation for promotion to lieutenant colonel at the end of one years service as brevet major dyou think you might manage that it was the fulfilment of any officers ambition and the means by which he could now with assurance present himself to henrietta and her guardian as a man with prospects hervey felt taller by several inches even as they spoke i shall do so to the very best of my ability colonel and then he seemed to have doubts or rather he thought he ought to have doubts your lordship does not then consider that i have not the years great heavens no said the earl frowning and shaking his head as i recall wellington had the thirtythird in holland when he was not five and twenty didnt do him or them much harm the comparison astounded him as perhaps it was meant to for the earl of sussex wanted no dissent now i may tell you at present in the regiment there is a captains vacancy two indeed and i have instructed the agents that one is to be yours your brevet remains extraregimental of course you shall be captain hervey with your troop only remember this the brevet is the means by which you shall have accelerated advance to lieutenant colonel your commanding officer is the means by which you will have the recommendation and thereby the promotion i trust i make myself clear again hervey one year one year you can manage that cant you oh yes sir said hervey emphatically i believe i may assure you that you need have no fears on that account then come and share my table said lord sussex rising and beckoning hervey with boyish delight i dont think i could wish for more agreeable company chapter three returns horningsham ten days later i blame mr keble declared herveys mother roundly never would your father have carried on so if he had not filled his head with such notions elizabeth hervey glanced across the breakfast table at her brother with a look that requested sympathy for having to listen again to the vicar of horningshams wife on the subject and now we shall all be dispossessed of the living for your father will not be persuaded to moderate his habits and who then shall give him any other for there isnt a patron who would be disposed to a parson who had been so recalcitrant no no we shall be forced to throw ourselves on the charity of your aunt spencer though heaven knows they could ill afford to have us in the deanery for hereford will be thick as thieves with sarum mark my words hervey tried to avoid his mothers eye by gazing through the window on the pretence of distraction by two combative jays he had used the same stratagem many times before in that small but comfortable dining room since the death of his elder brother he had shifted one place to the left at table so that he sat directly adjacent to his father now a little further from his mother and offset from elizabeth whose place had not moved in the reordering of things but otherwise it seemed to him that nothing had changed since his earliest recollection of that room except that his mother now wore a lace cap and was a little fuller and his sister no longer had her ringlets more was the pity hervey considered for elizabeths ringlets had given her a pertness which nicely offset a sometimes overearnest disposition do not be too downcast mama we might always carry the gospel abroad to matthews india perhaps elizabeths attempt at levity misconstrued perhaps did not find favour with her mother who scowled back disapprovingly her brother now sallied to her rescue though with equally unhappy results mama the bishop cannot dispossess father from the living not without recourse to law surely and lord bath would never have that elizabeth regretfully explained their mothers gesture of hopelessness lord baths is not the advowson horningsham is a diocesan peculiar since his return some days ago the subject had been put to one side in the general rejoicing only now the day of his fathers summons to the palace at salisbury was an open discussion entered on what exactly are the bishops objections mama asked hervey he surely cannot mind a little variation we are hardly a parish that many take note of oh it is not the bishop himself who does this said mrs hervey waving her knife dismissively it is his archdeacon we have all had excess of his zeal these past twelve months since his institution hervey could not have known of the new appointment nor indeed would it have been of any moment to him were it not for the mischief it was making now very well then mama what are the archdeacons objections that the choir is put in surplices is that all hervey was bemused the choir has been surpliced since i myself was in it and your father has taken to preaching in his instead of a genevan gown hervey was even more astonished at the insignificance of the offence there is a little more to it than that is there not mama suggested elizabeth carefully oh i do not suppose they will let him off lightly therell be other objections ill be bound elizabeth raised her eyebrows the merest touch but her brother was already alerted to the point what might these other objections be he asked elizabeth glanced at her mother to see if she wished to take up the question herself but mrs hervey evidently did not he has taken to celebrating the lords supper during the week but that is scarcely offensive to the bishop is it father is anyway obliged by rubric to say morning and evening prayer to what can there be objection in adding the communion the prayer book forbids the celebration of communion privately said his mother with another heavy sigh but on this all may not be lost said elizabeth with a breeziness intended to lift her mothers rapidly flagging spirits for we might yet find sufficient parishioners to attend at least until the fire has died down suggested hervey quite elizabeth frowned if only he would not be so romish as the archdeacon calls it when he celebrates romish how so hervey was finally alerted to the true seriousness of his fathers situation elizabeth looked anxiously at her mother who purposefully turned her gaze to the window he places candles on the communion table and stands eastwards with his back to the congregation that is though there isnt one smiled hervey but he knew it was a practice as well as the candles that would bring strife is any of this of a sunday too no only the surplice for his sermon that much is as well opined mrs hervey though if he speaks any more with mr keble heaven knows where it will all end mama protested elizabeth you cannot blame mr keble father has held these opinions for many years before he visited with us you may as well blame the jesuit at wardour for father has dined with him many more times than he has ever spoken with mr keble it was well known in the village and therefore in the diocese that the reverend thomas hervey had for many years enjoyed monthly conversation with father hazelwood it was even supposed by some that these were occasions for auricular confession and yet this had never given offence as far as the family was aware for such was mr herveys genuine piety and devotion to his parish it was true that he had some years ago written a monograph on the life of archbishop laud but since it remained unpublished its support for laudian excesses could only be imagined well we may say goodbye to all hopes of preferment at any rate complained mrs hervey we shall not see even a canon residentiary now and with that she rose and left the room elizabeth knew that her father had long considered himself past all preferment but she was also aware that her mother still entertained some hope of easeful retirement in a cathedral close and it had occurred to her more than once that her own life might take a more lively turn were she to be translated thus and much as hervey would have been loath to quit the place in which he had been born he too had hoped that his father might see out his days in such comfort for there was little enough prospect that the modest family annuity would allow him to do so it appeared that john keble had visited twice while he had been away and elizabeth had been to his priesting at trinitytide the year before hervey imagined that to his father the young clergyman was a remembrance of his elder son hervey had also imagined some attachment forming with elizabeth for in john kebles letter to him a most welcome poste restante in paris there was mention of quitting oxford and therefore its rule of celibacy for his curacy in the cotswolds but it was evidently not so devoted to her father though elizabeth was there were evangelical sentiments in her which might in any case militate against such an alliance she read hannah more copiously and had only recently declined a position out of clapham with the society for returning young women to their friends in the country not out of any qualmishness but from a conviction that her father and mother had need of her with their mother gone hervey thought he might change the subject how are your good works in the town elizabeth never in all our years at horningsham has there been such distress answered his sister solemnly the marquess has set in place a system of relief but it does not extend beyond the estate and so many were the calls on the parish last year that funds were exhausted before harvest time warminster common is become more than ever a refuge for beggars and every kind of felon hervey could easily believe it at the time of his going to the sixth it was known to be a fencingcrib for the three counties gangs now maraud from there they take the game sometimes quite openly at longleat daniel coates sat three times each week with the other magistrates last month and still there is no end to the lawlessness father will not allow me to visit though and how should your being allowed to visit the common prevent this her brother frowned sceptically i do not for one minute think that it would my concern is for the children who are being raised in that depravity and daniel coates believes there should be a mission there too elizabeth knew this recommendation would turn her brothers opinion i shall see daniel this morning hes coming to look over jessye do you know he is the owner of three brewing houses now which keep his bench well supplied with miscreants of a monday no doubt joked hervey elizabeth returned his smile for she was not so much an evangelical as to be an advocate of temperance hervey was pleased for with a smile her face became pretty and he still entertained hopes of a husband in regimentals rather than clericals he is the only farmer hereabouts who has managed to keep all his labourers in work these past two years elizabeth said it with real pride as if coates were family he has not dismissed a single one indeed he has even engaged some of the wretched imber shepherds so much in need of relief were they well ill be very much interested to learn how he has been able replied her brother for everything i read is of depression in that business she frowned its an ill thought that with peace there comes a fall in demand for the countys wool i hope we shall never come to be thankful for war as the means of providing for our working men let us hope not he agreed though i should sooner see sturdy men in a red coat with the colours that is than have them without work there are men in scarlet begging along every road from here to london i can believe it for there are several in warminster and a sorry sight it is too they would at least be provided for in the army and they would be under discipline i confess i am sometimes a little afraid of them in the town now and that was never so before she poured him more tea and then for herself by the by matthew do not take against mr keble for this business of fathers i truly believe there is not any guilt attached to him in this if guilt indeed be the right notion no sighed hervey i dont suppose i should have been inclined to think mr keble guilty how is he elizabeth frowned again i think he is well though his eldest sister suffers ill health still you did know did you not that a younger one died of consumption hervey did not he had written to keble from london but a fortnight ago he hoped the letter did not intrude on any grief when did this happen two summers past the time in fact that he stayed here that was a mercy in its way thought hervey though he had written to him several times from ireland unconscious of his grief i had no way of knowing when i wrote to him later and he said nothing by return then he will presume you still do not know i shall write to him at once i should very much like to see him again the younger towle girl elevated to parlourmaid since last hervey had been home came with the news that mrs pomeroy was returned the household would no longer be reliant on extemporary measures in the kitchen therefore well matthew shall you join us for a proper dinner this evening asked elizabeth or do you expect to dine at longleat i really cannot say he said reddening a little i still dont know that henrietta will return today tomorrow is the more likely moreover he was by no means certain that henriettas return would bring an invitation to dine indeed nothing had discomposed him quite so much of late as the anxiety that his sweetheart might jilt him and now his fathers troubles with the bishop seemed to threaten his happiness even if she did not for if the reverend thomas hervey were dispossessed of the living then his son would be obliged to support the family with the very means he required to keep a wife hervey looked long at elizabeth as she gave hannah towle instructions might she not at least be able to set his mind at rest on the first question he had never been able to fathom the true extent of his sisters intimacy with henrietta the two being so different that he could not imagine on what basis their familiarity proceeded in truth he invariably underestimated their connection though it made little odds since asking his sister about his fortunes in love would have been entirely ignoble to him two years of absence suddenly seemed a long time if henrietta had changed then perhaps elizabeth had too herveys mother had told him that despite what she was sure had been the pressing attentions of three suitors of whom lord john howard had been one elizabeth showed no signs of accepting any offer of marriage he was sad of it for his leaving horningsham with henrietta would be to make a lonely woman of his sister now especially that their brother was dead and indeed if the business with the bishop went ill for their father who could tell what would become of the family did you hear what i said matthew he was brought rudely back to the present no er i i said that there is one about whom you have not yet asked he looked puzzled mrs strange i saw her yesterday she asks to be remembered to you he had not forgotten he had enquired of her of both his mother and father but their replies had not yielded much beyond the here and now i had a letter from her in india thanking me for the position you may never do horningsham a better favour the school thrives and her charges are devoted to her said elizabeth admiringly you may see her take them each afternoon on walks about the village the children learn so much of natural history that i should be ashamed myself to be put to the test i do believe she knows the name of every flower underfoot and before they walk they have spent three hours and more with the slate writing and numbers and all manner of things i have even seen her teaching geometry hervey was gratified by elizabeths enthusiasm and the obligations of worship dont trouble her henrietta shook her head with the same look of admiration she is more punctilious in her observance than any but the wardens and then afterwards she will go to her own chapel she is the finest of women you were very right and clever to see the opportunity in her bereavement has she formed any friendships do you know she has dined with us on more than one occasion but she keeps a distance in truth im sorry for it but i cannot but respect her wishes as for more intimate attachments i know that one of the farmers who attends her chapel has made her an offer but so far she has not been inclined to accept it has she spoken at all of her situation how her husband came to be killed yes hervey felt uneasy what exactly did she say she told me that you somehow felt you bore a responsibility for his death she said that i never told her so oh matthew sometimes i think you have not the slightest notion of what a woman can see why did you not tell me of it when you came home it was a fair question what was the purpose of close kin if not to share such doubts why did he suppose that just because the death of serjeant strange was on the field of battle a woman might have no understanding of the turmoils of conscience that followed and yet perhaps a woman could only see so much indeed a man who had not known the face of battle could only see a little he looked at elizabeth and saw a sensibility that could not and should not ever understand what the prospect of death in battle made of men sudden violent death by a hand that was in a frenzy to sever the spirit from its body that or else to make the body a cripple to impale on the bayonets point to stab or slash or cut with the blade to shatter with the muskets ball the rifles bullet or disembowel with the cannons shot how could he even look at elizabeth close as she was to their saviours commands as anyone could reasonably be and not feel he had quitted a part of her company for ever matthew he hesitated and then smiled we must allow that mrs strange is a perceptive woman then why dont we walk together this afternoon and we shall see her we might call on her even yes said her brother smiling still i should like that very much jessye lifted her head from the early shoots of spring pasture and looked at her master without a sound hervey had been watching from the gate of the old glebe meadow for a full five minutes before she saw him the mare was content at her ease somehow he supposed she must know that she was back in the place where first she had stretched her legs to a trot and then more all those years ago when was that all of twelve years before she had certainly seen and endured more than any village horse hereabouts ever had now as march went out like the lamb and before the summer swarms of flies had come up from the water meadows there was no pleasanter place on earth for her to be and thought hervey jessye deserved it after what she had been through only this last year she deserved it he had vowed months ago that never again would she have to attend the call of the trumpet let alone the bugle and now he was sure of it even though she was the best age for a charger beyond the worry of splints her bones being stronger with each year he would never find another like jessye for agility and bottom he told himself and perhaps even for honesty but if he cast her now from service she could take her ease without the broken wind and lameness that was the fate of many a trooper which had served too long she could sate herself on the wiltshire pasture instead of haphazard campaign fodder enjoying good timothy from the longleat hay meadows through the winter and fresh water from the chalk streams of the downs im going to put a stallion to her dan he announced daniel coates smiled now theres the mark of the man fullgrown hervey looked at him quizzically the snowwhite hair and weathered face deepgrooved and sundried spoke of age but for the rest there was nothing that revealed the passing of his many years such had been the reward as well as riches for coatess soldierly virtue and sober living ive observed it many times the urge to see a foal when a mans taken from a horse a little too much hervey made a sort of frown enough to acknowledge the sentiment do you have a stallion in mind hervey shook his head more an idea of the horse i want from the foal about jessyes height half a hand higher perhaps but no more and a bit more blood suggested coates nodding his head as if he could see the reasoning jessye not quite as fast as youd care she was never outrun in the field said hervey quickly as if to make amends for disloyalty in which case replied coates looking purposely bemused you want another jessye hervey smiled have you seen lord baths improvement stallion no ive not to tell you the truth dan ive called on the marquess but hes much occupied by affairs in parliament he went to london at the beginning of the week and i havent been to the house since when does henrietta come friday you said yes that is what the express said but derbyshire is some way distant and i dont suppose the roads at this time will have been much mended coates clapped an arm on his shoulder i would dare any odds that yon carriage will move like a fly coach besides that most of the turnpikesve been macadamized while youve been away in any case that young lady would ride astride if she thought she could be here the sooner hervey smiled again how can you be so sure coates was not sporting with him though i didnt tell did i she came to drove farm to ask me all i knew of the indies and how long i thought you might be gone when was this pressed hervey gratified yet surprised that henrietta could have shown so much eagerness just after she came back from france oh a great occasion it was a barouche with the bath arms in my drive hervey made a little oh of disappointment but that was the better part of two years ago matthew hervey sighed coates clapping his shoulder again i ave been on this earth long enough to recognize certain things when i see them and i may tell you the look in that yon ladys eyes was not going to go absent in the space of two years she made me promise to let her know the instant id any knowledge of you and she reminded me of it when last i saw her at the michaelmas rents hervey could have heard nothing so heartening michaelmas was only six months ago i gave the lodgekeeper a halfsovereign to let me know within a quarterhour of her carriage arriving by whichever gate if i was you id sit at the picket post myself from midmorning o friday said coates his smile as wry as if he were still the young dragoon hervey was stung dan dont suppose thats not my instinct too id be riding the fosse way this minute if i could be sure its how shed come but it would be indecent surely not to allow her a few moments to herself before receiving me to herveys further dismay coates laughed oh dont mistake me matthew i stand in admiration of such propriety its just that our worlds have been so different margaret tramped from one end of devon to the other when she got news that the regiment was back from america hervey had never known margaret coates but what he had heard over the years made the revelation less remarkable than it might have been nevertheless coatess point was well made and he envied the freedom for so ardent an advance dan i confess i know little about putting a mare in foal might you tell me coates was content enough to let them both return to simpler matters where do we begin matthew at the beginning laughed hervey with a look of mock despair when must i put the stallion to her and when shall she then foal by the end of may very well why because when you put the stallion to a mare depends on when you want her to foal a big coldblood one of the suffolks that ploughs the glebe say will carry a full year or even longer ponies and smaller types can be as short as forty weeks i reckon jessyed be in the middle somewhere say eleven months calendar months i mean you dont want her dropping her foal before the beginning of april the grassll be too poor for best milk and i like to see foals ave the sun on their backs for the first six months then may it shall be when i find the stallion will you tell me whats what i will but if you go for the marquesss improver then his stud groomll tell you all you need jessye looks in good fettle youll keep feeding her barley wont you there isnt enough goodness even in this pasture just yet indeed i shall shell be as round as a barrel soon ay well not too round i dont hold with that notion my ewes always carry better through the winter if i get them up to the rougher grazing by the end of july hervey nodded come over to drove farm soon you can help with the late lambs and you can tell me some more about what you got up to in india and this brevet and i shall call you major hervey smiled how congenial was the pleasure daniel coates took in his young friends triumphs id like that very much just as soon as henrietta is come and i am back from hounslow it should only be a day or so but i must pay my compliments to the colonel of course you must what a thought it must be to be seeing a regiment youll soon command colonel hervey what a fair prospect there are one or two bridges to cross first dan said hervey with a cautionary frown and i am not to use even the majority while at duty with the regiment ay well ill say not a word to anybody you may be sure of it coates began to dig out his pipe hervey still saw the man who had first helped him astride the woolpack before even the old donkey was considered a safe enough ride his old friend bore the signs of his years that was a fact but not in the mind for sure at length the old dragoon spat and rubbed his forehead with his sleeve did i tell you i saw bonaparte he asked matter of fact hervey was astonished bonaparte ay the emperor himself how in heavens name in torbay just after you was gone to paris he was aboard the bellerophon now theres a ship matthew they held im there a week or so while they decided what best to do with im when i heard i posted down there at once prospect of a lifetime indeed i never saw him not ever there were boat trips out to see im by the score he used to come on deck well hell not trouble us again in this world said hervey resolutely no said coates nodding we should be able to count on a few years peace at least and then he smiled again where do you think colonel hervey shall draw his sabre then goodness how becoming that title sounded hervey positively glowed well nowhere this side of the world thats for sure coates nodded india dye mean i wish id seen india just pray its not ireland youre sent to hervey simply raised an eyebrow ireland had all but undone him two years before and he had no wish to see the country again not even for the hunting and the good friends he had made there no said coates its no job for a soldier is ireland no good for him ever comes of it that sort of work but we shall have the same troubles here soon the way things are going half the countrys been in riot or distress this past year ive never known things so bowstringtaut hervey disclosed his experience of the cashman hanging the spa fields business coates nodded knowingly that orator hunt as whips up the crowds farms over the plain at upavon ive known im years at first he was just a nuisance now hes a danger true enough but it was too fine a morning to be speaking of such things then hervey suddenly remembered dan i cant think how ive not told you before i have a repeating carbine to show you coates whistled now that is something youre sure it repeats though it doesnt just carry more charges ive seen some cutcha affairs in my time as your indians would say believe me dan this is a repeater right enough i watched it put seven balls into a target in quick succession and then put in another seven myself then this i really do want to see will you bring it over soon just as soon as im back from hounslow a week at most now come and see my mother she is sorely in need of cheer this morning it was a quarter after noon the next day when hervey got word that henrietta had arrived at longleat the hour presented a problem since he supposed the family would be at their table he could scarcely intrude without an invitation but daniel coatess admonition stung him still and he was soon hurrying to the stable for his fathers cob between the two of them abel towle and he had jessyes dam under saddle quicker than a dragoon at alarm and hervey was kicking on even as his fathers man was trying to pull the straw from her tail but slow ever so slow was the old mare hervey hadnt the heart to demand a trot when she refused his asking even though the road was downhill for most of the way and the last mile nothing but from the gatehouse on grass grazed short and springy by lord baths blackfaces she did manage a stumbling jog though still he rued no more than a doubling pace for even a battalion company a light company would have shown him their heels for certain at last he was at the steps of the great house one oclock he had walked it quicker many a time and still arrived with not a bead of sweat but this time his agitation was not from exertion here was the strange tightness in his vitals again the analogue of peril a gauge which showed that destruction was at hand unless he took immediate action but what was he to do what control over events might he seize henriettas was surely the initiative not his nothing he said now no matter how ardent or profound would change her heart if it were against him for fickle she had never been he had in his pocket the necklace that the rajah of chintal had pressed upon him a favourite the rajah had explained of his late wife it seemed so much a bauble now when he thought of how he had abandoned henrietta could there be any other word first in london then in france and yet surely if she were so vexed with him so vexed that their engagement was already broken for her part she would have sent word that she would not receive him he rallied a little but then relapsed as quickly at the thought that she might merely wish to vent her anger on him he pulled the bell loop soon he would know the worst longleat park had been at the centre of his thoughts one way or another since first he was conscious of them he heard the sheep on the hill and the rooks in the hanger would he be allowed to hear them ever again the door opened it was not a footman but the housekeeper who bid him enter with a friendly good afternoon captain hervey sir the smile encouraged him and he smiled in return mrs cousens i am very glad to be returned is lady henrietta at home she is came another voice from the great staircase for all the times matthew hervey had been in want of words never had he greater want than now he could find nothing to utter but oh it sounded first like surprise dismay even but henrietta was smiling a warm generous open smile for she had taken his oh to be rapture though she stood above him on the stairs she still contrived that doelike look which had greeted him on his first return from france the dark pools that were her eyes half raised to him half turned from him and there was a blush to her cheeks that no rouge had made he rushed to her eagerly and they embraced with all the ease of seasoned lovers kissing full and long exchanging endearments with a happy passion telling each other without words that all was now right and would never again be otherwise i watched for you coming henrietta laughed shaking her head you have no idea how my heart leapt when i saw you ride through the arch i wanted to run to greet you but you made your way so slowly i feared the worst my fathers cob hervey began then said no more for they kissed again the family being away the lovers were able to enjoy a cold table together each admitting to a curiously strong appetite afterwards they walked to the hanger and on to heavens gate the place from which best to admire the houses fine proportions and gardens they had done so many a time before but never alone they sat on the same seat they had known since the schoolroom and hervey had never felt himself so content henrietta took off her hat pushed her head back so that her face was full to the spring sunshine and closed her eyes the rajahs necklace sat sensually about her neck its emeralds and rubies so at home in the palace at chintalpore seemed the image of decadence in the wiltshire countryside but henrietta revelled in the opulence and hervey loved her for it perhaps it was her look of contentment that made him suddenly anxious again a part of that contentment was surely her attachment to the place in which she had lived so happily and comfortably since her infant days something of this communicated itself to henrietta my dearest what is the matter hervey measured his words you love this house do you not she answered at once why yes there has never been a place so dear to me herveys look partly revealed his concern but that is not to say there wont be in the future she smiled shaking her head a little things are different now that was not quite what hed meant however have you heard the trouble that my father has with his bishop she put a hand on his and squeezed it reassuringly tell me what news he was summoned to the palace yesterday the bishop kindly says my father told him that he must observe strictly the rubrics of the prayer book or that he might have to answer to the consistory court and what shall he do i dont know for i am not sure how dearly he holds his convictions at worst though he might be deprived of the living and though he says his annuity is sufficient for the family i dont believe it to be so in which case it will be my duty to support them henrietta nodded her understanding and sympathy evidently the full implications were escaping her thought hervey he made a despondent gesture with his hand nodding in the direction of the house my dear i have better prospects now within the regiment but even so how might i matthew dearest henrietta squeezed his hand that is of no matter to me none at all but matthew i do have a little money of my own the extent of henrietta lindsays fortune had never been the subject of speculation within herveys hearing he knew her people to have been from the borders and that somehow their estates had become derelict so that they had come south just after she had been born and that soon afterwards both her parents had died and distant kinship had brought her to longleat to be the marquesss ward more than that he did not know it is hardly a good beginning she smiled matthew if fortune hunter you be there can scarcely have been a less determined one he blushed deeply at the memory of his early hesitancy now he knew that he would have done with it once and for all when shall we be married she was only momentarily taken aback the first of may hervey seemed a little surprised at the exactness as soon as i knew you were come back i made a beginning i see he said smiling back with no little admiration could it not be the week before though no matthew im afraid it could not the first of may is a regimental review it wouldnt be easy for people to get down are plans so very far advanced i did so want a may wedding as princess charlotte had he understood that female desire might the nuptials be later then heaven knows he had no wish himself for delay but well she said solemnly we have to have a good moon or else the carriages will never make the lanes safely that was reasonable hervey acknowledged but there would be another good moon towards the months end no matthew that will not do said henrietta most emphatically and more than a little flushed do not have me spell it out there are some things over which i can have no influence they looked at each other she was not going to turn away whatever her instincts then it began to dawn on hervey and he became as red as the sky would later be he put his arms around her again it was an embrace with a new intimacy for they had crossed a threshold if only in the mind and so what do you think of the arrangements for your wedding matthew said elizabeth as they waited for the family carriage to take them to dine at longleat that evening his arriving home late with the invitation had caused her no little confusion her tone intrigued him why do you say that elizabeth smiled wryly but said nothing do you know of them then of course i know of them do you not think that henrietta might have wished to discuss them and you were not here to listen and so for a week elizabeth had had it in her power to set his mind at ease if only she had had any cause to think it necessary why in gods name had he not asked her hervey rued what do you think of the notion of a wedding in longleat house she pressed you are surely very flattered by it oh indeed it is a very elegant notion he agreed readily it was true that he had thought little before if at all about the ceremonies themselves supposing they would be conducted in the usual way in his fathers church at horningsham or if canon law required it at longbridge deverill for in that parish strictly lay the great house henrietta has thought of nothing else since princess charlottes wedding elizabeth explained yes said hervey pensively i read something of it in madras prince leopold of saxony henrietta was a maid of honour to the queen hervey was impressed she would be the first to tell you there were eleven more a dozen virgins in days not too far gone the reward for saving a royal elephant he recalled how distant chintal now seemed he smiled oh you must not joke of it matthew elizabeth warned henrietta is very devoted to the princess i did not know she even knew the princess i dont think she does not well that is but i should say that her affection for her is very great hervey nodded content that is why she is so especially enamoured of a may wedding as princess charlottes was and why she is so intent on its being in longleat house for the royal ceremony took place in the prince regents palace what in carlton house have you been there asked elizabeth with just a hint of awe he laughed heavens no but the talk in london was all of how racy that place is neros hotel they call it hardly the place for solemn nuptials i shouldve thought elizabeth looked a little shaken but henrietta was there and speaks of how graceful an occasion it was fifty or more sat down to dinner beforehand beforehand apparently hervey pulled a face suggesting he found the idea curious and then the ceremony itself was in the crimson drawing room crimson said hervey teasing that must be very close to scarlet elizabeth screwed up her face too exactly as she always had there was not so much hannah more in elizabeth that she could not smile at the ribald mystery babylon the great you had better go no further he admonished with mock sternness chapter four first parade hounslow three days later the cavalry barracks at hounslow had not been sparingly built especially not the high wall which surrounded the twenty acres of parade square stables and quarters hervey did not care for the look of the wall it reminded him of cork no doubt its purpose was to keep out intruders of whatever description as in ireland but this was england and who would want to intrude on a cavalry barracks walls confined and that went against the spirit of the sixth something rather nobler than bricks had kept the regiment together when times were a good deal more troubled entry was easily arranged however the picket corporal a man from d troop hervey didnt know but who recognized him pointed the way to regimental headquarters the mans uniform was as new nothing of the patches and fading they had all become used to by toulouse and which had scarcely been better by waterloo a reward from a grateful government it should have been sighed hervey to himself but likely as not it was from a rich commanding officer how good it was though one way or another to see the regiment back in proper fettle as he walked towards regimental headquarters soberly dressed in dark green with a black silk hat the band struck up on the far side of the square hervey had not heard them since ireland and then it had been a thin noise they made now they filled the barracks with a strong treble and bass alike the trumpeters tripletonguing was admirably sharp and the clarionets still something of a novelty were altogether less shrill than before he walked round the square to take a closer look there were three times the old number and all as immaculately uniformed as the picket corporal the four sable bandsmen brilliant in turkish silks the bandmaster was not old mr merryweather though this one was much more active and when he shouted to the bandsmen he was shouting a good deal it was with a heavy german accent picket turned out as if on review and a band forty strong with a german bandmaster hervey headed for the orderly room convinced he might be in a footguards barracks it was indeed an impression of efficiency that wholly belied the scene in skinner street the commanding officer received him unusually formally at orderly room hervey remained at attention waiting in vain for the invitation to sit you will find that much is changed captain hervey said the earl of towcester and with a note of challenge in his voice hervey thought it best to say nothing beyond very good colonel lord towcesters pale blue eyes were the coldest he had ever seen and his thin lips parted only a very little when he spoke just enough to allow the words to slide past with a distinct sneer the adjutant an extract from the second whom he had never met took a step forward the commanding officer is to be addressed as his lordship captain hervey the tone was of reprimand and doubly did hervey resent it for it was hardly a gentlemans way of correcting something so minor quite besides the fact that it had always been the sixths custom that all ranks called their commanding officer colonel he breathed deep as his lordship pleases very well hervey replied lord towcester looking up only momentarily i take note that you shall join for duty at the end of august and you are aware that your brevet rank is not recognized regimentally i am your lordship very well do you stay to luncheon yes sir then i shall see you in the mess at that time until then captain hervey hervey bowed the commanding officer rose and bowed stiffly by return and by the by captain hervey said the earl of towcester turning his back to look out of the window i had just better say that i want none of those indian ways in my regiment we are his majestys light dragoons not hindoo horse hervey was so taken aback by lord towcesters manner as well as his sentiment that he could say nothing yet say something he must for with the commanding officers back turned he could not now take his leave thank you for receiving me your lordship he managed at length he knew it needed a supplementary but he could think of nothing he might utter he left the orderly room dispirited there was a full hour to luncheon now he wished he were not staying and that thought made him the more dispirited for the shared table of the mess was a precious memory perhaps he ought to walk the lines but he was not in uniform and it might be awkward he looked at his new watch again a poor thing he mourned after jessopes hunter watering parade would be finished and the stables quiet before the midday feed first squadrons stables were indeed a restorative there might not have been the complete quality of the rajah of chintalpores establishment he could still remember his disbelief on seeing so much blood but the change here was every bit as striking as with the band every trooper looked as good as the chargers most officers were riding at the close of the peninsula even after a year in ireland when the regiment had been able to readopt troop colours they had only achieved uniformity at the cost of conformation and substance but now a troop had its bays again and b its blacks and he would find later e the smartest its chestnuts and they were lookers in the best sense and pleasing to see the sixth were still disdaining the regulations for the trumpeters mounts were greys but sadly the regulation was applied in the one thing he hated most every troopers tail was docked it was not just india that convinced him of the horses right to a flywhisk no officer in the sixth who had seen any appreciable service in the peninsula supported the practice hervey lifted a few tails none had been nicked thank heavens that was a device that had never taken hold in the regiment thanks largely to the earl of sussexs strictures compelled by a riding master of uncompromising discipline the horse sir will carry its tail just as soon as you allow him to work through his back the words rang in herveys ears and he remembered how they had stung him so when first he had joined first squadrons lines were peaceful there was the sound of haygrinding here and there as the odd trooper had a little to finish and here and there a jingling as a chain was pulled through its ring in the standing stalls there was the odd stamp of iron on cobble as a horse shifted its weight and the occasional snort and whicker but otherwise he might have been in a cloister this he told himself was what he was returning to not a peevish colonel the stables call summoned him from his musing as it did the dragoons to the horse lines better that he were elsewhere than in the bustle of hayingup feeding and watering to come so he walked briskly to the mess the place was as silent as the stables had been with a halfhour before the first officers might arrive earlier in the season the anteroom would have been full of those who had had a halfday with hounds not yet ready to take out a second charger to hear the huntsman blow home but this late on they would be out for a full day no doubt perhaps they would be few at luncheon hervey looked about the walls there were familiar pictures he had last seen in cork and some less so there was an exceptionally fine portrait of the earl of sussex in the uniform of colonel by the hand of sir thomas lawrence said an inscription but he couldnt find the girlish romney of princess caroline and he supposed it must be elsewhere in the headquarters perhaps the times of three days before lay open in a chair testimony to a recent perhaps hurried departure or to the stewards indolence there were copies of regimental orders in leather binders on a table together with the regimental list hervey picked up the latter and settled in a low chair to study it half the names he did not recognize the majors eustace joynson he did an able administrator i think the earl of sussex had said but hervey was as certain as the colonel had implied that joynson had no great instinct for the field where the actions of the enemy or even the mere chafing of events and the elements soon brought even welllaid plans to naught second squadron bore not a single officer he recognized its captain lord henry manners was one of the marquess of selbys sons that much was promising for the marquess had been a much regarded brigadier before a tirailleur had shot him down outside badajoz the other troop in the squadron was commanded by a captain addy and the subalterns were likewise unknown to him cornet the marquess wymondhams name was there with third troop still to be excised hervey sighed at the remembrance of the boys broken head resting in his hands in that gloomy alehouse third squadron was a mix strickland its captain and e troop leader he knew well enough strickland had bought in from the tenth just before waterloo and quickly won the confidence of the ranks for his cool head under the heaviest fire that day hervey was glad at least of one veteran of the sixth of irvine and edmonds and there was saint lawrence too the junior cornet at waterloo whom hervey had placed in charge of old chantonnay and his ravished daughters on the road to paris f troop black like b was as unfamiliar as d its captain hugh rose by reputation a buck had exchanged from the thirteenth when they were warned for india hervey didnt suppose he would see him much with london only a chariots gallop away but in what would be his own squadron first came the real surprise for there with b troop he read the name of ezra barrow barrow had been adjutant for half a dozen years or more brought in on commissioning from serjeantmajor by lord george irvine and so hervey supposed that his getting a troop must be field promotion rather than purchase yet how that had been he couldnt imagine for so rapidly were regiments being disbanded all but the first two twenties had gone that there could hardly be room for promotion without purchase in any event barrows was not the name he would have chosen for his second troop though it was at least one he knew and one that had known the regiment under irvine and edmonds the sixth hadnt had a troop leader from the ranks for a decade or more it was always tricky hed seen one or two in other regiments and good theyd been too but often as not it was the men themselves who disliked it most he wondered how the lieutenant colonel was taking to it but then he read one name that cheered him heartily seton canning now a lieutenant at waterloo seton canning had been his only officer by the time he had had to step into command of first squadron the boots had brought out first troop from the terrible mêlée after the greys had run on and with all the skill of an old hand though it had been his first time shotover good good thought hervey canning and armstrong a start at least how he had missed serjeant armstrongs straight talking and powerful sword arm in india how grand as armstrong himself would have said to see him again just as he was about to turn the page to study the quartermasters lists a noise in the entrance hall announced the arrival of the first for luncheon they were a dozen at table and a good table it was too thought hervey even for a high day which it was not plovers eggs turbot and a baron of somerset beef with hock and a chambertin the troop leaders were there less manners as well as a couple of new cornets there were two officers from the rifles guests of addy and the daag from the district headquarters but there were no quartermasters and no riding master no surgeon medical or veterinary nor paymaster perhaps thought hervey they were all at duty elsewhere but it still seemed strange hervey sat between joynson and strickland almost directly opposite lord towcester the lieutenant colonels manner was markedly different from that at orderly room hervey might have called it exuberant even yet although lord towcesters mouth smiled his eyes did not and there was an edge to his manner still which hervey could not quite fathom conversation seemed also less than free dictated more by the colonel than flowing naturally as he remembered it at its best might we have the cellars better found joynson said lord towcester frowning at the chambertin i can scarcely ask the prince regent to disturb his digestion with this it was well known to all at the table but hervey that the colonel was intent on entertaining the regent as soon as he might whatever your lordship wishes replied major joynson obligingly there was the beginning of a silence that hervey thought he might ease where is the portrait of princess caroline sir he asked joynson the major turned red the adjutant answered for him his lordship has ordered its removal hervey realized the danger too late for the mess had long held a truce on the matter until the end of the peninsula caroline had officially remained their colonelinchief unofficially they had been known as princess carolines own and there had remained an affection for her especially among the quartermasters and serjeants with many old hands able to recall her warm if sometimes indelicate manners during her visits there had been many an opinion in cork that the regent had illused the princess she is grown monstrous fat i hear said lord towcester abruptly hervey was taken aback and evidently visibly for ezra barrow shook his head at him warning him to let it go whats that barrow you know otherwise do you challenged towcester his face reddening and his eyes narrowing i know nothing of the princess your lordship replied captain barrow quickly except that it would be a pity if her royal highness were to tax her constitution as badly as does the regent the response did not please the commanding officer do you say that the prince regent is obese sir barrow remained more perfectly in control of matters than hervey would have supposed possible i do not say so your lordship one more opinion would scarcely be of any point when there are so many already on the matter the adjutant now joined the colloquy and piled the coals higher i hear tell she wore a gown so sheer in naples last month it was as if she wore none at all scarcely an alluring sight scoffed the colonel this was really most unbecoming thought hervey and his fault too for mentioning the picture she seduced murat there yknow continued the adjutant blithely and now shes living openly with a mussulman of all things the dey of algiers there was an anxious silence strickland broke it and she is happy as the dey is long it was a mercy for there was laughter all round indeed so keen was it that the chaplain must have laughed had he been there it even seemed to restore lord towcesters equilibrium call for the port someone he said taking a cigar from the box which the steward had brought nows as good a time as any to announce our good fortune gentlemen he beamed this autumn we are to furnish the escorts at brighton there was a general hubbub during which ezra barrow leaned across to hervey and shook his head again time for me to go this news i cant afford the expense of that place it aint soldiering the birmingham vowels were as strong as ever hervey wasnt so sure there was nothing like ceremonial to fill a regiment with pride except a famous victory he thought it no bad thing at all that the sixth be given this trial for it would take effort indeed to be fit for the regents eyes as well as for those of the population of brighton doubtless become expert during the past decade and what gentler way too to begin the married state than wintering by the english seaside lets take a walk after this is done he said to barrow but spirits were high about the table where is the betting book came a voice from the end a footman brought it to captain rose very well cornet finucane wagers mr seton canning the sum of five guineas that the measurement from stifle to hock of eclipse did not exceed twentyfour inches the wager provoked intense discussion all round and who is to adjudicate asked captain addy the hippogrammarian declared lord towcester blowing a great deal of smoke across the table one of his horsebutcher friends dissected the animal if im not mistaken there was appreciative laughter hervey felt himself back in the sixth he knew a place of raucous even at times tasteless good humour as well as of cultivation there were always ups and downs better then to dwell only on the happy side perhaps things were more promising than hed imagined it was past three before they were able to break away from the commanding officers court and so hervey and barrow had to content themselves with a stroll around the manège yard instead of outside the walls barrow was the longestserving of the sixths mess after joynson and hervey coming from the royals with lord george irvine after corunna he had never endeared himself to the regiments officers in the way that his patron had being as short on ceremony as he was long in experience nevertheless he had been respected as a diligent and efficient adjutant he was a man of the midlands the industrial midlands perhaps the only one in the regiment and he had never quite seemed one of the sixth before but now hervey was more than happy to walk with him as a comradeinarms after all they had first borne the battles heat together as well as the suns at salamanca almost five years before things have changed hervey the army never changes so joseph edmonds used to say i didnt say the armys changed things have the regiments not the same hervey had little enough cause to be enamoured of the new commanding officer after the business in the orderly room but he had no wish to become further depressed by barrows spirits at the very time he was returning to all he loved best there are bound to be some differences with a new colonel i have to say the regiments looking smarter than ive seen it in many a year oh that i grant you and id be the first to own wed grown ragarsed even in ireland but its not the only thing you dont have efficiency solely through smartness and the horses are better than ive ever seen them too added hervey still unwilling to share barrows discouragement that i grant you well what is it then the ncos do their duty as before do they not barrow furrowed his brow hervey knew that an exadjutant was perforce a professional sceptic when it came to subordinates and the performance of their duty do not tell me mr lincoln hasnt things right in that direction thereve been some queer promotions barrow declared ive always believed as long service should be rewarded but only when accompanied by merit some of the troops are sorely illserved in my view at the last board mr lincoln was not even allowed to sit in hervey recognized the integrity of the opinion for the rsm not to have a say in promotions was strange indeed why was that dye think barrow shrugged his shoulders i dont know i just dont know no notion at all well barrow sighed heavily i do have a notion and that is that lord towcester does not see the necessity of leavening seniority with aptness because he has seen so little service himself corporal collins had said as much as they stood beside cornet wymondham in the skinner street taproom what service has he seen exactly well to be certain nothing these past ten years for hes had the monmouth yeomanry all that time and before that i know not i heard say hed been in flanders with the duke of york then sighed hervey well have to pray that the residents of brighton are not too hostile and that you and i can make something of our troops in the way that edward lankester and the others did ay nodded barrow but by heaven it tests a man and after everything the regiments been through these past ten years hervey sighed again it was easy to be loyal to a man like lord george i suppose the real test is being loyal to a man less agreeable but a colonel is owed loyalty as of right barrow agreed ay he has to earn his respect like all of us but hes due his loyalty that i grant you too it really may not be so bad you know said hervey smiling trying to rally his own spirits as much as barrows it can never be easy for someone come from the yeomanry it will take a little time i dare say hell soon be satisfied once the regiment begins to answer barrow said nothing when hervey returned to horningsham at the end of the week there were two letters waiting for him the first was from the reverend mr keble it was a long warm thoughtful letter replying to his from london expressing his earnest wish that they should meet again soon hervey was especially pleased to receive it for a number of reasons not least of which was his and henriettas wish that john keble should jointly officiate at the wedding henrietta had formed a favourable impression of the oxford man that day at the great henge almost three years ago when she had done all she thought proper to declare her own feelings for hervey though he had not yet revealed any for her and now that things did not stand harmoniously between horningsham and the close at salisbury it was improbable that the bishop could preside at the ceremony in which case it would have to be mrs herveys brotherinlaw the dean of hereford who would solemnize their vows but though the dean was a fine man he was no poet it seemed best therefore if it were mr keble who gave the homily so kebles expression of keenness to see him again was a welcome portent another reason and this had really only occurred to hervey a month or so ago was that john keble was the only man with whom he spoke in any more than the everyday way who did not wear uniform of course there was daniel coates but with coates he was not truly intimate for their respective ages made their connection ever one of master and pupil and besides though coates had left the colours twenty years ago hervey could still not quite think of him as anything but one of general tarletons dragoons revere him indeed as tarletons trumpeter but india with its brief excursion to the world beyond the barracks and the battlefield and the acquaintances of exotic opinion and taste was now far behind him he was again as the gospel had it a man under authority and having soldiers under him the army was not a world so apart from the everyday as was john kebles kingdom of god but apart it was not because hervey wished it to be but because it had to be how might a soldier face death if he were not made to act contrary to what the instincts of any mere mortal told him john keble was not only therefore a guide to matters spiritual he might easily prove his best counsellor in things temporal the second letter troubled him deeply lynn regis norfolk march dear captain hervey it was so very good of you to write a grieving father is consoled by nothing so much as the thought that his son died doing his duty as countless fathers sons have died in these troubled times it was my younger sons dearest wish from when he was but a boy to see service against the great disturber and he fretted all the while at eton even as the army was assembling before waterloo and i confess to you that when i saw the casualty lists following that battle i gave thanks to the almighty that he had spared my son from such a test i do not dismay though as perhaps i might that his death was at the hands of his fellow countrymen for to do so might make in me a resentfulness that would be a canker neither do i need pain myself that there was any dereliction of duty on anyones part that if it had been otherwise might have rendered the outcome different for lord towcester has written to me saying that my sons squadron leader was the finest of officers and his serjeant the most experienced of men so that nothing more might have been done to render him better support in that singular duty i am ever grateful to you sir for your kindness in writing and if this appears to be but a very inadequate expression of it then be assured that it is caused only by a heart that i fear may be for ever broken i remain sir huntingdon the problem was the quite obvious untruth in the assurance that the duke of huntingdon had received from the lieutenant colonel although hervey could not be sure what the earl of towcester had actually written he had no reason to doubt that lord henry manners was the finest of officers but manners had not been in skinner street and although serjeant noakes could certainly be described as experienced in that twenty years service was vastly more than most soldiers could lay claim to the greater part of that service had been spent with the quartermasters had it been one thing or the other hervey might have been inclined to think that the duke of huntingdon perhaps even fortuitously had got hold of the wrong end of the stick but two misapprehensions was altogether different hervey turned it over again in his mind was it proper to ease the suffering of the next of kin by such an artifice had he not himself spared margaret edmonds the details of her husbands shocking death at waterloo had he not sought to spare mrs strange the anguish of knowing that her husband had died in the way he had yes but not in order to conceal some neglect indeed had he not been at pains to tell her of the sacrifice serjeant strange had made so that he hervey might get his despatch to the prussians but it was a dreadful thing indeed to imagine ones lieutenant colonel capable of so ignoble a deed as covering up a misjudgement in this way and this was the man on whose favour his promotion rested was there not as ever more to things than met the eye hervey laid both letters aside and looked out of the window at the delightful corner of creation that was his fathers garden he had enough things with which to occupy himself at present and pleasurably so by the time the regiment decamped to brighton lord towcester would be content and the regiment too was that not the sixths way he really shouldnt make it his business to worry he told himself chapter five an honourable estate salisbury plain st georges day hervey set his horse at the fence and kicked on the big gelding took off long and pecked on landing hervey was so off his balance he was on the ground in a trice it had been so quick he could do nothing to save himself but not quick enough to spare him the exasperation of knowing it was happening his hat fell the other side of the hedge an iron missed his head by an inch and the gelding galloped off across the vale winded and bruised but with no bones broken furious with himself but not humiliated for there was no one to see he cursed everything himself most all the leaps for the king hed made or for his life and a hedge in warminster bottom put him on his backside thank god it hadnt been a field day with the regiment where dismounting involuntarily was an occasion for damage to both pride and pocket he couldnt blame his horse and he didnt hed put him at too big a fence for a youngster a horse he didnt know well enough and his mind had been elsewhere but the sound of liberated hooves now pounding the chalk would turn every eye for miles hell he cursed again this time moderating the oaths hell hell hell he rubbed his shoulder which had taken his weight as he hit the ground there was so much hervey liked about this gelding though not least because he was a grey iron grey and he had always liked that colour especially when the quarter dappling was as pretty as this ones he sat up to see those quarters disappearing at a great pace in the direction of drove farm where daniel coates had stabled him for a fortnight since the dealer had brought him from trowbridge it could have been worse he might have been in the middle rather than on the edge of the downs but there again had he been in the middle he wouldnt have found a hedge to jump there was no point ruing his luck the gelding had dumped him and that was that better to stride out for coatess place while there was still light enough to see him back to horningsham afterwards what he had intended to do was take back the repeating carbine which coates had been trying for the better part of the month and with it the old soldiers opinion too for hervey felt it time to make some report to its supplier for his own part he was very much impressed with the weapon a day or so after arriving home he had taken three rabbits near the hanger above the glebe before the rest made it to their burrows something he had never managed even with his percussionlock and though it had jammed on one occasion he had righted it easily enough but daniel coatess opinion would be the long view and that he must surely prize above his own and soon he would be having it for scarcely had he walked half a mile when he saw coates trotting towards him on his old chestnut cob the grey in hand good afternoon master matthew hailed coates as he neared it was the old greeting the way daniel coates used to address him when they had been together all those years ago hervey on the leading rein and many had been the time the young master hervey had failed to keep his pony between himself and the grass and ever grateful had he been that it was as springy on the plain as bogmoss in ireland good afternoon mr coates hervey replied humouring the old dragoon do you have a hobbyhorse i might try if anyone was to bring him his loose horse better that it were daniel coates but herveys equestrian pride had taken a fall and though he might make a joke of it that pride which remained was a sight more hurt than his bones in truth he would have been content to pick his way back to horningsham at once at drove farm however coates was keen to show him his usual hospitality and the jug of purl was brought sit you down matthew i have something important to tell you hervey sat in his usual chair coatess manner had a note of warning he had heeded with profit many a time before your carbine matthew before i give you my opinion i should like very much to know what is yours hervey gave it simply i should choose it for myself instead of a paget at all times coates nodded instead of the percussionlock hervey considered carefully it would depend on the circumstances ay conceded coates might you elaborate hervey had not expected to be pressed to a view but in principle the answer was straightforward in the wet i should prefer the percussionlock when dry the repeater coates nodded again because the repeaters advantages are voided by damp just so but dry it has the edge over the other yes said hervey quite assured it can fire at many times the rate of the other coates thought for a moment and would you approve it for your dragoons yes hervey did not feel quite so assured coates made a thoughtful um sound and your opinion dan the old soldier sighed cant be too careful with your flats and sharps matthew he said shaking his head from side to side so you have always said dan replied hervey curious as to what was implied thats why i brought the carbine to you whats your worry for a start its a mite too tangled for a private man you mean he might not master the mechanism said hervey with a touch of disbelief no not that any as can be taught to strip and assemble a bridle ought to be able to cope with this the problem as i see it is that the mechanism jams just like the first ones i saw years ago a bit of dirt and the chamber wont turn and where theres a field day and a dragoon theres dirt hervey was disappointed and though he concealed it even a shade exasperated but dan where theres a field day theres damp too nine times out of ten ive told you before that ive seen a whole troops carbines misfire after a deep fording and heaven knows youve seen it yourself that was why i prized your percussionlock so highly coates nodded just so matthew and if this mechanism werent a flintlock i should embrace it gladly but here you have the chance that it will misfire and jam perhaps his shoulder was hurting more than he pretended perhaps he was not attentive enough but hervey just could not see the logic but dan if it misfires with the first round youre no worse off than if it had been the paget in your hands and if it jams on the second then what have you lost looked at that way its a fair bet i grant you but it seems to me youre doubling a mans doubt in his firearm hervey was dismayed coates was sounding opposed to what was better because it was not as good as it might be indeed he was sounding not unlike the very luddites he so railed against fearful of some notion because it was new had he aged so much in the past year and a half it was a loathsome thought he knew but hervey began to wonder if daniel coates were not on that cusp where a man turns from being an old soldier to an invalid from a sage whose wisdom protects to a reactionary whose fear only stifles he rubbed his shoulder hard praying for patience you would not wish to persuade me against it though would you dan no i wouldnt wish to persuade you against it but i would counsel you to choose the percussion carbine any day it seemed to amount to the same and so you do not think i should recommend it to the ordnance coates shook his head i should be very circumspect were i you matthew urge them to trials certainly but no more except perhaps to allude to forsyths percussion caps and say that the two in combination might make a formidable weapon though you cannot say anything of the caps to your american of course no of course it wasnt necessary for coates to remind him of that but he could hardly blame him for being prudent they had a second glass of purl then hervey made his apologies and said he must be leaving he could still get to horningsham before last light and the gelding was too green to be passing carts and cattle on a dark road he realized it sounded rather lame and hoped it didnt give offence he might have stayed for some supper but he was no longer in the best of sorts what with the fall and the wary counsel coates was obliging he called for his man to fetch the grey as hervey climbed into the saddle he used the mounting block better not to give the youngster any more surprises he began to rue his impatience how short his memory had been for all he owed thank you dan he said with a smile that revealed his contrition he held out his hand ill be sure to write in very measured terms of that flintlock for certain it would never have done for me at waterloo not in that sea of mud he knew he ought never to forget it coates smiled back a smile of paternal pride albeit adoptive and he clapped him on the leg and one more piece of advice matthew hervey waited three more days to yon wedding dont go putting any more green horses at oxers when he returned to horningsham that evening hervey was much relieved to hear from elizabeth that the archdeacons visitation which his ride on the plain was in large part designed to avoid had gone more than tolerably well the bishops caution to the reverend mr hervey the previous month had required him to submit to an inquisition as mr hervey put it at the end of thirty days and those thirty days had passed heavily for mr hervey had not shown any great inclination to abandon the practices which the bishop apparently found so odious when hervey had left the vicarage that morning therefore it had been in the expectation of hearing on return that there would be proceedings of one sort or another against his father a summons before the consistory at least or even perhaps suspension of his licence hervey had pleaded with his father to let him stay he could not be of any help beyond the filial but that was some comfort to a father was it not but mr hervey had insisted that this was a matter that he himself must bear it appeared however that the meeting had been one of respectful listening and then accommodations said elizabeth she had been there throughout much to her surprise as well as the familys for mr and mrs hervey had imagined that the archdeacon would wish his visitation to be entirely private mrs herveys loathing of the archdeacon had disposed her to believe that he would not welcome witnesses at the last minute mr herveys spirits had faltered somewhat and therefore elizabeth had found herself the supporter and so what was agreed on asked hervey as elizabeth stood watching him rub down the gelding well father was truly christian or at least he was very clever he was at the greatest pains to explain each and every little thing to which the archdeacon had found objection and he did so with such a humility that the archdeacon who was disposed at first to be a little stiff was quite warmed to father by the end and he stayed to luncheon did he indeed who would have thought it so all along there has been much smoke and little fire elizabeth furrowed her brow i dont think we can say that did father ever show you the letter of complaint it was a long list and it was written in attorneys language no he didnt show me hervey replied emptying a quarter of a bucketful of crushed barley into the stable manger but mr keble told me that if the complaints were upheld then any diocesan would be obliged to act theres no doubt that father might have been unbeneficed had the archdeacon still found fault today as mr keble pointed out as you did indeed father does not own the freehold he pulled the bar across the stall gate and took up his coat elizabeth noticed the streaks of dried mud across the shoulders matthew you havent taken a tumble have you there was a smile on her lips yes he frowned oh dear he isnt going to do then hervey was of a mind not to reply but thought better of it hell do very well he smiled and shook his head it was i who didnt do he took off half a stride before i was ready and did anyone see are we to read of it in the warminster miscellany captain hervey lately returned from enough her brother protested taking her arm and closing the bottom half of the stable door behind them nobody saw daniel coates brought him back soon afterwards and we had a laugh about it i can imagine daniels laughing did he say more about what about your gun that is what you said you were to see him about oh we had a good talk they walked to the front of the house as the first pipistrelles were beginning their nightly acrobatics which now spring was truly come would soon be rivalled during the day by the house martins which returned every year to the vicarage hervey followed the swoops and turns for a while as if they might help his thoughts elizabeth he began after an interval do you think dan is become old i mean i know hes not getting any younger but today he seemed well a little less reasonable elizabeth furrowed her brow again and shook her head no i have not thought that and not a week goes by that i dont see him in the town and lord bath was saying only the other day that he was the best magistrate in the whole of west wiltshire why do you ask hervey paused another while and then smiled youll think me proud but he would not see the advantages in my new carbine he could only see the faults and that ive observed is the mark of someone become old elizabeth gave him a disapproving look i should not wish you to be my judge in anything brother i have never known you to be other than an optimist to a fault indeed he replied at once opening the door of the house for her as if it were an end to the matter the door to their fathers library was open and the reverend thomas hervey was sitting by his fire a fire was always lit there throughout may with glass in hand and contentment on his face he turned as he heard them come in well well well heres a turnup eh all those weeks troubling over my books and then the archdeacon is all sweetness and light im not sure i ever met a more reasonable fellow elizabeth soon demonstrated that her brothers opinion of her was more brotherly than exact father i should not be too quick to that sentiment were i you for i did not observe any change in his mind only a desire to have things done with oh said mr hervey disappointed with her opinion though unsurprised proud in fact that she should give it so freely elizabeth had been his mainstay these past three years since the death of his elder son she poured him more sherry well father on each and every complaint you assured him that you believed you were following the practice of the early church before rome erred and strayed those were your very words mr hervey nodded and matthew hervey grew a little in awe of his sister for here were affairs that he had never had occasion for mastering and you gave him evidence and cited authorities elizabeth continued and it seemed to me that the archdeacon was inclined to concede your argument lest it reveal his own ignorance so that even now he may be delving into his books in order to refute that argument should the time come oh now surely protested mr hervey but elizabeth persisted because it appeared to me that the only issue on which he was certain that you stood in breach of any ordinance was that of facing east at the communion table i notice that you forbore for once to call it an altar and that was his chief concern her brother thought it only right that he should make some contribution and how was this resolved father the prayer book is quite explicit is it not explicit yes but not dogmatic i didnt argue the point though i assured the archdeacon instead that he would hear of no further complaint in this regard oh so you did concede in one matter at least tried hervey matthew his father replied gravely i have said what i have said hervey looked a little chastened and then his father relented your friend from the wooden world is come by the way captain peto he stays at the bath arms but hell dine with us in about an hour indeed we are all so late today hervey was thoroughly enlivened by the news oh how i wish henrietta were back to meet him therell be so little chance before thursday what did you think of him father is he not the very embodiment of a frigate captain i thought him a very fine fellow at once he replied squarely elizabeth smiled his voice was perhaps a little too great for such confined quarters and he seemed to bump into the furniture rather a lot but i liked him at once too do you know he says he believes this to be the furthest inland he has ever been herveys smile was even broader i can well believe it and then the clock struck the halfhour oh have you seen johnson i must tell him about tomorrow elizabeth frowned but it was an approving sort of frown private johnson had preceded hervey to horningsham by several days and with him jessye and had been warmly welcomed by all find hannah towle first for hes been making eyes at her all day in a village such as horningsham which owed its wellbeing to a great house like longleat it was by no means unusual for important affairs of state to be played out within the witness of the meanest of its inhabitants but even horningsham did not expect ever to be party to the news that broke next morning it appalled and fascinated everyone alike from daylabourer to lord bath himself the details were dreadful and needed no embellishing in the retelling the shock about the village was so apparent that even private johnson a visitor with an undeveloped sensitivity felt its strange effect during his progress from one end of horningsham to the other on an errand for hannah towle one of the yeoman farmers the same that had proposed to mrs strange and whose property lay remote at the very edge of the parish bounds had been found murdered in his own house and his maidservant the only other occupant was likewise dead and her body disposed of in the garden well nothing more was known but that the house bore the signs of ransacking for money and valuables and that the parish constable had hastened there at once in no ones memory had there ever been such a thing in the most distant past even and it was everywhere assumed that the culprits must be from warminster common which all knew to be a sink of growing proportions except as the reverend thomas hervey pointed out the farm lay the other side of the village from the common so the murderers would have had to make a very great detour in order not to have been seen there the farmer himself had no kin in the village and his maidservants family was from the neighbouring parish so mr hervey had no immediate pastoral calling the coroners business would likely be slow and the funeral many days off therefore a mercy in not claiming his attention as the wedding approached at longleat lord bath was in a mood of some despair for the more personal effects of the crime apart he believed it reflected ill on the stewardship of his demesne such things might happen in cities or on an estate where the owner took no careful interest in affairs other than its rents but not here wiltshire wasnt clare or kerry after all and he was not an absentee landlord and what might the parish constable discover he was good enough when it came to the odd bit of mischief but this was altogether too grave a crime for a man whose principal occupation was the maintenance of the longleat fire engine no it would not do lord bath would not wait for the trail to go stone cold while constable gedge completed his thorough but fruitless enquiries he would send at once to london for bow street detectors when hervey set out for longleat in the midmorning he had a mind to call on mrs strange to condole with her for he imagined that an offer of marriage on the farmers part supposed some degree of intimacy or at least familiarity but as he passed the school he heard the children singing a hymn and by no means a sombre one so he presumed mrs strange was not so indisposed as to put off her charges and draw the curtains at home he therefore rode on to his appointment with henrietta who would be returned he trusted from that nearby fashionable spa where ladies could find everything that a lady needed the appointment was not so much with henrietta however as the two of them with mr keble john keble had also dined at the vicarage the night before and the meeting this morning he had explained was in order to discharge his obligation in certain matters respecting the prayer book the meeting began well they sat in a small summer breakfast room the late spring sunshine warm through windows full east with orchids from the longleat hothouses about them herveys and henriettas chairs were drawn close enough together for them to place a hand on one anothers from time to time with mr kebles chair somehow arranged so as not to be too formal though not yet so intimate as to make for any additional awkwardness in his discourse with them first mr keble explained that in order to preach as he intended and so that the dean who was to officiate might omit the lengthy declaration of the duties of man and wife which the prayer book otherwise required he felt obliged to share with them certain things and so the familiar injunctions of saints peter and paul were rehearsed and the parties were content then with a certain delicacy of manner he asked their leave to go a little further he wished with considerable authority as well as delicacy to lay their minds at rest as he put it to disabuse them of any doubts they might have as to the worthiness of the desires of the flesh within wedlock henrietta smiled serenely and her countenance gave no indication of whether the desires of the flesh were in any respect understood hervey shifted slightly in his chair and feared somehow that his own understanding would be all too readily exposed for it would be contrary to all christian doctrine explained john keble to imagine as did the gnostics that the body is the enemy of the spiritual life henrietta listened as before she had not the slightest notion of who the gnostics were but her instincts were true enough hervey had known who the gnostics were and what their heresy was but had forgotten and he drifted off into recollection of his shrewsbury divinity indeed he would have languished there an age had not john kebles discourse suddenly taken an unusually frank turn henriettas eyes lit at last as the young priest began speaking with perfect candour of the growth in love that came with its physical consummation hervey did not see her eyes for he was avoiding them intently wondering how a man so recently ordained priest so unworldly a man could speak of this so assuredly so let me conclude with scripture said keble at length and rather to herveys relief not st paul this time but from the old testament from the song of solomon hervey glanced at henrietta she touched his hand for an instant telling him at once she understood all perfectly as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters began john keble henrietta smiled so happily that he paused very deliberately as the apple among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste she smiled wide again her neck where the demure single string of pearls circled it became red in vivid patches and her eyes grew larger he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me hervey at last turned full to henrietta she looked more desirable than at any time he had seen her and he ceded his thoughts to all that the words aroused the day of the marriage between captain matthew paulinus hervey bachelor of the parish of horningsham and of lady henrietta charlotte anne wharton lindsay spinster of the parish of longbridge deverill as the banns had lately declaimed them passed slowly at first all too slowly they would both agree until from about three in the afternoon the time began to pass twice as quickly as it ought and so though he had made his preparations with meticulous care the bridegroom found himself hastening to fasten the knee buttons of his regimental court dress as lord john howard his supporter looked anxiously at his watch they got into the carriage a full fifteen minutes later than hervey had planned risking being caught behind others in the darkening lanes but the driver earned himself a sovereign by taking his team at a canter the length of horningsham and the park drive arriving three minutes before the time hervey had first intended the groom was therefore content once more as they stepped down it had not been his idea to wear uniform a sombre coat would have been his preference but prince leopold had worn his uniform at carlton house and so henrietta had wished her affianced to do the same lord john howard wore the selfsame uniform albeit a brand new set in which he had first appeared at the vicarage two years before the memory of that unhappy business when the lieutenant of foot guards had come with the mistaken orders for his arrest crowded hervey for an instant when as then they had got into the carriage but all that had been put from his mind by the gallop to longleat and they stood now as if friends of long years longleat house was lit inside and out as he had never seen it before the music of a string orchestra could be heard even above the talk of the seventy privileged guests who had just been treated to a dinner of immense refinement in the great dining room and indeed of nearly the same number of only marginally less privileged guests who filled the tudor hall the yeomen and tenants of the village those who had nursed bride or groom to adulthood and the ncos of the sixth who would form their guard of honour roast pork filled their plates and hops their glasses if burgundy was not to their liking and both parties separate and content were now beginning to rise to make their way to the grand state room where they would bear witness to the marriage vows at one end of that elegant room was a velvetcovered altar just as at carlton house with chapel ornaments brought from longbridge deverill including two handsome candlesticks six feet high a little string orchestra played purcell airs as the principal wedding guests began to find their places in the ranks of gilded chairs and at the rear the yeoman and tenants assembled though in a more respectful hush fine worsteds and cottons to the silks and satins in front hervey quite composed took his seat with his family he had managed to exchange a few words with the ncos as they took post along the wall at the back of the state room and he was much gratified that their turnout was as fine as he had seen perhaps finer testimony to his troop serjeantmajors authority or else dare he imagine to that mutual respect which was the regiment at its best serjeant armstrongs hessians were so mirrorlike that hervey thought he must have shuffled every step of the way to prevent their cracking across the instep the dean of hereford flanked by john keble entered quietly through a side door and together they took their sedilia shortly afterwards the marquesss butler the master of ceremonies gave a discreet nod and hervey left his place and went out to meet his bride hervey knew that a bride on her wedding day was transfigured legend had it so as well as village lore but henriettas transfiguration was beyond anything he had imagined for beneath the veil her features had an ethereal quality her eyes hair and complexion luminous her dress was exquisite and he stood before her quite unable to express anything but utter admiration and silently at that sir a button snapped private johnson suddenly having stationed himself with his customary prescience excuse me maam he said to henrietta pulling his captain aside into the little anteroom off the hall henrietta smiled warmly at so faithful a servant and turned to her bridesmaids elizabeth she said with perfect composure i have never been so sure of anything or anyone than at this moment it was true that her bridegroom had perhaps never appeared to her more dashing in his regimentals than now for levee dress set off everything in appearance about matthew hervey that a woman might admire but more than that she knew the uniform signified a strength and a constancy on which she might with utmost certainty rely this ceremony might show longleat at its finest and witness to the great affection in which she was held by its lord but she would quit it gladly for the complete affection with which matthew hervey would honour her and would follow the trumpet for that love no matter what its calls and privations and she hoped he might soon trust in that is tha all right capn ervey asked johnson pushing the needle once more into the stiffened cloth of the tunic collar to secure the idle button tha looks like thas seen a ghost hervey looked at his groom incomprehendingly what thas miles away sir he had indeed been miles away he had visited things years past in his mind all the way back to that first encounter with the little girl who had never been far from his thoughts ever since deny them though he so often had he smiled the colour now coming back to his face i saw quite a few ghosts johnson but they dont trouble me any more eh sir never mind is that button fast yet it is johnson knotted the thread bit off the ends and fastened the collar up again hervey clapped him on the arm grinned his thanks and took his place at henriettas side are we ready matthew she smiled at him full again this time he returned the smile and with interest he nodded to the master of ceremonies who signalled to a footman and the little string orchestra began the march from alceste to which hervey his bride and her retinue would process to the altar the seamstresses of bath whom henrietta had long thought superior to those of london had made so faithful a replica of princess charlottes wedding dress that it might have been supposed she wore the original except that charlottes figure stood in unhappy comparison with henriettas and the removal of several yards of the silver cloth would not have been possible without destroying the overall effect layer upon layer of the costly fabric was sewn with silver thread and embroidered at the borders with patterns of shells and bouquets it was cut full below the high bodice and while the original had as many sadly observed emphasized charlottes corpulence this bath replica served only to present henriettas figure in all its elegance somehow too its frills lace trimmings and garlands of diamonds wholly became her rather than drawing attention away from her fine eyes and captivating face under its wreath of rosebuds leaves and brilliants princess charlotte had graciously given henrietta leave to imitate her to flatter her indeed by such imitation but there were several in the assembly that evening who said how providential it was that the royal pregnancy kept charlotte from longleat now dearly beloved we are gathered together here in the sight of god began the dean he had said the words many times before and yet always they seemed new and full of promise to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is an honourable estate he enunciated the purposes for which marriage was ordained and no one alleged or declared any impediment when called upon to do so why hervey and henrietta should not be joined together bride and groom answered clearly and distinctly when the dean asked of them both if they would honour their obligations to each other each of them spoke clearly and distinctly as they gave their troth to each other henriettas right hand in herveys and then herveys in henriettas and hervey put the ring on the fourth finger of henriettas left hand as the prayer book required and vowed with it to worship her with his body and to endow her with all his worldly goods they knelt and the dean asked gods blessing on them both commanded that those whom god hath joined should no man put asunder and then pronounced them man and wife together and when hervey lifted henriettas veil he marvelled equally at his fortune that this woman had indeed consented to be his wife there followed psalm one hundred and twentyeight beati omnes o well is thee and happy shalt thou be and the lords prayer and others for general blessings and for fruitfulness in the procreation of children then all were bidden to sit to hear the homily on the duties of man and wife i do hope this is not to be a long affair whispered the marquess audibly to lady bath these oxford fellows can be mightily pleased with the sound of their own voice john keble as he rose and moved to the middle of the extemporary chancel gave no clue as to how long he would detain his congregation nor indeed how engagingly dearly beloved in the preface to the form of solemnization of matrimony the persons to be married are bidden to come into the body of the church with their friends and neighbours the words his voice and his sublime aspect at once commanded unusual attention in a congregation enlivened by the hosts hospitality and this matthew hervey and now henrietta hervey have done for you indeed are their friends and neighbours we need not dwell on the reasons for requiring that they should not come privily save that those whom they love best and who love them best should bear witness to the mutual love that these two persons have for each other love the last best gift of heaven he paused above all they witness before god to this love this gift of heaven this heavenly grace and they and we ask gods blessing that as isaac and rebecca lived faithfully together so might they sustained by the prayers and society of you their friends and neighbours and by the grace of god matthew and henrietta may hope fervently that they might live as isaac and rebecca and that they might follow christs commandment to love one another love the last best gift of heaven love gentle holy pure amen john keble turned and knelt before the altar hervey took henriettas hand neither bride nor groom could possibly know the range of sentiment for them in that chapelroom for the most part it was that of friends and neighbours young and old who had watched or somehow shared their progress to adulthood and their consent now to be man and wife in herveys case although his society was limited in comparison with henriettas the range of acquaintances which his profession admitted was much the greater there were some in that congregation like mrs strange with feelings of obligation for a past kindness out of the run of the ordinary some like private johnson would owe that daily life was infinitely the better for the command of their captain one or two might even claim their very being here rather than in the grave was because of him and there were some perhaps no more than a dozen who hardly knew either of them officers of the sixth happy to accept the customary invitation to see a fellow wed including his commanding officer whose duty it was to be there it was impossible that john kebles address should touch each as strongly but touch each in some way it did if for nothing but its singular brevity and clarity as well perhaps as for its challenge the silence between its ending and the deans blessing and dismissal was memorable the service ended the little orchestra began to play the triumphing dance from dido and aeneas the brides choice both for its purport and liveliness and the congregation led by captain matthew and lady henrietta hervey walked from the chapelroom between a file of carried sabres and into the great hall there the band of the th light dragoons high in the minstrels gallery struck up the regiments quick march young may moon to the spontaneous applause of all the guests who now mingled freely or at least unseparated to enjoy their hosts generosity once more and only now did henrietta feel an inclination to rue her idea of imitating all princess charlottes arrangements for she realized how very detained they would be by so many wellwishers not that hervey imagined any such feeling on his wifes part how might he yet he could only submit to duty once more content with the thought that for henrietta this must be the happiest time of the whole day it would be two hours and more before he came at last to understand the truth the whole truth of john kebles words of the day before it was indeed a glorious may moon that lit the guests way home that night by foot horse and carriage alike and which shone a full three hours on hervey and henrietta in their marriage bed and it was after midday that hervey came down the great staircase of longleat house for the first time in his life his slight feeling of awkwardness in his new status was made worse by the obvious cause of the lateness of the descent henrietta would be a full fifteen minutes behind him he was doubly surprised therefore when the butler greeted him formally but with polite indifference and astonished when he announced that daniel coates wished to see him as soon as might be possible hervey sighed on this of all mornings might not daniel coates allow him to be his own man for right or for wrong he surely does not expect me to ride to upton scudamore oh no sir he is here waiting replied the butler in heavens name for how long the butlers voice changed just a point to explain the propriety of coatess request mr coates has not been home this last evening sir at about one oclock this morning after you had retired sir hervey coloured a little he came up to me in may i say sir a degree of agitation and asked if i knew what were your and her ladyships plans in the coming days i replied that i was not privy to them sir mr coates then said that he had to go to bristol for several days in his magisterial capacity and that he could not risk your leaving without his speaking with you hervey knew he would see him at once of course he would but he wanted to know all there was of it beforehand did you not offer him paper thurlow indeed i did sir but mr coates said he could not possibly commit his business to paper ten minutes later when they met together in the library coates bore an expression of great anxiety which was not helped by his evident lack of sleep my dear dan whatever is the matter said hervey now genuinely concerned for the man who was in both senses his oldest friend daniel coates shook his head several times your commanding officer lord towcester hervey looked puzzled yes dan you met him last night not exactly not as such he replied shaking his head again well what is it then he laid a hand on coatess forearm hes not not not right by now hervey was becoming exasperated dan to be frank hes to hardly anyones liking in the sixth and its only too clear to me why as doubtless it was to you no its not just that ive met im before hervey was about to try allaying what he judged to be a veterans anxiety when the old soldier rallied in holland in with the duke of york and abercromby i was an orderly dragoon at general pooles headquarters hervey began to listen intently for he knew that tone well enough wed landed on the helder towards the end of august and it was muddle as usual but a few weeks later we were giving the french a trouncing at last on the coast at bergen there was a hell of a long skirmish with the french ussars all along the dunes for half a dozen miles pouring rain an all it was mainly the fifteenth and eighteenth but then the twentythird was thrown in newcome from england they went at it well enough but then the french counterattacked good and proper out of egmont and rolled over them like they wasnt there hervey knew the battle well a good light dragoon action he had always understood and coates had spoken of it before but now it was as if he were still there so intent was his look go on dan lord towcester well he wasnt lord towcester then he was lord charles keys wasnt he lord towcester had a troop of the twentythird and he upped and left them galloped off the field as if the hounds of hell were after him in full view of his brigadier herveys mouth fell open how in heavens name could he become a captain then let alone a lieutenant colonel coates didnt answer directly the eighteenth charged through and through young stewart at their head him that is lord londonderry now privy councillor an all thats the way cavalry should be handled called general poole and as for that officer who bolted ill have his name disgraced for ever but it seems he didnt sighed hervey that night i was outside the generals office waiting on him to take his despatch to lord abercrombys headquarters just a curtain for a door it had lord towcester was brought in under arrest and i heard everything the generald been appalled when hed learned who the officer was because he knew his father as a very old friend hed wanted to have lord towcester courtmartialled at first but said he couldnt bear to think of the pain it would bring so noble a man as was his father he made him swear upon his honour to resign his commission at once and never again to seek one and then lord towcester went out into the night and no one ever saw him again but this was all done in front of witnesses was it not pressed hervey disbelieving that such a promise could not have been enforced let alone dishonoured and the whole brigade saw the flight too the only man that i know of who would have heard the exchange was the brigade major but he died that winter and general poole went peacefully in his bed many years ago now he called me in to take the despatch soon afterwards and asked me if id heard whatd passed i said i had and the general said he believed he might well live to rue the day he had been so weakminded about it i remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday for a general would never share such a thought with a corporal if he were not truly dismayed hervey could not but agree but what about those who saw him bolt that i cant say said coates shaking his head it was nigh on twenty years ago who remembers anything when so much has happened in between and who could say anything against their betters anyway i dont even know if stewart himself saw it what a dismal thing to hear on any morning thought hervey so i have a commanding officer who is not merely disliked for his manner by all he was and therefore almost certainly still is a coward and whats worse his word counts for nothing ay matthew agreed coates shaking his head gravely you see now why i was in such haste to warn you of it a regiment commanded by a knave like him will be a damned pitiable place hed give you the point from behind soon as look at you stay on guard matthew stay on guard part two skirmishers out chapter six from whom no secrets are hid hounslow six weeks later his lordship is most insistent on it captain hervey he wishes that you will take command of your troop at once the major generals inspection is at the end of the month the adjutants tone was emphatic hervey could not complain these were the petty exigencies of the service after all but why had july been declared the grass month only weeks before and officers promised leave he accepted lord towcesters wish as if it were an order that went without saying but it seemed not unreasonable for the adjutant to say why the change had been necessary did the annual inspection come as such a surprise the adjutant clearly believed he had a fight on his hands if you wish to protest any more then you shall have to put it in writing to his lordship he said defiantly but i have not protested in the least i have merely asked to be told the reason for the change things will go all the easier with the troop if they know why it is i do not think his lordship would hold with that sentiment an order is given and it is a subordinates duty to obey hervey sighed to himself only an imbecile would think that this truism was the last word on the command of men dauntsey do not mistake me i say again that i have not the slightest wish to question the order but i have always observed that our men go the better for it if they are told as much as possible our came properly enough for they both wore the same badge the adjutant sneered in my former regiment i pride myself that we were greatly more punctilious in such matters captain hervey you shall have to put your objections in writing to the lieutenant colonel he would not countenance it if this conversation continued and i say for a third time that i make no objection hervey managed to keep his voice quite even to begin with but then his patience failed him see here dauntsey if you go blustering to the troop captains in this way you will soon have their resentment and it is not a good thing for a commanding officer to have an adjutant who cannot manage the captains the adjutant made to protest i am not finished if you please mr dauntsey when you speak it is as if the lieutenant colonel himself were speaking and it is as well that you remember that privilege for if you use words that the colonel would not have wished then your authority will be shot through once and for all the adjutant wore a look like thunder very well then dauntsey i shall return to longleat now and i shall be back as his lordship wishes in seven days time be pleased to give my respects to him when he returns hervey left the orderly room and walked to the officers mess fulminating at the adjutants disdain and presumption he was angry at having been driven to speak so sharply but dauntsey had had it coming to him the fellow had been deuced rude on their first meeting two months ago and since his own arrival yesterday to do no more than make a few domestic arrangements dauntsey had scarce had a civil word for him it was not good though to be on poor terms with the adjutant for although hervey was confident enough of keeping the likes of dauntsey on his guard a meanminded adjutant could always exact his vengeance in other ways on the troop itself perhaps and in herveys experience when that went on for some time the men could turn their resentment towards their captain rather than their true persecutor an unpropitious start then but better perhaps than to let things run on and have a bigger quarrel later well it was done now said hervey to himself better to get his things into the chaise and be away how satisfying it was to have his own chaise the stage was a mean alternative even though he could now take an inside seat without having to worry about the cost serjeant armstrong had called it swanking when first he had seen the carriage with the bath arms and all on the sides and hervey had been quick to admit to its provenance and its temporary proprietorship but it would still give him no little satisfaction to leave the barracks in it at once beholden not even to the mess drag to get him to the staging inn hallo you are off already said captain strickland coming on the rig outside the mess a halfhour later ay the colonel wants me back early it seems there are things to do in wiltshire first strickland raised an eyebrow and half smiled the major generals inspection yes what a todo that is youve heard about the muddle i suppose no my serjeantmajor had it from one of the clerks it seems that the general wrote months ago to say he wanted to see the regiment before the grass month someone failed to take note hervey frowned then i should not like to be who it was that failed strickland smiled but thinly i mean it lay on the colonels desk for an inordinate time oh said hervey cast even lower by the intelligence had i known that but a halfhour ago i should not have pressed the adjutant on it strickland smiled again i shouldnt trouble yourself on that account dauntsey is so terrified of towcester that he couldnt bring himself to press him to an order nor had he the wit to issue even a preliminary one of his own he deserved whatever he got then heaven preserve us if ever we have to turn out on some alarm ay just so nodded strickland solemnly im glad youre come back hervey hervey felt the sentiment a shade awkwardly im glad you should say so but i believe i must tell you im thinking of exchanging added strickland sheepishly im very sorry to hear that hervey spoke with feeling for though they had not served together long they had at least shared a campaign he wondered if he might soon have any kindred spirits of the old sixth to serve with do you have to it wont be easy to exchange now unless youre prepared to go to a regiment warned for india a troop is hard to come by as things stand what with disbandments and so on i know id go to india though the climate would serve me ill id exchange into the infantry even perhaps not taking the difference either this last he said almost defiantly he must indeed be desperate thought hervey for strickland was not a rich man and could ill afford to throw away the difference in price of a captaincy perhaps a thousand pounds if auctioned well in charles street could anyone find his commanding officer so unbearable he put his hand to stricklands arm do you want to speak of it no not now not here when youre come back the words were so heavy that still hervey could not break off my dear fellow a thought occurred to him why dont you come down to wiltshire with me for a few days id welcome the company and you could tell me of how things are here strickland brightened a little that is exceedingly good of you but im captain of the week then as soon as im back let us dine together in the town and you may tell me of it yes yes i should like that when hervey returned to longleat henrietta seemed to greet him rather anxiously i had such a presentiment of your not returning she said taking his arm as they walked up the steps to the house matthew dearest i do not want us to be apart again unless it is entirely necessary not even for a night the proposal was scarcely disagreeable but of course my darling i should not have gone to hounslow alone had i thought for one minute the journey would not have been tedious for you but you did not ask he was puzzled would you have agreed to come if it had been disagreeable to you yes then you see why i did not ask but matthew how could it ever be disagreeable to me to be with you what a simple statement of love that was a lump came to his throat my dear i she threw her head back grinning mischievously a strand of hair fell across her cheek but she merely brushed it behind an ear then it is resolved on only if i am ordered by the horse guards itself shall i leave you and a direct order at that hervey smiled too embracing her and taking the pins from her hair so that it fell about her shoulders then when i am on manoeuvres with my troop you shall come up at night with the bathorses and share your bivouac she giggled would your colonel approve he would be jealous i could dress as one of your dragoons then hervey smiled again if the disguise worked then it might lead to my arrest she giggled even more besides the dolmans a mite too tightfitting to be any sort of deception he coloured up even as he was saying it she blushed too but it was with the little telltale patches of red about her neck come she whispered pulling his arm were not to dine for another hour in the afternoon he took up the warminster miscellany to read the account of the trial and execution of the two murderers of farmer fremantle and his maidservant the bow street investigators had done their work with remarkable despatch it seemed they had arrived at longleat two days after the wedding and within five more had made their arrests not on warminster common as everyone had expected but in a nextdoor parish albeit across the county boundary and this fact made for alarm in horningsham for it was much easier to live with the notion that an outlaw from the common had done this vile thing than a couple of roughs from a village not unlike theirs nevertheless it was some consolation to know that justice would always be served for this must be a great deterrent to further crime albeit at the expense of bringing investigators from london hervey had been much taken with the bow street men lord bath had asked him if he would see to things while he himself went up to parliament for the estimates and so each day of a morning the detectors would give him a summary of the evidence they had gathered the previous day and tell him of their next intentions he did not suppose he had met two more intelligent men in the most practical sense of that quality the senior of the two had been twenty years in the kings service an artificer of sappers and miners his assistant by contrast had for a long time been a bookkeeper with the lunatic asylum protector insurance company their methods were meticulous ingenious and complementary their hours long nor did they make the mistake of thinking they were dealing with bumpkins because they were beyond the sound of bow bells but one thing had impressed hervey greatly from the outset the detectors had had complete confidence that they would bring the perpetrators to justice and doubtless this had conveyed itself to all whom they interviewed speeding the ultimate detection when this had been accomplished the three of them had enjoyed a good dinner at the bell in warminster which boasted the best double mutton chops in the county before the bow street men had taken the afternoon stage for andover and thence the post back to london as hervey now read the account of the hanging he thought himself lucky that he had had pressing business at hounslow after all for the companion gallows at the top of arn hill and two young men scarcely out of their teens brought by their own wickedness to so violent an end would have been a heavy sight even with the knowledge of the awful butchery of the farmer and his maid for he knew there were men in the sixth who might in other circumstances be capable of such a thing and he would for certain have had to be there not least to be a support for his father who with the vicar of warminster had had to officiate on the scaffold a vast multitude of spectators the miscellany said there had been and the wiltshire yeomanry had been out to keep order just as the regulars had been with cashman another man who for sure would have been kept from the gallows had he still been in the kings service in any event the bow street men were the toast of the miscellany the heroes of the multitude said the paper he was deeply absorbed with the times when henrietta joined him what engages you my love she asked brightly leaning over him from behind to kiss his forehead nothing agreeable im afraid he sighed tell me of it well habeas corpus is still suspended and lord sidmouth is castigated for the way he is dealing with the agitation over reform they accuse him of using spies too freely and agents provocateurs henrietta looked troubled rather in the way she had when he had returned from hounslow it alarms me sometimes i might tell you there have been nights here when i have lain awake expecting the house to be attacked when the slightest noise has made me fear for my life her tone chilled him he stood up and took hold of her my dear such things dont come like that we should have word well before she seemed prepared to believe his assurance for the time being in any case i have no cause for fear now you are with me it had been the briefest of departures from her habitually carefree manner but it registered with her husband nonetheless hers was the vulnerability of a world suddenly not impregnable like as not in her years in the shelter of the longleat acres she had never seen anything more violent than a carters whip to a horse or heard a curse stronger than a blades dealt a bad hand at cards but why then should she seem so fearful he knew little of her childhood before longleat of course but he hardly supposed it had been an unhappy one were putting the improver to jessye again today he tried to give the change of subject as uncontrived an air as possible the stud groom thinks it should be well this time jessye had failed to come into foal a month ago but the stud groom had said he doubted she was truly in season hes got her a teaser this time henrietta was smiling again do i tease you still matthew ay he grinned but different from how you did they kissed but the door opened and a footman informed him that private johnson had jessye ready for the stallion you had better go to your other love sighed henrietta refastening the buttons on his coat have you seen the improvement stallion he asked as he made to leave he is quite magnificent no may i come with you of course hes one of the handsomest things youll ever see he has a coat like polished ebony theres something in a stallion that he was going to tell her there was something in a stallion which there wasnt in a gelding yes matthew she interrupted frowning i believe i can understand that much he did not redden this time johnson led jessye in hand to the big yard used for the coverings straw was spread deep and for a moment the mare looked as though she had a mind to roll but he managed to keep her up and stood close to quieten her the stud groom brought the stallion directly and with scarcely a hand needed to help the big horse went to her hervey had left henrietta at the saddle room expecting her to return to the house he didnt know she watched from a window not until he went back afterwards and found her waiting for him she looked him full in the face an admiring look a look that said she understood him a little more what a thing is nature she said it was a distinctly reverent statement but also determined natures blush suffused her own face and she took his hand and led him from the room later they rode out together up past the hanger towards the picket post and around arn hill hervey thought he could do this for ever and said so henrietta thought he could not and said so too indeed she hoped he could not for i did not choose to marry a squire but for the moment though there was nothing that either of them would rather do than ride to the downs there was something about two horses in a landscape two was a number like no other three four ten twenty or even one it was all much the same but two was different for it spoke of intimacy they rode for a full halfmile without saying anything content to let nature speak a sky with scarcely a cloud the downs without the hand of man and now they were joined by swallows two dozen or more they dived and turned and soared all about them swooping so close and low as to seem certain to collide with the horses legs though neither herveys grey nor henriettas little bay mare took the slightest notice i have never seen the like said henrietta never seen them fly so they are enchanting why do they accompany us do you think perhaps they just like it oh i hope that is so matthew she said smiling and looking about her i should like to think that a bird is as capable of taking such simple pleasure i have never looked down at a swallow before only up they are so beautiful i should much rather we stay watching them than go to lady hores tonight she had once told him that a day without a party was not worth recording in her journal what a change this was or had she simply concealed this side hereto do you see how they spread their forktails as they turn he gestured with his whip it must help them veer so acutely and they have flown all the way from africa it is almost too much to believe so far that you have not been to africa have you matthew no not to africa around africa i saw its shores once or twice but very distantly i should like to see africa said henrietta still watching the swallows with a look of semiwonder at no time had she ever expressed within his hearing any desire to travel beyond italy or st petersburg he had even had his doubts in paris two summers ago that she could be persuaded to come with him to india he made no reply she watched the swallows for a full five minutes without a sound then she sighed very contentedly and turned to him i am so very very happy with you matthew i hardly know myself i see things i have never seen before and i too he assured her i do not believe that i truly knew what life was before now before daring to admit that i loved you that is for i believe i have loved you a very long time she smiled at him reassuringly she knew what trials had attended that declaration they rode on a while longer in happy silence but matthew there is one thing i have been meaning to ask the morning after our wedding why did daniel coates wish to see you so urgently hervey sighed he had decided against telling her at the time because it seemed so illmatched to the occasion afterwards he had found the notion hard to share with her since it could only increase her anxiety for him and nothing she might say could ameliorate his own misgivings tell me matthew it evidently disquiets you she insisted he told her what coates had said about his commanding officer she looked puzzled why didnt you tell me before i think that i did not want to distress you especially at that time but matthew if something distresses you then you must permit me to ease that distress and i cannot do so unless you tell me all she turned and looked at him direct there can be no secrets between us now she had still the appearance of contentment but her voice carried an insistence which left hervey in no doubt that she intended them to be a couple in every sense in duty and disappointment alike indeed henrietta intended taking her marriage vows with the utmost seriousness even if she had already largely forgotten their actual words hervey could only feel chastened but then encouraged for hers would be a brave course for a soldiers wife at the best of times and these were not the best of times he smiled stood in his stirrups leaned out and kissed her it said all there was to say and in a manner which entirely delighted her chapter seven manoeuvres hounslow three weeks later i well see your dismay gentlemen said major joynson but we had expected nothing more than the usual administrative inspection that is why there have been no field days the troop captains were complaining of the lack of drill they had had in the light of the major generals wishes just received that next thursdays annual inspection should take the form of a survey of horses clothing and equipment in the barracks and then a days manoeuvres on chobham common all the captains but hervey that is for he had not the slightest notion how handy his troop was in the field nor for that matter how it and b troop worked together as a squadron he had been at its head only since monday and during that time he had been able to do nothing more than any captain did on taking over his troop which was to see that everything for which he might be held accountable with his purse was as the regimental books said they should be he had looked at the sixty or so horses with a most careful eye and been more pleased than he could remember a far cry they from the tits and screws the weavers and windsuckers the quidders and cribbiters that had been their remounts by the end of the peninsula the private men too were brighteyed smart and quick about things to the trumpet and he was slowly getting the measure of the noncommissioned officers his serjeantmajor kendall was a man he would not himself have chosen but thought might just do for he was spoken of well in his time with the quartermasters armstrong was first serjeant and for that at least hervey was grateful but he was sad that collins was no longer in the squadron for he would have wished him for his coveringcorporal again though collins was chasing his third stripe so he would have had to find another coverman sooner or later anyway at yesterdays parade he had liked the look of an active young dragoon called troughton a norfolk man with a good seat light hand and supple wrist perhaps he would watch and see how he fared at the generals drill his trumpeter medwell whose nickname in the troop was susan and hervey thought he could see why was so flawless in his calls that hervey supposed it would not be long before susan was made colonels man but for the time being at least he knew he could count on his orders being relayed exactly does the colonel have any notion of what form the manoeuvres will take asked ezra barrow seeing that there was no point in grumbling any more major joynson said he did not or if he had he had not vouchsafed it when is he back asked d troops captain i dont know for rights said the major growing more uncomfortable by the minute perhaps we might address the problem ourselves suggested strickland who seemed in better spirits than when hervey had taken leave of him a month before they all nodded the major wasnt sure however i do not know his lordships wishes in such things hervey was baffled it was a very fair presumption that any commanding officer would wish the best efforts to be made he sighed to himself this was going to be a deuced hard pull for the moment though he held his peace major eustace joynson had all but been on halfpay these past eight years with no more responsibility than organizing supply for the yeomanry of kent when they were mobilized for invasion duty which since they had never been he was a kind man by all accounts he meant well worked hard and was far from stupid but he disliked upsets when hervey had first joined for duty as a cornet the then captain joynson was called daddy by his troop and was soon shed by the colonel when they reached the peninsula his return to regimental duty was therefore as unexpected as it was undesirable with a martinet at best for a commanding officer and a toady for an adjutant the last thing they needed was a major who wouldnt say boo to the proverbial goose hervey sighed heavens what a change thered been it was a matchless regiment that had crossed the pyrenees that winter the year before waterloo lord george irvine commanding joseph edmonds the major and ezra barrow ay for all his brusqueness the adjutant now even mr lincoln was being elbowed aside an rsm the like of which the army took thirty years in the forming and could never get enough of hervey thought he might easily despair of his own prospects of promotion if his fortunes depended on an orderly room like this as indeed it did he silently resolved that when the time came his own troop at least would have the bottom henrietta had spent the day writing letters to those with whom she was on calling terms to inform them of her new quarters these were small but comfortable in a terrace near the heath with a coach house to the rear and a welltended garden she had been content but now she was not at all pleased hervey promised it was strict necessity i have to have the troop out for a night none of them seems to remember when last they did anything in the dark and with the major general threatening to put us all through some scheme or other instead of just a review next week theres really no time to be lost you will not be gone more than a night i dont much care for this place on my own he assured her he would be back by the time she was breakfasting have you taken against the house no not the house she said shaking her head then what i just do not like our being parted so soon my darling you would not have me sit at home when i know that my troop is in need of turning out he pulled the bell rope she shook her head i told you at longleat matthew when you go away i have a presentiment of your not coming back their manservant was at the door hervey smiled at him that will be all for the evening hanks i shall not be home tomorrow please be especially attentive to the shutters and locks when hanks had gone henrietta poured more tea how important is private johnson to your nocturnals hervey looked at her curiously if only he could tell her of johnson in the pyrenees on waterloo eve or the night in the forest at jhansikote he is indispensable she frowned again and hervey saw her intention you mean you would feel more secure were johnson in the house if hes indispensable then it is of no matter you think you might hold him hostage to my return you would have no harsh choices to make if he were here although jessye of course is some miles away the smile was now fully returned for henrietta was pleased with her tease then you shall have him hervey replied teasing her in turn with the impression of giving it careful thought and he would certainly prefer it to beating about the heath especially if this rain continues but you said he was indispensable perhaps i should have said that i wouldnt be without him when the time came she furrowed her brow you are funny you are so certain of things i could never be afraid if you were at hand you mistake me there my love im certain of just a very few things to do with soldiery learned the hard way i might add but beyond that shall you tell me of them that surprised him tell you of soldiery why not well i you have never spoken of it he had never spoken of it because it had never occurred to him to do so it was one thing to like pretty uniforms and bands quite another to be interested in their purpose it was true that many a fashionable female would try to get a view of a battle safe on a hilltop but he had never met any who wished to speak of war what a month it had been and what a change there came in things when lovers shared at last the secrets of the marriage bed how differently they looked to each other and others to them how differently they spoke and of what things which sometimes the morning would blush to hear and now henrietta would have him speak of things so wholly beyond her comprehension that he feared she might loathe a part of what he did but they daily became more intimate whether by a look a word or a caress and so he must trust now in what she had said about there being no secrets they sat late into the night talking he began with thoughts and then secure in her estimation as he had never been before he told her at last of deeds he told her all that had ever troubled him or as much as she would permit for once or twice she stopped him and said with great tenderness that she did not have to know any more they retired well after midnight after some of the candles had given out but they slept little it rained all next day hervey and barrow were together in a troop office ruing the weather while outside some distance away at the guardroom the orderly trumpeter was struggling with the semiquavers below the staff for afternoon defaulters a knock at the office door covered his final c which cracked as he overblew trying to be heard above the torrents come called hervey hoping it might be johnson with something hot but it was only the squadron subalterns come to ask if the scheme were still to be had at which hervey looked at his fellow captain and smiled nothing so bad dye suppose as that day in he could have said any number of places in spain sluiced top to toe with water colder than ice but instead he chose to include them all before waterloo barrow nodded but could not quite forbear to humble the lieutenants and cornets by saying that neither would there be lancepoints pricking at them through the rain they left sheepishly no doubt to repeat the admonitions when they in turn received the enquiry from their juniors when they had gone barrow declared that their concerns had been proper enough the weather would take its toll of the mens uniforms and with the major generals inspection so close it would mean more expense and trouble in truth hervey had already been minded to abandon the scheme but on the other hand so torrential a downpour especially if it continued during the night would test the squadron more than any general could it would reveal what he must do in the short time before the inspection and so in the middle of the following morning they left the barracks marched on parallel lines of advance to chobham common throwing out scouts for five miles along the river ash finding fords and swimming points and eventually occupied a vidette line on oystershell ridge at last light at midnight hervey and barrow rode the line finding varying degrees of vigilance and at dawn they began a rearguard which took them back again to the river there they picketed its bridges blowing them and retiring in the face of the enemy and then galloped to seize them again they proved their carbines soon after the old hands largely with success the young ones largely without then hervey and barrow inspected every shoe and were agreeably taken by the permanence of the farriery the rain had continued throughout the night with little respite but it had stopped after first light the sun soon had men and horses steaming before even the final gallop so that if spirits had been at their lowest ebb before the false dawn they were restored by the time herveys trumpeter blew cease firing just after nine and those restored spirits were lifted still further when after a short trot to the red maid at bedfont the quartermasterserjeants turned out a warm bran mash for the troopers and tea rum beef and potatoes for the dragoons on the ride back to hounslow hervey and barrow gave each other their opinions of the work for the most part herveys estimation of b troop was favourable but barrows of a troop was markedly less so youve some clewedup corporals he said and armstrongs prices beyond reckning but its that serjeantmajor of yours kendall just hasnt the zeal for a troop and it gets to the men you need rid of him and quickly there was much else besides little of it agreeable so that stables was a muted affair when they got back to hounslow though herveys dragoons seemed pleased enough brightened by the exercise and the encouraging words he had managed to find to finish his otherwise critical peroration at standdown he left the barracks an hour before watchsetting he was late for dinner very much later than he had anticipated and he was discouraged by how unhandy the troop had become since paris if only the fourth piece of tape could be armstrongs instead of kendalls he resolved to make it his first objective with lord towcester and between now and the major generals inspection he would have to use every spare minute to lick his troop into shape and all he would have to do it with was the sandtable and his imagination henrietta was already reconciled to the lateness of the hour and she listened tolerantly to her husband as he scarcely drew breath while recounting the battle of chobham common bidding her stay even as he took his bath and then denying his hunger to explain how he intended arranging things better for thursdays inspection she had long since dismissed her servants and arranged a sideboard that would not greatly deteriorate by the hour braised crab figpeckers cheese strawberries and claret come she insisted when hervey had said he would take only a minute or so to dress put on your gown and come to eat i have something to tell you she kissed him on the lips smiling conspiratorially and led him to the dining room he took in the sideboard with some delight if also with dismay for while the champagne he had been sipping was an extravagance he might justify as a reward for his exertions their supper seemed rather more than he deserved or indeed could rightly afford well what is it which prevents my dressing he teased as he spooned some crab onto her plate private johnson is a very good sort henrietta began he spoke very freely you know he was not in the least bit ill at ease hervey smiled he could well imagine it he told me that things are not at all happy in the barracks but i told you that but do you know that your serjeant armstrongs wife has been teaching in the regimental school running it by all accounts since the regular teacher is ill hervey knew that too but how does this make for unhappiness because lord towcester when he learned of who she was declared he would not have a papist and an irish papist at that teaching the regiments children except that he apparently used words altogether too coarse to repeat hervey put down his knife and fork caithlin armstrong was a wellread woman he himself had introduced her to greek the regiments children would find no kinder or cleverer teacher at least for the modest outlay it was prepared to make i wonder that serjeant armstrong has not spoken of it he sighed a little bruised he has too strong a regard for you what do you mean i mean that he would not wish you to risk lord towcesters wrath when there is quite evidently little chance of his changing his mind hervey looked at henrietta for a few moments contemplating the suggestion what do you think is it so foul a thing that the children be taught by a catholic henrietta did not answer at once having achieved her purpose in alerting him to the news he would soon hear while warning him against precipitate action your duke of wellington would say so hervey was not so sure of that proposition the dukes views were sundry in the matter of ireland how do you know my guardian dined with him last year and he was root and branch against removing the penal laws there hervey realized he had strayed from the point but i first asked what you thought my dear matthew she is irish of the meanest sort how can you presume her loyalty in all things but plenty of irishmen have spilled their lifeblood for england these past twenty years and she is a catholic what sort of notions might she fill the childrens heads with oh henrietta dearest you dont suppose she would teach them that their parents are all damned to hell i dont suppose anything matthew all i suggest is that with two such grounds for anxiety lord towcester might be said to have just cause to be cautious hervey saw that yet again she had skilfully evaded his question you have still not given me your opinion truly ah she smiled my opinion is that caithlin omahoney caithlin armstrong is a very dangerous woman look at the trouble she caused in cork hervey went bright red and almost stammered that is very unfair on all of us matthew sweetest i only tease her smile revealed it too he picked up a crab claw to compose himself then tell me what is your true opinion why do you wish to know my opinion cannot count for anything in such an affair the crab claw shattered noisily failing in the purpose for which hervey had taken it up why should a man not want his wifes opinion he was tired and henrietta was trying him for some reason or other it was not the soldiers welcome he had hoped for why should a wife wish to withhold it indeed because henrietta drew out the second syllable as if to emphasize her own dismay in his lack of perception she might be afraid of what her husband would do as a consequence i mean matthew that if i say i approve of caithlin armstrong you will feel obliged doubly obliged to take things up with lord towcester and i doubt that this would be felicitous you think i do not understand your character sufficiently but you would surely want me to do what was right you wouldnt want me to say nothing just in case i called down the wrath of the lieutenant colonel henrietta frowned oh matthew my darling it is not so simple as that is it you of all people know that to fight a battle when there is no chance of success is she seemed to be wondering how to finish her challenge contra jus ad bellum she smiled if it is so then it strengthens my point he sighed heavily very well then i shall say nothing i shall speak with serjeant armstrong though and try to find out if there is more its my intention anyway to speak with lord towcester to get a fourth stripe for armstrong then you must weigh things in the balance very keenly said henrietta sounding wise for his promotion is surely worth more to them than the few shillings the schoolroom would bring yes i know what you will say she added quickly seeing him make to protest but let the armstrongs be able to afford their pride before standing on it chapter eight taking the field hounslow barracks a few days later the major general commanding the london district was a shrewd man he knew all there was to know about the interior economy of a regiment and likewise its drill but all of this knowledge he had gained in the brigades of foot guards of cavalry regiments he knew nothing beyond what they had in common with the infantry which was not a very great deal he knew what to look for in a horse as did any general officer but he was all too aware that waterloo light dragoons would demand a careful eye he had therefore assembled a small inspecting staff of officers from the cavalry and horse artillery under the command of a waterloo veteran lately promoted colonel and a month or so before he had set the colonel the task of devising a scheme by which the sixths handiness in the field might be tested on the day of the inspection general browning and his staff rode into the barracks promptly at ten oclock general salute preseeent arms lord towcesters voice carried easily across the closed parade square the officers sabres lowered to the present just a fraction ahead of the lieutenant colonels guidon as was proper and the trumpeters dismounted sounded the first five bars of the lieutenant generals salute as was a major generals due the commanding officer trotted up to general browning on his blood chestnut to inform him that officers and men of the th light dragoons were ready and awaiting his inspection the general nodded in acknowledgement and then reined his charger left to begin his ride down the double rank of dragoons as the band struck up airs from figaro reported to be his favourite opera the real work of the administrative inspection had been completed the day before when the staff had examined every ledger and given every private man the opportunity to raise any grievance they had found the sixth to be in good order and there had been no notices of grievance the deputy assistant adjutant general a major of the coldstream had reported to the general that the regiment seemed somewhat sullen compared with when he had seen them last in belgium but added that there had been so many new recruits that perhaps it was not too surprising that they should lack the old confidence general browning was alert to the point however and as he rode along the front rank he too thought the mens eyes lacked just that something he had seen so often in the eyes of light cavalry a special sort of alertness eagerness perhaps well he was confident that colonel freke smyth would find out right enough when he put them through their paces on chobham common then he would know whether he had a regiment he could rely on for he could not rid himself of the doubt one way or other that nagged him still about the affair in skinner street the death of a young cornet in his district and the duke of huntingdons son too was not something that went easily with him after he had gone up and down the ranks the general complimented the commanding officer on the fine appearance of his men then the regiment rode past their inspecting officer in troops first at the walk and then at the trot wheeling and giving eyes right as pleasingly as browning would have wished to see in his foot guards be so good as to have the trumpetmajor sound officers lord towcester if you please the general said when he had dismissed the parade all officers my lord asked the trumpetmajor saluting as he drove his right foot down at the halt lord towcester looked at the general just the troop leaders and their subalterns the trumpetmajor saluted again turned to his right and marched off five paces to blow the officers call the quartermasters and other noncombatants the paymaster surgeons and veterinarians looked relieved when the call ended with the g for the next four bars would have summoned them as well as the squadron officers ten minutes later the squadron officers were assembled in the mess anteroom sit down gentlemen said general browning as he came in i wished to see your faces before the real business of the day began and to say that of one troop i hope to see very little for i have told your colonel that i intend taking it to act as enemy for the entire scheme he glanced at lord towcester a troop general captain herveys hervey bit his tongue someone quite evidently had to be the enemy but it implied that his troop was the one whose services the lieutenant colonel was happiest to dispense with he rose to identify himself very well captain hervey report at once with your officers to colonel freke smyth he will inform you of your duties while i give my intention to the regiment it should have been the junior troop f said seton canning when they were outside i dont want to hear your opinion of the colonels decisions hervey snapped seething with anger though not in truth at seton canning for he had worked up his troop so well in the past week that he wanted to see them tested herveys discouragement was allayed to an extent however when he learned what colonel freke smyth had in mind for them they were not simply to send men here and there with false reports or to hand the usual piece of paper to an officer there is an infantry picket on the high ground to your front instead they were themselves to manoeuvre as a troop in the face of the rest of the regiment which was to advance as if covering an infantry division on the march to first encounter these are your boundaries captain hervey said the colonel pointing out the roads and streams across chobham common which he had come to know so well in the last week there will be officers from the blues on either flank to ensure that neither your troop nor the regiment transgresses them and major jago from the horse artillery will be my eyes and ears with you yourself throughout hervey opened his sabretache to make notes and mind you warned the colonel looking him fiercely in the eye there is to be no faking no giving way to the other troops just to make them seem crack the thought had not occurred to him but hervey knew it must at some stage for it was only natural to want his regiment to show well major ormonde from the blues will ride with you too added the colonel you are to explain your intentions to him before any manoeuvre and if he disapproves you are then to follow his express instructions is that quite clear quite clear colonel good then let us now to the detail hervey had assembled his officers and ncos in the old taphouse by chobham rise he had left his troop in the hands of serjeant armstrong managing to contrive some plausible reason for not leaving them with the serjeantmajor who would bring them to the rendezvous as soon as their marching order and supply was ready when hervey had taken command of the troop he had asked to see the field standing orders and had been surprised to learn that there were none so he had dug up an old copy of those that joseph edmonds had written before they left cork for waterloo and issued them to his squadron for his own scheme he hoped that these would gain him a march for without regimental standing orders there were bound to be discrepancies between troops entailing lastminute alterations as the commanding officer noticed the lack of uniformity and hervey knew that he would need that time for his orders were for the troop to throw out a vidette line across the whole of the regiments frontage and so gentlemen he emphasized coming to the end of his own orders my intention repeated is simply this the first halftroop as the contact troop will observe the advance of the regiment from the great park at windsor and will fall back along the lines i have indicated he pointed to the excellent new map from the ordnance survey from which the ncos had made their own sketches on the flanks and a full three furlongs behind the contact line are to be videttes guarding against flanking marches in the event of the enemys attempting such a manoeuvre the videttes are to give battle briskly and to make out as best they can until relief comes i do not wish any of the remainder of the contact troop to exchange fire with the enemy unless it is absolutely unavoidable he looked at each man to emphasize the instruction let me remind you that in an action such as this the great object is to see fighting is merely a means to this end there are other means superior and less hazardous as we demonstrated on our scheme barrels clean then gentlemen and swords in their scabbards unless it is impossible to move within sight of the enemy it was as well that he laid emphasis on this now for the true instinct of a light dragoon he knew all too well was to draw his sabre and make straight for his man outpost work was never so exciting when they were denied a skirmish now hervey continued the communicating troop shall be formed of the second division you will establish your relays in the places marked i shall remain so far as is possible on this centre line he pointed to the old windsor road running north south across the common from here i shall send orderlies with reports to the controlling staff at chobham with me shall be a corporal and dozen men which you shall nominate he looked directly at cornet st oswald who nodded in acknowledgement and these shall be held ready at a moments notice as my reserve so having now repeated my intention do any of you have a question for some time no one spoke that much was pleasing thought hervey his plan must be straightforward and his explanation clear at length seton canning looked up from his map if i can cover the front and have a few men spare is there any reason why i should not patrol forward of the bourne rather than simply awaiting the enemys advance there is no reason that i am aware of from the staffs point of view hervey replied glancing at the directing officers majors ormonde and jago and in ordinary i should urge you to do so but by my calculation you will scarcely have a man to spare let alone a patrol see what comes though you know which is the priority if you can do more then so much the better are there any more questions gentlemen there were none well lets go to it and remember the generals orders are that we face the enemy not friends good luck it was the better part of two hours before lieutenant seton canning was able to report that his line of videttes was secure just after two he galloped back to the old coach road where hervey had planted his flag and there with cornet st oswald they made the necessary adjustments and arrangements for the relay points it had been many years since the sixth had carried guidons in the field but herveys trumpeter carried a lance with a yellow pennant and the letter a in blue so that his troop leaders position should be known at once by night a lantern with red and yellow glass would indicate the same for hervey had many a recollection of delay and confusion searching out a headquarters in some spanish village in the pitch dark do you have any men to spare to patrol forward of the bourne he asked his lieutenant more hopeful than expectant no sir in truth i could do with twenty more for the vidette line for the country is so trappy on the left flank im concerned the enemy might slip through hervey looked at cornet st oswald i could spare half a dozen though private men only good man send them to first division at once then he was gratified by st oswalds willingness to cede that number the cornets priorities were right enough as the assembly broke up hervey looked at his watch almost halfpast three a full hour ahead of the time they had been given to have the line set he commended his two officers yes gentlemen very satisfactory indeed i shall ride forward and check some of the videttes and pickets and then i shall take post back here by the appointed hour we are in for a long hard night i trust there are fires burning now for a warm dinner seton canning and st oswald smiled of that he could be certain they said hervey set off up the old coach road with his new coveringcorporal troughton had indeed shown well in the past fortnight and had sewn on his chevron only the day before along with susan his trumpeter and private johnson he found the picket well sited at the bottom of a shallow hill where the regiments advance guards would most likely have to commit themselves to one of two routes through the woodland the nco in command told him that lieutenant seton canning had ordered both lanes to be blocked so that the action of the advance guards in attempting to clear the blockage would reveal the intended route of the main body the dragoons had been busy therefore they had felled four trees across the sandy lanes closing them very effectively and had put up chevaux de frise which would cover the pickets withdrawal nicely if the enemys scouts pressed them too hard corporal sykes had always been a steady man thought hervey his own groom indeed when he had first joined for duty it was good to see him wearing his second stripe to such effect now where is the vidette he asked cheerily a furlong to the front by the spinney sir hervey could see the spinney clearly enough on the crest of the rising ground but not the vidette i see no dragoon has he taken post yet theres a couple of men sir ive put a youngster with broadhurst a very promising lad he is too they wont show themselves except to signal well done corporal sykes ill ride up there to see what they can see shall i come with you sir no thats not necessary ill ride straight there and straight back he turned to his escort stay here for the present theres no call for kicking up more dust than necessary lancecorporal troughton looked alarmed it was mock battle but a covering man had his duty all the same i shouldnt by rights let you off by yourself sir even to a vidette hervey had once taken a spontoon in his leg because he had got too far ahead of his coverman corporal collins would have said the same as troughton and he was pleased hed picked a man who could think for himself and was not afraid to speak up no youre right johnson medwell and corporal sykes to remain here then corporal troughton comes with me hervey put his gelding into a canter towards the vidette he had still not got used to the idea that jessye was no longer his charger besides anything harkaway was so green there again he had rather abandoned harkaway the splint had put the horse off the road for the best part of a year it was true but hervey felt he had not seen to his schooling properly since then indeed harkaway had done scarcely a thing for two years but gorge himself on the green grass of east cork and hervey had been hardpressed in the last month to get him to bend even a little and bring his quarters under the gelding had a good mouth though and a good turn of speed and above all he was honest hervey thought he could have him right by the time they went to brighton gilbert the grey would take longer however for he was foaled a full two years later if he could just keep harkaway between himself and the ground for the duration of the major generals inspection he would be well satisfied good afternoon sir said private broadhurst coming out of the spinney and saluting from the saddle of his little bay trooper he spoke confidently with a trace of a smile evidently taken by the captains visiting his vidette good afternoon broadhurst said hervey returning the salute and encouraging him to make the smile definite an english summers day what better thing could there be than a vidette ay sir theres nowt better and broadhurst meant it a more straightforward uncomplicated dragoon had probably never drawn pay his accent was that of johnsons county but from a little further north and not nearly so pronounced even so the other dragoons had dubbed him johnsons nip when he had first joined the troop have you seen home since returning from france hervey swished the flies from harkaways ears he would need the citronella soon no not yet sir i was hoping to have leave before the years out though after brighton that is im keen to see brighton hervey nodded harkaway was getting restless as the flies swarmed thicker where is your coverman broadhurst smiled at the idea he should have a coverman private wick sir hes a goodn and only eighteen hes posted the other side of the spinney keeping watch on the road shall i lead you through yes please i want to know his orders private wick heard them coming but only turned to salute when they were beside him so determined was he to have first sighting of the enemy he had joined after waterloo and fretted that he had not yet seen action especially of an evening in the wet canteen when the stories of that day were being retailed good afternoon wick said hervey smiling encouragingly at him do you see anything at all nothing sir theres not even a rabbit moved since i was posted hervey searched the ground with his telescope it revealed nothing too he handed it to wick see if things look different private wick had never looked through a telescope before no sir not different just closer hervey liked that and smiled to himself of course things only looked closer but a telescope was worth more to a dragoon on outpost duty than a carbine yet the ordnance had none for the issuing right then wick tell me your orders the young dragoon began without hesitating an instant i am to watch the road and all to my front between the white house on the distant far hill sir he pointed with his sword arm and the line of the stream to the right and i am to tell private broadhurst as soon as i see anything at all anything ay anything sir private broadhurst says that the enemy might disguise himself as even an old gypsy woman he said it with very serious purpose and he was right for broadhurst had known ruses like that in spain and what then shall private broadhurst do on report of a sighting he will signal to corporal sykes at the picket sir hervey turned to broadhurst your signal code he knew he hardly needed to ask might wick give it sir hervey nodded go on then wick said broadhurst with a smile i go to the back of the spinney sir where i can be seen by the corporal at the picket and put my horse to walking in a circle clockwise if the enemy is a cavalry patrol the other way if infantry and i put im into a trot if there are a lot of em well done wick said hervey how shall you know if they are cavalry or infantry at the furthest distance because the dust rises higher from cavalry sir and for infantry it is lower and thicker good and what if it is artillery and wagons then the dust isnt even its all over the place sir hervey was pleased and how might you judge the distance to the enemy at seven furlongs you can tell if the enemy is cavalry or infantry sir at three sir you can count eads and between one and two you can see what uniform they is wearing hervey turned to private broadhurst youve drilled him well and i think youll be the first to put the drills to the test for this is the enemys main route of advance by my reckoning will he go on through the night do you think sir hervey tilted his head we have to be ready for the possibility you are clear as to the signals then ay sir unshaded red lantern for enemy approaching carbine shot for alarm and when do you make the alarm wick said hervey turning back to the young dragoon if were surprised which we shant be said broadhurst emphatically or if the red light isnt repeated back to us by the picket added wick just so just so there was nothing more for hervey to test he was sure that if the duke of wellington himself were to ride up he could not find fault with this vidette he turned to leave but then a notion came to him are you a shropshire man by any chance wick perhaps it was the way he pronounced light as c troops serjeantmajor did and the town boys when hervey had been at school ay sir replied wick with a proud smile both at the fact and at its interest to his officer from shrewsbury sir have you been there sir what hervey liked about the sixth one of the many things he liked was the way the private men would speak up he had once tried to coax the most innocent opinion from one of darcey jessopes guardsmen only to be met with incomprehending silence and here was the youngest dragoon asking him a question i was at school there he replied at shrewsbury school sir the big school private wicks first syllable of shrewsbury rhymed with shoe and hervey was tempted to make a little sport for many a time he had got close to blows with the town boys over the matter he thought better of it though yes he said simply wick positively beamed my father kept the gate there sir indeed yes i remember now gaoler wick as we called him yes sir i knew as that was is name among the gentlemen replied the young dragoon proudly hervey shook his head well i may tell you private wick your father had a heart of gold but you will know that already many was the time i thawed myself by his fire and drank his tea wick was beaming with pride now is he well still a frown at once replaced the smile no sir he died two years ago oh i am sorry said hervey your mother is well provided for oh yes sir the school has given her rooms and everything she does for one of the masters the beam had returned hervey was doubly pleased for as well as making for a contented dragoon it was what he would have hoped from his old school well wick we can continue this at another time he pushed his telescope into its saddle holster there are things pressing elsewhere dont you think broadhurst how long would you suppose it was after us that the regiment left barracks private broadhurst thought hard for a moment well sir knowing ow things is at present they wouldnt ave left until everything were perfect at least three hours id say broadhurst didnt miss much either thought hervey in which case we should expect them within the hour and then therell be two more of good daylight left they could advance a fair distance before last light well beyond the bourne indeed the estimate proved right a little after six oclock the warning sentries began reporting that the videttes were circling the pickets stood to the relays brought the intelligence to herveys flag post and a galloper set off to the notional army headquarters with a firstsighting report at twentytwo minutes past the hour later the inspecting staff would compare timings thoroughly but major jago was already noting in his pocketbook that reports arrived with impressive speed and were handled with confidence and despatch herveys orders to the contact troop were that videttes should fall back on the warning sentries when the enemy came within carbine range for to remain any longer risked a ball in the back on retiring and there form a second vidette line while the sentries fell back on the pickets the pickets would engage the enemys scouts only withdrawing if the advance guards came up in force by which time the videttes and warning sentries would have taken post on the new observing line behind these lines hervey had carefully chosen from the map and confirmed from the saddle with his two troop officers and because they had practised the manoeuvres the week before he was sure they would be able to keep close track of the regiment during its passage of the common greatly outnumbered though his troop was it had taken the firmest resolve on herveys part not to be drawn forward himself his every instinct was to get a sight of the enemy and he had thought long about placing himself with corporal sykess picket but the best place for a commander joseph edmonds had always said was where he could best command from and with videttes and pickets thrown across the most part of a mile of bosky heathland that place was at the apex of a triangle which allowed reports to come almost as quickly from the flanks as from the centre line heavens it was frustrating though especially when shots began ringing out along the front but he knew he could trust his corporals not to allow their pickets to be overrun what about the flanks though hervey knew that if this were real battle he could expect to count on squadrons abreast of him but on this scheme there were none this did not matter the inspecting officer had said because the regiment would not be allowed to stray outside its boundaries what would happen at night though or with the dawns mist the enemy could stray intentionally or not and herveys flank pickets would have the devil of a job at night or in mist keeping station with the observing line two or three furlongs to the front would take the greatest address too on his own scheme the week before his flanks had been easily turned he had therefore insisted on two of the most experienced ncos being put to the task but still he was unquiet hervey now determined to employ observers behind the enemys line as the duke himself had employed them in spain the trouble was that he had scarcely men enough for the vidette and picket lines so he decided to take a gamble by detailing serjeant armstrong to the task this was a costly wager for he had wanted to place armstrong at the rally point instead behind the notional line of infantry two leagues to the rear where the troop would reunite and be revived ready for what the inspecting officer might order them to do next serjeantmajor kendall hervey feared was not up to seeing to a rally point by day let alone by night but armstrong behind the enemy was a premium he felt unable to default on there was nothing for it then but to trust the rally point to the troop serjeantmajor that kendall had botched it on last weeks scheme was a worry but was not that the purpose of the exercise that shortcomings could be rectified before today at eleven it had been dark for three hours and the action was still going well the good moon was working in a troops favour aiding both detection of the enemy and fast movement by the relays major jagos own observers were reporting that the picket line continued to retire steadily but without penetration while from herveys own dragoons there was a continual flow of intelligence on the enemys progress there had been a lull in the last quarter of an hour though and hervey was beginning to get anxious that something was amiss major jago had pressed him for his assessment and he had had to admit the possibility that the enemy might have trickled through his line here and there after all they were hardly greenheads but it was also true that by now the regiment had been advancing for six hours tiring for both men and horses perhaps more so than withdrawing in the face of that advance might it be the short halt then suggested hervey saddles fast bridles off and nosebags on and water from the runnymede ponds where the last reports said the advance guards had reached major jago had smiled appreciatively on hearing the assessment and said he would leave him to his own devices for a while sir whispered johnson as he came into the old pannage hut which now served as herveys command post hervey thought it strange he should be whispering with quite so much effort sir he repeated and with some insistence gesturing towards the door the lantern was bright enough to read a map by but it only cast shadows across johnsons face and hervey could not make out what it was he wanted the door scraped open and hervey shot to his feet at the sight of the general officers cloak you did say i might share your bivouac said henrietta pulling off the tarleton and smiling wide what in heavens name are you doing here gasped hervey where did you get that cloak and those plumes how did you get here he was about to ask a dozen more questions when she stopped him with a kiss he glanced awkwardly at johnson who was making a show of looking the other way henrietta still smiling began to rearrange her hair as if nothing were more normal hervey glanced anxiously at the door the last thing he needed was to have the inspecting officer find dalliance instead of alertness my dear we are in the middle of a battle what are you doing in a hut then well we are he realized the absurdity of trying to explain johnson would you ay sir replied his groom no need to spell it out sentry duty the other side of the door he allowed himself a grin as he squeezed through and henrietta grinned back when the door was pulled shut she kissed him again but longer hervey pulled open her cloak and slipped his arms around her what she kissed him again i couldnt very well ride in a skirt he was too nervous of discovery to be shocked whose breeches they were he simply could not imagine and in truth he didnt much care for she filled them very handsomely dont pretend you disapprove didnt the queen of scots ride like this hervey shook his head in halfdespair i am very tired she smiled i am not surprised where shall you lie down tonight he shook his head again he would dearly like to lie down this very instant to put out the lantern and trust to johnsons vigilance i cannot lie down for a minute the enemy could be close by us even now well said henrietta a cavalry bivouac is a chaster place than ever i have heard of and very dull does anyone know youre here who brought you she gave a little laugh the regiment was so taken up with getting itself to chobham i just followed them no one seemed to notice me how that could be so he simply couldnt conceive but how then did you find me when we got to egham there were a great many spectators and all the regiment were telling them what they were about to do hervey shook his head a dragoon loved to share his secrets and i heard one of the officers saying that he was off to give you a surprise what did he mean i wonder i dont know but about twenty of them left soon afterwards and so i followed them hoping to see you and then well at length they just turned into an inn yard and the officer said they were to stay there until night where was this hervey began to feel anxious again henrietta look puzzled the plough at addlestone i think it was i rode on a little way hoping to find you but i became quite lost and then an officer from another regiment happened by and he seemed to know exactly where you were and he brought me here what was his name he didnt give it she said blithely he had no idea who i was and i thought it better not to say quickly he found addlestone on his map johnson his groom opened the door gingerly sir ask mr st oswald to come here at once what is it dearest henrietta seemed puzzled that her scanty report should have caused such alarm addlestone is well outside the boundaries of the scheme from there those dragoons will be able to slip behind my picket line and theyll avoid even the flank picket if they strike a little further south first who was the officer with the party that you followed henrietta didnt know for she had yet to meet them all what colour were the horses she smiled chestnuts all e troop strickland he nodded he will have drilled them keenly it could be sandys or binney with them the troop officers both are capable enough the cornet came into the hut squinting a little in the sudden if dim light he saw henrietta and then looked at his troop leader curiously not a word st oswald not a word no sir i of course ive just learned that about twenty men from e troop under sandys or binney were lately assembled here he pointed to addlestone on the map which makes them very well placed to slip behind our line if indeed they are not already doing so cornet st oswald glanced at henrietta again his admiration for his captain grew daily whoever would think of sending his wife as an observing officer the flank pickets ought to pick them up but if they ride south any further then theyll be missed st oswald nodded do you want me to go there yes it looks to me as though their best move would be to come in on this road here about half a mile behind where our line now is he pointed out the lateral road which cut right across the area of the scheme it was one of his own reporting lines a line which would serve to get his pickets back in hand if they were pushed too badly before it the more hervey studied the map the more it occurred to him that the slackening of pressure all along his front was more than just fatigue the regiment had checked just sufficiently forward for e troops party to get in behind his own line without colonel freke smyths staff suspecting they had come from outside the boundaries for he might be persuaded that they had found a gap in the picket line and slipped through that was cunning hervey thought no on second thoughts it was devious there was a difference he looked at henrietta thank god she had come that way armstrong had missed stricklands men but then he could not have been expected to be everywhere at once sir called one of the dragoons outside excitedly a rocket hervey dashed from the hut the firework was just beginning to fall but its smoke trail was clear enough it came from the right flank from almost exactly where he made the lateral road to be armstrong hes there after all cried hervey with a little note of triumph and grabbing his cornets arm thomas take your halfdozen dragoons and make the biggest demonstration you can take my repeating carbine you know how it works well enough it will make your party sound twice the size let me get one of major jagos men first though the affair will need an umpire cornet st oswald was pleased no end with the plum major jago himself now appeared with his lantern what do you make of that rocket hervey he enquired suspiciously it isnt a congreve thats for sure no sir admitted hervey noticing henrietta concealing herself from jago i bought it two weeks ago in london and then he wondered why he was being so guarded it is the alarm signal from one of my videttes on the flank i believe there is an incursion i am sending cornet st oswald and six men to intercept it would you send one of your staff with them i shall go myself come on young man jago called to st oswald matthew whispered henrietta when he had gone that was the officer who brought me here when i lost my way hervey groaned major jago he suspected was not a man to miss much the question now my love is how we are going to take you back again that question presented much less of a problem than he expected for soon after cornet st oswalds successful affair on the flank major jago received word from colonel freke smyth that the scheme was at an end and that all of the regiment was to assemble at first light on the green at addlestone so that the condition of the horses might be assessed by the veterinary surgeons and farriers of the blues hervey had no doubts that the regiment would be adjudged exemplary in this but he was surprised that the officers received a separate order to assemble at the plough inn for it had been the invariable practice for them to attend at any such parade but general browning wished to breakfast with them and that was that hervey was therefore able to ride with henrietta as far as the crossroads short of the village from where johnson would escort her back to hounslow hervey felt a deep glow of satisfaction as did his subalterns after the order to cease fire major jago had told him that not once had his picket line been penetrated by so much as a single scout and that the affair on the flank had been the sharpest piece of work he had seen in many a year he had not asked about henrietta but something in his remark about unorthodox tactics hinted that her identity and her part in things had not gone unnoticed but it was herveys ploy with serjeant armstrong and indeed with armstrongs own conduct that brought jagos especial praise armstrongs orders had been to remain covert unless it were absolutely necessary to do otherwise the rocket had been a desperate and expensive expedient to warn of the incursion now that the whole world knew of the wheeze hervey couldnt very well keep his stratagem secret he would surely have to admit that he had set his serjeant to follow the regiment from the outset he began to fear that jagos praise was doubleedged his fear soon proved not to be groundless lord towcester was beside himself with rage when he learned of the rocket and that it had been fired from behind the outflanking party poor strickland was mortified later to discover how his troop had been the cause neither did it help when general browning complimented hervey in front of the other officers on his sharp action to counter the penetration at least he made no mention that the penetration was the result of someones disregarding his instructions as soon as breakfast was finished and the major general and his staff were gone lord towcester made to leave and without a word his adjutant however marched up to hervey and addressed him sharply captain hervey his lordship is very severely displeased that you should have sought throughout the inspection to thwart his ambition he did not wait for a reply turning on his heel instead and striding out after the commanding officer hervey was speechless you too said strickland i had the foulest tonguelashing of my life as we came here i should have known better than to trust to a damned papist was what lord towcester said to me the mans a mountebank hervey sighed the catholic relief measures had still a way to run evidently i wonder how much a mountebank may do before he is called to account i fear were in for a very hard ride indeed chapter nine for the sake of example hounslow barracks july it was a black day indeed for the sixth only the regimental serjeantmajor and the two senior troop serjeantmajors had been serving when last there had been its like and that had been in flanders when pitt had been prime minister and wellington had been but a lieutenant colonel that campaign two decades past had been a wretched affair indeed perhaps the depths to which the incompetence of the horse guards could reduce an army and the basest to which human nature without discipline could descend in such circumstances it was widely believed that condign punishment was all that held a regiment from becoming a rabble but here in hounslow a posting town little bigger than a village the question of whether the flogging of a dragoon was necessary to maintain good order and military discipline was on the lips of every man in the regiment lord towcester had not the slightest doubt however private hopwood had struck an officer and he had done so in front of his troop entirely unprovoked his reason for the assault was both cynical and at the same time naive his lordship is therefore determined to make such an example of the man that it will arrest any tendency to the striking of officers said adjutant dauntsey in reply to herveys intercession on the mans behalf but there has been no tendency to the striking of officers indeed there has not been a single case in my entire time with the regiment hervey pointed out and a flogging shall ensure that the regiments record is restored you do know captain hervey that his lordship might have imposed a penalty of death hervey knew it perfectly well striking a superior officer along with mutiny desertion plundering burglary with violence giving false alarms sodomy carnally abusing children ravishing women and riotously beginning to demolish a house could bring a man before a firing squad or the hangman and yet the details of the offence were so bizarre as to trouble the sternest of disciplinarians i should like one final attempt to persuade his lordship to further clemency said hervey careful to make acknowledgement of the concession so far i shall convey your request to his lordship captain hervey is there anything else no there is nothing else hervey replied in his heart he knew that lord towcester was not for turning but that could not bar his trying it soon became clear too that major joynson wanted no confrontation with the lieutenant colonel the major sat in his office surrounded by ledgers and sheaves of paper and evidently regarded the question of hopwoods punishment as a distraction to his work hervey there hasnt been a flogging in years that i grant you but then there hasnt been a case of violent insubordination either it wasnt violent insubordination insisted hervey shaking his head in despair it was no more insubordination than than hervey sighed do you know all the details sir i know that a dragoon called hopwood struck mr seton canning in the face with his glove in front of the whole troop do i need to know more you were not at the court martial sir do you know why he did it is it of any consequence in one sense the major was entirely correct a private man striking an officer was an unallowable occurrence but the majors manner suggested to hervey that his submission in the business was entirely pragmatic if there was nothing he could do about it then why provoke trouble hopwood struck seton canning because a man from the fusiliers had told him that striking an officer brought deportation he has a wife in australia whom he abandoned three years ago believing her to be untrue to him and he has learned that she was accused falsely and he is in despair of seeing her again and yet i am unmoved sir i relate the story not to excite sympathy for him but to show how unmalevolent was his intent i know that may sound strange at first but it was no more an act of rebellion than the major sighed and took off his spectacles rubbing his eyes wearily though it was not past nine hervey has it ever occurred to you that the threat the possibility of the lash no matter that it has not been used in twenty years may hold some of the regiments meaner sorts in check that this flogging irrespective of the offence may keep others from transgression in the future not insubordination i mean but generally there was undoubted logic in the majors argument and hervey was conscious of beginning to sound like those evangelicals who went round calling for the prisons to be made comfortable and the poor laws bountiful but flogging had not been the sixths way and the regiment had pulled through the severest times without it with respect sir i do not believe that many in either the officers or the serjeants messes share that view the major put his spectacles back on and looked at him severely you have not been discussing the matter with them i hope hervey no sir hervey tried to conceal his mounting exasperation i should not dream of it there is talk of nothing but the matter in the canteens the canteens how do you know that captain hervey oh sir this time he was not going to trouble to conceal his dismay or even to answer directly the talk cant be anything other than injurious to discipline for it implies that striking an officer is the most heinous of crimes in the lieutenant colonels judgement unless that is he intends restoring the lash for any number of offences hervey i should be very careful were i you we do not wish any more trouble than we have already with respect again sir that is my intention also that is why i am come before you the major took off his spectacles once more are you sure you are not drawn into this too far because the dragoon is from your troop hervey could not follow his reasoning his obligation to act was precisely because hopwood was one of his troop i mean joynson explained that you may be seeing in this an affront given that the lieutenant colonel has been so obviously displeased with you since the generals inspection this was a terrible prospect indeed had lord towcester ordered the flogging to humiliate him and his troop would a lieutenant colonel order a dragoon to be flogged solely to humble his officer no surely not surely not even a man who had run from battle hervey breathed deeply and shook his head to dispel the notion what is mr lincolns opinion hervey sighed the major beginning to polish his spectacles i do not think that that is anything to do with you the major was right of course outside herveys own squadron matters were the preserve of the regimental staff no indeed sir hervey conceded i will take my leave then i have requested a hearing of the lieutenant colonel i thought one last attempt at yes hervey the major interrupted his voice seeming almost to tremble do not think that i do not admire your dedication to principle and indeed to your men but the last thing hervey wanted now was major joynsons shrift thank you sir im very much obliged for your time and counsel we can only pray that it turns out well he put his cap back on saluted and left the majors office and with a truly heavy heart we can only pray echoed joynson softly alone now one hundred lashes the law allowed three times that it should not be impossible to bear prayer was indeed all that remained for hervey was unable to gain a hearing of the lieutenant colonel lord towcester remained out of barracks until the hour appointed for the punishment and hervey knew that any appeal in public would not only be to no avail but might prejudice the peace generally at midday the regiment turned out for foot parade in full dress with side arms the officers in front of their troops it was a solemn affair without the usual banter from the ranks only the words of command and these muted broke the heavy silence from time to time private hopwood was marched onto parade under close escort and with him the halfdozen other prisoners in confinement at the time so that they too might experience the benefit of his example when he reached the centre of the front of the regiment he was halted and the adjutant stepping up to the commanding officer and saluting received a sheet of paper which he proceeded to read aloud it detailed the finding of the court martial and the sentence awarded hopwood stood erect throughout so that only the guard at his side was able to detect the involuntary trembling which he struggled hard to control hopwood had not been at waterloo but one could readily suppose that his conduct there would have been as it was now hervey felt anger welling as he wondered by contrast how the earl of towcester would have stood seton canning five paces behind had been at waterloo and he would rather have been there this day he it was who had received hopwoods blow it had not been much of one and it had certainly not drawn blood canning had also been the first to ask the court martial for clemency on the mans behalf yet still he could not but feel that what he was about to witness was in some measure his fault the reading finished the regiment received the order fours right from major joynson in a faltering voice and the band struck up seventeen come sunday it was so curious a choice that it had the reverse effect from that doubtless intended for as the squadrons marched to the riding school by its merry tune the resentment was almost palpable at the doors the squadrons halted and fell out to line the sides four deep at the furthest end opposite the door stood a wooden triangle six feet at the apex and next to it the farriermajor and two brawny farrierserjeants jackets off sleeves rolled up and each holding a catoninetails beside them stood the trumpetmajor in full dress hopwood was marched up and halted he placed a piece of silver in the trumpetmajors hand a custom which not even the adjutant had recalled until lord towcester reminded him the regulations said the trumpetmajor was responsible for training with the cat the trumpetmajor then marched to the door to take up his post and when he was out of sight of the lieutenant colonel he threw the coin as far as he could and with unconcealed contempt hervey saw it but he could take no satisfaction in having told major joynson the affair would have that effect lord towcester in a clear voice gave the order proceed the farrierserjeants seized the prisoner and tied him to the triangle hopwood made no struggle it seemed he was trying the while to meet his punishment squarely but although he had stood without support he could not now control his bladder and the wretched dragoons incontinence became at once apparent to all hervey felt tears come soon hopwood was firmly triced up his shirt stripped from his back and a leather gag placed between his teeth the farrierserjeants took post either side of the triangle at attention lord towcester was allowing the moment to have its full effect but the chaplain hitherto silent and who indeed had made little impression on the regiment since his joining six months before stepped forward and bowed to him my lord he begged have mercy now on this miserable offender as we hope our lord himself shall have in the dreadful day of judgement lord towcester went a deep shade of red when i wish to hear you reverend sir you may be sure that i will let you know proceed farriermajor sir there was not another sound in the school the farriermajor raised his right arm its muscles tightened the veins swelled down swung the lash with a sickening crack on hopwoods bare flesh one called the farrierserjeant hopwood writhed as no one had ever seen as if the lash flayed his spirit from one side of his body to the other blood oozed from where the thongs cut deep into his side his back vivid with great weals two dragoons fainted behind hervey he heard them fall and saw three more across the school one or two men were already pushing their way outside to throw up hervey had prayed hard that hopwood would not cry out but the sheer force of the lash drove the air from his lungs his mouth already open in shock the gag expelled hervey looked across at lord towcester he could not be sure but his face had a look of triumph at the sound one of the farrierserjeants picked up the gag brushed off the dust and jammed it hard into hopwoods mouth a rough but necessary kindness two cried the farriermajor laying the cat a little higher this time opening new wounds and making more weals but hopwood had clamped his mouth hard this time and there was nothing but the noise of the lash despite everything hervey felt pride swelling in him there were other ways to demonstrate courage than on the battlefield three hopwoods back was now a livid mass of raw flesh blood dripped to the sand four five six methodically the farriermajor continued the count the strokes falling regularly ten to the minute past twenty and still the odd dragoon fell in a dead faint twentyfive yet hopwood made not a sound the farriermajor stood back and the surgeon stepped forward to feel the prisoners pulse as the regulations demanded he is fit to continue my lord he declared shaking his head sadly and then he signed for the punishment to proceed hervey thought to appeal now on account of hopwoods fortitude but he reasoned that the lieutenant colonel would surely see that for himself and might indeed be inclined to order the full punishment to run if he interfered the farrierserjeant now relieved his senior and the farriermajor took up the count at the fortieth lash hopwood suddenly gave a convulsive jerk and then hung limp the surgeon raised his hands and the falling blow was diverted he felt hopwoods pulse again pulled up an eyelid to examine the pupil then stepped forward to the lieutenant colonel my lord he can bear no more a sigh of relief went up from all officers and men alike without a word lord towcester strode from the riding school the farriermajor threw a bucket of salt water over hopwoods back untriced him and handed him over to the hospital orderlies seton canning made to go to him but hervey caught his arm not now not now he said kindly but emphatically as they left the school ezra barrow came up to herveys side a word if you please shall you come to my rooms in barrows quarters in the mess he was not married the captain from the ranks produced a brandy bottle and two glasses i can send for water if you prefer dont trouble said hervey i think my stomach could do with it undiluted barrow poured until the glasses were full sat heavily in an armchair and took a large gulp of his ive a mind to send in my papers hervey ive never been opposed on principle to touching over as the regiment is supposed to be but neither ave i seen any occasion when i thought it was truly necessary perhaps once when i were a young trooper two men ad got horrible drunk and spoiled another mans wife but never since then the strange brummagem vowels had returned as strong as ever hervey too had taken a large measure of the brandy and was beginning to feel its powers ive heard it said there is something of a mans spirit thats for ever broken when hes been flogged that however his body mends hes never the same again barrow nodded ive heard that as well all men are different mind do you know what was mr lincolns opinion of the matter the rsms opinion was always inscrutable outside the orderly room barrow took another gulp of brandy i do even an rsm must confide in someone and its only natural to confide in one whos been in that seat himself and i said confide hervey hervey would dearly have known the rsms opinion for it was so rarely given and mr lincoln had served the longest of any man in the sixth i hope you wont send in your papers barrow it seems that strickland will and soon enough therell be no one but towcesters lackeys besides aught else your dragoons wouldnt thank you the glasses were by now full again cods hervey my troops wellfound its true but theyd no more miss me than they like a gentleman not one as is like them under the skin you know that as well as i as a rule hervey knew it to be right but though there was little actual love for barrow in the ranks there was respect nevertheless barrow your troop would follow you thats the important thing is it not of course theyd follow there are serjeants behind them hervey frowned would follow willingly barrow huffed and drank more brandy brightonll be one turnout after another towcester will be lashing the whole regiment before a week i havent the stomach for it it may not be so bad we might see inside the prince regents pavilion tried hervey with a sort of smile hervey i dont like saying this it goes against everything ive held to in two and a half score years in the service but yon earl of towcester is a bad lot hell fall foul of the horse guards sooner or later they all do but hell lead the regiment a pretty dance ere then and a lot of men shall pay a heavy price hopwood me you even ive been trying to tell myself that it wont be so bad once we have real work to do maybe barrow conceded though not sounding convinced but if i had the means for what to let them in authority know what is his true nature i would hervey understood that the financial stake for barrow was too high and perhaps in its way it was for him too he shuddered at the notion it must never be so he told himself he must act disinterestedly always and if a man like barrow was driven to thoughts of defiance then was it not time that he himself made such a stand when hervey returned home that evening a little before eight the brandy was no more than a dull headache for he had turned out his troop for sword drill in the afternoon to sweat the flogging out of them it had been a woeful affair to begin with for serjeantmajor kendall seemed wholly incapable of exercising any mastery over a body of men and had it not been for the most judicious and surprisingly tactful intervention of serjeant armstrong the parade might have become like a shambles of a busy morning he had wondered when he could be rid of kendall when he might raise the matter with lord towcester he had even discovered lately that the serjeantmajor had managed to get himself and the commissary wagons thoroughly lost during the generals inspection where but for the early finish to the scheme there would have followed certain disarray in the troop but at the moment hervey could not broach the subject even with the adjutant for such was the strong detestation in that quarter that a request to have the man moved would only be met with accusations that he was trying to deflect the blame for his own shortcomings there seemed no end to his problems the heavy silk curtains in the drawing room were closed and candles burned brightly although it was still light outside the house was a picture of elegant comfort rather than of luxury a good place for a soldier to withdraw to henrietta greeted him warmly johnson has just this minute left she said holding her cheek to his lips he told me about the affair at the barracks i am sorry my darling it pleased and touched him that she should understand so perfectly a hideous business he sighed deeply i should have been home before now but there is a bath drawn for you why dont you wash away the day and then come to me as if it were a fresh one ive news that should interest you from wiltshire she gave him a puzzled smile yes is my father to be made bishop wait and see dearest said henrietta indulgently i shall expect you down in half an hour and then i shall tell you all his bath was a restoring exercise but when hanks poured water over his head he had a moments vision of the salt water and private hopwoods back he made an effort to put that from his mind though for henrietta did not deserve to have to share the sixths troubles he dressed quickly and returned to her side hopeful of diverting news from wiltshire henrietta was holding a glass of champagne which she loved better than any other wine hervey might not himself have chosen it in the circumstances but the regiments trials were not to be hers and so he took the glass which hanks proffered well he said with amused anticipation what is it in wiltshire that will interest me henrietta waited until hanks had closed the door behind him and then gave her husband another kiss my dearest princess charlotte is with child hervey tried hard to conceal his disappointment at news that was of such little moment to him had he not heard it before too my darling what is and so am i sensations of every kind came over him he was dumbstruck henrietta blushing a little smiled at him matthew i am wondering why you seem so surprised there has scarcely been a day when this was certainly true even on the night of the generals inspection he took her in his arms shaking his head with a sort of unbelieving pride but i do believe it was the day when jessye went to the stallion he reddened and then became anxious shouldnt you be sitting resting have you seen a doctor is there matthew she put a finger to his mouth he kissed her with the greatest tenderness whoever could have thought that the day might end as well as this it is not ended yet my dear she whispered and i am not suddenly become as a piece of china hervey was ready for the rude rebuff the curse profanity obscenity whatever it was to be for he was the mans troop leader the officer in whose charge private hopwood now was punishment having been carried out joseph edmonds had told him when first he had joined the sixth that it was unfair for an officer ever to confront a man when his senses were dulled by alcohol or fired by another spirit for if the man then acted violently by word or worse the officer was in truth guilty of provoking it hervey knew that private hopwood was scarcely able to rise from his bed and assault him but what if his verbal abusing was loud enough to be heard by all the others in the sick bay what if the abuse were directed not at him but at the commanding officer the adjutant the farriermajor at anybody indeed who might then prefer a charge of insubordination would he hervey have the right to overlook such a thing as he was prepared to do now should the invective be directed at him personally but hopwoods reply was silence at first hervey thought hopwood might not have heard him being still drowsy perhaps from the laudanum private hopwood he said again thinking at least to give him back a little dignity in addressing him by his rank is there anything i can do still hopwood made no reply hervey was now caught between anger at the refusal to speak for the man was still under discipline even prone in his sickbed and compassion for his evident wish to be shot of officers he would not leave though without first making hopwood meet his eye but as he moved closer to the bed he wished with all his heart that he hadnt for hopwoods eyes were streaming a continuous flow of tears as if all will to stem them were gone and every drop of that soldiers spirit which had made him face his punishment so bravely the day before was being washed away hopwood was no longer a man in age three or four years his captains senior he was not even a child hervey turned to leave but as he did so came the extraordinary sound of hymnsinging not the doleful stuff of corporal sandbaches prayer meetings which even lord towcester had not thought worth suppressing nor even the regimented chorus of a sunday church parade but a fullthroated rendering of he who would valiant be by how many hervey wondered it sounded like half the regiment he hastened outside to find his troop and the chaplain hats off heads high the sound would be carrying throughout the barracks and easily across the square hervey glanced towards the orderly room where the lieutenant colonels pennant was run up the pole lord towcester was certainly at orderly room the windows were closing one by one all that is but mr lincolns henrietta was on her day bed and did not hear him come in my dear hervey stammered as he saw her are you unwell she turned to see his anxious face and laughed no i am tired it was not yet ten in the morning but matthew she protested coyly he saw her tease at once and kissed her forehead why are you home so soon is anything wrong hervey shook his head then shrugged oh i just didnt want to be about the barracks why ever not ordinarily it claims you stronger than i can that is not true matthew i am not complaining you might not be quite so much the man if i had you all to myself he frowned then realized she was teasing him again what has sent you home then he sat at the edge of her bed i went to see hopwood the dragoon who was flogged yesterday oh she said her face becoming less animated do you want to tell me of it would you mind she sat up and took his hand of course i should not mind why should i mind your speaking of anything which is making you unhappy did you not listen to anything that mr keble said when we were married he smiled sheepishly you carry the evidence my love they kissed but she broke off and pressed him to what had made him return it was as if we had thrashed the very manhood out of him said hervey shaking his head i cant think that is right even for his offence even for twice the offence she raised her eyebrows a look that implied she might agree with him if i were a soldier i should want an officer who felt as you did what do you suppose would be my chances of getting one it was a curious way of putting the question he wondered if she thought him alone in his sentiments my darling he said smiling gently at her you flatter me but you must not suppose that mine is a lonely opinion since before i joined the sixth they were known to be a regiment that did not flog it was if you like a point of honour with the officers that we did not need recourse to it to prevent riot or desertion no doubt there were some men who took advantage of it but the regiment was never found wanting on campaign and we were by no means unique im sure that not one in four regiments of cavalry used the lash in the peninsula the point is this business may have driven something of a wedge between the men and their officers they assembled this morning to sing hymns outside the infirmary hymns of all things and they sang most defiantly it does not bode well she nodded and took his hand again what shall you do he sighed i had a word with strickland after seeing hopwood do you know he is on the point of leaving hes continually subjected to insults for his religion by lord towcester henrietta said that she did not know barracks gossip had yet to establish its conduit to her other than by johnson who so far seemed inclined to allow only a trickle and what did you say i told him i had a mind to go and see lord sussex that the colonel ought to know about the unhappy state of affairs generally but he begged me not to henrietta looked hesitant i am very glad that he did do you really suppose it would do any good it is lord sussexs regiment yes she conceded frowning but a man such as towcester will not be without wiles and how do you suppose things will turn out if lord sussex is unable to take your word against his lord towcester has put a deal of money into the regiment you said so yourself i dont think that would affect lord sussexs judgement not his judgement matthew i am sure lord sussex would know that what you said was the truth but his judgement might be that the greater evil could come of taking action against lord towcester hervey saw her point and sighed again in any case i had already decided against it what have you decided instead or have you not he paused as if thinking how to explain i spoke with serjeant armstrong we are going to try to get hopwoods wife to come here from australia and that will repair things she asked doubtfully the troop want to buy his discharge for him but that wont restore his pride that we shall have to do by degrees when he returns to duty she nodded again in agreement with his reasoning has serjeant armstrong said anything else about hopwood no about caithlin no hes reconciled to her leaving the school shes to find some other work i think something in the town perhaps henrietta knew that already she had shared a dish of tea with her in the prince rupert only yesterday i mean that she is with child too no he said not a word she is only surprised it has not happened before now hervey almost observed that a serjeants quarters did not provide the same opportunity that they enjoyed do you know my love he said instead smiling armstrong a father it is a very serious thing he may never be inclined to a headlong charge ever again chapter ten the landing the sussex coast september the downpour was so heavy that herveys reins kept slipping through his fingers and he had to wedge his insteps in firmly to save losing his stirrups driven almost horizontal by the wind the rain lashed his face viciously and no matter how he bent his head water found its way down his neck and inside his tunic shirt how the carbine locks were faring he could only hope the men had bound them with oilskin before leaving the billets but that had never been entirely proof against damp and this storm on the downs was as bad as any he could remember in the astorgias and he had to keep his head up because the night was so black he could see next to nothing beyond his chargers ears he would have dismounted and led had the gelding not somehow been able to maintain a better pace on the rough road above the cliffs perhaps because the chalk gave him a trail perhaps because the sides rose two feet behind hervey were thirty dragoons or rather he trusted that they were there for he couldnt see them and he certainly couldnt hear them he could trust though because serjeant armstrong was at the rear had the other halftroop not been at lewes for the assizes he would have taken them as well and then at least he would have had two officers if that is the lieutenant colonel had let him lord towcester had raged like a wounded beast when the revenue men had come to his orderly room coast duty coast duty ive not paid thousands for new jackets and shakos to have them ruined chasing smugglers i shall protest to the prince regent himself but the chief officer of his majestys excise had been unmoved i regret the inconvenience to your lordship but it is not every day that intelligence such as this comes into my riding officers hands we stand to apprehend contraband and owlers at one and the same time lord towcester had not been in the slightest degree animated by the prospect however only by the cost in appearance of his regiment the latter was not something to which hervey himself was insensitive nor the other officers but it seemed to him to be a cost that could be recovered whereas the revenues opportunity was not by now hervey knew the downs quite well having ridden out most mornings first on harkaway and then gilbert and he had been glad to do so for the lieutenant colonel had been in a bate since they arrived a fortnight before lord towcester had expected to be attending daily at the pavilion but the prince regent had not yet come sending word that princess charlotte was not able to travel and that he felt it his paternal duty to remain in london until she was able but now a full two hours after nightfall hervey was becoming worried they were supposed by his reckoning to take a right fork at the top of the beacon ridge and by his same reckoning they had made that distance easily already yet without finding the fork indeed if anything they seemed to be going downhill he was regretting not waiting just a little longer for the revenue guide but they had stood horses saddled for more than an hour in the expectation of his arriving and he had despaired of making the rendezvous if they stood any longer he knew the old windmill well it could be seen for miles it should not have been difficult to find were it not for this storm now they were most certainly going downhill his stirrups told him so where in heavens name were they he couldnt see the moon threequarters though it was let alone a star the wind was still in his face perhaps a shade round to the right side but no more than it might have veered the sea must therefore be to their right still but had they overshot the beacon ridge or had they turned fuller west and not made the crest at all it was no good asking anyone behind him they had scarcely stepped off the welllit streets of brighton since arriving one of the dragoons might somehow have seen the fork however but how long would it take him to go down the line anyway and it would hardly inspire confidence he reined about and halted by private johnson just behind i cant find the turning to the windmill we havent passed it have we johnson had only ridden this way a couple of times he didnt know the fork but he seemed certain they hadnt passed one as certain as anybody can be in this lot sir with such a proviso the reassurance was of no practical value thank you johnson said hervey disconsolately and then he cursed go and get serjeant armstrong we may as well see if hes certain of anything too i only said as i found johnson protested hervey knew his problems were already too many to go upsetting his groom any tea im not bloody merlin capn ervey he could imagine the grimace of a smile even if he couldnt see it go and get serjeant armstrong then the column stood patiently even the horses as if submitting to the rains whip was just a little more bearable than struggling and catching its sting awkwardly hervey wondered how dry was his map though what use it would serve he couldnt imagine it would be a sodden thing in seconds if he tried to read it even under his oilskin cape and there was no more chance of lighting a lantern than of unwrapping a carbine and expecting it to fire he swore even worse not bothering now to keep it below his breath for the noise of the wind and rain would have masked it beyond two lengths even if he had bellowed serjeant armstrong came forward cursing the dragoons to make way whats up sir i mustve missed the fork to the windmill well ive seen none but things are so black im not sure i wouldve seen it anyway where are we do you think hervey was trying to keep his voice no higher than need be to speak above the storm but it still felt like shouting words of command on the square i think were towards ovingdean all we can do is push on down this way and hope we find some landmark hope wasnt a principle of war hervey had said it so many times that johnson had even quoted it back at him once well this wasnt war and in any case he couldnt think of any alternative if they retraced their steps there was no guarantee they would do any better than before except that they might just meet the revenue guide he called for the corporal up came sykes a good man hervey considered him but no collins he would spell out the orders ride back down the route out corporal sykes and if you come across the revenue guide bring him on at once after us ill leave a vidette if the road forks that done they resumed the march hervey was soon praying that hed done the right thing for in a further halfhour they had found nothing by his estimate they must have gone another mile and a half perhaps two and they ought surely to be coming off the downs and across some signs of habitation whether they were marching east or due north where in gods name were they just as hervey was beginning to contemplate desperate measures splitting the troop perhaps and sending them to the four points of the compass he caught a glimpse of a light ahead just a flicker but a light unmistakably he pressed his legs to the girth and harkaway lengthened obligingly he wondered how he should close with the light this was hardly enemy territory but the revenue men had said they were up against villainizers who would not hesitate to fight and they had the means to do so but he had lost so much time already they should have been at the rendezvous an hour or more ago well it was a rule of patrol work and one which had never served him ill in the peninsula to take the risks early he therefore decided to risk now and instead of deploying in order to overwhelm any opposition would hold the troop where it was and send two scouts forward he himself would be one of them serjeant armstrong please he called back to johnson serjeant armstrong called johnson to the man behind and so on down the line up came armstrong within the minute at a fast trot yes i see it sir im going forward to look hervey didnt need to say more armstrong knew his business johnson at twenty yards the light revealed itself to be a lamp in a window but it was another ten before they were sure the window was that of the turnpike lodge how in gods name have we come so far said hervey aloud for he reckoned they must have been riding due north and this was the lewes high road ahead johnson closed alongside eh sir christ hervey slid from the saddle and handing the reins to his groom doubled to the lodge and knocked loud on the door moments later he heard a bolt being drawn and then the spyport slid open who be it captain hervey of the sixth light dragoons quartered at brighton i need your light to see my map more bolts were drawn and after what seemed an age the door opened hervey entered at once taking off his shako and cape and pulling out his map in its oilskin im much obliged to you keeper the lodgekeeper was an oldish man solid easy in his manner hervey looked him up and down carefully for it was always possible the man might be an accessory to the smugglers but what clue might give away the association he didnt know he spread the map dry as a bone thank god on the table and pulled an oil lamp closer where exactly are we maps were not something the keeper was familiar with though he could read ovingdeans but a mile down the road to the right sir the answer was enough hervey located the lodge on the ordnance sheet and took out his hunter great gods a quarter to midnight it was later by an hour than he had thought but the map showed a lane to the windmill from the turnpike just a few hundred yards on a lane no doubt decent enough to take corn wagons one way and flour the other if they kicked on they could be there in half an hour who has passed through since nightfall he asked giving the keeper half a sovereign the dover coach sir nothing else not on a night like this hervey folded up his map and wrapped it back in its oilskin is the road to the windmill easy to find it is sir replied the keeper helping him on with his cape a furlong almost exactly theres a milestone there hervey thanked him and put on his shako i shall leave one of my dragoons here i may need him to give directions the keeper said he would be happy for the company outside it was still raining as hard and seemed worse to hervey for his having been sheltered from it for ten minutes the night too seemed blacker but he knew his eyes would soon become used to the darkness again if only the cloud would break and let through some moonlight how on earth were they going to see their quarry let alone arrest them hervey remounted and trotted back to the troop armstrong had made the dragoons dismount despite the oaths and cursing that the saddles would get sodden broadhurst please serjeant armstrong private broadhurst the next for a chevron doubled up the line and stood to attention almost peak to knee with his captain sir broadhurst that lights a turnpike lodge theres one keeper there i think hes straight but i want you to watch him inside and if corporal sykes and the revenue guide arrive tell them that weve gone on to the windmill the keeper will tell you by which way just have your wits about you generally and wait till relieved sir broadhurst saluted and doubled back to fetch his trooper how long is it to the windmill sir asked armstrong already mounted and gathering his reins half an hour if we can get a move on theres a good track to it a furlong down the turnpike he turned and called to johnson ay sir your eyes are better used to this kick on to the milestone and find the cart track off to the right well come up as fast as we can hervey was happier now he could feel some momentum again how much their late arriving at the rendezvous would prejudice the revenue operation he had no idea for its details had yet to be given him as they rounded the lodge and gained the turnpike he pressed his gelding to a careful trot he didnt want to come down on slippery metal at this stage but two minutes was all it took to find johnson and now at last he was confident of finding the windmill a mile and a half to the right up a wellmade track the ground rising all the way minutes later harkaway checked else they would have collided a horse was squareon to them standing stockstill in the middle of the crosstracks hervey had barely turned alongside when he realized it had no rider and there were more horses to front and rear christ he cursed as he wheeled and reached for his sabre but a blow on the shoulder blade almost made him miss his grip he ducked to harkaways neck to escape the next one spurring him to turn on the spot to meet the assault alarm alarm he shouted and lunged forward in the saddle to make an uppercut into the darkness his sword failed to make contact alarm ran the length of the column though what in gods name they could do in this light hervey didnt know trumpeter trumpeter he called repeatedly until johnson found him and then armstrong and finally susan medwell i think weve run on the owlers train shouted hervey serjeant armstrong take half a dozen men left along the crossing track and ill go right johnson stand with two men to picket the track ahead about fifty yards and detail another two as videttes here then he told off the same number and struck along the drove determined to take one prisoner at least but the packhorses were gone and though hervey rode for a furlong and more he could find nothing he dared not leave the drove for fear of losing himself what would the owlers be trying to do now they wouldnt still be making for the shore not with dragoons and for all they knew the revenue men on their heels they would double back seeking safety inland surely he turned and led his men back the way theyd come it was no easier a business than leading them out and he almost missed the crosstracks even with its vidette if only the rain would cease theyd at least have an extra couple of yards to see there was no sign of armstrong had his serjeant had more luck sound rally he called to susan herveys trumpeter managed it very well considering the gale cracking the octave descent only once in three repeats in the ten minutes it took armstrong to return hervey thought over his options he could abandon the mission altogether the owlers would surely be abandoning theirs and now alerted to the presence of troops the contrabanders would hardly risk a landing but that decision ought rightly to be the revenues or he could throw out a cordon in the hope of intercepting the owlers at first light he might well catch them still trying to come off the downs or he could give up the owlers as lost and make for the rendezvous with the revenue could he throw out a cordon and tackle the contrabanders only with another two dozen men yet he was reluctant to let either opportunity go johnson i want you to gallop for me johnson was knee to knee with him but still hervey was having to raise his voice against the wind ay sir back to brighton yes to captain strickland his troops the nearest give him my compliments and ask if he will send as many men as he can spare twenty at least to the road back there tell him whats happened and ask him to lay up along the turnpike to catch the owlers as they beat back ill go on with serjeant armstrong and the rest to try to meet with the revenue do you have all that ay sir shall i follow you up once im done no itll be best that no one comes east of the turnpike that way we should avoid mistakes and youd better remind them the password is wellington stricklands cordon was a very long shot indeed and his own chance with the contrabanders was perhaps no greater if only the guide had shown if only he hadnt missed the fork it took them threequarters of an hour to cover the remaining mile to the windmill for the going in that pitch darkness was as hard as any he could remember in spain and he was especially wary of running into the owlers again as they broached the windmill rise he saw the reassuring flicker of a storm lantern and then by its light the same revenue riding officer of the afternoon good god captain hervey we were within an ace of opening fire he called why in heavens name are you come from that direction hervey didnt give their flash powder much of a chance in this weather even inside the windmill but you could never be sure and even one ball might have struck flesh at that range pointblank the guide didnt show in over an hour so we set out as best we could we came on the owlers a mile back and theyve scattered to the winds ive sent word back to brighton for reinforcements to picket the lewes road and then we came on here as fast as we could the riding officer looked dismayed youd better come inside by lantern light sacking shielding the windows hervey was at last made privy to the revenues information and intention an ordnance map like his own was spread on a table and the officer his face a chiselled image of incorruptibility pointed to the route by which he believed the owlers to have come theyre seasoned hands captain hervey the wool isnt theirs so their first instinct will be to save their own skins though they wont abandon the packs unless they have to my estimate is that theyll lie up on the downs until they can be sure of their escape route your men on the lewes road will frighten them thats for sure but it would take two more lines each from the road to the sea to be sure of netting them will they alert the contrabanders its a good question said the riding officer taking out pipe and tinderbox i should say not though for they owe nothing to the wetfeet as they call them the two ply their own trade independently its only the economy of using the same vessel that attracts them theres no honour among their like hervey peered closely at the map where is it you expect the landing here said the riding officer confidently we have our sources you know hervey continued to study the ordnance sheet but how on a night like this will any vessel be able to find the cove let alone heave to and send out boats the riding officer smiled its a very fair question yet the answer is simple there are lights placed on the headlands in such a way as to guide the craft to the very place from which to launch its boats lights which we cant see from land exactly captain hervey but there are other methods you know hervey looked abashed i have a cutter stationed offshore watching for those very lights said the riding officer proudly her instructions are to signal me with her observations but if she signals will that not alert the smugglers and those with the lights the riding officer smiled indeed so that is why she will signal only if there are no lights after midnight the danger of signalling a negative had been drummed into him as a cornet yet he could see there was no alternative in the revenues business and how do the contrabanders do their landings the riding officer looked grave usually they first land a dozen men maybe two dozen to secure the place where the contraband is to come ashore ive known as many as fifty picket a cove for a rich cargo hervey was puzzled i should have thought it far easier to have men secure a place from landward true said the riding officer with another wry smile and thats how it used to be but with so many troops watching for bonaparte these past twenty years it became too hot to assemble on the coast now that things have quietened well see a return to the old ways no doubt hervey nodded so do we speak of englishmen or french who will come ashore frenchmen for the most part there are plenty of the old grande armée keen to earn some gold and by god theyll fight they wont scruple in the slightest to use their firearms hervey was not especially troubled by this but the relative numbers were not good if the french were to put fifty men ashore they would outnumber him more than two to one taking account of the horseholders ordinarily that wouldnt trouble him either but in this darkness with this rain and with mutual support so difficult is this a rich cargo do you expect the landing to be in any strength the officer looked grave again indeed i do that is why i asked for a whole troop of regulars hervey raised his eyebrows is something amiss i have fewer than thirty men for an instant the riding officers bile was roused but his selfcontrol had been too many years in the making i confide that the deficiency will be no fault of yours captain hervey but this makes things damned tricky id intended that we should take the vessel and everyone about the business but this weather was already making that a forlorn hope and with insufficient men we stand little chance of taking the landing party all we can safely do is seize the contraband and the porters and the lightmen for theyll have information of use to us it will have to be with the sabre too for we couldnt trust to pistols and carbines in this rain the riding officer agreed let us talk of the details then hervey found the riding officer to be a practical man that he wanted keenly to close with the contrabanders was beyond doubt but he was not so reckless as to expose herveys dragoons to unnecessary danger for as he explained they would succeed at the very least in putting the porters to flight without their uncustomed cargo the design they worked out was therefore to send a party to the beach a halfmile or so from where the landing was expected to work along under the cliffs until they were in a position to mount an attack which would separate the porters from the contraband a second party would meanwhile work along the clifftops until they came across the lightmen the light on the other side of the cove would have to be left for they hadnt enough men to mount two simultaneous approaches hervey was able to tell each and every one of his dragoons what was the design crowding them into the mill in their two parties cheered by the fervour of the sweats who were only too happy to have another go at johnny crapaud and by the eagerness of the greenheads to claim their first laurels with the old enemy he was at pains to disabuse them of any notion that it would be an easy affair however and the revenue riding officer likewise warned that these were men who would fight hard for their money as well as for their lives at one oclock more than three hours later than the riding officer had hoped herveys dragoons began their final approach march the rain had eased considerably the wind had dropped so that speech no longer had to be in a raised voice and it seemed just a fraction less dark than before the going was easier anyway with a guide and they quickly found the path to the beach hervey with serjeant armstrong led twelve of his most experienced men down its precipitous length slipping and sliding and cursing but with nothing worse at the bottom than a dragoon with a twisted ankle he had put the other party of eight in the charge of one of the revenue men for he dared not risk fewer than seven horseholders and even that would be a trial for so indefinite a period the two parties had no way of signalling to each other so which of them was to begin its work first would have to be left to circumstance ideally the lightmen should be apprehended first before they could extinguish their beacon or else any commotion on the beach would have them flee if only the revenue could see exactly where the beacons were but so cunningly shielded to landward were they that only by coming right up on them could they be fixed down on the beach it was distinctly lighter the chalk cliffs and the sea seemed to be reflecting the faint moonlight piercing the breaking cloud and hervey could now make out his men at three paces though it was still not enough to exercise any degree of control if it came to a fight the wind was little more than a breeze now and the rain had been stopped for a full ten minutes now was the time to unwrap the firelocks and load it took only a minute with these dragoons yet even that was one minute more than it took armstrong to slip a bulleted cartridge into herveys percussionlock hervey himself carried his repeater he carefully unwrapped the primed cylinder and fitted it to the carbine surprised how quickly the real test of its handiness had come in single file with armstrong at herveys side and the riding officer at the other they advanced at a brisk pace to close the halfmile hervey counted the paces shorter slightly than he would have managed on firm ground but three for every two yards nevertheless by his reckoning after his fifth hundred they saw lights ahead one well to the left evidently on the contrabanders ship the others almost directly to their front dimmer and moving how far ahead it was not possible to tell theyve begun to bring the stuff ashore said the riding officer their pickets will be posted therefore wed better be ready it struck hervey at once if the lights were visible from here they must already be at the picket i think we should two blinding flashes and two reports made louder by the cliffs echo came an instant later the riding officer fell back clutching his stomach wick tansey shouted hervey see to mr poole remainder extended line at the double advance a shingle beach at the double this was a trial even for a rifleman number from the left begin shouted armstrong his voice carrying as it always did the dragoons numbered off breathlessly after two hundred yards they were struggling to keep in line from the cliff bottom to the waters edge and beginning to blow as hard as their horses after a good canter but they knew that if they didnt get to the lights quickly theyd face more determined resistance another hundred yards hervey could see armstrong was with him on the left and another dragoon close in on his right there were more flashes and earsplitting reports pointblank he levelled his carbine as he ran and fired once twice three times all by instinct for there was no target to see armstrong fired too as did the dragoon on his other side hervey could now make out figures by the lantern light at the waters edge a welter of fire came his way from front flanks above and behind then screams shouts curses oaths hervey fired four rounds in rapid succession in an arc to his front threw down the carbine and drew his sword from the left number he bellowed one two five six nine ten came the numbers then armstrong sir four men down but armstrong still there thank god another fusillade brought fresh screams from his left lie down reload hervey shouted but he knew that with momentum gone and the cover of darkness he would never get his men forward now even were armstrong to drive them all he could do was hold his position and harry the french with fire as they withdrew for they surely couldnt continue the work with the threat of dragoons so close he was wrong just as the riding officer had said these men would fight in a few minutes more fire opened again in their direction and there was movement too keep up a steady return serjeant armstrong lets try to fool them were more than we are from the left count to five fire shouted armstrong hervey ran from man to man to reassure him with the hand the furthest dragoon to the left was bleeding badly from his leg finch the oldest sweat but he was still reloading as if at musketry practice hervey called him by his nickname as he bound up the wound with a silk square choky dont let those waves get to your powder we cant abandon this place now the appeal was direct and finch knew it must be desperate i know sir but dont leave me to them french if you as to pull back i can limp with an and i promise said hervey gripping his shoulder but its as bad a scrape as ever i saw the volleying to their front increased and hervey knew they must soon be overrun for the french would have gauged their numbers from the puny return of fire captain ervey captain ervey hervey swung round and saw johnson and the horseholders eight more carbines and sabres rally here rally here he shouted standing and waving his sword extended line fire there was firing to his right too from atop the cliffs they might just be able to hold their ground surely it must force the french to withdraw but that wasnt why they were there just to hold a line on the beach stand up light dragoons draw swords prepare to advance advance how many were with him hervey couldnt say but he could hear serjeant armstrong shouting by the centre how magnificently futile an order clever though for the dragoons would be trying to dress instead of worrying what lay ahead double march hervey bellowed then it was crunching of shingle cursing and blowing and then a terrific explosion in front the discharge high grape whistling over their heads the rush of it felt in the face even down screamed hervey what in gods name had they there he pushed his shako back and shouted again serjeant armstrong another explosion just as loud with grape feeling as if it were raking their backs armstrong crawled to his side swearing terribly lets give em a volley from ere in case they rush us hervey prayed theyd managed to reload stay prone light dragoons one round fire it was a ragged volley but he counted eight shots perhaps more enough please god to dissuade the french from charging theyve swivelguns in them boats thats what it is armstrong spat hervey could see nothing still then well be swept away if we press them any more weve got to take one prisoner at least sir i can work along the cliff bottom and try and snatch one in the dark ill come with you hervey shouted for johnson no sir youve got to stay here else these buggersll take fright just keep up a fire to distract them french heres your carbine back ill only need a pistol butt armstrong the fathertobe had lost nothing of his instinct for the charge hervey rued what the assignment had become a desperate confused contest hand to hand would he always have such a man as armstrong when it came to this chapter eleven the pen and the sword brighton next day what the fornicating hell do you mean captain hervey a halftroops horses gone stricklands troops uniforms in tatters dragoons killed hervey bit his tongue hard the preposterous sequence betrayed lord towcesters priorities very plainly the horses and uniforms touching on his pocket the dragoons of no financial consequence to him and the death of a revenue officer would not disturb his lordships thoughts in the slightest unless that is it might reflect on his own efficiency but what was his commanding officers sincerity to hervey who stood before him with the blood of that officer and four dragoons on his hands and nothing to show for it nothing smugglers escaped with not so much as a flesh wound and with their contraband socalled owlers disappeared into thin air with their wool if there were any owlers in the first place hervey had begun to doubt this himself though he resented intensely the sneer with which it was intimated the words hissing from lord towcesters slitted lips like steam from a kettles lid your lordship i have said that i acted as i saw best indeed sir indeed you take things upon yourself too freely it is your indian ways again my regiment is at brighton to guard the prince regent it is not here to chase about after miscreants and frenchmen you hanker after the french war do you sir then why do not you exchange into some indian regiment and sate your lust for battle there the lieutenant colonels tirade continued a full five minutes more throughout hervey remained rigidly at attention his left hand holding his sabre scabbard his shako under his right arm never ever had he been bareheaded on parade before in all the times as a cornet and lieutenant that he had found himself answering for some indiscretion or misjudgement he had never suffered the indignity of being ordered to remove his headdress truly it was an effective device for belittling a man for humiliating him indeed for it took away his surety his sense of being an entire soldier hervey listened to the acid stream of denunciation selfpity and threat with a growing feeling of hopelessness nothing he had done before and certainly nothing he might say could mitigate his delinquency in the eyes of the earl of towcester what power did a commanding officer of cavalry possess for good or evil it was a power that hervey believed he would never now possess for himself whatever the earl of sussexs aspirations how right henrietta had been to urge caution on him though last nights events made that caution seem at once worthless well captain hervey concluded lord towcester waving a hand in airy dismissal there shall be an inquiry and thereafter i have no doubt a court martial and if you are fortunate enough to escape a cashiering i myself shall require you to resign your commission at once and so you may as well begin now to find an indian regiment with fewer scruples than it has officers you will hand your sword to the adjutant and you will dismiss sir as bad as the lieutenant colonels invective had been hervey had not expected this last his mouth fell open and his fingers could hardly work to unfasten the swordbelt when the surrender was done he bowed turned to his right made himself count two three slowly so as not to be thought of as bolting and marched from the room outside he replaced his shako and pulled his gloves tight he saw or thought he saw the clerks and orderlies glance his way to where his sword had hung what was their regard of him now was he the cause of death of their fellow dragoons or was he merely a curiosity an officer an olympian cut down reduced perhaps to a level below even their own he walked from edlins gloucester hotel a headquarters improvised in the manner lord towcester considered fitting for the prince regents escort not knowing whether he would turn right or left it did not matter now for he neither commanded a troop nor had leave to be about the regimental lines he ought to confine himself to the mess by rights but he did not suppose that even lord towcester would insist on this punctilio all he could do was go to his own quarters the little rented villa off north street and explain things as best he could to henrietta when she returned from london that evening and then he must trust to the due process of military law a hand grasped his forearm come on sir said serjeant armstrong hervey made no reply content to follow he walked as if in a dream past the regents pavilion and on towards the maze of streets beyond he saw faces rich and poor alike that seemed different from only a day before the faces of men and women for whom the future might look bleak but which was nevertheless a future without dishonour and how he envied the poorest of them that serjeant armstrong he sighed as they turned into a street of alehouses i dont think that drink no sir not one of these just gan on a wee bit farther hervey had come to find armstrongs tyneside as reassuring as he used to think serjeant stranges suffolk though more years must pass before ever he could trust to judgement as wise as serjeant stranges armstrong now stopped by a coffee house and nodded to its inside ay itll do very well said hervey gratefully just managing a smile it seemed an unusual sort of place for armstrong but once they were inside the connection was revealed caithlin mrs armstrong hervey had not seen her in a month and more what do you do here she came from hounslow last week explained her husband weve a room upstairs in exchange hervey was suddenly agitated on account of her condition but could not find the words even to congratulate her on it take a seat captain hervey she said with a smile that had lost nothing of its warmth for all the incivilities she had abided these past months as hervey and his serjeant settled at a table in the seclusion of a window bay caithlin armstrong went to bring them coffee it was a respectable enough occupation for a serjeants wife for the habitués of this place were solid citizenry but hervey could not help thinking of all that learning put to naught she had more knowledge than half the fashionables who promenaded about the regents pavilion yet it would remain closeted because of its origin and hers for her learning was of the hedgerow schools and her latin of the vulgate rather than the æneid does caithlin know of last night she does not then you will have to tell her soon i could just wait for the news to pass by the usual means hervey sighed i fancy this is not an event to be retailed by the canteen route armstrong lit his pipe i wouldnt be too sure the canteen often as not gets things in a proper light it gets the truth from below as well as above if you know what i mean i know exactly what you mean hervey thought for a moment and i counsel you to have a great care this business will bring down many more than just me you aint done yet sir said armstrong with a shrug perhaps i deserve to be serjeant armstrong perhaps if id waited for the guide aw come on sir thats not how we were taught major edmonds wouldve tonguelashed anybody if theyd ever said they were waiting for orders let alone a guide it was true enough but i went at the beach too baldheaded wed lost too much time we couldnt have stalked it armstrongs eye was what every officer wanted in his serjeant and more but the lights serjeant armstrong the lights armstrong made to spit and then thought better of it what about the lights where would any sentry be posted armstrong didnt have to be pressed that was unlucky a few seconds more and wed have had the advantage and that first ball to fell the revenue man like that it was the devils own i was still too slow look sir yon was a cannily posted sentry in any case we stood our ground and they had to abandon theirs hervey knew it but in the end as lord towcester had contemptuously pointed out all they had succeeded in doing was scattering the woolpacks and sending the french back into the channel they were not in possession of a single bit of contraband wet or dry or any of its handlers two of his dragoons were dead and another three might join them by the days end finchll live sir never fear hervey smiled at the prospect you know i believe he was more afraid of being left on that beach than he was at corunna armstrong relit his pipe dying in the dark like that theyre all afeard of it whats it they say there are no atheists at night with a muzzle jammed their way thank god that hill and greenwood were single men but theyd mothers like as not it seemed perverse to wish instead that like johnson they were sons of the orphanage yet johnson had told him many times that he could never be a soldier with a mother anguishing for him caithlin placed a pot of coffee in front of them who had mothers none of our troop replied her husband with a smirk jack armstrong she put her hand to her breast just a manner of speaking love he looked indeed a shade chastened sit down a minute lass only a minute mind they drew up a chair for her hervey lost no time recounting events by the end he felt immeasurably better for the honest company of the armstrongs was the best of antidotes to lord towcesters spite henrietta returned some hours earlier than expected she looked troubled as her husband came into her sitting room and she did not rise to greet him princess charlotte is unwell she sighed inclining her cheek to him as he bent to kiss her hervey was sorry to hear it of course but it seemed strange that this should bring such gloom what is the cause henrietta looked at him surprised matthew she is eight months with child but how is she troubled she has had two miscarriages you know hervey did not know and she grew very large in the summer so that sir richard croft had to restrict her diet severely and draw off blood each day and i think this has greatly depressed her spirits for she spoke very freely of her fears you saw her only briefly she had asked me to take tea along with several others but then sir richard insisted on bleeding her again henrietta had herself engaged sir richard croft to obstetricate for he was acknowledged as preeminent in that field as indeed the physician should be who was to deliver the kings first greatgrandchild the princess is in the best of hands hervey pointed out but ultimately she is in gods hands sighed henrietta and he may have designs that are unfathomable hervey could not gainsay it but he saw no profit in contemplating the melancholy fact he moved his chair closer and took her hand she smiled at him a little thinly but even her anxiety could not dull the blush that had come in this third month of her own pregnancy she had not yet any swelling that he observed except he fancied in her bosom and her hair shone like a stallions coat he had never imagined that her attraction to him could increase so they kissed long and in doing so she seemed to forget her disquiet and he his own troubles why might they not forget them a little longer he rang for hanks and said they would not dine and that her ladyships maid might be dismissed for the evening the next morning henriettas spirits seemed largely restored so hervey hazarded to tell her of the events of the beach and lord towcesters reaction she comprehended everything at once the extent and implications the limitations and possibilities and at once she resolved to act she had extricated hervey from arrest in ireland when his excess of conscience and zeal had provoked a jealous authority and she saw no reason why she should not do the same now to henrietta indeed the exercise of influence was but a normal part of life she had friends and she had artfulness and the deployment of both for the good of her husband was entirely proper to her true she had been expecting to use her connections for his advancement rather than for his rescuing but it was of no matter the methods were essentially the same hervey was brightened by her spirits they had indeed been restored in the intimacy of their embraces the night before but that she should be so buoyant now after hearing of his miserable condition seemed remarkable princess charlotte was not mentioned once throughout their breakfast shall you rest today or do we go for a drive he asked quite carefree indeed i have no duties to detain me a dragoon without his sword he did not count for anything a drive perhaps later though for ive letters to write and i should not put them off he poured himself more coffee and then hanks brought in the morning herald and a letter for henrietta from longleat while she looked over the letters contents local news of a general kind from lady bath he turned the heralds pages one report caught his eye at once we learn of a very serious breach of the kings peace in the county of sussex two nights last wherein there took place a desperate clash of arms between his majestys forces and a descente of french smugglers of whom some sources have it that their numbers were close on a hundred a running fight with as many of his majestys dragoons has left a score of dead on both sides hervey sighed the scribblers art could ennoble the meanest affair what is it my love asked henrietta the first two pages of her own news not detaining her long he read it to her it sounds heroic he smiled ruefully there were neither a hundred frenchmen nor a hundred dragoons though there should have been matthew my love if someone wants to say there were a hundred frenchmen opposed to you then i should not be in any great hurry to disabuse them he smiled again no perhaps not what does the times say we do not appear to have it then we shall have to wait to see if they have any advance on a hundred henriettas selfpossession seemed remarkable she appeared not the least anxious for her own situation in connection with her husbands hervey was about to make some endearment when hanks entered again and announced that private johnson wished urgently to see him henrietta nodded and hervey bid him show him in johnson was in best dress he would explain that it was the surest way of being allowed to pass by the town patrols who assumed him to be on official business good morning your ladyship maam good morning capn ervey sir i thought youd be wanting tknow that weve got all torses back arkaway an all hervey was astonished how in heavens name theyd all run east and down into that valley that as that river the winterbourne ay sir thats why capn stricklands troop couldnt see ide nor air of em from tturnpike and who found them johnson smiled even broader they all came into ovingdean trottin behind tdover stage yesterday morning still saddled tlivery there caught em all this was good news indeed and it would draw the sting as far as lord towcester was concerned somewhat at least wheres harkaway now back in is stall right as a trivet but with one more leg johnson smiled im glad yer not too out of sorts then capn ervey henrietta smiled too i shall go to my sitting room to finish my letter and you may talk all morning of corralling horses i shall ask hanks to bring more coffee when she had gone hervey bid johnson sit at the table and tell him what other news there was not a lot sir capn strickland is in arrest too though not a lot just another troop leader arrested johnson frowned i thought you meant news in ttroop it was always well to remember the difference a private man thought little beyond his own troop any news man crowners quest on greenwood an ill today is it indeed that is very prompt where i think they said it were at tassembly rooms at what time twelve i think are you going to go sir most certainly i cant think why ive not been called to give evidence johnson looked thoughtful are ye sure yought to be gooin just pretend you never heard me say it what other news theres been a man from ttimes sniffin round since yesterday mornin but nobodys said owt as far as i know but es buying drink and offering money it wont be long before some gobby devil falls for it and what might he say johnson hervey had the distinct sense that his groom felt there was something to withhold anything e wants to ear that there were two hundred frenchies led by bonaparte himself so you dont mean that some might say we were wandering about the downs like lost jews herveys concern for the good opinion of the canteen was genuine as well as for the mischief the opposite opinion could make johnson shrugged ive been lost in worse places isnt that what appens in tdark not if youre an officer smiled hervey wryly but at least yknew where ywas gooin ive known some officers as didnt even know that johnson was ever frank it was one of the reasons he was still a private and one of the reasons he was still herveys groom and is there anything else oh ay there is trm asks if youd like to elp im wi a new orse es just bought up on tdowns away from things hervey was touched for the riding masters invitation to schooling sounded like a message of support please tell mr broad that i should like to very much and do you think you might look out some clothes for the inquest meanwhile ay right you are then sir johnson left through the door that henrietta opened she smiled at him as she always did and then turned to her husband with a look of some distress matthew have you not received any word from wiltshire of late no is there something wrong lady bath writes that your father is to be summoned before the consistory court herveys heart sank again but all that was finished he made his peace with the archdeacon months ago she raised an eyebrow evidently it was not a lasting peace there is no mistake ive heard nothing from elizabeth and she for certain would have written there is no mistake matthew lady bath gives dates and places here read it he took the sheet it read plainly enough ill apply for leave to travel to horningsham at once then he frowned ill not be granted it of course id better write at once the inquest into the deaths of privates hill and greenwood was pleasingly brisk the coroner was a nononsense sort of man who seemed not in the least dismayed by the attention the proceedings had generated especially the reporters from the london broadsheets who with others of the provincial press filled one of the galleries in the assembly rooms at the end of a brief deposition by the surviving revenue riding officer he directed the jury to bring in a verdict of unlawful killing in the case of both dragoons and adjourned the proceedings without elaboration in an instant the london and provincial hacks besieged the uniformed observers for some titbit to enliven their days copy for once hervey was glad to be in plain clothes and apart from his fellows all the hacks that is but the timess man who raced from the court to a waiting chaise and made off with great haste to the capital dawn the next morning saw hervey and his groom on the downs above brighton the air had a taste of salt but was invigorating and with no one as far as the eye could see but the riding master lieutenant broad and broads groom hervey could forget his woeful condition for the time being mr broad was another extract but hervey had taken to him from their first meeting broad had been in the ranks of the st dragoons lord george irvines former regiment for fifteen years before lord george had arranged his commissioning into the sixth after waterloo his predecessor as riding master who had been a rough rider under three rms had been diligent but somewhat rigid and though he had been generally respected there were some including hervey who thought he had become too averse to new ideas so that the regiments equitation though sound enough did not rise beyond the commonplace mr broad however was both his own and a woodbridge man in the question of the riding school he had surprised some in the sixth by his assertion that each horse and each rider was an individual and that it was his duty as rm to bring on both as individuals yet for the common task of the regiment these were progressive views indeed and hervey had wondered at first how well the rms own staff took to them the answer he had soon learned was well when he had first visited riding school on returning to the regiment it was evident how quickly the recruits absorbed their instruction broad must therefore have been as sympathetic with his rough riders as he was with his other charges for they it was who had the close care of the babies but broad was not without his detractors the adjutant especially abhorred his system calling it too comfortable and since the rm was directly subordinate to the adjutant there had been many turnups you see what i mean hervey he called from the chestnut blood circling at the trot hes just a fraction unlevel and i cant tell if its bridle lameness or the real sort hervey watched keenly as the rm schooled the troublesome chestnut broad had the lightest hands he had seen in many a year bridle lameness seemed unlikely with hands such as these although there again it was a very indefinite condition at the best of times in five more minutes broad rode up to him and dismounted id like to see him from the ground if you will drive him forwards in a long low outline get him to step under more with his hind limbs to get more impulsion from them and his back to swing more freely then i should be able to tell hervey lengthened the stirrups two holes and with johnsons help lowered himself carefully into the saddle wishing to judge the horses temperament by degrees rather than risk shocking him with a spring he began with shallow serpentines changing the diagonal each time for broad to judge the soundness of the leg but ten minutes of this revealed nothing good called broad i got nothing either what do you think i think theres some resistance in going forwards properly so did i can you start driving him then it was hard but hervey did so for a quarter of an hour until both he and the horse were sweating prodigiously then he brought him back to a walk to let him down i really dont think theres chronic unsoundness in this animal i rather like him indeed i just think hes been badly schooled bravo hervey my sentiments too hell have got butchers hands at a tattersalls doers they wont give a young horse time hervey jumped from the saddle and patted the geldings neck and so i shall buy him then a fortnight of this and hell have a proper rhythm back ill lunge him in a chambon tomorrow would you like to come again the day after thank you broad said hervey warmly as the rms groom took the reins thank you very much indeed in the hour he had been there he had not thought of their commanding officer once its a bad business hervey said broad abruptly offering him a cheroot hervey declined it what is a bad business everything the serjeants arent happy or the corporals it was a rude return to regimental matters hervey sighed an officer is owed loyalty he replied rather flatly it was the principle on which they had all been nurtured as cornets but then it had been easy enough herveys first troop leader had been joseph edmonds his last sir edward lankester and for the most part the lieutenant colonel had been lord george irvine it was not difficult to be loyal to men like these we have to remain faithful broad if for no other reason but that matters will be worse for our dragoons if we do not i know said the rm speaking with more than a little experience ive seen from below the trouble thats stirred when the officers are unhappy happy officers happy regiment exactly hervey stopped and turned to him what is it you are saying then that there has to be some prospect of improvement else nothing will reverse the ill spirits the rms discretion did him proud thought hervey he more than the quartermasters even would know the minds of the senior ranks not that that was supposed to be difficult joseph edmonds used to say that you always knew what your dragoons were saying and usually what your ncos were thinking but the officers rarely you know broad i believe were missing mr lincoln rather more than we might think the rsms long leave of absence was the single most aggravating factor some were saying it would be as well to promote another now said broad decidedly hervey frowned i cant see how you dont imagine hell return to duty do you why on earth would he not besides aught else he surely has hopes of being promoted now the rm frowned commissioned hervey not promoted hervey reddened no officer commissioned from that august rank ever considered he was promoted very well but i for one would be dismayed if mr lincoln were not back at his post before the year is out unless that is you know otherwise what i know is that hopwoods flogging tested his loyalty to the utmost lincoln was more opposed to flogging than you could have supposed the orderly room serjeant overheard the rsm in with the colonel and all ill say is that his lordship left him in no doubt that his opinion was of little value then it was very wrong of the orderly room serjeant to speak of it youre right of course hervey but only up to a point who can the orderly room serjeant turn to when he believes his loyalty to the rsm demands some action you might say that he showed more courage in coming to me than in remaining silent for he didnt know what my answer was going to be hervey conceded the point and what was your answer i told him hed discharged his duty to the rsm in telling me and that he must now discharge his duty to the colonel by telling no one else hervey hoped that he himself would have had the presence of mind to put it thus and so you are now telling me yes and i shall consider my duty completed in that too hervey nodded but one more thing why didnt you speak to the adjutant he is your proper superior and its his duty to advise the colonel hervey you ought to know full well that it would have been to no avail whatever a hollow gesture i exercised my judgement isnt that what an officers meant to do use his judgement rather than just carry out orders even officers from the ranks hervey thought it devilish unfair that an extract and from the ranks at that should have to make such a judgement you didnt consider approaching the major the rm frowned again you hervey are the senior squadron leader and youve a brevet hervey remained silent for few moments what would you have me do nothing for sure that would make things worse hervey smiled despairingly i think almost anything would make things worse and what you have quite forgotten is that as long as im in arrest my motive in doing anything will be questioned the rm did not reply at once seeming to search for his words hervey if it comes to a court martial you must defend yourself with every ounce of guile you can summon you must not think of it as a game of cricket my dear broad do you truly think that but the rm was in no mood for nicety and if things go against you you must make appeal to lord sussex the very words court martial chilled hervey to the marrow but the threat of it could play no part in his actions respecting lord towcester the rms counsel was brave many in his position would have kept it to themselves but in the end it gave hervey no true line to take he would just have to pray that he could determine what duty demanded for he knew well enough where it lay when hervey returned to breakfast he found henrietta smiling and with just a suggestion of triumph do we have good news at last i think it may be so she said smiling even wider you will not have seen the times i think she handed him the paper folded open to reveal the leading piece threat to the regents pavilion brighton we are most reliably informed that tuesdays affair with the frenchmen bent on depriving his majestys revenue of their just receipts and which occasioned the deaths of an officer of the revenue and two private men of his majestys sixth light dragoons as well as a number more very grievously wounded was a most desperate contest between the dragoons and upwards of one hundred heavily armed smugglers who greatly outnumbered our brave fellows the dragoons led by their noble and gallant lieutenant colonel the earl of towcester had ridden through the foulest of weather and the blackest of nights to answer the revenues urgent request for assistance and had it not been for the extraordinary address shown by his lordship and his gallant officers and men it is thought that the french might even have despoiled that part of the town of brighton nearest their landing we need scarcely add that his royal highnesss own pavilion residence is within but a short distance and though it shall not be our business to provide intelligence of his royal highnesss comings and goings so as to be of use to malefactors of any nationality we may say with safety that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a most exalted personage might have been taken captive in such an expedition had it not been for the prompt action of the regiment we may further say with the same assurance that not even in their late campaigning in the peninsula and at the battle of waterloo have the sixth light dragoons rendered his majesty and the nation greater service and that we expect confidently to report in due course the honours which must surely be bestowed on the regiment how in heavens name did such a piece come to be written herveys tone could not have been more incredulous ive never seen such a concoction of falsehoods inaccuracies would be too charitable a word and such speculation but it serves very well does it not it serves to make of lord towcester a hero for sure but does it not serve to absolve you matthew it may be so but that is an incidental which hardly makes the fiction worthy oh i dont know said henrietta picking up a teapot as an excuse to look away but why do you say incidental she turned back and lifted her eyelids just enough to catch his gaze he was stunned surely she could not have had anything to do with such a report do you really not think it settles things my darling she pressed looking away to the window again lord towcester is a hero he could scarcely make one of his captains a case for court martial he smiled wryly i think very probably yes it does settle things she took back the newspaper and kissed him you are naught you are naught he declared she giggled in the wicked way he had provoked and you are very poetic and you have no duties for a little while longer i imagine chapter twelve to the aid of the civil powers brighton three days later major eustace joynson had a sick headache he had sick headaches often and his doctors prescription was always the same he emptied a small envelope of calomel into a glass of water watched it dissolve and then drank it in one go as a purgative it was admirable as a counter to pain he could not tell for although it had no immediate effect the pain always passed and so he could never be sure whether it was the white powder or simply time that was efficacious he recoiled from taking laudanum since that had rendered his wife to all intents and purposes an invalid at least she was no longer fit to be about society one of his doctors said they might try the new morphium from leipzig but he was as yet wary of that his sick headaches were invariably coincident with periods of demanding activity of the cerebral kind indeed if the major were faced with a disagreeable decision a sick headache could come on almost at once the past three days had not required of him any decision but it had required unprecedented cerebral activity first there were the courts martial stricklands was a relatively straightforward affair to arrange for the evidence was before them all in the shape or rather the absence of shape and colour of his troops best jackets but in the case of herveys court martial there was the report of the revenue commissioner to await and so the arrangements could only be tentative and then had come the timess resounding praise and with it a sea change in the lieutenant colonels disposition so that all the arrangements for the courts martial had had to be undone and hastily the invitation from the prince regent for lord towcester to attend on him at once at carlton house which had followed within a day of the timess report had further lifted the lieutenant colonels spirits but it also placed the major in a position of temporary command and this was not conducive to freedom from headaches so when this very morning orders arrived from the horse guards to proceed to the north within twentyfour hours the cerebral consequences for joynson were unhappy hervey i must go and rest a darkened room please would you be so good as to see these orders are put in hand he gave him a sheaf of foolscap hervey sat in the majors chair once he was gone and read over the orders quickly to gain a feel for their substance general insurrection is feared in nottinghamshire and south yorkshire seditious meetings serious outbreak of violence against machines and property threats made to magistrates and constables informers suggest traitorous conspiracy six troops to reinforce northern district under direct command of majorgeneral sir francis evans he could hardly be surprised for there had been reports in the broadsheets for the past month though heavily censored and as daniel coates had said in his last letter with habeas corpus still suspended not even the bountiful harvest they were enjoying was likely to quell the discontent six months ago the yeomanry had been issued with a general order to respond to calls for assistance from the civil authorities and so hervey supposed that the yeomen must be exhausted for to order the pavilion regiment north was no small thing he turned to the sheet headed regimental orders it was blank what the major had meant when he said see these orders are put in hand was write the orders and then put them in hand he sighed where is the adjutant serjeant short the orderly room serjeant said he was in lewes for the assize dinner please bring me the standing orders for forced marching then said hervey briskly beginning to read over the papers again there are none sir what none sir what about the orders that major edmonds wrote as we left for belgium they were printed and bound when we got to france were they not yes sir but his lordship ordered them all destroyed a month ago and said that there was to be a new edition indeed yes sir in red morocco red morocco hervey was about to ask why the old orders should be destroyed before the new ones were ready but then realized it was not the orderly room serjeants place to answer very well then serjeant short pen and ink please and a large pot of coffee hervey issued a preliminary order at once but it took him the better part of two hours to complete those for the march itself the rate of progress shall be fifty miles per diem a fair compromise between speed and handiness on arriving he reckoned for they would have to cover a little short of a hundred and fifty miles the first ten miles shall be at the walk led a full halfhour then at a steady trot there shall be a halt of mins each horse shall be given water to wash the mouth only and wisp of hay the next six miles shall be at a fast trot and afterwards a halt of half an hour horses to be unsaddled and rubbed down and one peck of corn given and water a second ten miles first walk led then brisk trot with halt as after first after next six miles at fast trot shall be a rest of two hours horses to be given hay and feed of corn they carried this themselves and hervey knew he hardly need detail that the men should eat their haversack rations then ten miles and halt as the first followed by last eight without halt at night billets a warm mash with beans if weather foul before evening feed allowance per diem fourteen pounds of hay and twelve of oats barley or indian corn he made a separate schedule for the order of march the times of departure and the night stops uxbridge northampton nottingham itself and then he made a start on the directions for carrying camp equipment at length pleased with his improvisation he gave the sheaf of papers to the orderly room serjeant for copying and went to find his groom it was now close on midday and the stables were quiet harkaway and gilbert contentedly grinding corn in their loose boxes but there was no sign of private johnson his troop lieutenants groom emerged from the hay loft oh good morning lingard said hervey a little surprised for he knew seton canning to be away to lewes with the assizes still have you seen johnson private lingard looked puzzled hes not here sir yes scowled hervey i can see that do you know where he is lingard now looked distinctly uncomfortable i dont rightly sir hervey sighed lingard what is the matter nothing sir this was evasion by any measure come man ive known you long enough to tell when youre not saying all lingard had no option but to comply sir hes at riding school riding school johnson had been dismissed riding school for many a year would you explain lingard this is becoming a little tedious lingard seemed embarrassed sir hes learning how to ride sidesaddle hervey made a chortling noise exactly sir johnsons devotion to henrietta had plainly taken an unusual turn very well lingard sighed hervey struggling hard not to laugh perhaps you would be so good as to ask private johnson to come to my quarters after evening stables if by then he is still of a mind for soldiery there are things to do youve heard were for the north no i hadnt sir im only just back from lewes you mean you are going north sir the whole regiment were leaving brighton sir lingard sounded pleased for a while yes hervey gave harkaway another favour and then gilbert isnt brighton to your liking too much spit and polishing sir the best of it was the other night against the french i wish id been there it was a strange thing with dragoons hervey marvelled they were like their horses they spent their hours in the stable wishing to be out and then once they were out they were only too keen to make straight back in he only hoped the news would be greeted as well in the officers mess though in truth he knew it would not george beau brummell may have been striking a pose when the tenth having been ordered to manchester all those years ago he protested that he had not enlisted for foreign service but brummells sentiments were prevalent in the cavalry still outside the stables he found serjeant armstrong in heated contest with the farriercorporal except that the corporal was now silent i dont care which one of your men did this came the raw tyneside if ever i find a dumped foot in this troop again ill charge you with negligence armstrong was evidently relishing his duty as serjeantmajor during kendalls convalescence kendalls dyspeptic ulcer was almost as troublesome as joynsons sick headaches and why should he not thought hervey for armstrong had been fitted enough for it innumerable times in the peninsula do you know where johnson is he asked when the farriercorporal had gone he wasnt at watering parade so i thought he was with you sir no armstrongs eyes narrowed suggesting a frown beneath his shako thats rum hes never slipped his collar before now its nothing to worry about hervey suddenly thought better of revealing johnsons change of seat for the need to school henriettas little mare was something whose announcement wanted careful judging what do you make of the orders glad of em this place is getting stale but im not much taken with police work especially after the other night i just hope were not going to be buggered about by a lot of fuzzled justices i know i know hervey paused to return the orderly corporals salute on his way to guard mounting how are things going fine well be ready all right just another halfdozen to shoe any news of the serjeantmajor still on gruel not even light duties for another week armstrong sounded content enough hervey huffed and looked embarrassed its an ill wind i didnt join the sixth for foreign service either hervey captain rose blew cigar smoke ceilingwards there were muttered hear hears all about the anteroom leicestershire is adjoining country rose look at it that way the place is full of mine shafts isnt it and forest trappy country to follow hounds in id say the slight inclination of f troop leaders eyebrows told hervey that his objections were not entirely flippant it might make for interesting sport though he countered warming to the imagery we should see hounds working rather than just galloping with a big field rose shook his head doubtfully but these northern foxesll bolt straight back to the woods or wherever youll lose hounds left right and centre going in after em i grant you well not have anything like the runs wed have in leicestershire but well just have to go at our fox a different way meaning stop up the earths for sure and terriers for if they do manage to run to earth perhaps well have to hunt as we do for cubs drive charles back onto hounds rose smiled still sceptical well see hervey but i still say i havent paid good money to hunt poor country during this somewhat recondite exchange hervey had begun to realize that his authority as the senior troop leader although a matter only of days and pounds was being accepted with some grace by the other officers hervey had already learned that no one expected the report from the revenue officer when it came to point a single finger of blame at his handling of events in the passage of remarkably little time he had gone from dejection to if hardly triumph then certainly encouragement the vexation was that the bubble reputation was not to be had in the cannons mouth any longer but in the columns of the times and not by his own feats but by the guile of his wife henrietta was surprised to see him return so early and dismayed to learn the reason why i will not stay here in brighton she declared my love the very last thing i would wish is to be parted from you another night but my father would welcome some encouragement at this time and she looked even more unhappy matthew if you say that i am to go to wiltshire then i will of course i will but my thought was to come with you he could not have been happier with any notion but how shall you stand the journey and it is not london what lodgings shall we be able to find oh she laughed i can stand the journey perfectly well and we can stay at chatsworth william devonshire has said often enough that he hoped to meet you again i shant be able to stay there not with my troop elsewhere he cautioned then he brightened but im sure there will be opportunities to visit it cant be many miles may we travel together then the prospect of her company and one of the bestsprung chaises he had known was a great temptation i cant im afraid my love nor is it just the troop joynson will have a sick headache like as not and lord towcester wont join until nottingham the responsibility will be mine to see the regiment there but i may travel with you may i not yes of course though we shall be a little slow you are sure you are up to so long a drive yes matthew i should be able to ride to chatsworth if i really wanted to it minded him to tease her about johnson but he was so full of admiration for her spirit that he could only sit and enjoy her delighted expression he knew how much the trials of princess charlottes confinement were troubling her for the newspaper reports were more lurid by the day she must inevitably make comparisons with her own condition however inapt that might be three days later they were in nottingham and the troop returns were better than any of the captains could remember after such a distance testimony to a sound march plan good discipline on the part of the ncos and the quality of the regiments horses this latter was freely acknowledged by all ranks and lord towcesters name was heard spoken of with increasing respect again they had gone miles in three days at a cost of only two horses dead both from colic on the first night and nine lame as remarkably there were no horses off the road with sore backs an admirable pointer to both discipline and skill the price was a fair number of limping dragoons but as their corporals were only too happy to point out blisters on the feet were no hindrance in the saddle and still the regiment was herveys for major joynson would not be fit to travel for some days yet it seemed and lord towcester had yet to arrive they had had word from carlton house that he would set out as soon as the prince regent decided to detain him no longer meanwhile therefore hervey had to present himself to the general officer commanding majorgeneral sir francis evans goc northern district had established his temporary headquarters in nottingham castle of all the countrys military districts the northern was the most exigent it had been so indeed since trafalgar after which there had been no longer any threat of invasion the district ran from the scottish border through the northeastern coalfields and took in the counties of yorkshire lancashire nottinghamshire and leicestershire the headquarters were at york as a rule but the hotbed of trouble in his district at this time was undoubtedly nottinghamshire and general evans was not a man to sit distant and aloof but he was as crabbed as his reputation had it and this morning he was belabouring a clerk for the scratchy signatures the mans pen was making as hervey entered his office his right ear turned forward so much that the troops called him general tab was almost as red as his tunic and the redness of sir francis evanss ear hervey had been warned was a sure indicator of his temper captain hervey sir francis said the daag beckoning the clerk away sixth light dragoons hervey stepped quickly to the generals desk halted and saluted good morning sir are you the adjutant when does the regiment arrive said sir francis gruffly i am not the adjutant sir i am the senior troop leader and i am pleased to report the arrival of six troops three hundred and eightyone effectives sir franciss ear grew even redder where in hells name is your colonel hervey was pleased to have been warned of sir franciss choler though the warning did not entirely ease its sting he was summoned by the prince regent sir francis i am given to understand that he will be making his way here at any time he hoped this was not too blatant a distortion of his latest intelligence and where is the major then he is sick sir he will follow from brighton in a very few days i am sure mm i see this is not a very satisfactory beginning the troops are all wellfound and officered sir hervey felt he was speaking up as much for the sixth as for his colonel yes but that is all very well captain hervey i must have a field officer here in nottingham the troops themselves i intend disposing throughout the county at the immediate call of the bench very well sir i shall take the orders from your daag and hold myself here until lord towcester arrives i trust that he will not be long he braced up for the dismissal it did not come sir francis evans seemed to be eyeing him suspiciously hervey i have some recollection of that name hervey could not think how for they had never so far as he knew seen the same campaign i have always been with the sixth sir except last year in india sir francis nodded i thought as much you are brevet major are you not hervey was as flattered by the recognition as he was astounded and tried hard to hide both yes sir mm sit yourself down he turned to his daag bring us some coffee harry theres a good fellow sir franciss ear had regained its normal colour he leaned back in his chair studying his temporary commander of cavalry his chin disappearing beneath the standing collar of his tunic the duke thinks highly of you as i recall hervey was not sure if this was meant to be rhetorical but the silence demanded some response thank you sir i was in india on his bidding there was just the suggestion of a smile on sir franciss lips then i fancy i might repose in you myself hervey was not going to presume to sport with the general even with such an invitation the arrival of coffee was opportune sir to begin with hervey and let it be rightly understood there is no glory for you or your dragoons in aid of the civil power therell be no charging hither and thither no flashy sword work hervey had little enough experience of the application of that duty beyond the squalid business of west cork yet he knew enough to be in no doubt as to its nature indeed sir and i know i may speak for the whole regiment in this the dragoons are glad of the change from hounslow and brighton but they have a great repugnance for riot duty we lost an officer killed last march in london sir francis nodded it is the most terrible thing to fire on ones own countrymen however grave the provocation hervey assented silently sir francis narrowed his eyes and looked keenly at him yet there can be no shirking from duty captain hervey it will have to be done at all hazards i know it sir replied hervey with a tone of both regret and resolve which together seemed to reassure the goc sir francis now appeared to take his ease entirely he poured himself and hervey more coffee offered him a cheroot which hervey declined though he would ordinarily have enjoyed its taste with his araba and lit one for himself it seemed that sir francis rather liked this young cavalryman perhaps because hervey had shown no trepidation in facing him he knew his own reputation well enough and for his general air of assurance it was not every captain in his experience who would look forward to his duties overmatched as they were for his rank and with such equanimity sir francis now recalled the brevet committee better he had opposed herveys cause in the first instance thinking him nothing more than another waterloo hand he recalled how sir horace shawcross had pressed his case admirably believing him to have special merit and it was looking as though sir horace had been right it was not the portion of a goc to be able to talk confidingly with many men sadly and sir francis evans did not intend letting an opportunity pass let me tell you something of the genesis of all this hervey and then you might be set more favourably to do the kings business what do you know of the secret parliamentary committees the january committees hervey was perplexed if they were secret how should he know anything of them i was not in england in january sir and i have not heard of them since too many have tutted sir francis and what they reported you know of course that habeas corpus is suspended yes sir and that special legislation has been enacted to prevent the holding of what are deemed seditious meetings i did not know that sir the committees found there to be overwhelming evidence of a traitorous conspiracy to overthrow the government a general insurrection indeed and these two measures are the fruits of that inquiry bitter fruits they are too hervey intended making the most of the intimacy do the magistrates exercise the powers aptly sir his memory of the cork magistracy was still painful depends whether theyre whig or tory or for that matter town or county the tory bench is a violent one on the whole uncompromising and damned irritating but i will say they are bold the whigs on the other hand are a sneaking base lot always quick to call for troops yet trucking with the mob the county magistrates are a miserable set generally they insult the people and grow frightened at every alarm those of the towns have a little more pluck but the county ones bully them inoculate them with their own fears and then they pour in calls for troops youll have no very great love of them but remember this when you have gone back to brighton they must remain here and with no protection but the parish constable and the shutters on their windows no of course sir hervey had never envied the magistrates he was just dismayed at their want of understanding and it might be said often enough their coldheartedness well now understand that my object in all this is to tranquillize the situation as much as possible it has been my habit to meet with the magistrates weekly in the most troubled areas to impress on them more than anything that they must not interfere with the basic rights of the crowds to assemble for not every such assembly is by any means seditious if of course the orator is preaching arson murder or treason then he must be arrested as soon as the crowd is dispersed but galling though it may be i am very much afraid that it is better to let him finish his tirade than try to get to arrest him by pushing through the crowd for that way spells only misadventure hervey nodded the affair of skinner street had been a salutary lesson i am myself as a rule chary of using cavalry for they cannot do much other than bully a crowd though id rather have a crowd chopped a little than destroyed with firearms the trouble is in a town theyre too easily assailed from above and with impunity slates coping stones theyll hurl anything you shall have to drill your dragoons to dismount as infantry hervey else theyll be no use in some of these places theyll have to be able to get aloft hervey said that he understood now billeting its the very devil of a business always you must keep your troops together these towns have big enough places of one sort or another in one or two there are barracks even or else farms nearby hervey took careful note and the yeomanry have a care to my mind theyre overzealous for cutting and slashing and theyre tired too theyve been out the best part of the spring and summer as for the militia i pray god we never become so desperate as to have to call them out for i could never count on them theyd throw in their lot with the mob too easily you wont remember devizes it was hushed up right and proper i am from those parts sir i heard of it well and good then the last thing we need is a battalion of militia mutinying hervey made a note in his pocketbook to learn the whereabouts of the militia armouries the daag came in excuse me sir francis but you have your call on the lord lieutenant at eleventhirty the goc looked at his watch and made to leave very well captain hervey you have my general intention my staff will give you the details be so good as to inform your colonel of it when he resumes command and ask him to call on me at the first opportunity he held out his hand i have enjoyed making your acquaintance sir goodday to you hervey took his hand before replacing his forage cap and saluting the generals company had been an uncommon stimulant it was agreed that the regiment would rest for the day and that night in nottingham before dispersing to their appointed towns b troop would march thence to newark fifteen miles to the northeast c to mansfield about the same distance to the north d to worksop ten miles further on e to retford some eight miles to the east of worksop and f would be the reserve at ollerton centrally placed between the others a would remain in nottingham so that hervey might have its command as well as the regiments for the day or so before he expected lord towcester to arrive this was not an easy decision hervey had no qualms about continuing to stand duty for the lieutenant colonel and indeed without his lordships intemperance the regiment was very much the happier but it meant that he would then remain in his closest proximity and that could only bring greater distress but hervey had also to hope for lord towcesters early return for sir francis evanss notorious temper would be sorely provoked by the prolonged absence of the sixths commanding officer he called a meeting of the troop leaders at three oclock in the white hart hotel where the officers would mess for the night and then went to see how were his chargers gilbert had been warranted a good doer by the trowbridge coper and so he had proved to be in the weeks at hounslow and brighton all the same hervey was surprised by how well he looked better than many a horse hed seen after a days hard hunting the big grey turned from the hay rack as hervey came into the white harts stables and began to stale the urines colour was no different from usual and herveys nose smarted at the pungent smell the same sal ammoniac as his old governesss reviving salts he could leave the gelding to himself in that big stall where no doubt he would be stretched out on the fine straw bed before the hour was out harkaway however had lost condition he stood tucked up ignoring the hay a sorry sight indeed perhaps he had not had enough time to become fit again after being turned away for so long although he had had slow progressive work of late and had seemed as fit as any trooper before the march what do you think johnson asked hervey evidently johnson had already been thinking i reckon wed better physic im hervey sighed he was probably right and yet selden their former veterinarian whose opinions were held in high regard still had forsworn routine physicking as much as bleeding leave him another hour or so but keep a sharp eye out and if hes any worse get mr gascoyne to look at him and call me right sir ill try and tempt im with a mash meantime hervey nodded as johnson put the blanket back on harkaway the gelding scarcely moved as he fastened the surcingle we cant be very far from your parts now can we said hervey as johnson ducked under the stall bar a days march ay easy would you like leave to go there if things quieten down johnson shook his head ive no crave to go to sheffield again capn ervey its a mucky place you wouldnt want to see anyone who they were decent enough folk them as ran tworkouse but theyd be long gone an i cant very well walk tstreets all day on toff chance o seein somebody hervey thought it better to let the matter rest at three oclock the troop leaders assembled in the dining room of the white hart it was a room of some refinement with a woven carpet and little oak but the white hart was undoubtedly a provincial hotel only a fraction more elegant than a posting inn it was however as serviceable a headquarters as they might find the orderly room serjeant began distributing maps a good start they all agreed for the absence of maps was the normal feature of the commencement of a campaign and what maps these were not the old county charts or the coachcards which showed only the landmarks along a road but the new inchtoamile ordnance survey detailed accurate and with the novel system of contour lines which gave a picture of the lie of the land hervey had asked for enough to give each troop a full set for the county and a local sheet for every officer from these he expected the ncos to make sketches so they could familiarize themselves with the neighbourhoods as quickly as possible it was a promising start indeed at the end of the conference too there seemed to be a very fair degree of contentment barrow went so far as to say that if this were foreign service he wished they might see it more often though rose declared that for his part the weather in these latitudes was already taking its toll of his humours but it was happy banter and the captains fell out to their troops in good spirits and looking forward to their meeting together again to dine that evening shortly before midnight when the contented diners were dispersed if not actually retired lord towcester arrived from london the adjutant told him of the plans that had been put in hand and the lieutenant colonel at once exploded with rage why was his regiment broken up in this way he demanded why had the dispositions been made so who had presumed to choose which troop would go where he sent for hervey what in the name of god do you think you do sir bawled lord towcester as hervey came to his quarters so loud indeed that the whole of the white hart must have heard hervey explained in the most composed manner imaginable that the goc had stated his intention and that the consequent troop dispositions were all approved by him then you should have represented to the general officer commanding in the strongest terms that the dispersal of cavalry is contrary to the practice of war hervey was now thoroughly on the alert for the lieutenant colonels response was as irrational as it was hostile they were no more at war than they had been in ireland your lordship the general believes that the deployment of a troop to each town will of itself discourage trouble and at the same time permit rapid reinforcement well i do not sir it will inflame the population that is all and then we shall have trouble everywhere who decided which troop should go where i did sir there is little to choose between the towns so far as the general is aware and you placed yourself here in nottingham yes your lordship the inflection suggested he was puzzled you chose to remain close to the general when the other troops are expected to face the trouble alone and with your wife here too hervey boiled inside he wanted to treat the insult as a matter of honour to have it out once and for all with pistols swords whatever the earl of towcester chose he fought the urge for all he was worth however for the voices in his head henriettas armstrongs stricklands all begged him not to call out lord towcester he told himself that the hour was late and the lieutenant colonels journey had been long and tiring in any case the adjutant as the sole witness was not worth the trouble your lordship in your absence i was required to i think you take upon yourself a very great deal captain hervey you must have known that i was to arrive this evening no sir i did not i received no communication whatever he managed he hoped to keep the simple statement from sounding like a complaint well i tell you sir lord towcesters voice had risen substantially in both volume and pitch that i command this regiment and i say where the troops shall go the adjutant shall countermand the orders at once and shall issue new ones at first parade you may dismiss hervey replaced his cap saluted and left he was tired confounded and above all angry at the additional labour which would now fall to the troops and the inevitable delay and confusion it must cause so that what might have been the appearance of a regiment under good order would like as not be quite the opposite perhaps he overestimated the difficulties they faced with these luddites perhaps lord towcesters arrogant disregard of them was more apt but that was not sir francis evanss opinion hervey stood for several minutes in the white harts empty smoking room wondering how much longer he could tolerate a martinet whose actions seemed calculated to bring the regiment to calamity there seemed no point sending any orders to his troop at that hour without knowing what was to be done nothing could be gained by even a preliminary order cancelling the previous one he had to know first what was nugatory before he might halt it the smokingroom clock showed that it was well past watchsetting his dragoons would be asleep he decided to let them sleep on the night light was still burning when he went back to his room henrietta was sleeping peacefully her tresses spread on the pillow as if just arranged by her ladys maid he stood long looking at her contemplating indeed marvelling at the changes which nature was working within henrietta was changed for ever from the girl he had known she was changed the night of their wedding as was he though in different measure and the quality of his love for her was changed now by what nature was accomplishing perhaps he began only now to comprehend truly what john keble had meant when he spoke of their becoming one flesh he looked about the room it was a mean lodging compared with longleat compared with the vicarage at horningsham even he had brought her to a place no better than a corn merchant might use although she did not complain she had made light indeed of his concern at the meagre furnishings and his disdain of the boiled fowl that passed for partridge at the supper brought to her caithlin armstrong might find contentment in such surroundings when she arrived with the sutlers wagons and serjeant armstrong could have the satisfaction of knowing that his outlay gave her unaccustomed comfort but he captain matthew hervey had failed to honour his wife as her guardian would have expected and he himself wanted would it be ever thus if she followed the trumpet chapter thirteen dukeries mansfield next day a troop reached mansfield towards the middle of the morning hervey had taken his amusement at this substitution silently for lord towcester evidently had great satisfaction in sending him from nottingham not realizing that hervey would be a full three hours closer thereby to chatsworth whither henrietta was driving even now indeed he was a little surprised that the lieutenant colonel had not sent him even further afield to worksop for instance though he supposed that towcester feared having him at too distant an arms length mansfield seemed a pleasant enough town its population not especially hostile as the troop rode in there was a fine church norman towers were not a common sight in herveys part of england and a handsome moot hall there were curious dwellings carved out of the sandstone cliffs along the southwell road where he was informed by his guide there were many families still and there were extensive roman remains though only partially excavated a more peaceful place than mansfield in the heart of the once great sherwood forest it would have been difficult to imagine yet only two weeks ago an armed mob had attacked one of the new steamloom factories on the edge of the town the owner and his night watch only managing to drive off the assailants after killing five of their number and wounding a dozen more the mob had returned the following night and after a gun battle in which there were more casualties succeeded in demolishing the factory the scarred remains now stood as a stark reminder to the authorities that beneath the tranquil canopy of sherwood there lurked as there had so many years ago predatory bands who were they hervey wondered and who were the ringleaders the bench it seemed had no idea and the constable seemed afraid to ask hervey soon discovered that his troop was not so much assisting the civil power as obliged to be the power no sooner had they arrived but mansfields most prominent citizens besieged him in the moot hall to enquire how he intended to pacify the neighbourhood hervey was at a loss and could only assure his audience that he stood ready to answer and promptly calls for assistance from the magistrates the predicament of a number of those living in isolated houses outside the town was brought to his notice and he had to agree that passivity would save neither life nor property in their case he asked what measures they themselves had taken and was surprised by the degree of fortification which some of the houses had undergone and the extent to which firearms were kept at hand for their domestic staff but the steamloom factory had been barricaded and defended too they pointed out and that had not stopped its destruction hervey promised he would consult with the senior magistrates at once and so lieutenant seton canning having taken the troop out to the grange on the southwell road just beyond the town which was to be their quarters hervey rode with just his trumpeter and coverman to clipstone hall to meet the chairman of the mansfield bench after the major generals dire warnings of the inadequacy of the magistracy hervey was very pleasantly surprised by whom he found at clipstone sir abraham cole seemed neither a scheming whig nor a baying tory he was instead a rather bookish man in his late fifties with a ready if slightly anxious smile and a civilized way with his words his father had bought the baronetcy half a century before with his stockingmaking wealth afterwards buying and extending the hall and sir abraham had since combined the running of the family business with his other passions astronomy collecting chinese porcelain and making a new translation of the old testament hervey sat in the library admiring the shelves and sipping a fine montilla sherry would you tell me please captain hervey if you are permitted to do so what are your orders hervey smiled there was something most engaging in sir abraham coles courtesy of course sir abraham put very simply i am to answer any call for assistance from a properly constituted authority the bench the constables and to act on my own cognizance as may be lawful for the maintenance of the kings peace sir abraham nodded and this means that you may take an active part it does replied hervey but the general officer commanding the district is anxious to avoid prolonged engagement or any appearance of martial law that is understood said sir abraham equably have you heard of posse comitatus it is the means in common law by which a sheriff or now indeed the lord lieutenant may call upon all male members of the county above the age of fifteen years to assist in preventing riot or enforcing process i do remember now said hervey recollecting his shrewsbury history and i seem to recall too my fathers being amused that the clergy were exempt sir abraham smiled again indeed yes and peers too i shall return to them well then now that we have a force of regular cavalry to fortify the weaker spirits i intend applying to the lord lieutenant under those powers to raise a body locally for the preservation of the peace my desire these many years past has been that we should have a stipendiary constabulary but that will be a long time in the coming yet and so we must rely on the posse to provide us with special constables that was as well thought hervey for the goc had said that he was considering withholding assistance if a town or village had not taken its own measures to preserve the peace you were going to say something of peers sir abraham sir abraham cole paused for a moment you are no doubt aware that we are on the edge of the dukeries i am sorry to say that their graces and lord manvers take a contrary opinion in respect of law enforcement they are not troubled in their parks you understand and news of any outrage reaches them late so that the sting is too far drawn i truly believe they are of the view that broken machinery is a price willingly to be paid to avoid a greater insurrection and does this make keeping the peace more difficult sir abraham shook his head well it certainly doesnt make it easier their support would greatly assist us raising a special constabulary for instance hervey waited for him to say more but it was some time before sir abraham seemed ready to confide in him i have it on good authority that the dukeries at night are something of a haven for drilling men the keepers turn a blind eye i am astonished said hervey frowning deeply i find it hard to credit that peers of the realm could connive at treason in this way sir abraham nodded looked at like that you are in the right but what if they did not believe it all amounted to a real threat of insurrection ive heard it related that the duke of portland says the business of the blanketeers proves that fears are too exaggerated hervey sighed let us pray they are right sir abraham asked if he would take luncheon with him and although hervey regretfully declined he accepted a second glass of sherry for he wanted to be clear on the benchs view of the situation and he still had questions there are two distinct threats are there not sir abraham there is that to the government the crown indeed and there is that to the peace hereabouts in the form of machinebreaking and food riots sir abraham agreed the one might well sustain the other however and we have to proceed on that surmise their graces might well be in the right about the real threat to the crown but if general lawlessness goes unchecked it may generate a greater malevolence that indeed is what some of the political speakers are hoping is it not sir abraham seemed delighted captain hervey i very much approve of all that you have said i confess to having been in two minds about the arrival of the military for my experience of military officers is solely that of the militia and the yeomanry and i am afraid that it has not always been felicitous herveys own experience of both had been limited but equally infelicitous i thank you sir i trust you will find us handy he finished his glass i believe we should meet later this week to speak of the employment of your special constables yes yes indeed but before you go captain hervey allow me to show you briefly of course my collection of chinese porcelain and my observatory sir abrahams invitation was so unaffected in its enthusiasm that hervey could not but accept and glad he was too for when they went to the observatory on the roof he was put in mind of a simple scheme which had long served the nation well in its darkest times and which would do the same for the manufacturers the telescope turned terrestrial commanded a great tract of country sir abraham do you think it likely that the machineowners can see each others houses from the roofs i mean sir abraham thought a while going through the names in his mind you wouldnt be able to see barlows place its past the worksop road it was his factory that was burned to the ground the day after mine but the rest ay you might see them you would see a beacon then on the roof ay you should be able to see a beacon especially at night there have been no attacks in broad daylight have there that is true so if you were to arrange a chain of beacons with a watch then we could send assistance very promptly i dont imagine frankly that mr barlows house is in danger any longer captain hervey that is a capital idea i am full of regard for your address i shall begin on it at once sir abraham had his fist clenched as if determined to do something disagreeable hervey hoped his resolution would spread to his fellow owners then i shall send my lieutenant here tomorrow and he can make the finer arrangements he thought for a second and then judged the moment right you know sir abraham it might be worth while setting new hounds on the scent of barlows ruiners terriers indeed since they appear to have gone deep to earth i have had occasion to see investigators from bow street in a case of murder and from a most unpromising cold trail they were able to dig out the murderers the outlay would not be small but hang the outlay captain hervey i have such a strong presentiment of your succeeding in something here that i shall foot the bill myself for the time being how is harkaway asked hervey as soon as he reached ransom grange from clipstone johnson took gilberts reins and shook his head e was forging badly on tway from mansfield was it just tiredness theres summat up wi im some o tothers were knocked up when we got to nottingham but they were right by morning hervey ducked under the bar of harkaways stall did you see any blood at his nostrils at any stage no sir not once hervey had no doubt that johnson would have noticed the slightest bleeding what did the veterinary officer say just to physic im which id done anyway well lets give him another mash tonight with some nitre johnson pulled the bar back across the stall as hervey stepped out im sorry sir i just didnt see anything es been in as good a fettle as any o tothers up to now hervey smiled and clapped him on the shoulder well have him to rights soon enough they left the stable and began walking to the officers house a dozen or so jackdaws were picking at the droppings in the yard theyre pleased weve come at least said johnson hervey smiled again as he watched them carefully selecting the uncrushed grains oh there are others too i had rather a nice meeting with the chairman of the bench earlier on what dye reckon then sir its a lot quieter than i thought itd be wed all thought wed be on riot duty tfirst night hervey confided that hed expected the same though he was grateful to have been wrong maybe its just our numbers or maybe the ringleaders are biding their time theres more machinery being brought from birmingham in the next week or two and that might be a cause for trouble johnson nodded we were wondering if wed be allowed into mansfield armstrong would be asking him that too no doubt it would be safer not to let his men associate with the citizenry for besides the usual fights it did not do to have the very force sent to coerce the populace drinking with them the day before but mansfield was hardly seething and it was not the populace as a whole that was to be coerced hervey imagined there would be more peace caught from the dragoons than sedition caught from the townspeople ill have a word with serjeant armstrong in any event it should help the posse the magistrates are getting up a pussy oh for heavens sake man you just said i said posse johnson looked genuinely baffled and then began to smirk a thing he did infrequently enough to induce a similar reaction in hervey and what are they going to do with the pussy dragoons about the yard were now glancing their way theyre organizing a watch said hervey managing to regain a reasonable composure he told him about the bow street men too not that he expected to see them inside of five days the letter to london would go express by sir abrahams pocket together with a letter of credit so that the detectors might post to nottingham with all speed but they would have other business in the capital no doubt and he couldnt expect them to abandon those duties at once meanwhile he concluded that his best course was a vigorous show of force throughout the district by day and by night hervey was fast asleep when johnson banged on his door two nights later its arkaway sir es down hervey sprang out of bed pulled on his overalls and boots and snatched up his field coat they ran to the stables where the picket corporal was lighting oil lamps as fast as he could how long has he been down i dont know for sure sir said corporal sykes but he was up at midnight when i did the rounds as a rule no one patrolled the lines themselves during the silent hours for horses needed their peace as much as dragoons but some of the barley feed that day had been fusty and there were fears for the odd case of colic but harkaway had not had the barley he lay quite still his breathing shallow with no sweating the veterinary officer was twenty miles away and hervey was at a loss to know what to try serjeant armstrong arrived he watched silent until hervey pressed him for an opinion i just dont know sir i dont think ive ever seen a horse down and as still as this he cant have picked up any poison hes been all but in tandem with gilbert the past two weeks mr gascoyne thought he was just off his form tired after the march weve all seen horses drop dead with fatigue but not like this could his gut have twisted or got a block hervey knelt by harkaways head and listened close to the shallow but regular breathing perhaps but look at him hes not sweating and hes not trying to nip at the pain hervey looked up as the farriercorporal entered the stall what do you make of him corporal perrot the farriercorporal got down by the geldings side and felt along his flank and belly there was nothing unusual just as hervey had found its queer sir hes not sweating or showing any pain he looks like an old horse snuffing the farriercorporals soft dorset was an emollient even if his words were not it cant be colic hervey shook his head unsure perrot sighed has he had colic before sir hervey and harkaway hadnt been together all that much the irish splint was the only thing he knew of to have bothered the veterinary officer i believe not at all do you think we should dose him with salt water the farriercorporal looked undecided might it be impacted colic sir hervey shook his head again im at a loss to know what it might be corporal perrot i dont want to dose him if we dont have to not lying like this and wed never get him on his feet id best have a look if you dont mind sir daniel coates had once shown hervey how to examine for impacted colic but he had never had cause to yes id be very obliged if you would corporal perrot and ill send for mr gascoyne meanwhile the farriercorporal asked for some whale oil took off his tunic and shirt then rubbed the oil over his right arm pull his tail clear for me johnson he said rubbing a little oil on the anus the picket corporal brought a lantern closer what bloody goods that going to do sykes rasped corporal perrot sliding a hand inside the rectum corporal sykes coloured up and even hervey managed a smile harkaway barely moved a muscle at the intrusion corporal perrot pushed on gently until his forearm had disappeared and then began carefully probing the abdomen to locate any blockage a full five minutes passed before perrot pronounced that there was no obvious obstruction hervey was disappointed for although an impacted colic was a deuce of a thing to treat they would at least know how to start all they could do now was wait for the veterinary officer to arrive and they knew he couldnt do so before morning ill stay with him then johnson when johnson was gone hervey looked long at the gelding and with a growing sense of despair never before had he been at such a loss to know what to do all he could do indeed was watch a little before first light harkaway gave up breathing hervey did not see the actual moment for the geldings respiration had become so shallow by the end that it was almost imperceptible one minute hervey knew he was alive and the next he knew he was gone and it was an end with relief as well as melancholy for hervey had known for several hours that nothing could put life back into so weak an animal he did not get up at once apprehending a forceful command to remain at harkaways side an awe numinal powerful which he had known once or twice in the peninsula it had not been something he had enquired into or later denied he waited reverently for several minutes until quite distinctly he felt his restraints slip away then he rose took a blanket and laid it over harkaways head and went out into the morning johnson was as grieved as hervey in some ways more so he had seen enough horses die from wounds and malnourishment strangles and staggers from any number of causes indeed but never once reflecting on his own husbandry it was as much to assuage his grooms dismay therefore that hervey asked the veterinary surgeon when he arrived shortly after nine to carry out a critical dissection hervey didnt care to watch it and neither did johnson as he said to mr gascoyne the knife to a dead horse was a thing for the boucherie chevaline or for mr sanbels new veterinary college or even for mr stubbs and his palette but he himself had no stomach for it the knife revealed a sad story the pathognomonic was extraordinary hervey said gascoyne when he had done i looked at once at the lungs for since you described respiratory failure those were quite obviously the organs to start with they were very morbid indeed chronic abscessing in the upper posterior part ive never seen worse there must have been haemorrhagia over a very long period hervey was puzzled and yet neither i nor johnson saw any blood about the nostrils not once by no means impossible opined gascoyne in his gentle devon burr hervey always respected the veterinarians willingness to concede that there was much still to be understood in any case gascoyne assured him a pulmonary haemorrhage of this magnitude is not something for which anyone might be blamed there must have been some defect at birth hervey expressed himself grateful declaring as cheerfully as he could that it was now but a matter for the rufford hounds after his meeting later that morning with sir abraham cole who was just come from the building site that was his erstwhile factory and who expressed himself very content with the peace about the borough these past fortyeight hours hervey began contemplating a ride to see henrietta it was less than twenty miles to chatsworth if he set out after first parade next morning he would be there comfortably by noon they could at least enjoy a walk together before he returned for evening stables and johnson could come too it would be a tonic for them both for harkaways death had cast a dismal spell over the grange but henrietta had already saved them the ride the bath chaise was standing at the front of the grange as he came from watering parade and only a moments anxiety that something might be amiss dulled his thrill at seeing it he took the steps two at a time to embrace her i cant tell you how good this is now of all times inside the grange she condoled with him and said how she hoped to be able to say something of comfort to private johnson too for besides herveys own notice of his distress she knew from the evening in hounslow that johnson had developed a special feeling for the gelding but in the end she herself seemed in lower spirits than the news required and this was betrayed by a rather distant look in her eyes is everything well asked hervey trying not to sound too anxious again she sighed there is no one at chatsworth for william is gone south i felt the need of company very keenly it seemed strange that the need of company should depress the spirits quite so much but he presumed it was the result of her condition i was to have come to chatsworth myself tomorrow he said to rally her she smiled back appreciatively knowing that his going there was a conscious decision to leave his dragoons albeit for only a day but her distant look remained tell me what is the matter my love hervey tried again taking her hand in a way that said he would not release it until she told him all the news from london of princess charlotte i confess it troubles me greatly needlessly perhaps but sir richard croft is bleeding her every day and allows her so little food i read that she is become very disheartened and speaks of the future being joyless he squeezed her hand and spoke softly do you wish to engage a different physician is that your concern henrietta shook her head no dr croft is spoken of everywhere in the highest terms he put his arms round her my darling there is no reason to suppose that your confinement will be as troubled i should like to stay with you here matthew i should feel better then you could not be comfortable here my love and i should not wish you to stay in mansfield for everyone would know you were there and if there were any disturbance i can stay at welbeck the portlands are cousins of williams i believe there could be no more objection to one dukery than another and though hervey felt a little ashamed of the thought it would do no harm to have an advocate at welbeck if sir abrahams picture of ducal detachment were a true one i should be very happy indeed if you did we could meet every day another thought occurred to him first you will want to send word will you not henrietta nodded then while that is done will you take johnson for a drive you could call on sir abraham cole hes chairman of the bench and a very engaging man and he has a very extensive collection of chinese porcelain which i confess i found rather too extensive for my taste he lives alone a few miles out of the town and johnson could take some papers which he must sign the prospect entirely delighted her her spirits seemed already to be rising and now explained hervey he must go and write to daniel coates for harkaway was his gift and had been very much his pride he was overdue writing in any case and his last had been a gloomy affair composed when he was at the low ebb of arrest he would have more agreeable things to tell him on that account which would perhaps counterbalance the news of harkaway the old soldier liked nothing more than news from the field and a troop despatch even allowing for the objectionable nature of a commanding officer such as lord towcester was a thing to be savoured wherever the campaign chapter fourteen good deeds and bad clipstone hall that night clipstone hall was a fine gentlemanly residence its stone was good and solid its lawns well laid it was a place to which a man might retire of an evening content with his days work whatever it might be and enjoy his diversion and repose as the sun began to set the stones turned a mellow amber colour and the big oaks which had stood in sherwood since before the conqueror cast long shadows across the lawns in which a rabbit or a pheasant sometimes braved the remaining daylight before darkness gave them licence to browse all of the mow rooks returning to their high nests cawed a general retreat and jacobs in the park bleated the same to their imagined lambs to varying degrees the picture was the same for the several owners whose pleasure it was to be close to their manufactories while enjoying a tranquil country living but once night fell especially when there was no moon as this night and when so much violence stalked the lanes their country seats became places of anxiety sometimes of fear and occasionally of terror in this dim darkness the clock of sir abraham coles parish church just the other side of the park wall struck two sir abraham himself was asleep but on the roof was an undergardener earning a handy extra shilling he was wide awake despite the hour for the ruination of sir abraham might well be his own ruination too and consequently of his wife and five children but diligent though the gardener was he neither saw nor heard the intruder the jacobs hadnt stirred nor the geese at the back of the house neither had the two king charless in sir abrahams bedroom the intruder his face blackened stole across the gravel drive as if he were weightless and reached the doors of clipstone hall without a soul knowing but although he had a pistol in his belt it was not his intention to use it indeed he intended neither the house nor its occupants any mischief that night at least instead he took from his pocket a letter and pinned it to the front doors with a facingneedle then he slipped away as silently so that the discovery of the letter when it was daylight might be all the more menacing at a dozen and more houses in the borough the same was happening sir abraham was so alarmed when his manservant brought him the letter just before eight in the morning that he drove at once to the grange he arrived as first parade was being dismissed but the speed of his carriage and manner of his getting out arrested the dismissal his meeting with hervey was conducted with the entire troop standing horses in hand necks craning and ears straining captain hervey this was pinned to my door in the night and it was the same at taylors and arkwrights too probably everyone of the hosiers association has them and the bench too hervey took the letter and read the wellformed hand shirewood camp to those whom it may concern in consequence of the great suffering of the poor whose grievances seem not to be taken into the least consideration by government or the hirers of labour general ludd shall be forced to call out the brave sons of shirewood who are determined and sworn to be true and faithful avengers of their countrys wrongs and by night when all is still and the moon is hid behind the hill we forward march to do our will with hatchet pike and gun great enoch still shall lead the van stop him who dare stop him who can press forward every gallant man with hatchet pike and gun general ludd the metre is very ill hervey pronounced ill warrant theyre tedious company the artifice was as reassuring for the dragoons as it was for sir abraham who sighed in some relief nevertheless hervey lost no time in ordering ncos patrols to the hosiers on the watchlist sir abraham had not specifically requested it but it was clear that prompt action was needed lest fear turn to panic it is not for me to suggest it hervey said to him when the last of the patrols was gone but now is the time your posse would be of greatest value i cant think that undrilled men can have much effect once real trouble has begun but a large enough picket at each house and workshop might well deter attack sir abraham agreed and after a restorative set off as quickly as he had arrived for the moot hall it was now that hervey began to feel keenly the lack of any intelligence as to what was happening outside the borough doubtless he would know more by the end of the day when the usual channels conveyed intelligence to the moot hall but what he really wanted to know was what was happening with the other troops especially barrows in worksop and stricklands in ollerton on which he would have to rely for immediate support he therefore ordered lieutenant seton canning and cornet st oswald to ride to the other troops to find out what they could and then he returned to his map board private hopwood had made an enlargement of the ordnance map by ten times with colour and lettering so careful that it looked as if it were a piece of fine engraving his skill with pen ink and brush had come to light only through caithlin armstrongs diligence in visiting the infirmary with comforts indeed caithlins attentiveness had done much to hasten the healing of hopwoods wounds moral and physical hopwoods was a skill that not only aided the recovery of his selfrespect but was of real value to hervey for after each patrol the officer or nco had come to the map to add the human detail gained in reconnaissance and so by this the seventh morning hopwood had drawn a remarkable representation of the borough more complete hervey supposed than at any time since domesday would you like some tea sir asked the draughtsman hervey looked him in the eye hopwood held the gaze until hervey smiled and said yes it had only been for a few seconds but hopwood could look his officer in the eye again and he had asked if he would like tea not waited to be asked but offered it and not out of servility or fawning but because that was what a dragoon should do he was ready to rejoin the sixth instead of just mustering with the ranks it took him a full ten minutes to make the tea however hervey didnt notice for he was rapt in study of the map hopwood at last brought in a tray and poured milk sir a little yes he added the milk and then turned to leave shall you not have any hopwood asked hervey still peering at the map with a magnifying glass hopwood looked hesitant can i sir of course go and get a cup and sit here while i continue to admire your work hopwood did as he was bidden but said not a word in a few minutes hervey put down the glass where did you acquire such skill when i left the workhouse sir i was apprenticed to a printmaker id always liked drawing but i could only do it on the slate before if you were going to get a trade why did you enlist hopwood smiled we made a lot of recruiting posters sir and you ended up believing them ay sir he smiled go on to tell the truth i kept seeing soldiers in the town it were maidstone and in the end i kept thinking that yes well i just kept thinking that youd think the worse of yourself if you didnt put on regimentals ay sir just that hervey took another sip of the honourable companys pekoe this teas good hopwood i should be careful or someone will claim you as a groom hopwood smiled it wasnt much of a joke but he knew hervey was trying you were in america first with the fourteenth werent you i was sir but we didnt see a lot of fighting no but ive learned you saved a man from drowning hopwood looked abashed and from a river with sharp teeth in it i couldnt very well leave him sir hervey looked at the dragoon with admiration as well as pity when your time with the colours is up hopwood the thing to remember is that you saved a mans life when no one would have called you coward if you hadnt nothing else is worth thinking of you understand nothing it will be the only thing that matters thank you sir no more thank yous hopwood its just time to kick on now ay sir thats what id like to do good he drained the cup then look at your map and tell me what you observe more green than i thought i had ink for sir he smiled yes green all over the place and a few roads is that a good thing sir not at the moment but im trying to think of how it might be it seems the hosiers and magistrates have all been threatened during the night and either these luddites are all like robin hoods merry men and live in the forest which i dont believe for one minute or why would they be so intent on breaking machinery which has nothing to do with them or else theyre travelling along these roads at night and if theyre doing that then there must be a way to intercept them its a big place sir i know hopwood i know thats why were going to need exact intelligence rather than just beating around in the dark im praying that the bow street men will not be too long later that morning without notice lord towcester arrived at the grange herveys heart lifted by the independence of his situation fell at once as it became clear that the lieutenant colonel was not come for any supportive purpose rather indeed the opposite he had spent the past three days at welbeck and then clumber where their graces had left him in no doubt of their disapproval of the intervention of regulars they were strongly of the opinion that events should be allowed to take their course with the yeomanry called out only when the trouble threatened the peace of the county as a whole as indeed am i captain hervey i understand you have had patrols all over the north of the county we have been patrolling the jurisdiction of the magistrates your lordship to discover the lie of the land and to show a deterrent force i have been in close liaison with the chairman of the bench sir abraham cole liaison captain hervey liaison your business is to respond to a properly constituted request for assistance nothing more where is your troop hervey explained and did a magistrate request this not exactly your lordship what do you mean not exactly sir there has to be exactitude in this business or else it will be the assizes for you i mean your lordship that the association members received threats during the night and i thought it best association be damned captain hervey upstart tradesmen and jews ill not have my regiment ruin its appearance and name by chasing round after halfwits who put a torch to a few hosiers shops and their pretentious residences once again hervey boiled inside he had seen more learning and good manners in one week from sir abraham than he had seen from lord towcester in six months and he longed to say so my lord these are honest men deserving of our protection sir francis evans said just that do not presume to tell me what is my duty sir hissed lord towcester do not presume that you know what is the district commanders mind better than i do hervey clenched his fists bringing them instinctively to the stripes of his overalls so that at the position of attention he might better master his rage he knew he had overstepped the mark but he did not want to concede the fact the trouble was it was perfectly evident that lord towcesters sole object was to get back to brighton at the first opportunity and with his regiment in as pretty a condition as possible he cared not one jot for the peace of the boroughs or the safety of the manufacturers your lordship it was certainly not my intention to presume anything but sir abraham cole has told me in great detail of the fearful eruptions of violence in the borough not five years ago if the luddites got the upper hand there is no knowing where they would stop for the opinion is that their grievances go beyond framebreaking there is talk of general insurrection and their graces in the dukeries are members of parliament the nearest ones at hand they might well be the first objects of the mob lord towcester remained silent hervey pressed his point carefully and the militia sir they have not been embodied these last two years you could scarcely count on them the yeomanry is true but the lieutenant colonel seemed to calm himself a little i see he turned towards the big coloured map what is this hervey explained it was drawn by private hopwood sir lord towcester looked at the dragoon standing to attention next to the board indeed indeed it is very good my man thank you my lord have you been with the regiment long hervey rolled his eyes in disbelief hopwood remained steadfastly eyesfront three years my lord good good now captain hervey he said turning back let it be strictly understood i want no heroics you are to withdraw your troop to these lines and await the properly constituted request of a magistrate and it shall be for limited assistance mind the appearance of regular troops about the area is bound to fuel violent feeling these hosiers must get up proper watches dig into their jewy pockets and pay for constables i will not have the hosiers of nottingham kept at my expense im obliged your lordship a tory of the most boneheaded sort wrote hervey that night in his journal though he could not claim the words as his own for they had been barrows one evening in brighton the sort who believes the garden of eden was inferior to any english estate barrow had scoffed in his cups and barrow was a man known for his forthright contempt for the whigs too thus could lord towcester unite opposites rued hervey fortunately lord towcester had not specified when exactly the troops were to be withdrawn to the lines though it was perfectly obvious he intended it to be at once hervey confided to the page he had therefore calculated that he could get away with sending orders for recall at first light next day which would at least reassure the hosiers and magistrates during this crucial first night thereafter the paid watches and the posse properly stoodto ought to be able to give some measure of reassurance and he prayed it would never come to it protection each house had at least three firearms sir abraham told him and as long as the others in the beacon chain were prompt and brave in relaying the alarm it ought to be possible for each householder to ward off an attack long enough for herveys men to arrive three days went by without any further threats made to the association or the bench indeed they were a very agreeable three days for the autumn sunshine was warm there was no rain and the tradesmen of the town appeared welcoming of the dragoons custom especially the innkeepers and owners of the public houses the bow street men had arrived the same as had come to longleat and had begun their investigations at once first they questioned the known witnesses to the attack on the steamframe workshops discovered there were more took statements compared them began questioning the proprietors of the drinking places and their taverners and slowly but resolutely like an industrious spider they extended the range of their investigation until they reached the town limits in this way they explained they hoped to establish what method there was in the luddite activity and the degree of support active or passive which they enjoyed in the various parts they would then go into the villages of the borough depending upon the results of this preliminary work but their work methodical though it was had not been proving easy they had encountered they told hervey the second evening a shyness which quite baffled them a shyness far beyond that which they encountered in london in the investigation of crime they had not had a single piece of information on the usual terms although the senior of the two the former artificer of engineers was hopeful still of one of the pothouse owners they went unmolested in their work however requiring no escort although both of them carried pistols and looked well able to have a care of themselves mansfield was not one of the rookeries they said smiling henrietta had driven from welbeck each day to see her husband she had not been at the abbey when lord towcester had visited staying instead at nearby woodhouse with the dowager and though the duke had been kindness itself she declared she felt unsettled by the distance and when the portlands left for london a few days later she determined to lodge at the grange no matter what the objections were she and hervey had dined at sir abraham coles the evening before and he had delighted them for an hour afterwards with his celestial globe and professed himself much disappointed when they insisted they were unable to stay to see the heavenly bodies in their reality they had driven back to the grange late for a wheel pin sheared soon after they left clipstone and finding the other officers had retired by the time they returned they were able to retire too and enjoy an intimacy denied to them for a whole week towards watering parade next day hervey found himself searching for private johnson where in heavens name is he serjeant armstrong i saw him at reveille and he was there on first parade but i havent seen him since do you want something doing no not especially now i just wanted to tell him i was intending to drive to clipstone ill send someone to find him said armstrong lingard seton cannings groom came doubling sir have you seen johnson since first parade lingard looked sheepish whats happening lingard growled armstrong sir i johnsons in the feed store hervey took over the interrogation whats amiss lingard lingard shifted awkwardly evading herveys eye answer up man barked armstrong sir johnson is very upset about what sir if you please i think its better that he tells you lingard barked armstrong again its his mother sir hervey looked at armstrong puzzled but he doesnt have a mother no sir said lingard sir itd be much better if it came from him hervey sensed he was right very well ill go and see him ill keep the store clear said armstrong quietly hervey found johnson sitting on a bag of barley head in hands he sat down next to him and took off his forage cap do you want to tell me what this is about johnson sat up there were telltale streaks on his face mmother yes lingard said i thought no sir thats what id always thought an all he wiped his nose with his sleeve i als thought she were dead thats what i were told im sure it were but shes ere in ttown hervey tried to keep a rein on his disbelief but how have you found this out she wouldnt have known any of the troops names johnson merely shook his head only then did it occur to hervey that tears were a strange reaction to such a discovery have you seen her no i avent i dont want to i were appy enough as i were hervey stayed silent for several minutes but johnson even now to know your mother is he stopped when he saw the tears in his grooms eyes and on his cheeks johnson gave a deep sigh and seemed to brace himself sir some o tmen met er in one o tpotouses yes sir shes been gooin wi em for over a week hervey felt a knot in his own stomach even the idea appalled he put his arm round him im so very sorry after a while he got up and told johnson to stay where he was for as long as he liked ill tell serjeant armstrong and well try to sort something out is there anything you want me to do no sir replied johnson sniffing ill stay by meself for a bit longer and then ill go and do gilbert all right then but only when youre ready as hervey left johnson stood up and turned his head after him thanks sir im sorry hervey told serjeant armstrong johnsons news but how in heavens name he came to find out i cant begin to think armstrong had already questioned lingard robustly he sang like a little linnet did our lingard seems theyve all been lifting a leg in that part of town since we came anyway one of these women gets talking and says how shes got a son in the army but shes never seen im since he was a bairn she put im in a workhouse in sheffield twentyodd years ago and never saw im since hervey frowned but thats not very convincing evidence of motherhood she knew he was called johnson and shes got half a page from a bible thats the testificate or whatever its called hervey had heard johnson speak of that before but even so even so sir what she needs to do is get that page matched up with the bit they keeps at the workhouse and quickly hervey agreed meanwhile ill put this busy little doxy out of bounds therell be no more ascension days for the troop with her henrietta learned of johnsons unhappiness soon after and was very grieved for him she knew at once what must be done and reported as much to her husband but you cannot possibly go to that place and see her hervey protested i doubt shell be about her business in the morning you said she lived in a cave i shall go and see her there going to a hovel dug out of stone to visit a it is insupportable he admired her pluck though he hesitated to tell her so matthew i have moved in society a very great deal and in principle i should be doing nothing that i have not done before it was a riposte so disarming that hervey at once gave up any further protest henrietta returned an hour later with the carriage blinds drawn and told her husband that she was driving to sheffield why why must you go to sheffield demanded hervey so incredulous as to sound angry to her because the sooner the testificate is verified the sooner private johnson will know what to do mrs stallybrass his socalled mother is inside the carriage her tone defied further protest for the second time that morning when hervey told serjeant armstrong at watering parade later both men found themselves smiling apparently mrs stallybrass would not give up the piece of paper and so my wife had to take her with her then she went to tell johnson and he insisted on going too because he said he couldnt allow her to travel with a woman like that what a merry party they will be said armstrong shaking his head how far is it to sheffield twice as far as nottingham theyll not be back before night hervey raised his eyebrows she spoke of returning via chatsworth armstrong shook his head in equal dismay im not even sure as my caithlin would have taken a fence like that hervey smiled again oh i think she would serjeant armstrong i think she would whens caithlin coming by the way tomorrow all being well ive found clean lodgings five minutes away by the southwell road im glad of it the latest from nottingham is that the prince regents pavilion has closed for the winter already so therell be no pull from the prince to get us back to brighton we might well see out the winter in nottingham garrison well therell be plenty of firewood at least said armstrong with a grin ive never seen so many trees in all my life then he looked more serious if ever it comes to a chase though well lose every time but what a place it is for ambushing enthused hervey armstrong nodded there was no doubting that come and have a look at hopwoods map its given me an idea chapter fifteen attack mansfield october sir sir beacons lit hervey woke slower than usual he heard the banging on the door rather than the report come in the orderly serjeant held his lantern high corporal evans sir weve just seen the north beacon light have you roused the outpicket ay sir and mr canning serjeant armstrong was at the door a few seconds later id just begun my rounds ive told lingard to saddle up for you hervey pulled on his boots and overalls cursed as he broke the bar of a spur ramming it into the housing fastened his jacket wedged his shako on tight took his gloves seized up his swordbelt and carbine almost forgetting the ready cylinder and took the stairs at a run in the grange yard dragoons were already leading out horses under saddle both outlying and inlying pickets slept dressed and the lancecorporal was numbering them off mr seton canning the lieutenant hurried across the yard ready hervey standto second division and follow on as soon as you can have st oswald standby third ill take the picket with serjeant armstrong sir trumpeter susan medwell came doubling followed by herveys coverman i think this is it corporal troughton stick close medwell ill want charge when were near it could scatter them without a shot sir well done lingard put this in the bucket he passed the carbine to his standin groom as he took gilberts reins and checked the girth picket ready sir called armstrong from the saddle of his big dapple bay very well threes advance at the trot in fewer than ten minutes from first alarm fifteen dragoons their captain coverman trumpeter and serjeant were leaving the billet for the besieged house herveys beacon system was in two lines one for the houses north of the town and one for those south when a house was attacked the watchmen on the roof were to light the beacon and the watches on the other houses would relay the alarm by lighting theirs videttes set at last light observed the centre house of each line and galloped the alarm back to the grange the centre house had two beacons so that if a house on the left of the line were attacked and later one on the right it could signal the subsequent attack but the picket would not know whether the attack were left or right until reaching the centre house there was a threequarter moon giving enough light to the road to allow the picket a good canter for most of the mile and a half to warren hall centre house of the north beacon line there were men with torches at the gates as hervey came up its down the line towards pleasley sir they called hervey left one man as post and took the rest straight on increasing the pace once his eyes had recovered from the torches at each house it was the same they had relayed the further beacon as hervey passed the last house but one he became suspicious of the luddites chance attack on the furthest point of the line do you want me to blow the charge yet sir called susan medwell no lets wait and see herveys instinct soon proved right they galloped up the drive of pleasley grange to see torches all over the place but no luddites the roof watch came down the escape ladders in haste and confusion whats happening shouted hervey its queer sir said the chief watchman we was attacked for all of ten minutes shots and all and then they just went as if they heard you coming but that was half an hour ago did you fire the beacon at once ay sir i think it were that that frightened em off is anyone hurt no sir very well ill leave two dragoons till morning threes about serjeant armstrong they galloped back down the drive as fast as they could do you think what i think shouted armstrong closing up ive been humbugged i wouldnt have taken it personal like that but yes how in gods name did they know they checked to a trot to take the turn back onto the road well theyd easily have known about the beacons you could hardly keep them a secret all they have to do is attack one house and then stand back to see how long it takes us to get here sons of sherwood they call themselves bloody robin hoods armstrong spat into the hedge at an imagined outlaw so theyve watched us all the way here probably shit hervey felt like spitting too surely its too much of a coincidence to be all the way this end of the line though what if they draw us to one end and then attack the other thats why youve got a second beacon and what if the other lines now lit the south line well we always knew we couldnt be everywhere at once and neither can they no thats why we had to be at the right place because they choose the point of attack what if theyve decoyed us here and then st oswalds picket to the other line cannings already galloping down here i bet that second beacon at warren hall wont be lit till hes passed you mean itll be lit any minute now if theyre having a go at clipstone exactly come on they pressed back into a canter it took the best part of an hour to get within reach of clipstone they had turned round seton cannings division within half a mile of pleasley grange which meant to hervey that the second beacon at warren hall could not have been alight a quarter of an hour before but both beacons were well ablaze when theyd passed the house again and now they could hear firing towards clipstone from a mile off hervey ordered medwell to blow for all he was worth as they galloped the last stretch praying there were no trip ropes across the road from the top of the rise they could see the house plainly more flames than just the beacon hervey barely checked to take the graceful curve of the park drive through the gates his blood boiling at the sight of the flames as well as at his own deception he shouted no orders as there could be no plan luddites bolted in all directions before him like rats fleeing a terrier he chased after one towards the jacobs meadow knowing hed run him up against the park wall a report and powder flash from the beech hedge to his right made him swing his carbine and fire instinctively oh sir oh god he looked round susan medwell was clutching his stomach hold up man called hervey circling and seizing medwell round the shoulders to support him in the saddle corporal troughton his coverman was already on the other side ive got im sir hervey let go and turned to the beech hedge come out at once with your hands up he barely counted to five before firing into the hedge again four times a few seconds later a man stumbled out and fell to the ground leave im sir shouted armstrong jumping from the saddle and running towards the motionless figure pistol cocked he turned him over roughly saw he was dead and spat with the utmost force at the ground wheres that other bastard run to sir the field there with the sheep but the park wall will stop him armstrong changed hands with the pistol drew his sabre and took off after him go and cover him stancliff called hervey to the nearest dragoon come on susan my brave lad lets get you down and bandaged but medwell was dead in the saddle and his little grey mare was anxious sir hes gripping my arm so tight i cant oh christ all right corporal troughton ill take his bridle morris another dragoon hurried over sir help corporal troughton get medwell down hes shot dead it was a struggle but between the three of them they managed to lay private medwell on the ground with a degree of dignity hervey tried now to hold back his disgust his anger he was past caring about he was never fool enough to believe that all dragoons were the same to him and susan medwell he loved because he was a matchless trumpeter and as smart a man as ever hed seen in uniform and medwell had loved being his trumpeter and never sought to hide it jesus christ cursed hervey shot down in his own country seton canning came running hervey the house is well ablaze well need help from the village send for it then and tell whoever not to take no for an answer is sir abraham safe ay they all are except one of the watch has a flesh wound ill come in a minute he took medwells cloak from the saddle arch and laid it over him stand with him stancliff i dont want anyone riding over him ay sir said the dragoon taking the greys reins hervey and his coverman ran to the front of the house where sir abraham and the watch were huddled by the light of the flames he could see the dismay in the magistrates face sir abraham im so very sorry we were not here quicker we held them off a full halfhour kept firing above their heads but they were determined to break in they managed to prise off the shutters at the east side though we threw bricks down at them the while and then they fired the place without a thought for who was inside or how we might get down from the roof hervey glanced at the line of gardeners and indoor servants passing buckets to the house it seemed to him a forlorn hope is there a fire engine in clipstone sir abraham there is i paid for it myself then we shall have it soon sir abraham seemed reassured hervey glanced over to the house again corporal troughton get as many men as you can to the front doors we can at least get some of sir abrahams things out no hervey no sir abraham shouted i shant have the deaths of any more men on my hands leave it leave it all hervey motioned troughton to do his bidding anyway with your leave sir he said quietly and then ran towards the house calling to seton canning to follow him the doors were wide open and the gardeners were managing to play a stirrup pump to some effect over the stairs the fire was still in the right wing and there was as yet no smoke in the left where sir abrahams porcelain collection was displayed the study adjoined the main drawing room which was well alight so hervey took seton canning and some of the servants straight to the china in a very little time they had a chain bringing it out the study was another matter it took him several minutes to find the right doors it was surprisingly dark and when he had the smoke issuing from beneath them suggested the study was gone but hervey couldnt turn his back on years of scholarship not without trying he felt the door panels they were cool enough he touched the gilt handles they didnt burn him he took a deep breath and opened one of the double doors a little way the smoke swirled backwards with the draught from outside giving him a clear enough view of sir abrahams desk he knew the folios were in its drawers only two dozen feet from him but with so much smoke he needed a clew to be safe curtain ties provided the means he made three forays into the study with the last he was forced to the floor as smoke swirled back with the shattering of one of the clerestories coughing badly he managed to close the doors however and get seton cannings chain to pass out the ledgers all of them the clipstone engine and its crew fought the flames tenaciously but the battle was uneven by dawn the house was burned out on the lawns were a good quantity of sir abrahams pictures and furniture all his chinese porcelain and his old testament scholarship the man shot dead by hervey was recognized at once by sir abraham when daylight came one of his own workshop foremen serjeant armstrong had taken the other fugitive alive after a savage fight which had left both of them bruised about the face and corporal harris had taken two more in clipstone churchyard as he went for the fire engine sir abrahams first thought on seeing the extent of his loss was the condition of his servants he gathered them together indoor and outdoor alike asked the housemaids very politely to stop crying and assured them all that they would not lose a single penny of their wages while the house was rebuilt and that they would have a roof over their head somehow by that very evening a man that men would follow willingly said serjeant armstrong hearing it some of these folk dont know theyre born there was an emergency meeting of the bench at midday sir abraham cole presided with remarkable composure hervey told seton canning as they rode back to the grange afterwards the other magistrates looked decidedly shaky they took a lot of persuading their duties must continue as before i would that theyd make a start with those two we caught in the churchyard theyll be remanded to the assizes this afternoon hervey assured him besides aught else sir abraham wants them out of the borough as soon as possible seton canning nodded im surprised the bench assembled at all i imagined theyd have barricaded themselves in after last night i think it was the bow street men who put the resolve in them theyve a string of agents now and it seems their questioning of the churchyard men this morning rendered very serviceable intelligence what about the one that serjeant armstrong took oh theyve even higher hopes there he was found with a pistol on him which means he could be charged with at least one capital offence they believe hell turn kings evidence just as they were approaching the grange there was a noise of galloping on the road behind them they turned to see sir francis evans at full stretch good lord said hervey reining his horse about what alarms this sir franciss horse was in as great a lather as hervey had seen but the general looked invigorated heard about the nights trouble via the mercury offices this morning he called springing from the saddle like a man half his age came at once just seen sir abraham cole and his justices promised em more troops as long as they maintain the posse in being urged em not to swing to repressive measures i dont want my cavalry drawn into controlling crowds i dont want them dissipating their strength when its needed to fight the hard core of these luddites grooms rushed to take the reins of the dozen or so horses now snorting and blowing by the gates of the grange come then said sir francis clapping a hand on herveys shoulder a full and frank account of the past week if you will hervey began at once as they made their way across the courtyard to the grange house serjeant armstrong had hastily arranged for coffee coffee could allay a great many general officers complaints in armstrongs experience and the state of the quarter guard which had turned out for him in cloaks because their tunics were still sodden from firefighting would be bound to provoke a generals displeasure but no sir francis appeared to have no cause for complaint he took the coffee gladly sank into a chair and bid hervey to do the same tell me of those bow street men hervey when did they come hervey explained the background a little warily still for the generals tone could have implied disapproval as well as curiosity he need not have worried on this account either however sir francis thought it the very model of assistance to the civil powers i truly believe that its the fear of being taken in their own homes with evidence for conviction which will stop this criminality for thats what it is no more no less its the same with the insurrectionists its not the plotters and ringleaders that get chopped down by the yeomanry we can hang and transport all we like but rooting out them thats scheming should be the priority i met with the sheriff again yesterday and he is ruing the dearth of intelligence from his own sources i congratulate you therefore hervey thank you sir said hervey how easy it was to serve a man like this a man to place ones trust in but i have to say i take no delight in last evening i was humbugged and i should have seen it before i did sir francis looked at him sceptically captain hervey a word of advice do not be too ready to volunteer your failings to authority you may find it is too convenient sometimes for superiors to accept them in lieu of their own hervey nodded im sorry sir i confess to feeling the loss of my trumpeter rather more than i should if this were france indeed indeed it is bound to go heavy with you and you are aware of course that you will have to answer to the courts for the man you killed i know it sir francis sir abraham cole said that i should engage an attorney at once though he supposed it would amount to no great affair i should damn well hope not sir francis drained his coffee cup and then a thought seemed to occur to him where is lord towcester i havent seen him in days hervey explained that the lieutenant colonel had visited only recently having been paying his respects to the greater landowners of the district thats only right said sir francis nodding then you shall have to send for more dragoons yourself he added emphatically its quiet in worksop by all accounts they should be able to spare you a halftroop well hervey i consider myself very well instructed by all that ive heard now explain to me once more what precisely is this scheme of ambush of yours you can cover all the roads north of the town you say and at one and the same time a letter arrived from horningsham in the afternoon hervey opened it with some trepidation for it was in elizabeths hand and that could mean only one thing ill news of the archdeaconry feud for his father would surely have written if the affair had been resolved happily horningsham september dearest matthew i fear i send you discouraging news father has been summoned before the consistory on the quarter day next he is greatly supported by mr keble and others in london but it goes very badly with mama who is fearful that we shall be promptly dispossessed i know that your duties in the north must prevent your being with us for many weeks more and i would not wish you to have any cares on our account but our mother and father would be greatly comforted by your visiting especially if the consistory goes ill for us daniel coates called yesterday and on learning that i was to write to you bade me ask if your instruction to him with reference to lord towcester remained as before i do not understand the inquiry and so i repeat the words exactly as daniel spoke them to me and trust that their meaning is plain to you please give my very greatest love to henrietta and say that i shall write as soon as events permit forgive please the haste in which this is written but i have a short time only before a postboy is to come your ever affectionate sister elizabeth henriettas carriage returned to the grange a little before five where is my husband mr seton canning i believe he has gone to take exercise maam said the lieutenant with an amused expression though why he should need it after last nights exertions is a little beyond me im afraid you must tell me of them later sighed henrietta rather dismissively but taking his hand to step from the chaise private johnson had already jumped down from the box where despite henriettas request otherwise he had insisted on travelling since chatsworth and seton canning now craned his neck to see the third passenger of whom he had heard so much no mr canning there is no mrs johnson or mrs stallybrass rather the lieutenant looked puzzled johnson saluted excuse me maam mr canning sir ill report to serjeant armstrong if theres nothing more seton canning looked at henrietta who smiled and shook her head very well johnson he said returning the salute with a touch to his cap dismiss johnson said thank you maam to henrietta twice and scurried off to the horse lines what a transformation said seton canning taking henriettas travelling case i had no idea sheffield could be so restorative of the spirits henrietta smiled again he is very happy hes reconciled to his mother then no he still does not have a mother it was ezra rather than ezekiel maam she set off up the steps of the grange house the testificate was a page from the book of ezra johnsons was from ezekiel he looked no wiser yet it seems the practice at the sheffield foundling hospital or the workhouse as johnson will insist on having it is to tear a page in half from a special bible they have and in the part remaining they record the details of the foundling and give the other half to the mother or whoever brings in the child as a receipt seton canning sounded astonished you have lived too long with gentlefolk by the sound of it mr canning it gave henrietta surprising satisfaction to say so maam that is most unfair i oh come mr canning you dont suppose that i make a habit of walking in gutters no of course would you like some tea yes very much he called for fresh water but the name johnson that was an extraordinary coincidence was it not no she said taking off her gloves all the foundlings that month were named johnson that is the custom like naming hounds with the same letter in a year great heavens henrietta was warming to her newfound social sensibility if he had been left at lincolns inn he would have been named lincoln no matter what the month just like your serjeantmajor canning had again learned something new where is mrs stallybrass now she is with the bow street men i believe the phrase is assisting them with their enquiries have you heard of twisting in he hadnt well it is the secret rite by which someone is admitted to the company of general ludd i shall say no more it is not womens business seton canning could not imagine henrietta conceding that any business could fall under such a ban but he thought prudently to let it go they chatted for not many minutes more before hervey returned from his solitary ride he managed a sort of smile which alerted henrietta to some distress while not suggesting the same to his lieutenant he bent to kiss her said how pleased he was to see the journey had not fatigued her and then asked seton canning if he would leave them alone for a time when seton canning was gone hervey asked how things had been with johnson she told him briefly of the particulars saying that she would explain more about mrs stallybrass when he had told her what was troubling him hervey pulled a chair up close to henrietta and gave her the news of trumpeter medwells death tears came to her eyes at once for medwell had been a regular visitor at their quarters what a terrible thing to be shot down by a fellow countryman she said dabbing at her eyes with a silk square everyones been saying the same it seems so much worse than falling to a french ball just like the poor duke of huntingdons son in london exactly so hervey took her hand and sighed and there is ill news from wiltshire my father is to be arraigned before a diocesan court elizabeth believes he will lose the living i think i had better go back to longleat she said sorrowfully he took up her hand again my darling i would very much prefer if you didnt never had she heard him sound quite so dejected she smiled encouragingly and kissed his forehead no i shant go we stay together now be what may chapter sixteen revolution stalks our county leading article the nottingham mercury october the insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month has no parallel in history since the troubled days of charles i even the depredations of luddism in these parts only five years ago did not carry the attendant threats upon the sovereign his regent or government which have been uttered these last weeks in the name of justice the rioters appear suddenly in armed parties under regular commanders the chief commander whoever he may be is styled general ludd they march to their objective with military discipline ten abreast and as soon as the work of destruction is completed the leader draws up his men calls the roll each man answering to a particular number instead of a name they then fire off their pistols give a great shout and march off in regular military order in spite of curfews and a posse comitatus the authorities seem powerless to halt the wave of machine breaking which nightly threatens the prosperity of these parts and so thorough is that destruction so indiscriminate in its abuse of employers who are spoken of by their workers as bad and good alike that we are of the opinion that the spectre of jacobinism which stalked the continent these past twenty years is come to our shores and that only by the most vigorous action shall it be extinguished a week passed in which despite the worst fears of the mercury the borough of mansfield and indeed most of the county remained peaceable and hervey and henrietta were able to enjoy an interlude of domesticity at the grange one afternoon an orderly dragoon brought a letter from regimental headquarters in nottingham hervey read it twice and then put it down i can scarcely believe it the man must be an imbecile lord towcester i suppose sighed henrietta laying aside her novel tell me of it he says that the uniforms of my troop are now in the worst condition of any in the regiment and that i must put in hand their replacement at once and are they he looked at her in some surprise how can i know for i have seen none but my own troop for three weeks barrows was here for only a couple of days before lord towcester sent them back she simply raised her eyebrows in any case weve scarcely been chafing them for our own amusement how shall you have them replaced the men must pay for them themselves or else i must well make claims on the borough and the insurance companies for the fires weve put out but ill warrant the moneyll be slow in the paying she picked up her book again and grinned perhaps the clothiers of mansfield can knit you all new tunics henrietta but it is i grant you a strange preoccupation in the middle of all this skirmishing nothing i do seems to please lord towcester sir abraham sent him a letter of appreciation and youd think it had been a protest by the prince regent its only when general evans rides him that his stupiditys at all curbed and where is the general gone to that lord towcester is let out of his asylum london to see lord sidmouth at the home office she merely raised an eyebrow all this was really most dispiriting hervey was tired of talking about his commanding officer what do you read there miss austens last novel it is called emma oh a pretty name yes she said turning a page i wonder if emma lucie is married to mr somervile yet i hope so they sound very suited from what you spoke of him but i have had no word from her in response to mine another two months at least even by the egyptian route she raised another eyebrow he poured more tea why did you say her last novel has miss austen declared she will write no more oh matthew she died but two months ago did you not read of it evidently not i am sorry of it was she very old she was not three and forty and i confess her passing made me most alert to my own mortality for i had spoken with her in bath only the month before you returned my darling she shook her head did you ever read the book of hers i gave you he had to own that he had not i confess it never engaged me matthew do you ever read novels yes which last did you read the answer came almost at once it was called waverley was it of soldiery he frowned there were some very romantic episodes it was about soldiery and how recently was it that you read on board ship now she frowned the return or the outward passage he sighed i prefer poetry she laughed i know you do then i shall read to you tonight when we are in bed john keats he looked blank dont you remember mr keble spoke of him when we were at the henge those three years ago but i dont think hed been much heard of then i have his first volume published only this spring he smiled in pleasant anticipation you know i do very much like it here she laughed again of course you do matthew hervey you are surrounded by your dragoons the lieutenant colonel is twenty miles away and you have me with you in that order i think probably yes they kissed and would have moved closer but a knock at the door reclaimed them private johnson announced the bow street men come in gentlemen come in said hervey holding out his hand with a display of real pleasure you have been elusive this past week or so indeed we have sir indeed we have good afternoon your ladyship henrietta smiled as warmly and asked johnson to bring more cups sit down gentlemen please said hervey helping them to chairs what brings you i think we may be very close to a deciding bout said the senior of the two it seemed an apt metaphor for he had always looked to hervey like a man at home in the ring indeed mr wilks then i am all attention the other investigator the former insurance man took out his pocketbook and sat poised to make notes there was no look of the pugilist to mr bartle rather had he the appearance of an apothecary wilks drained his teacup drew forward in his chair and began to speak in a more confidential tone i do believe we know the identities of the leaders of the socalled shirewood brigade its they that have been organizing the violence in the north of the county hervey nodded you know who is this enoch wilks smiled that much was easy sir enoch is a hammer hervey did not comprehend the hammers they use for machinebreaking theyre called enochs after the ironworks that makes them hervey felt a little foolish do continue please mr wilks we had a meeting with general evans last night in the castle when he got back from london at this point wilks looked rather uncomfortable im sorry sir but though i know we are in the boroughs pay and you asked us here we had a duty to the goc of course of course said hervey who had never for once supposed that bow street men worked to as rigid a system of command as his well then the home office it seems is of the opinion that although there is plotting against the government all over the place it is haphazard theres no method in it all their spies and informers suggest the same that these luddites are only associated with the conspirators by opportunity by suggestion even for the most part and the likes of hunt and the spa fielders have no more connection with the trouble here than bonaparte hervey was glad to hear it but didnt immediately see the implication if we can give one knockout blow to one of these brigades wilkss dislike of using an otherwise honourable term was quite evident then theres a very good chance the others will be cowed into surrender or rather inactivity theyll fear weve penetrated their secrecy entirely and the threat of the gallows should do the rest and we are now in a position to do this to deliver this knockout blow wilks smiled and a suggestion of the same came to the lips of his assistant we are sir would you like more tea before you tell us how mr wilks asked henrietta indeed i should maam and you mr bartle very much your ladyship she filled their cups and asked if they would prefer that she left before hervey could say anything wilks protested that indeed he would not for it was your information with regard to mrs stallybrass that began the trail to this evening your ladyship henrietta seemed very gratified by this well sir it seems that your ambuscading scheme has them running very scared they cant assemble in the numbers they need especially since the posse is now so effective it was now herveys turn to feel gratified and your dragoons are so quick about the place that our night owls fear being counterattacked if they do manage to concentrate its the same at worksop hervey was pleased to hear that barrow was having equal success though hardly surprised theyve called a meeting tonight at the crows nest in cuckney hervey knew the place about the remotest spot they could have chosen wilks agreed if they can get there therell be every twistedin commander in the north of the county and one or two from as far afield as derby and yorkshire how many upwards of twenty and theyll have their guards with them hervey blew out his breath twenty that would be a devil of a fight with twice the number of dragoons henrietta began to look anxious with three times the number wilks interjected thesell be desperate men when theyre cornered all of themll face the gallows i shall have to send for help from ollerton or worksop id rather you didnt sir said wilks it would be better that there was no extra movement of troops theyll be jittery these men and i wouldnt want them frightened off theyll know your dragoons by sight by now and theyd recognize reinforcements from a different troop then i shant be able to lay my ambushes tonight no sir i wouldnt want you to for that might discourage a few as well no we want the birds to flock to the crows nest like regular black crows of an evening rookeries again mr wilks smiled hervey rookeries indeed sir how many birds does it take to make a rook pie dye think henrietta rose a little pale and excused herself hervey made to follow but she bade him stay just a little air that is all i was never partial to the dish very well gentlemen said hervey sitting down again but im afraid i shall have to have a written request from a magistrate either that or an order from my commanding officer wilks looked uncomfortable for the second time how can i put this sir he cleared his throat the goc said most emphatically that we were to treat direct with you and on no account to speak of it in nottingham itself the general will be here himself by five he said hervey made no comment so we shall ask sir abraham cole that would be best sir agreed wilks also the generals daag will come to apprise you of the position as regards the new act hervey went to a writing table dashed off a few lines to sir abraham and called private johnson to have them delivered straight away to the moot hall where the chairman of the bench had taken up residence well then gentlemen he said taking the stopper from a decanter of madeira i imagine we have rather a lot of details to discuss sir francis evans arrived shortly before five his ears were bright red as he stepped from the stirrups to the mounting block and hervey took note of the danger signal his look was fearsome rather than merely angry however for there was a glint in his eye like a hungry bird of prey a hawk which had spotted its quarry and was savouring the swoop everything set hervey yes general hervey replied surely there is just the bidding from the magistrate to come good better tell me your intention then sir francis pulled off his gloves and set about the dust on his sleeves with the utmost aggression hervey took him to his map board by which johnson had already placed a steaming pot of coffee you dont miss tricks much do you hervey indeed sir hervey assumed he meant the coffee nor do i hervey nor do i no sir hervey was becoming a little lost and thought he would press on with what he knew there is cuckney sir he began pointing out the little cluster of houses where the old worksop and chesterfield turnpikes crossed its eight or nine miles from here and the roads are good the crows nest was once a posthouse and it has goodsized stables with a few liveries still he showed the general a sketch plan drawn from the recollection of the halfdozen dragoons who had visited there once or twice in the first days the bow street men say the luddites will assemble over the space of an hour or so under cover of regular taverners and when all are come by nine they reckon they will meet in the stables loft for about an hour and then disperse in time for the curfew the trick will be judging the moment to take them has barnaby instructed you yes general he arrived an hour ago as i understand it the new act makes assembly for a seditious purpose illegal just so its meant to stop jackanapes like hunt from drawing the crowds and hotting em up but it could serve our purpose too for if there isnt enough evidence for charges under the common law for unlawful assembly then we ought still to be able to net them for sedition either way itll be the rope mr wilks says there will be an informer at the meeting and that it will be his evidence that will convict the general looked very satisfied but in the event that the man is not there mr bartle will already be secreted in the loft to witness it and how shall he get there without being seen hervey smiled its very ingenious sir hell take a no said the general sharply i dont need to know very good sir so we shall have our patrols about the roads before dark so as to give every appearance of the usual and then theyll make a proper show of retiring from the district but theyll assemble in the forest in subdivisions here he pointed to half a dozen patches of green in a broad circle around cuckney by the clock theyll leave their hides and make a cordon about the crows nest at a depth of about a furlong that much is easy enough captain hervey the general agreed it will bring spain back to mind for sure sir the general saw that too and then what major barnaby says that we stand to have things go badly against us if we do not call upon them to throw down their arms assuming they will be armed that is its a very fair presumption hervey and in truth sir i dont wish to go in with fire against men who have not offered resistance the general made a wry smile tirez les premiers captain hervey hervey sighed you yourself said it was a most objectionable business firing on ones own countrymen general indeed i did hervey your forbearance does you credit and in truth therell be more example in the gallows and the transport than dead meat quite sir he agreed though a shade caught by the tone but see here those are decent sentiments and never should i wish the day to come when we had insufficient officers of that mind but these will all be twistedin men looking the gallows in the face youre not to take any chances sir franciss robust support was very welcome no sir i intend that we shock them so greatly they will throw all in very well and you shall have my best support hervey was not sure of his entire meaning sir i mean that i shall ride with you i do not send men on such hazards while i warm myself by a fire no sir francis indeed not said hervey with a slightly anxious note but if things go badly itll be me to answer for it and im an infinitely harder fish to swallow than a captain of dragoons i am very much obliged sir hervey supposed that the disadvantages of the generals interfering were outweighed by the safety he provided well then do we eat before we go said sir francis with a proper smile at last yes general in half an hour when my cornet is back with the bidding from sir abraham cole good ill take a little madeira with you until then johnson brought a new decanter there is one thing sir francis said hervey cautiously as he took his glass ay he cleared his throat i am uneasy that i have not not had the opportunity to speak with my commanding officer on this affair sir francis evans turned a gimlet eye on him and his ear reddened do not sport with me captain hervey lieutenant seton canning moved like a seasoned woodsman along the forest track to where the last of the subdivisions stood waiting the moon being up early and throwing all the light he needed corporal clarkson was ready for him subdivision fed and watered carbines and pistols primed nothing to report sir it had been the same with the others all in their places in good heart and eager for the chase another halfhour corporal and then well break cover stand easy seton canning lit a cigar cuckney was about a mile to the south the other subdivisions were a little closer and timing was of the essence the cordon had to be set by nine so that if anything went wrong at the crows nest they would be able to net the assembly as they bolted but there could be no movement from the coverts until the very last minute in case a latecomer detected them and alerted the rest they might even bump into honest travellers but that was a risk they would simply have to take in which case they would detain the wayfarers until the affair was over when the time came seton cannings dragoons would trot for half the distance to the hamlet along a green bridleway which would take them four minutes then taking about the same time again they would walk for the next quarter of a mile so as to make less noise and then they would dismount and lead the horses the last furlong posting dragoons at intervals until they met up with the other subdivisions and the whole village was encircled this would probably take another ten minutes they would therefore leave the covert at eighteen minutes to nine a few minutes before the others it is just gone ten past eight sir francis said hervey closing his hunter very well then the generals orderly held down the offside stirrup as his principal mounted the handy little mouse dun which he seemed excessively attached to and beckoned to his adc if that mare of yours is still horsing and squeals so much as once ill send the pair of you packing at once sir the adc was from the first guards and therefore wont to answer any enquiry or command with the simple affirmative relying solely on its infinite tonal possibilities to convey meaning hervey gave henrietta a parting kiss sprang into the saddle and gathered up the reins gilbert crabbed right and rear backing into the adcs horse which squealed and set her teeth at the greys rump for gods sake harry the general seemed much preoccupied with the behaviour of his adcs mare my fault sir francis owned hervey hes still a bit green about carriage lights the chaises lights made a sweep of the party as it turned full circle in the yard all set serjeant armstrong called hervey ay sir came armstrongs voice from the window its a press but were in very well mr st oswald lead on if you please the general obliged hervey greatly as they rode to cuckney by saying nothing except the occasional reproof to his longsuffering adc the moon gave the evening an almost merry feel as if they were off to a levee or a ball the first mile they did at a walk and only a milk cart passed in the other direction on the whole sherwood was not a place to be about after dark then they made a good trot on the macadamized turnpike eight miles an hour with something still in reserve plans were all made orders had been given there was nothing for hervey to do now but enjoy the ride and relish perhaps what was to come he found himself humming rule britannia until he supposed it not quite apt and then remembered another of thomsons ballads pour all your speed into the rapid game for happy he who tops the wheeling chase has every maze evolved and every guile disclosed he had to search his memory hard for the rest repeating the last line two or three times so that more than once johnson glanced his way who knows the merits of the pack who saw the villain seized and dying hard without complaint though by a hundred mouths relentless torn o glorious he beyond his daring peers is tha all right capn ervey sir asked johnson in the nearest thing to a whisper he could manage yes hervey assured him never better all saints church clock struck the halfhour as they trotted through clipstone the village was ill lit and the street empty but dogs began barking and soon there were faces at the windows and braver ones at doors five minutes called lieutenant seton canning some time later in the northernmost covert men began stowing canteens and tightening girths soon the other subdivisions would be doing the same taking the time by the flickering light of a candle what a todo it had been to find enough watches the road party sped on up a long incline to where an old beacon tower kept lonely sentinel the driver checking his team at the top for a steady descent mount seton cannings order was hushed but clear and eight dragoons their corporal and lieutenant put left foot into stirrup pushed up with the right and swung into the saddle they formed twos on the track at the edge of the covert and in a few minutes were trotting across the worksop road and onto the green bridleway for cuckney there was no clock to strike the threequarterhour for hervey and his men for they were in the middle of the broad oaks which had built the nations wooden walls there was nothing but the odd foresters hut between here and cuckney not a light to tell the time by either but the pace had been steady and even he knew they could be neither late nor early by more than a very few minutes in another mile or so when they reached the old ford on the meden he would close up and read his hunter by the carriage lights cuckney church had no carillon but seton canning was confident of his timing as he led his mare the last furlong before deploying in their cordon position the other three subdivisions doing the same thing on the further points of the compass the horses were quiet to seton cannings and all the corporals relief it was going well the longcase clock in the parlour of the grange struck the hour henrietta glanced up nine oclock was that not the time when she turned back to her novel trying to remember what she had just read and still she felt sick a pheasant started noisily from under corporal cooks feet its alarm call sounding loud enough to carry to nottingham his subdivision froze they remained stockstill for a full five minutes until a vixens bark nearby gave them their alibi the road party was late by a mere four minutes at the ford and these they made up easily on the straight incline to warsop hill next where hervey halted the party at twelve minutes past nine were at the rallying point sir francis he said you can see our object quite clearly yonder there were only one or two lights a quarter of a mile distant but they stood out distinctly on the open heath about the crossroads ill leave cornet st oswald and hell come at the signal very well captain hervey do you recognize it if i say bestir yourself and then call on the gods he held out his hand hervey took it and smiled i do indeed sir and thank you for it with your leave then he saluted took off his shako reined about and kicked on a minute later the chaise rolled up to the hamlet at a steady trot the driver expecting a signal to halt at any second it came just short of the old turnpike lodge a lantern swinging in the middle of the road whats yer business the challenge was in the rough accent of the county master cutler on is way back to sheffield the sentry held up his lantern and moved towards the nearside door serjeant armstrong had already slipped from the offside one show yerself please master cutler called the sentry armstrong sprang on him from behind his forearm was round the mans throat in an instant stifling any sound not a word lad or youll feel my sabre in your side private scriven was out too a regular pocket atlas they bound the man up tight with horse bandages pistol to is ead scriven rasped armstrong wait on mr oswalds men to take him off he leapt back inside as the wheels began to turn well done geordie armstrong said hervey to himself he would tell caithlin of it with the greatest satisfaction they slowed to a walk to turn into the crows nest yard who goes there came another challenge this time from the shadows and no lamp master cutler homebound weve a lame wheeler have you a livery no liveries we pay handsomely called hervey from behind seeing a window open partially in the loft and then close again why dont you put tother oss on then because hes shy of the traces the inquisitor stepped from the shadows the master cutler dye say i saw im meself only a fortnight back at tgoose fair he put his hand to the door armstrong had it open before he could turn the handle driving his fist in the mans face with all his strength there was a muffled cry which had hervey turning for the loft with his pistol but no window opened come on then hervey called jumping from the saddle and ramming his shako back on his head out from the chaise sprang armstrong five dragoons and wilks all now with shakos on including the bow street man for that was the surest way of recognition in the halflight and god forbid the smoke up the outside steps they went wilks porting the sledgehammer a footboard broke under herveys boot whos there came from inside enoch boomed wilks and swung the hammer with all his force the door jumped from its hinges in they burst bedlam shots swords clubs fists smoke screams oaths pleas on the road st oswald the general and a dozen dragoons spurred to a gallop and on the heath the cordon began walking in sabres drawn pistols ready reins crooked on the arm remember no shooting without challenging first bellowed seton canning and outside the cordon only outside only a minute later st oswalds party was at the inn seizing luddites as they fled the yard in terror and then running up the steps to the fight in the loft but it was all over there were half a dozen men on the floor bleeding in varying degrees one of them corporal troughton who had covered hervey well but painfully corporal perrot was already binding up his shoulder hed live as would four of the luddites for the time being at least another was stone dead and four more were holding their hands so high they were touching the beams right you bastards lets have you all in the yard growled armstrong when they were gone bartle climbed down from the eaves he dusted off his shoulders then held up his pocketbook i have it all sir hervey sighed with no little relief youll both be very glad to get back to london im sure wilks blew out the residue from his pistol pan sir i cant tell you how fine it was to smell powder smoke once again chapter seventeen to the victor mansfield midnovember three weeks passed in which there was not only a cessation of luddite violence in the shire but also a remarkable disinclination for the ageold activities of the night such as poaching and housebreaking for the belief throughout the county was that the authorities now had the ear to all unlawful activity the magistrates and solid citizens of the borough were fulsome in their praise of herveys troop for the affair of the crows nest and sent them at once a quantity of beer and ham the nottingham mercury was no less appreciative and lauded the regiment in several editions we may safely say it proclaimed with lofty certainty that there can not be a regiment in the service more efficient nor more just in its doings than his majestys sixth light dragoons lieutenantcolonel the earl of towcester has demonstrated himself to be an officer of very singular abilities the report was taken up by the times too so that lord towcester became in the space of only two months a name on the lips of london tattlers and some said in whitehall itself ezra barrow even made a wager with his subalterns that his lordship would be promoted major general within the year hervey half hoped that it would be so for they would then be rid of a commanding officer in whom there was not the slightest confidence outside the pages of the newspapers and with others equally illinformed and yet he could scarcely wish the man to be placed in a position where there would be greater opportunity for him to make mischief in truth he wished that sir francis evans would exercise some influence at the horse guards and hasten lord towcesters advance to the halfpay list predictably lord towcester had raged when he had heard of the business at the crows nest and had only been pacified when he learned of sir francis evanss hand in matters although as the earl told hervey pointedly it was he who would make a report on his fitness for promotion not the goc a few days after the timess report hervey was summoned to nottingham to hear the results of the inquiry by the excise commissioners into the events surrounding the french landing which in broad terms exonerated him from all blame but he was dismayed to learn later that the document had been with the lieutenant colonel for over a month throughout this time however it was henrietta who gave hervey most cause for anxiety in herself she appeared well but the news of princess charlottes condition which came by one means or another almost daily from london once by letter in the princesss own hand had put her in low spirits on the third of november she had received word that the queen herself had expressed anxiety for the birth of the royal infant was then a fortnight overdue and there was yet no sign dr croft was steadfastly refusing any intervention and the princess was becoming hourly more melancholy then on the seventh there was intelligence that princess charlotte was at last in labour henriettas spirits rallied but on the tenth came the terrible news that charlotte and her child were dead hervey spent a despondent breakfast with henrietta that morning he had the greatest difficulty condoling with her to any appreciable effect for a part of her sorrow was at the loss of an association which though by no means ever close was none the less true yet he also knew that there was an element of foreboding in her sorrow and this he felt wholly powerless to ease but he had to leave her temporarily nevertheless since sir abraham cole had sent him a note the evening before saying that there was business of which he would speak and in seclusion and that he would come with his chaise at ten the melancholy news from london was dampening sir abrahams spirits too as he and hervey set off towards welbeck next morning sir abraham was of the decided opinion that it boded ill for the peace of the country for with no infant heir to the throne on which the populace might dote there was all too much opportunity for the whigs and even republicans to exploit the ample shortcomings of the prince regent he was sure that there would be trouble when it came to a coronation the princess caroline was not going to be excluded easily and might well become a figurehead for forces opposed to the regent hervey questioned whether the princess would take such a course but sir abraham pronounced himself sure that she lacked the sense to realize let alone resist such exploitation hervey felt some need to speak for his erstwhile royal colonel but then thought better for her reputation was now such that any reasonable man could not but share sir abrahams opinion albeit with the greatest sadness sir abraham said he was pleased beyond measure that the luddite troubles seemed abated finished even for throughout the north and midlands the forces of the law were making inroads on the secretive organization but he was unhappily of a mind that luddite violence would soon be replaced by reform violence perhaps a more damaging thing than the sledgehammers of the machinebreakers for its objective was less material than political the day was sunny a fine autumn morning for all that the news and prospects were grim after a little way further they stopped to drop the barouches halfhood to continue with the senses open fully to the sights the sounds and the scents of the season in this said sir abraham proudly the finest of the shires in another half an hour they turned through the gates of manvers priory a house about the same size as sir abrahams own but with a larger park and a small lake within its grounds hervey had seen it before only at a distance for it had neither suffered attack nor threat of it its occupant being an elderly dowager of the dukeries he was intrigued therefore as they pulled up to the front and sir abraham bid him step down the house bore signs that the occupant was not at home however the windows were shuttered the chimneys idle and there was no footman to attend them lady anne died three weeks ago im sorry to say sir abraham told him she was a good sort knew her neighbours and village folk alike its a fair prospect the lake especially do i suppose that you bring me here because you intend taking the lease since hervey had never met lady anne there seemed no reason to express any particular regret at her passing sir abraham smiled youre ever sharp captain hervey yes i had a mind to negotiate for the lease then youll not rebuild clipstone i thought that surveyors were already at work oh yes indeed i shall rebuild clipstone then why should you want the lease on this house sir abraham smiled again took a flask from the door pocket and offered it him captain hervey command of the sherwood yeomanry falls vacant soon the bench and the association are of one mind that you should have it and with command shall go the lease of manvers priory hervey had never been more astounded than by this proposition not even by the appointment to the dukes staff nor the brevet and its promise of regimental promotion he could scarcely make a sound even of astonishment and captain hervey how may i put this you would be handsomely remunerated sir abraham i and there are other inducements indeed the living of manvers parva is vacant a very presentable one im told and the tenant of manvers priory has the advowson there are one or two pretty cottages with the estate too sir abraham i confess i am exceedingly flattered more than i can express but i cannot think entirely clearly of course captain hervey of course said sir abraham this is scarcely a matter on which i would expect a decision from the saddle so to speak a week shall we say hervey took his leave of sir abraham some distance from the grange deciding that a walk might give him opportunity to assemble his thoughts and objections before sharing them with henrietta although the new appointment carried the rank of lieutenant colonel it would hold no seniority within the army as a whole he would have to sell out from the sixth of course but perhaps if he went on halfpay instead he could rejoin the colours later as major possibly or if his seniority and means allowed it as lieutenant colonel although that rank would require a prodigious sum of money but sir abraham had hinted that the yeomanry command would not leave him impecunious quite the opposite indeed although the upkeep of manvers priory and the social obligations of a commanding officer of yeomanry would also make their demands then again what prospects did he truly have with the sixth he stood on the wrong side of his commanding officer and that would be enough to blight any hope of advancement yet how might he like leaving the regiment perhaps for good and those who had come to look upon him as more than just an officer in the army people came and went all the time nothing was permanent and that he supposed was one of the strengths of the system as well as one of its weaknesses he neednt leave everyone behind though he could make armstrong serjeantmajor and let him have one of the pretty cottages for his family collins could be promoted serjeant and johnson corporal he might even be able to make mr lincoln quartermaster there was much more to this advancement than just his own fortunes hervey thought of his father was this not the very solution to his problems with the archdeacon why should not the reverend thomas hervey become rector of manvers parva and find his ease in its extensive glebe and two thousand a year elizabeth would be content as the countryside was pleasant and there seemed rather more opportunity here of her moving in county circles even mrs strange could have employment in the parish school henrietta too would have a house in which she might truly feel at home not the mean little places they would otherwise have to take seeing her that night asleep at the white hart in nottingham he had come to realize how unkind was his transplanting of her from the elegance of longleat to the soldiers camp at manvers priory she would enjoy the company of her equals in the county and indeed in the neighbouring ones for driving was a good deal easier than in wiltshire she and elizabeth could see each other often again above all she and he would see each other every day they need hardly spend an evening let alone a night but in each others company and here she could bear their children in comfort and safety and raise them healthily if ever a death had been more instructive than the princess charlottes and her childs he did not know of it as hervey walked into the grange yard his mind was made up and his opinion was strengthened in respect of his reasoning at least by the report which greeted him hervey thunderously good news beamed seton canning rushing over from the picket post those rumours these past weeks well were to see america after all hervey appeared perplexed the regiment is being sent to canada with two others infantry theres a great todo about warship building on the lakes were wanted to make a show on the border private johnson brought coffee into a sitting room at the grange where hervey and henrietta were in earnest conversation thank you johnson that will be all i shall not be at watering parade ask mr seton canning to carry on if you will right sir johnson picked up his captains cloak and shako and left without another word no matthew said henrietta when the door was closed hervey was astonished it had not crossed his mind for one second that she might have any objection whatever but why my love everything about this offer is so singularly attractive no it is not not everything he was now thoroughly perplexed you have not seen the house i grant you but it is not the house matthew then what is it she sighed you speak of serjeant armstrong why should he be happy to take his ease in a cottage in manvers parva it would be like taking a foxhound from last years entry and putting a collar on it and corporal collins too do you think he is so hungry for a serjeants chevron that he would wish to join a regiment of catshooters as you call them henriettas forthrightness took him aback as well as her evident grasp of military cant she had rallied bravely from the mornings news that much was clear and what about you matthew how should you like it do you mean to tell me that the prospect of trotting about nottinghamshire for the next twenty years shall please you my darling it is not i whom i think of there is the happiness of he looked at the swelling at her skirts slight though it still was she took his hand matthew dearest if you are not happy then i can never be and if you care to think on that you cannot but see that this business with the yeomanry would be a very sad affair indeed but the orders for canada matthew your troop has been abuzz with life since the news came i have no doubt that you yourself are eager for it too she smiled so warmly that he could not help but concede her point though with an embarrassed sort of grin but the consequences my love they scarcely bear thinking about what consequences matthew that you and i shall be parted and at the very worst of times henriettas smile returned accompanied by the familiar disarming little shake of the head oh no my love we shall not be parted for i have every mind to see canada myself part three the affair at niagara treaty of peace and amity between his britannic majesty and the united states of

day of december one thousand eight hundred and fourteen gambier henry goulburn william adams john quincy adams j a bayard h clay jon russell albert gallatin chapter eighteen reunions york upper canada th january my dear father you will have received by now i trust the brief note of our safe arrival in quebec one week past and i pray that this letter too shall find you and mama and elizabeth in good health i can only add that i pray also for your peace and tranquillity in respect of the disagreements with the diocese and i await news of the proceedings of the consistory court with confidence that justice shall in the end be done of our own situation i am pleased to send you every good report and more fully than i was able in my last the regiment less one troop to form a depot at hounslow left liverpool on the th of november with all its horses and so well fitted were the transports that we lost naught but half a dozen during the voyage this was also occasioned by calm seas throughout yet a very favourable wind which made for a faster crossing than sometimes is made so that we entered the st lawrence river on the nd of january and proceeded under tow by steam barge which i had never seen before for as far as the rapids above montreal there we were disembarked and two troops under the major proceeded to that city where they are to reinforce the garrison the remaining three troops were transferred to lake ontario and so to here at the western part i shall not describe the difficulties we had on account of the severe cold though it is said that the winter this year is much less severe than usual but the men and horses bore it unexpectedly well perhaps because the air though cold is very dry and there has been little wind above all henrietta has suffered it without distress or complaint we had good quarters on the ship which brought us and the two dozen wives who accompany the regiment are treated with every consideration by the agents for much of the transfer to lake ontario the ladies were taken by sledge and covered with furs they had a very pleasant ride of it indeed at first i thought that henrietta might remain in montreal for her confinement but there being still two months and she feeling in hale condition she has accompanied me here york is the most unlikely capital you ever saw there are scarce a thousand inhabitants not counting military it was burned by the americans five years ago and there is much bitterness still at it but it grows almost by the day even in the depths of winter what is so very pleasing though is that the lieutenant governor here in upper canada i mean is sir peregrine maitland who commanded the guards at waterloo he is the finest of men and his wife is lady sarah lennox an acquaintance of henriettas and his aidedecamp of but two months is charles addinsel whose reacquaintance from peninsular days i never felt more pleased to make he was a good friend of darcey jessopes of whom you heard me speak much so neither henrietta nor i shall be wanting in engaging company it seems no matter how hard a winter it goes as to the military purpose for which we were hastened here i feel that i may say this without prejudice to safety it would appear that the alarm is past and we may find ourselves altogether more agreeably employed than was supposed hervey put down his pen and read over the letter what his father would make of the vivid ink he did not know perhaps he should have explained that his own had frozen solid on the last leg of the journey broken the glass of the bottle and then when the baggage had been brought inside thawed into his unexpectedly absorbent pelisse coat private johnson said he could remove the ink without too much trouble but hervey doubted it and thought he would have to reconcile himself to writing off a second coat in ten years hed see a paupers grave yet he sighed he looked again at the last paragraph it was not untrue he need not concern himself there but it was so far from the whole truth that he worried it was more than he habitually allowed under the general principle of not alarming his family which had always made his letters from the peninsula read as if he had been little more than a spectator of course there was no present danger of renewed fighting that much was clear to him in quebec this man bagot whom lord liverpool had sent to settle the question of warships on the great lakes was by all accounts not a man to misjudge things it seemed that he had drawn the sting that remained of the late war with a new protocol hervey was looking forward to meeting him at dinner at the lieutenantgovernors that evening but the evening would not of course be unalloyed pleasure for there would also be the brooding presence of lord towcester what a joy the last two months had been separated most of the time by a mile or more of ocean in their respective transports however any hope that the sea air had improved his lordships disposition in essentials was dashed in quebec where he had stomped about the governorgenerals apartments in petulant rage his desire for easy glory thwarted by the tidings of peace there hervey had wondered yet again if he should have accepted sir abrahams handsome offer in truth he had wondered long about it during the atlantic passage but so pleasant was the cruise that the offer had faded greatly in its temptation by the time they reached canada but all of towcesters baseness had been laid bare again since their landfall at least to herveys eyes and he could scarcely hope to avoid any more trials of loyalty and try as he might to see this country favourably and there was much in its raw beauty that appealed hervey could not detach his feelings from those he supposed henrietta must have how in heavens name might she be happy in this frontier of nature he would love her with all the intensity a man could but was that in the spirits sense enough to keep the cold from her oh how he might look back now on the happy unhurried intimacy of the crossing and wish he had secured that state for ever at manvers priory was his soldiery so essential a part of that happiness henrietta had thought it so yes but had he himself truly contemplated it contemplated it thoroughly he smiled again as the crossing came back to mind the dinner at christmas with all the officers squeezed around the mess table henrietta full of laughter and then the capering with the other ranks that evening she had seemed to enjoy both so much that had been his second christmas at sea in three and never one at home since shrewsbury was this really to be his life for ever not for ever of course for even an officer of his age must know of his natural mortality but was it to be the pattern for all of the life he so wanted for them both how difficult he found it how difficult when you loved someone both as viscerally and cerebrally as he did and when that love was soon to bear its first fruit the trouble was and he knew not just in his heart of hearts there was no appeasing a man like towcester the boil as it were was forced to come to some ghastly head where the lance was all that was left but might a running sore thereby follow he could not be certain of success with the blade yes the boil would come to a head and he would surely have to take the lance to it the last thing he could afford however was for that to occur too soon while henrietta still carried their child for he knew full well that her mind was prey enough still to the doubts born of princess carolines sad confinement he was no free agent even in military matters now that he had taken a wife you are sure this evening will not fatigue you not excessively replied henrietta really this baby is being so very good to me truly it was there was a colour about her face always as if she were the girl again it stirred him as much as had her blushes in those first novel days of intimacy after their marriage her eyes seemed just that bit brighter too her voice that much richer her hair was a silky gloss the stallions coat where before it might have been the geldings the fact of there being a baby too was almost imperceptible beneath her highbodiced dress though the swelling beneath the bodice must betoken it to anyone who knew her usual figure hervey put the fur cloak about her fastened the front and then put on his own cloak very well then let us to the maitlands the distance to the lieutenantgovernors residence was nothing but a few furlongs but the cold and the snow made even this a trial on foot so they were taking a carriage heated by a warmingpan the scene was not unlike horningsham when every few years or so the village was besieged by a hard winter or rather by a month of hard winter instead of the three or even four which came every year here snow lay deep over gardens and pasture and high along the sides of houses except for the trenchlike path cleared to door or stable the houses as in horningsham were too scattered to be of any support to each other there was no network of clearance therefore and the notion of community outside the walls of the fort itself seemed smothered by this great white blanket but community there was thanks largely to the efforts of the garrison who tirelessly cleared the snow from the main thoroughfares after each fall making them passable to sled and wheel alike but unlike horningsham there were oil lamps along the streets and these were now lighting herveys and henriettas way to the maitlands as well as might a full moon of a wiltshire summer the snow magnified the power of the little lamps which in their homely flickers made the bitter outdoors seem so much less forbidding and the two were received in only a very few minutes later at government house not greatly chilled henrietta had taken tea that very day with lady sarah maitland and so their conversation was resumed on the same terms of only a few hours before hervey had seen captain addinsel for a little while on their first evening two days ago but they had yet to have any real opportunity for discourse first though he paid his respects to general maitland who chatted agreeably after their introduction their exchanges were brief however in consequence of the arrival of lord towcester followed at once by the minister from the embassy in washington charles bagot and his wife this gave addinsel the opportunity to take hervey aside to meet the other dinner guests one of whom he found immediately engaging as acting superintendent of the upper canada division major barry lawrence wore the green facings collar cuffs and lapels of the indian department of british north america he was a man of about herveys build in his middle thirties with a skin the colour of newtanned leather and when he learned that hervey was only lately returned from india he began an interrogation designed to acquaint himself with any similarities in the native methods of organization and fighting however hervey was eventually able to persuade him to volunteer details of the north american indian being he argued a rather more pertinent subject to time and place the superintendent was able to say only a little though before dinner was announced leaving hervey obviously disappointed come to the department tomorrow at ten say and we can resume said lawrence as they proceeded to the dining room im pleased you take an interest for it is the most important business to be settled now that we have an agreement on naval matters they were fourteen at dinner but the table was not large and there was an intimacy to proceedings despite the formality of the seating arrangements as a privy councillor mr charles bagot envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the united states of america came before an earl in precedence and so was seated on sir peregrine maitlands right with lady mary bagot on his left across the table from her husband sat lady sarah maitland with lord towcester on her right henrietta was to the ministers right and hervey almost opposite for the first courses hervey chatted with charles addinsel who sat adjacent at the end of the table and then to the widow of a commanding officer of the new brunswick fencibles who had remained in york when her late husbands regiment had returned east from time to time he stole a glance at henrietta once she caught his look and held it several seconds reddening about the neck in the way she did when they embraced her eyes promised him they would embrace again that evening for henriettas ardour was in no degree diminished by her condition indeed if anything it seemed intensified and he himself was no less invigorated by it for all the little blooms of fecundity the swellings and ripeness roused every instinct to be one with her by the time the sweet dishes were served the conversation had become enlarged or rather the talk at the centre of the table was being listened to attentively by the guests at the ends lady sarah maitland leaned forward turning towards hervey and smiling very prettily said she understood that he too had been at the battle of waterloo and i wonder did you see anything of my husbands guardsmen the table fell silent lady sarah was the same age as henrietta and some fifteen years or so her husbands junior her enquiry was of a childlike innocence and pride and not one which even modesty might resist i did indeed maam was the best hervey could manage however sir peregrine who had hitherto borne a somewhat distant patrician look now softened even seeming to smile at the remembrance did you observe when the duke bid them stand up asked lady sarah yes maam we were not so very far on their left at that moment then tell me how it appeared for i have heard several accounts she pressed well maam it was towards the end of the day as you will recall and bonaparte had become desperate and sent his imperial guards at our centre they marched towards where there was a gap in our line of infantry with only a brigade of light cavalry seeming to stand between them and brussels and just as it seemed they would be able to take the ridge and drive on to that city up stood a whole brigade of guardsmen which i swear i had not even seen until that moment so perfectly still had they remained in the corn it was an unusual drill movement sir peregrine acknowledged and then they swept the french back down the hill prompted lady sarah indeed maam it was the end the duke of wellington gave the order for the whole line to advance lady sarah smiled adoringly at her husband there was some very apt musketry from others at that moment we should not forget said sir peregrine the sixth had a good gallop at the french hill too as i remember hervey yes sir who was commanding at that stage lord george irvine was with the prince of orange was he not yes he was sir i am afraid our major was killed and all our captains accounted for the command had devolved upon me in the closing minutes henrietta now bore the same look of admiration as the generals wife but she had also seen the look on lord towcesters face distaste an intense envy indeed and captain hervey must have performed those duties very well said lady mary bagot to sir peregrine though in a voice to be heard by the table as a whole because he was afterwards made aidedecamp to my uncle this further revelation made hervey redden he had no idea of lady mary bagots kinship with the duke henrietta glanced at lord towcester again his envy was so intense as to appear quite alarming to her i confess to feeling humbled by the presence of two waterloo men declared lady marys husband hervey was amazed that a minister with plenipotentiary powers should express himself humbled in any way by a soldier but he thought his sentiment genuine nevertheless sir peregrine was equally selfdeprecating oh now for my part at least i would own that it was sheer circumstance and infinitely to be preferred to the fighting that pakenhams army had in the mississippi at the time well let us pray there is no recrudescence on either front conceded bagot lady sarah maitland made to rise her chair eased by a footman not too long my dear she said fixing her husband with a smile that none might resist there can surely be little to detain you now that there is so universal a peace the men stood as she led the ladies to the drawing room when they were gone the junior guests closed to the middle of the table and the port was passed lord towcester lit a cigar and what is your opinion of recrudescence here bagot do the americans covet his majestys provinces still the tone was the merest shade lofty but enough to register with the minister plenipotentiary well lord towcester covet would imply to me that the united states laid claim to canada and would not be at rest until that claim is granted began bagot i do not see it thus though if it were possible to seize the provinces with impunity i should not doubt that the temptation would be too great he lit a cigar too blowing smoke confidently towards the ceiling but the time is past they failed to take advantage of our distraction by bonaparte and they know they have not the strength to take on our fleet and army now i have just finished negotiating the neutrality of the great lakes indeed they have given up any right of a naval presence on them save a few vessels to protect their legitimate interests in return for the same yet we could reinforce the lakes at any time from the atlantic with sufficient determination and the st lawrence a firstrate is laid up in ordinary recommissioned she would still outgun anything the americans could put on lake ontario for at least a year i heard they had something to meet her with in the new orleans said lord towcester bagot took another leisurely draw on his cigar a hundred and ten guns to seventyfour not i think good odds and in any case the new orleans is still on the stocks lord towcester frowned and so you believe that the border may now be left unguarded i did not say that lord towcester replied bagot frowning equally i believe though that it permits a strategy over a long term of disengaging from a forward defence of the frontiers the united states has anyway other priorities it is the south and west which more naturally engages the people seeking new land and in doing so they run into the native indians and the spanish that will absorb the energies of government these next twenty years sir peregrine maitland refilled his glass and passed the port to the superintendent of the indian department how say you lawrence barry lawrence took the decanter and poured himself a glass raising his eyebrows as if to say he was touching on something unfathomable well sir peregrine i believe the americans are about to begin a struggle that will take a generation and more to end lord towcester looked incredulous do you mean to say that an assortment of savages will trouble an army which inflicted so much pain on our own im afraid i do your lordship lord towcester huffed and i very much fear that we in canada may not escape the consequences have you heard of the affair at niagara sir peregrine was apparently none too keen to have it related let us adjourn gentlemen these are weighty matters for an evening such as this and major lawrence shall anyway have every opportunity these winter months to tell you of his concerns by now hervey had formed a very agreeable opinion indeed of the superintendent who was quite evidently a forthright man with a passion for his subject indeed lawrence put him in mind of the collector of guntoor and he wondered at the ability of the nation to produce men of aptness such as they able so to immerse themselves in a society alien in every way with danger and reward in wholly unequal proportions shall you tell me of this affair tomorrow when we meet he whispered as they left the room the superintendent looked at him and raised an eyebrow do you have a strong stomach major lawrences office was like no other hervey had seen whereas the collector of guntoors had the appearance of a donnish study the superintendent of the indian departments was both museum of curiosities and military headquarters one long wall was covered in shields and arrows and in glasstopped cases there were silver bracelets amber necklaces and other finely worked pieces on the wall behind his desk were feathered headdresses pinned flat but on the other long wall were perhaps twenty maps rolled and tied and on the table beneath magnifying glasses compasses rulers and measuring sticks coffee asked the superintendent taking an enamel pot from the top of the stove i thank you yes said hervey looking about the walls its not just decorative either every feather has its meaning and do you know of it most yes and my field officers know what i do not a lot of it is bygone stuff even to the indians though theyve been expert shots with musket and rifle for many years now ill tell you of the more extraordinary pieces another time perhaps i thought we might speak of your duties here your troop is to have the niagara frontier is it not hervey confirmed that it was so although he had yet to have precise orders general rolt the general officer commanding in upper canada was still in quebec meeting with the commanderinchief and lord towcester has instructions not to embark on anything until his return lawrence nodded though if i were you i should want to have a look at the river itself soon its the only place the americans made any real showing in the war oh they landed here in york and knocked the place about a good deal but they didnt reinforce the landing it was a halfhearted affair the point about the niagara river frontier is that its a mere furlong and a bit across at its narrowest point have you studied the map yet no admitted hervey weve yet to see one of the frontier all i have is a very general one melishs seat of war which i was able to buy in but an hour in quebec a good start though it ought to give you a feeling for the size of the country he pulled at one of the ribbons on his map wall and down dropped an enlargement of the melish print with coloured hatchings and additions in his own hand ive marked the general areas in which are the predominant tribes or nations of indians he indicated these with a feathered arrow the indians you will see west of york towards the niagara frontier are those of the six nations i admire them a great deal theirs is a confederacy thats endured for three hundred and fifty years whats the basis of their confederation hervey drew his chair up closer to the map the language family they are able to make themselves understood to each other readily enough you have heard of hiawatha hervey had not or else i forget no matter in the middle of the sixteenth century as tradition has it hiawatha united five of the nations which lived in these northern parts the cayugas mohawks oneidas onondagas and senecas he pointed to north and south of lake ontario the iroquois they are usually known as and later they admitted the tuscarora tribe of the same family so to speak the original league was called the great peace but it was only a peace among the iroquois themselves to other nations they were immensely warlike the huron the erie and others they had all but been destroyed by the seventeenhundreds and the iroquois spread west to the illinois river how did they stand with regard to us asked hervey making notes that is of the essence in the middle of the last century we encouraged them to raid the french settlements and they were a not insignificant factor in the final defeat of montcalm when it came to the revolution in america however the league split the oneida and part of the tuscarora supported the colonists the rest threw in with us the mohawks fought especially hard when the war was finished the loyal tribes were given land about these parts chiefly on the grand river here at the junction of upper and lower canada the others were treated ill duped by the americans into selling their land or given poorer country in exchange further west and so in the late war i presume our indians remained loyal indeed and not only in the sense of not taking up arms against us but of actually fighting for us the americans had continued to deal so ill with their indians that we had capital support from tribes within the republic too the socalled backwoodsmen there murdered a great number of the shawanese tribe and stole their land the shawanese had a very fine leader tecumseh you have heard of him perhaps again hervey had not oh a great man a very great man i do not think i ever met his equal even in a red coat he led the best light infantry you would ever see shall i meet him major lawrence smiled he lacked christian baptism so it is unlikely ah and was he killed in battle the major sighed theres the rub with the indians for tecumseh was killed fighting when those in red coats alongside him had taken to their heels the same happened here at york and worse at niagara this is the affair you spoke of last night yes and it exercises me a great deal at present for the scalplock of the chief who was killed at niagara at least the indians believe it to be his was made a spectacle of only lately at buffalo hervey peered at the map here across the river on lake erie in the united states that is how did it happen our general riall had taken a force with several hundred indians of the mississauga tribe across the river and captured fort niagara and he was making his way to buffalo when the americans counterattacked strongly for some reason hed conceived a mistrust of his indians perhaps because earlier theyd received emissaries from the nations fighting with the americans and when they promised they would stand he wouldnt believe them and gave way so that the weight of attack was unevenly borne by them and this scalplock was taken by the american indians it were better that it had been so but the mississaugas believe that one of the kentucky riflemen took it with his teeth hervey looked startled lawrence smiled the indians are commonly referred to as savages but to my knowledge they would only ever use a knife hervey smiled with him that is indeed a comfort to know well then enough of these parlour stories for the time being i have to say though the kentucky men had their reasons for theyd suffered many an outrage at home though whose score on that account was the greatest is open to question but i will own that the affair of the scalplock at niagara is exercising me the mississaugas are not of the old confederacy but if theyre unhappy with us then they might infect the six nations with their discontent hervey made more notes lawrence refilled both coffee cups and took up his pointer again let us leave indian affairs for the time being let us return to geography the niagara river it is important you know its features chapter nineteen time spent in reconnaissance fort york a week later hervey found the first week of their garrison uncommonly hard though the barracks in fort york were wellfound they had been rebuilt only four years earlier having been twice burned the cold outdoors went ill with both officers and dragoons and parades were few the horse lines were improvised but ample with bracken for bedding and good hay in fair quantities and troop horse and charger alike had coats as thick as hervey could remember since corunna after a few days voyageurs of the hudsons bay company arrived with the regiments winter clothing infantry greatcoats of grey kersey and the beef boots and fur caps which had been authorized for dismounted dress instead of the cloaks hussar boots and shakos which scarcely kept even an active man warm a brisk trade was done in extra fur too henrietta had remained indoors for the most part lady sarah maitland had begged her to come and lodge at government house but she had steadfastly insisted on remaining with her husband in their cramped quarters in the fort though after only a few days through the generosity of the lieutenantgovernors lady they were furnished very comfortably so comfortably in fact that with their travelling service she was able to give two small dinner parties and to receive sarah maitland daily in the morning or afternoon appropriately and sometimes both even ruth henriettas ladys maid complained only once in that time when private johnson had left unguarded a pan of linseed on the kitchen range and it had boiled over and run down the side and onto a pair of her mistresss shoes which stood there drying more than once hervey had watched his wife as she read or wrote or busied herself with some little detail of their domestic arrangements and marvelled at her choosing to forgo the comfort of manvers priory for this had she known how difficult it would be would she now change her mind if it were possible never had he seen her look more contented though it humbled him indeed and he envied her the apparent contentment for although he had accepted the inevitable cure of the lance in respect of lord towcester to puncture the impostor and express all the malice he had reached no conclusions as to when or how in truth though his mind told him the lance was inevitable his every instinct recoiled from it still a few days after the voyageurs had come and with general rolt still in quebec sir peregrine maitland suggested to lord towcester that a reconnaissance along the niagara frontier might be made to advantage for i think it would be no bad thing to trail your red cloaks along the border and give something for the americans across the river to observe lord towcester agreed at once it was unlikely of itself to secure him the bath ribbon which every waterloo colonel was wearing but it must be a beginning and with but a single road and guides there could hardly be much opportunity of becoming lost which had always been his anxiety on taking to the field before nevertheless it took three full days of preparation by the adjutant before he felt himself ready to take the lead of the niagara patrol furnished though it was entirely by herveys troop the distance from york to fort george where the niagara river entered lake ontario was eightyfive miles a little over half of it would be done by way of dundas street the military road which ran from the st lawrence river just above montreal through york and on to london on the thames river not far short of the michigan border at burlington bay the westernmost point of lake ontario they would leave the road and take a slower one along the southwest shore of the lake crossing many streams to the fort it was under clement conditions with an overnight rest at the marching camp at burlington a journey of but two days with a further day then to show along the niagara river frontier to fort erie retracing their steps it would be the same again home a sevenday patrol with a days lairage was nothing exceptional by peninsular standards but although no snow had fallen for a week it was colder than when they had arrived herveys principal concern was forage and then their own rations he had seen how fast a troop horse finished its hard feed in conditions like this not quite like this for the astorgias had not been as cold though they had been wet and how a dragoon emptied his mess tin of beef and dumplings in half the usual time he therefore decided on one bathorse for every two troopers i will not have my regiment turned into a commissary train captain hervey lord towcester objected on being told of this to hervey that chafed badly if there were one thing of which he was certain it was the business of maintaining condition of men and horses in the field it couldnt be booklearnt only bought by true experience your lordship i was thinking of unencumbering the troop horses else they will look like i will not be contradicted captain hervey general maitland shall take the salute as the patrol leaves and i intend its looking as crack as anything he ever saw at waterloo do you understand sir hervey did all too well but still there remained the question of feed and rations for the quartermasters art was the one that permitted the least flight of fancy your lordship how therefore do you wish the victuals to be transported lord towcester was in thrusting form if needs be we shall live off the land if the lieutenant colonel had said he expected them to be provisioned on the march by ravens like elijah hervey could hardly have been more shocked his silence was not apparent to lord towcester however who was attending instead to the guest list for the regiments first dinner in ten days time but in towcesters vanity and inexperience hervey saw an opportunity to have his way albeit deviously your lordship might i make a suggestion in order that general maitland should see us at our best lord towcester looked up by all means captain hervey if we send horses on ahead with winter stores and all the feed we should then be able to parade in field dress and cloaks without even a blanket roll on the saddles lord towcester nodded i shall consider it captain hervey ride in cloaks only serjeant armstrong looked astonished that is what i said hervey told him we shall propel ourselves briskly and it will keep the weight down armstrong looked unconvinced the first stage is a good road hervey continued we ought to make the marching camp in eight hours not on this snow we wont i rode out to the picket post this morning and its balling worse than i ever saw we might as well take the shoes off it would be tempting if we knew what the ground would be like at niagara but it might be rocklike well if thats the best you can do sir i fear it is now do i need to remind you that this patrol is your chance to display to the lieutenant colonel armstrong nodded ay the last chance then who shall we place in charge of the bathorses clarkson i reckon hervey thought for a while would you make clarkson next for serjeant in the troop yes but given the choice id have collins clarksons good and hell be a bloody clewedup serjeantmajor in his turn but collins has got the stamp of a lincoln do you think so im not saying i dont agree but thats because collins is the best corporal in the regiment and because he seems every bit a corporal you wonder if he can be a serjeant when hes a serjeant itll be the same ive always reckoned the best ncos and officers strike you whatever rank theyre in i never have understood the idea that someone could be a lousy troop man but a good rsm or colonel more coffee hervey held out his tin cup contemplating armstrongs proposition if there were any other ncos with such an opinion he supposed they would never venture to give it you dont believe that because there are different qualities needed to be a troop man from those of the commissary you could do one well and the other badly i wasnt saying that sir i dont believe every good serjeant would make an rsm or captain a colonel but i do believe it goes the other way round the best horses run well on any going hervey smiled at the imagery in principle i think you may be wrong but i confess that in practice all ive ever seen says youre right i suspect mr lincoln was the finest of corporals you can bet on it i wish hed come back soon we all say amen to that but i grant you clarkson runs collins close sir are you to fill the vacancy then hervey sighed its unfair on clarkson if i manage to get collins back and promote him its unfair too to try an exchange theyre both drawing pay of serjeant as i understand it so i thought id let things run a bit longer to see what turned up armstrong smiled thats what major edmonds would have done first whiff of black powder and all bets are off he always said hervey frowned that doesnt say much for clarksons chances then therell be no black powder here and do you know i shall be glad of it and so should you be fatherhoods not best an absentee state i think bloody ell sir whos been telling you that nobody you mean you thought of it yourself hervey raised his eyebrows sir id be thinking about halfpay if i were you oh i dont know i saw a pretty sort of crib being knocked up yesterday in the serjeants lines armstrong made an unconvincing huffing sound as he left the troop office in the modest but comfortable hervey quarters henrietta was being stoical as was caithlin armstrong in that corner of the barracks that served as the armstrongs quarters this sort of thing the niagara patrol was after all why the sixth had come to the canadas although both wives had perhaps thought that winter quarters would allow them the months of their confinement united with their men the captains lady and molly ogrady said hervey smiling proudly when henrietta declared she was not in the least preoccupied by the prospect of his leaving her she looked at him puzzled he frowned it was easy to forget that it had been less than a year since she had been taken on strength so to speak barrackroom wisdom took rather longer to acquire the captains lady and molly ogrady are sisters beneath the skin its one of the things the men say except they say the colonels lady henrietta did not tell him that a day had not passed without her imagining princess charlottes terrible trial and fate and without wondering why she lady henrietta hervey should expect to be spared when a royal princess attended by the foremost obstetrician of the land had fared no better in her labour than a beast of the field she wondered if she would bear it well when her own trial came the newspapers had made much of the princesss courage of her bearing the agonies with a brunswick heart not for charlotte the laudanums ease did she have a heart as strong as a brunswick she feared not indeed she knew it matthew you will be close when the time comes wont you he knelt by her side and took her hand just at your duty in the fort she explained placing her other hand over his so that if then i should feel i could bear it the better yes he said gently i dont imagine therell be another patrol in months when the time comes i shall remain in my office until you send for me he kissed her forehead and then she kissed his lips matthew if anything were to happen she seemed to be searching for the words but hervey could not help because he was unsure of what exactly was her fear especially as she had said not a word to him about princess charlotte since they had set sail from england if anything should happen to me he saw at once and put an arm around her my dear i was not going to say anything of this but our surgeon told me he would never have allowed the princess to go on as she did had he been in attendance henrietta looked at him perplexed he hesitated he would have delivered the child by section well had he hesitated and better had he said nothing at all he cursed himself as the colour drained from henriettas face like sand from a minuteglass my darling i she gripped his hand hard matthew do you know what you say he had thought he did but now he was not sure no woman survives that matthew but the surgeon is a good man why would he have said that henriettas distress took longer to subside than her husband expected but subside it did and they agreed that there would be no more talk of such things and that they would rest confident in the will of god and the combined wisdom of the several doctors and birth attendants at her disposal at dinner that evening henrietta was as gay as she ever was and later in each others arms she told him she feared nothing as long as he was with her only the next day did he really comprehend the fright he had given her in speaking of a caesarean section for when he confronted the surgeon with henriettas dismay the glasgow veteran of many a field amputation had rounded on him and cursed him for his ignorance telling him it was only in the last decade that his profession had been able to perform a live section successfully and that every woman knew it was but a desperate remedy to save the child only dye know naught about these things man he had demanded and hervey had had to confess that there was indeed a void in his learning when the time came for the patrol to leave henrietta said her goodbyes nobly bidding her husband a happy even carefree farewell she had after all a good reserve of novels she assured him and the frequent company of lady sarah maitland and he in turn was content to believe that her anxiety had been of the moment only exacerbated by his clumsy reassurance and if he had been alarmed to know the truth he would have been proud nevertheless to know how completely she had been taken on strength how completely she now played the role of captains lady though not so much for the sake of the molly ogradys but for the man she considered was her very life from an upstairs window a little later henrietta watched the halftroop parade for the lieutenantgovernor thirtytwo dragoons and four officers the lieutenant colonel adjutant hervey and seton canning ranked past sir peregrine maitland in their red cloaks as the trumpetmajor and four trumpeters blew the general salute red cloaks against the snow confident uncompromising contrast just like hervey himself please god deliver him she prayed passionately clutching her hands together deliver him from evil and from himself outside the gates major lawrence joined them on a hardylooking cob together with two cayuga indians equally sure mounted the three were well wrapped in buckskin fox and beaver their feet especially lawrence stared incredulously at the patrol why in gods name are you not wearing winter warms hervey when the sun goes youll turn to blocks of ice were going to trot in a minute or so replied hervey then youll be warmer while you do lawrence frowned but you cant trot the whole way to burlington and on this snow if you rush it youll have falls four or five inches down theres ice like glass and this fresh stuff will ball up too to tell the truth my intention is to catch up the bathorses youll be sorely pressed to do that they left an hour ago hervey paused just long enough to judge his secret safe with the superintendent i told them they were to mark time at the first fivemile point lawrence smiled that was wise as well as cunning but i promise you youll never make the same mistake of parting from your supply again after an hour of this in cloaks and boots hervey sighed thats what i was hoping he said with a sort of knowing frown why are you come incidentally ive called a meeting of my field officers at fort erie it seemed opportune and the indians are your escorts lawrence smiled indulgently i rather fancied they would do you well as scouts ah yes indeed im very grateful shall i send two dragoons with them i think not theyll be happier left alone he nodded to the indians the cayugas sped off at once to take the far point the iroquois were not known as a horse nation but that was not apparent as they put their ponies into a canter in a very few paces and besides being able to warn early of anything that might hinder the patrols progress they would be excellent guides it seemed for in the dusting of snow as lawrence called it which the dawn had brought their tracks stood out plainly not that taking a false turn on dundas street seemed likely since on either side was a formidable barrier of fir trees only here and there would they find a clearing for a dwelling house or where timber had been cut for a more distant purpose serjeant armstrong had been let in on the bathorse plan only late that morning and he had obligingly continued to pretend he had no idea that hervey was acting other than with an entirely free hand the bathorses tracks looked as fresh as the cayugas for there was no wind to drift the snow and the sun was not strong enough to melt so much as one snowflake on a pine needle but they were not the trailing lines of trotting horses and certainly not the furrows of the cayugas handgallop clarkson was doing his job thank god major lawrence had fallen in beside the lieutenant colonel as the patrol set off but he soon found him too taciturn to persist with and so hervey had his company again before not too long and glad of it he would be too for otherwise dundas street was but cold monotony it was not long before they made the rendezvous with the bathorses however and lord towcesters obvious relief was such that hervey did not even bother with the lines he had rehearsed they had ridden for little more than an hour yet he knew they would soon have had men slipping into winter torpor he had seen it once before in the astorgias it was the easy way they would stop fighting the cold allow the numbness to come and then a sleep they would not emerge from in that hour too they had not seen any living thing of the wild nor even a trace of one there would surely be no more talk of living off the land indeed the lieutenant colonel now seemed content to let hervey have command of the patrol in all its details and did not object when he ordered horses to be led from time to time even though he himself had made his objections to the practice known often enough the rest of the march to fort george was as without incident as the country was without wildlife an owl was heard in the night and some birds briefly at first light but the call of the wolf which the men had hourly expected and keenly so did not come the bivouac at burlington was a hard one and a wolfs call would have been some consolation something of which to write home to thrill the humdrum for little sleep was had by any the campfires had seemed without heat the rum without ability to warm beyond a few minutes resuming the march if not actually a pleasure had been a relief except that everywhere the forest enveloped them the trees so heavy with snow that it seemed as if they were beneath the walls of some great white city for miles there was nothing else to see and the steamy breath of six dozen horses and men gave it an eeriness quite unlike anything hervey had seen before or for that matter armstrong too but fort george welcomed them generously its quartermaster was relieved to have an opportunity to break out the stores for he had laid in provisions for twice the number of troops that would need them now the threat of hostilities seemed certain to be past the patrol ate well on salt pork and buffalo pickled pomme blanche and compote and they slept well in the stoveheated barracks lord towcester was entertained by the forts commandant and retired early leaving hervey to listen to one of major lawrences field officers the condition of the six nations between the erie and the huron is daily more distressing said the lieutenant an officer who had been so long seconded to the indian department that he still referred to his own regiment as the royal americans its the want of game everywhere three of the hunting groups have already broken camp and moved to find other grounds and they havent had to do that in more than a generation why is there so little game asked hervey he understood this winter to be a not especially hard one the winters by no means the harshest replied the lieutenant and thats puzzling the six nations too but theres no doubting the deer and the bear have gone and the beaver above all some of the younger braves are saying its the fault of the white man they know he doesnt rob them or harry them as his cousin below the lakes does but they reckon he upsets the balance of things in the wilderness and do you think that resentment will turn against us hervey was intrigued rather than anxious well said the lieutenant noting that major lawrence too was waiting intently on the reply ive heard talk again of the affair of the niagara scalplock and how it spoke for the way the white man would abandon his indian friends to save his own skin when the time came the braves wonder how long it will be before the white man above and below the lakes makes common cause against them are there other voices said major lawrence relighting his cigar yes the elders are saying that spring will see the return of the deer the bear and the beaver but again the younger braves point out that after the spring and the summer and the autumn there will come another winter they sat late into the small hours talking of what it might come to they left fort george at nine the next morning red cloaks over winter warms it must have been a good display to the american garrison across the river lord towcester seemed content that it was steadfastly refusing even to glance towards fort niagara such was his contempt for the american revolutionaries as he insisted on calling them they made the heights of queenston before eleven they passed above the falls after midday hearing more than they saw of the great cataract though the winter flow was a trickle compared with the spring thaw they took their ease for an hour in chippeway where reports of their progress brought out villagers bearing kettles and pots of boiling water even as they rode up in the afternoon they passed through the rich settlements of the upper niagara and on down to fort erie arriving a little before last light here the evening was much as the one before with another of major lawrences field officers confirming the troubling assessment of the indians condition although he was not inclined to believe that the younger braves blaming the white man would come to much once spring began to show next morning snow was falling as the troop mustered for the return march and there was talk of staying at the fort until it stopped but lord towcester saw no reason why they should not at least set out for between fort erie and chippeway there was shelter enough if the snow became heavier and they could bivouac at any number of places if things came to the worst he had matters pressing in plenty at york hervey was content enough with the condition of the troop after his morning inspection and so they left by the road they had come on at a quarter to ten the cayuga scouts this time taking a much closer point since visibility was reduced major lawrence decided not to return with them however he intended taking the ferry across the river to buffalo to meet with his counterpart there to discover what policy the united states would be adopting towards their indians in the spring rumours of inevitable displacements had already reached him in york from diplomatic sources in montreal and mr bagot himself had thought that the settlers inroads west of the missouri would soon unravel washingtons resettlement policy they made the fifteen miles to chippeway just after midday the snow had stopped falling soon after they set off and they had been able to maintain a brisk trot for a mile or so at a time they made a brief halt at the village where the people showed the same alacrity in hospitality as the day before and the dragoons were again able to eat hot without the trouble of dismounting their own camp kettles lord towcester summoned hervey to his side see here there is no need at all of our spending another night at fort george i consider there to be no purpose in it anyway we can take this road here he indicated the line with a gloved finger rather indistinctly along lundys lane to begin with there was some skirmish of cavalry in the war there so it must be passable to the horse we may then proceed to the road from queenston to burlington that runs atop the ridge instead of skirting the lake it will save us all of eight leagues and a further night hervey was not so sure indeed he felt uneasy if the lieutenant colonel wished to curtail the patrol that was of course his prerogative and he assumed that lord towcester possessed that discretion in sir peregrines orders but the distance by this direct route was even at a rough calculation not much short of fortyfive miles they had at best five hours of daylight left though the moon and snow would make movement at night along a road relatively easy but if the weather were to change again the route could be treacherous and the road through the forest to the burlington ridge looked little better than a track do you think we should ask the indians your lordship confound the indians captain hervey do you even know enough of their language theyll do as theyre damn well told lord towcester was clearly in one of his peremptory moods but hervey felt bound to risk one more objection we might be benighted though sir however well we do in heavens name captain hervey i heard tell at fort george of a woman who went on foot this way during the war and warned our men of an attack youre not telling me youre afraid to take to the woods on a horse if a confounded woman can do it on her feet hervey had heard of mrs secords fearless journey but she had walked from queenston not chippeway and in the middle of summer he thought it useless to point this out to lord towcester however very good your lordship i will tell the scouts he said wondering to himself if he could in fact communicating with the scouts was not as difficult as hervey expected he was able to get them to comprehend his intentions easily enough in a mixture of english and simple sign language the map predictably was of no use to the proceedings they were evidently unhappy with the news for three reasons as far as he could make out first the road was difficult with many ups and downs and streams to cross then they made signs indicating that night would fall on them and finally something about passing through land which the mississauga hunted hervey was only too relieved that they did not turn and walk away when he told them he intended taking the road anyway but it was his first taste of an indians displeasure even in that brief exchange and it was not palatable he called serjeant armstrong aside and made a clean breast of things ill not say anything to mr seton canning but its as well you know my apprehension i dare say all will be well well end up huddled in the forest after midnight when the moon sets but that we can bear and the indians will be used to people riding through if theres a road cut so they cant be all that troubled by our doing so but i want ncos pistols primed all the same no others mind armstrong nodded i was talking to them indians last night theyre worried where all the games going all of them are some of the tribes are starving hervey could only admire his serjeants way with men major lawrences officers have been telling me this as well i suggest we take flints out of weapons too except the ncos i mean if one of them greenheads pistols goes off hervey nodded ay it doesnt bear thinking about in the event the road was better than hervey had imagined but narrow they rode in file rather than threes though and from time to time the files had to merge but the snow hadnt settled so deep as on the road they had left and it didnt ball in the hooves they managed some good trots in the first ten miles the cayugas rode very close point however not once losing sight behind they seemed distinctly less at ease than on the ride out and not a word passed between them the forest impressed its silence on the dragoons too for the most part the only sound was the occasional snort from their plodding troopers or the jingling of a bridoon or the chink of stirrups as the files came too close looking left or right into the forest hervey could not imagine the sound travelling more than a few yards in that mass of fir beech and elm it looked more impenetrable than anything he had seen in india even and all the time there was neither sight nor sound of another living thing on the ground in the trees or overhead the mississaugas came out of the forest like some sudden mechanical change of scenery on a stage there seemed no movement only appearance a dozen or so warriors at the same instant in the same attitude well wrapped in long moosehide coats full hair to the shoulders faces dyed red above the cheekbones they stood rifle in left hand motionless and wholly impassive the cayugas halted froze lord towcester drew his pistol pulling back the hammer with his left hand he lost his grip grabbed as it fell but missed it hit the ground handle first springing the hammer the noise was like a cannon in the silence he spun his horse round threes about threes about he shouted but there was no room for even files to turn he barged at hervey and his trumpeter to make way hervey was so startled he grabbed his arm sir theyve gone theyve gone lord towcester turned in the saddle the mississaugas had disappeared as suddenly as they had come he was dumbstruck we should trot on sir pressed hervey look the scouts are doing the same he seized the lieutenant colonels reins and pulled his horse into motion chapter twenty orders just received fort york two days later the quarter guard turned out as the patrol neared the gates twelve dragoons of the inlying picket brought their carbines to the present and the corporal brought his sabre to the carry the trumpeters blew attention and orderlies stood ready to take the reins of the chargers the earl of towcester acknowledged the respects without halting carry on captain hervey he said barely audibly his right leg already out of the stirrup the lieutenant colonels groom took in hand the big black gelding and without a backward glance or another word lord towcester strode away to his quarters the adjutant a few paces behind him hervey fronted to the patrol the commanding officer would wish me to express his appreciation of your exertions this past week the conditions were trying and your conduct exemplary there shall be a rum issue and standdown of twentyfour hours from watchsetting this evening fall out mr seton canning carry on please serjeant armstrong ill see to stables if you wish hervey said seton canning as they dismounted thank you yes how decent of his lieutenant to guess so much of his mind henrietta would have claimed him anyway in her condition but canning was not to know how keenly hervey wanted to relate to her lord towcesters infamous conduct i shant be long just an hour perhaps as you please hervey theres no need of haste on my account haste or no it did not take hervey long to walk to his quarters even in the two feet of new snow lying about the fort which fatigue parties were already clearing into neat pathways smoke rising from the double chimney of his quarters promised a warm homecoming but the fresh sleigh tracks outside suggested they would not be alone he opened the door expecting to find lady sarah maitland though it was early for calling hopwood what are you doing here private hopwood was carrying a basket of logs to the fire corporal collins sent me to mind the house sir her ladyship was taken to general maitlands this morning she wasnt feeling well sir herveys mouth fell open im sure its nothing serious sir hopwood added quickly indeed did the surgeon say that asked hervey impatiently replacing his shako and turning for the door i didnt see him sir but i know that hes gone to the generals with her it was of course an obliging thing for a dragoon to want to allay his captains anxiety but so wholly uninformed an opinion was not of the least value to him very well i shall go there at once but now he found himself wanting to make amends for his impatience by some display of ease and while i am gone would you be so very good as to draw me a bath as hervey opened the door a sleigh halted outside a youngish woman in a black cloak stepped out captain hervey sir yes i am janette sir lady sarah maitlands maid i am come to fetch some things for your wife things what things the maid looked down awkwardly ladies things sir hervey fancied he knew the contents of their quarters well enough but as with hopwood he could not quite bring himself to disappoint someone so evidently intent on performing a good deed very well do please go inside he nearly said come inside but he had committed himself to stepping out at once for the maitlands thank you sir shall you be going back to government house i have not yet been there i am only this minute returned to the town he was tired the business was beginning to fray and all he could think about was getting to his wife oh the maids manner changed at once what is it why do you say that you dont know her ladyship is in labour sir herveys mouth fell open no no indeed i do not his response alarmed her i think i had better get these things then sir yes yes of course tell me is my wife i trust so sir i was given my orders by her ladyship the generals lady i mean direct it took him a quarter of an hour to walk to government house he walked so fast in the end that he slipped and slid for much of the way he took the salted steps of the lieutenantgovernors residence two at a time and pulled the bell rope ah indeed captain hervey sir replied the footman stepping aside to let him enter the house was silent is her ladyship at home her ladyship is at home sir i will announce you the footman showed him to an anteroom there hervey recovered his breath and something of his composure and tried to clear his mind in order to calculate the date again but it still came out the same theyd talked of the beginning of march surely there were a full six weeks to run what was the danger in so early a labour was there any danger hadnt daniel coates said that a mare carried from forty weeks to more than a year depending on whether she were a big shire or a pony was it the same with humans everyone spoke of nine months but was it more for a bigger woman and fewer for one more delicately made had kitty spence the tiny longleat seamstress carried her little girl as long as annie patten had carried those rough twins of hers sturdy annie the longleat dairymaid who used to pin fast his head in her huge bosom when he was a boy surely she would have needed longer how little he seemed to know why was lady sarah so long in coming why did no one come what was amiss captain hervey forgive me lady sarah maitland was come at last smiling wide and confidently i had to put on another dress allow me to congratulate you on being the father of a most beautiful daughter hervey stood speechless a very beautiful daughter i never saw such eyes and hair and and henrietta oh she is fine fine very well indeed a few minutes more and you shall be able to see her my husbands physician and your regimental surgeon attended throughout but they scarce had a thing to detain them he shook his head in a sort of disbelief and i may tell you she bore it all with a most noble heart dear henrietta oh but i forget some refreshment how was your patrol was it very arduous how is lord towcester he didnt have to answer for henriettas maid entered smiling too your ladyship sir she curtsied to each her ladyship is ready to receive captain hervey now thank you ruth hervey glanced eagerly at sarah maitland come captain hervey she led him to the stairs he had meant to ask how his wife came to be here and to express the thanks due to the maitlands for their unusual hospitality but he found his tongue strangely tied sarah maitland was saying something about his daughter being the first child to be born in york that year or perhaps she said the first girl or here captain hervey i shall leave you she opened one door to a dressing room and motioned to another he tidied his stock in a looking glass checked that all his tunic buttons were fastened then knocked softly on the door to the bedchamber come came a male voice he opened the door gently matthew there was pleasure and pride and relief all together in that single word but how spent henrietta sounded too her hair lay on the pillow as it had that night at the nottingham inn and he knew again that he had laid privations in her way she should by rights have been at longleat in the great rose bedchamber that had been hers since childhood see matthew she turned her eyes to the maitlands nurse he took her hand and bent and kissed her forehead but she made a little sound of protest and he kissed her again on the lips the doctor nodded and the nurse presented their swaddled issue hervey stared with pride and wonder in equal measure he saw what sarah maitland had told him for there were the largest bluest of eyes and the most luxuriant shock of dark hair henrietta squeezed his hand im sorry my love for you wanted a son truly very much her voice was so tired that just saying the words could not have been without effort he was wholly at a loss to respond to anything so entirely selfless we must decide on a name she said raising her head slightly to see better my darling i never so much as once uttered any thought that i wished for a son she is quite perfect i would not have things any other way then sit with me a while and let us speak of it for i cant bear to think of her without a name stables was done by the time he returned to the troop lines indeed the orderly trumpeter was sounding first post for watchsetting hervey complimented him as he passed the guardroom a pretty sound for so cold a night martin private martin saluted thank you sir but a whole tone flat im sorry to say martin took his music seriously he did not quite have perfect pitch but he had a good memory id warmed it by the stove for a quarter of an hour until its pitch were right sir two minutes later and its dropped a whole tone i thought itd freeze to my lips even to hervey his mind so agreeably preoccupied as it was the cold was uncommonly severe has the guard commander shortened the duties do you know he has sir to half thats as well very good martin i should begin warming your trumpet for second post if i were you ay sir good night then sir something clearly had put the captain in good spirits he saluted again as hervey turned for the troop office a sound man martin said hervey to himself meet to replace susan medwell it seemed strange to think like that perhaps but there could be no other way once a man was struck off strength no matter what the circumstances it was a case of soldier on for those who remained no one was irreplaceable all else was mere sentiment that at least was what hervey had always tried to tell himself now especially must he do so since he bore the additional rank of father he must soldier on no matter how difficult his commanding officer made it the sixth were strong enough to ride out a man like towcester were they not his real nature would soon become apparent to those in authority and he would be checked surely for wasnt that the way with the army he was surprised to see major lawrence in the troop office a word hervey if you please the troop orderly serjeant made to leave is mr seton canning in the lines corporal sykes asked hervey winding his hunter it still seemed a mean instrument compared with the one it had replaced but every time he wound it now he felt the want of his old friends gay society most keenly in darcey jessope he could have confided happily even if that delightful coldstreamers counsel had not always been practical hes in his quarters sir shall i fetch him no have him informed that i shall do picket officers rounds myself please very good sir lawrence scarcely waited for the door to close what in the name of heaven happened at niagara theres all manner of rumour abroad on the reservations hervey poured himself coffee took off his cape and shako and sat down one of the patrols pistols discharged accidentally when a hunting party came out of the woods lawrence frowned no hervey that will never do i never expected such a thing from you of all men hervey sighed how easy it would be to tell him all to pretend major lawrence were darcey jessope and what hardedged counsel he would have by return yes it would be very easy but lawrence wasnt jessope there was no basis for mutual trust yet other than instinct they had not campaigned together they did not wear the same uniform hervey had no right to discuss his commanding officer with lawrence no matter what the inducement i cannot think what you mean that is the substantive report he said defiantly though sadly well to begin with i never imagined i would hear you use the word accidental well it was certainly not deliberate do not sport with me sir you know very well that the term is negligent discharge that would be the term if we were talking of the mutiny act yes but it doesnt render my report inaccurate major lawrences powers of observation were not to be underestimated hervey who are you shielding that might well have been impertinent but hervey knew it was apt he supposed the cayugas had already told him but much as he was tempted to confide the circumstances made it impossible for nothing he told the superintendent could be in confidence what does that matter lawrence what is the greater problem the tribes are saying the white soldiers rode through their hunting land without thought for disturbing the little game there was and even fired to frighten them away we were on a road that appeared on a map it was the superintendents turn to sigh the cayugas say you are a brave man do they indeed how would they know one way or the other hervey managed an expression of innocence as much as puzzlement lawrence narrowed his eyes they told me what they saw you must have a care that they saw enough oh i shall hervey i shall for it is my duty to apprise the lieutenantgovernor of all matters touching on the affairs of the indian nations and when he returns i shall give him account hervey had not known sir peregrine was away where is he gone to quebec and he shall be gone another fortnight too but on his return i must give him my assessment of course you must and any report on our encounter with the indians must properly come from lord towcester not from me so i should hope do you know when i might have it hervey was puzzled by the persistence tomorrow i should imagine the day after at the latest indeed captain hervey smiled lawrence how so hervey looked at him blankly lord towcester set out for quebec by sleigh this afternoon did you not know after first parade next day a pale affair with all those of the patrol stood down seton canning went to the troop office it was good of you to stand my picket for me last night hervey his captain smiled i had rather forgotten myself earlier i didnt know it was so late you have my hearty congratulations at any rate sir st oswald has gone to find flowers to send to government house hervey smiled again i salute his gallantry and even more his optimism canning for where in heavens name does he expect to find flowers here i asked him the same but i had intended coming to see you last night you know that was very good of you but there was really no need no hervey not about your good news but rather about our misfortune i dont follow seton canning took a deep breath look here sir how long are we to suffer that man hervey quickened but then gave him the benefit which man towcester of course hell be the death of mr canning herveys tone managed reprimand surprise and disappointment in one go its no good hervey we cant pretend we didnt see what we saw the man bolted that is not true canning oh hervey have it that way if you will but if you hadnt barred his way he would have fled hervey had known this might come the last twelve hours had merely been an unexpected suspense but it made it no easier sit down harry seton canning took off his gloves and laid them in his lap with his forage cap please dont speak of the necessity of loyalty hervey i know full well what you might say on that account im your lieutenant like it or not the men look to me when when they feel unease with with their captain no not that surely you know what i mean hervey did he might say though that that was the true price of a lieutenancy not the cash sum which the agents demanded but he had learned enough these past three years to know that that would sound like cant you will have to trust me harry i can say no more of course i trust you hervey the whole troop would follow you over those damned falls if you led them it was only yesterday that hervey had had the same sentiments for joseph edmonds and edward lankester they of course would have known how to act major edmonds would have taken the affair headon there would have been blood on the stable floor so to speak but the matter would have been resolved captain lankester would have found an altogether different way subtle indirect and would have succeeded with patrician ease it was not by fear that hervey shied from edmondss direct approach or from distaste that he eschewed lankesters indirect methods it was just that he lacked the certainty for the first and the craft for the second and there was no other way yet his troop evidently expected him to find one if i have the troops trust why did you feel it necessary to speak thus harry seton canning picked at imagined idle ends on his cap perhaps i didnt trust myself hervey sighed why did his lieutenant imagine himself alone in this we all have our doubts canning all we can do in the end is hope for the grace to do our duty a week passed a week of guards drills and fatigues of nothing more indeed than a week at hounslow would likely bring except that a great number of the fatigues were as a consequence of the bitter chill worse now than when they had arrived they shovelled snow cut firewood and drew ice as well as the hundred and one stable and cookhouse fatigues that detained so many of them no matter where the station it was hard labour but it was no more than a homesteader thereabouts would be obliged to do the canadas were spoken of as a land of opportunity but in the depths of winter it was first a question of survival yet on the whole the dragoons liked it they fed well the wet canteen of an evening was lively the trappers passing through regaled them with extraordinary tales as well as dispensing princely hospitality and the parade hours were not long in one sense too hervey could not have imagined himself happier except for the nagging question of his superior and the incident in the forest hervey was not so proud that he ruled out talking of it with someone the problem was who lawrence had his own loyalties charles addinsel was in quebec with general maitland and anyway as aidedecamp his loyalties must be to his principal the daag he scarcely knew he had even thought about bagot who was to return in a day or so from sacketts harbour where he had been inspecting the new orleans hervey had very much taken to him bagot was not more than ten years his senior and his wife as the dukes niece would already have predisposed her husband to believe that his complaint would not be frivolous yet what should bagot be expected to know of military particulars as far as hervey was aware the man had never so much as worn a militia coat and besides the practical how honourable was it to take the affairs of the regiment to one so wholly unconnected with it less so even than lawrence no mr bagot would not do which left only those who shared the roman six the adjutant it was unthinkable seton canning unsupportable strickland was days away as was the major there was the chaplain of course the reverend mr esmond shepherd ma oxon who had been unable to obtain a living for himself and had taken his bishops advice instead to answer the call for military chaplains he was a faithful man he said morning and evening prayer conscientiously he preached unmemorably but aptly at divine worship on a sunday he visited the sick dined unobtrusively with the officers and was treated kindly by the ranks but otherwise generally ignored hervey had some regard for him even now the chaplain was preparing for the ministration of baptism that afternoon to their infant and yet mr shepherd could offer him no more advice surely than that he must do his duty according to his conscience doing ones duty was never as difficult as some supposed it to be the difficulty lay always in determining what that duty was the one man whose advice would be a tempered affair of good sense and sound military judgement was armstrong and yet hervey could not bring himself to ask it for two reasons armstrongs standing in the regiment was high yet the merest whiff of perfidy even if by association only would have the lieutenant colonel exact a terrible price from him secondly and it was the mark of a shrewdness which would have been wanting even a year ago if hervey were indeed to take command of the regiment at some early stage he did not wish to have an armstrong who had somehow been involved with that process it was an antique suspicion the same indeed that had dogged the praetorians but he was sure his classicals served him well in this regard he had told henrietta of course she had laughed and said that at least he would be able to make the decisions for himself if the commanding officer insisted on taking to the rear he had remonstrated with her but she had not been in a mood for the woes of the sixth why indeed should she be even though she had formerly insisted that he tell her all she had her child at her breast had she not and now there was baptism to be done in another half an hour and henrietta was in some distress for she had become so big about the bust that her coat would not fasten well ruth was working some small miracle with pins and thread while the nurse seconded from the maitlands stood ready with the sleeping infant mr shepherd had made the concession that the ministration need not be of a sunday on account of the availability of the godparents or those by proxy but he had made no concession to the weather and therefore the place which was why they were now preparing for another sally into the bitter cold once at the church though they were glad of the weather for they might have been at horningsham so peaceful was it the incumbent dr strachan who had lately distinguished himself during the occupation of the town by the enemys forces conducted the service in the warm and gentle tones of aberdeen this was much to herveys and henriettas satisfaction for the drier and remoter tones of oxford had mr shepherd officiated throughout rather than merely delivering a short homily would only have made things seem more chill the godparents or their proxies stood eager for their duty henrietta had known her duty in this regard and was well pleased with the choice john keble had been her husbands choice of godfather for many months he had been canvassed early and had responded in the way that perhaps only he of all their acquaintances might it was true that henrietta would not have chosen him herself but in the case of there being a son the second godfather was to have been william devonshire and in the case of a daughter it could not matter a great deal anyway her husband was content that was the important thing and seton canning was standing impeccable proxy for mr keble as for the godmothers henriettas first intent had been bitterly thwarted by princess charlottes death indeed her thought to call her daughter the same now seemed less appealing the second godmother had long been arranged lady camilla cavendish who would serve as well as william devonshire would to a son lady mary bagot stood proxy and in place of princess charlotte henrietta had asked sarah maitland a lennox even one who had made an improvident match all society knew the duke of richmonds opinion of his daughters choice would always be an apt supporter and so the prayers and promises done and the godparents having certified as they were required by the prayer book that the child may well endure it dr strachan dipped his charge discreetly and warily into the water and declared georgiana charlotte sarah elizabeth i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen afterwards they sat down to a dinner which would not have dishonoured longleat the maitlands chef had at his call fish of the first quality goose both wild and fattened and all the ice he could ever wish for to prepare his confections and hervey had laid in champagne hock burgundy and good tawny before they had left england the hour was very late the cigars were making the air thick and hervey had not thought once in three hours of his disagreeable commanding officer when a note from major lawrence was handed to him it read please be so good as to come to my office the very first thing tomorrow so that i may apprise you of orders just received from quebec no reply johnson he said taking a long draw on his cigar johnson retired silently with the tray like a seasoned footman hervey sighed to himself orders just received this was his life and the interludes of domesticity were always going to be hostage to the horse guards will but now of all times he thought himself deserving of a little peace hervey there are times let me tell you when i wonder if our masters in london do not believe that america is any more a foreign part than well wales hervey smiled halfheartedly he had had little sleep that night he had even arrived at the indian office before major lawrence he felt himself in no position to judge the superintendents proposition besides which he was not entirely sure to which masters in london he referred i would have said ireland rather than wales continued lawrence but i do believe there is a greater readiness to see the native condition of that place than there is here it was a moot point and ordinarily hervey would have liked to debate it its the same in every department hervey the war office never fails to misunderstand the nature of the country the admiraltys no better mind dyou know that when the war of began they sent out great coppers to the shipyards here for the menowar on the lakes to store water in herveys blank response was evidence that lawrences point had escaped him theyre the largest sweetwater lakes in the world hervey oh yes of course its no shame that you do not twig the matter but one might expect more of their lordships and now the foreign secretary instructs lawrence read from a sheet of paper that we render every assistance to the forces of the united states in the suppression of the indian resistance on their western frontier hervey thought for a moment puzzled by the vehemence of the superintendents opposition is that so wholly bad hervey did you hear anything i said when last we spoke our relations with the indians in upper canada have on the whole been happy the result of prudent policies but of late the relations have been tried by any number of little things if we take a hand against the nations in the united states whether they be enemies of the canada nations or no there are bound to be consequences ructions he raked the stove vigorously to let the wood ash fall and the flames have more updraught since the affair at niagara the two affairs at niagara i might add now that your commanding officer has entered the lists the indians do not trust us as before the six nations especially believe we will sell them cheap at some time in the future this is the very worst thing we could be doing and it comes from illadvised folk in london with not a notion of the frontier or indeed a care the lament of a field officer that london did not know or care was not new to hervey he had heard it in much the same measure in the peninsula and lately in india but lawrences tone was unusually strident i dont really understand why the united states should need our help anyway he replied shaking his head lets be frank their army worsted ours at new orleans ah nodded lawrence as if what he was going to say would entirely prove his contention their army consists now of infantry artillery and engineers they have no cavalry what said hervey unable to conceive such a thing was possible you mean none at all no none at all they stood em all down two years ago as soon as the war was ended rattled though he was lawrence could still manage a smile dear stuff cavalry the want is evidently costing them dear at present and is that what we are to do send them cavalry yes that is what theyve asked for to detroit to be precise where is that lawrence pointed on the map but thats two hundred miles by the look of it a little more although the road is good but at this time of year the going will be hard to say the least now look the daag agreed to let me tell you of the situation and mission in general terms and then he will discuss with you whatever detail you feel is unsettled hes having a copy of the commanderinchiefs orders made detailing the limits of your intervention which i am sorry to say do not seem great hervey nodded very well who are these indians who give the americans so much trouble lawrence put more wood into the stove you recall what i said before about the disparate treatment of the nations by ourselves and the americans yes in broad terms the shawanese are one of their trickiest problems in this respect theyre a tennessee and ohio nation and they fought the colonists there tooth and claw then the authorities made various deals with them and served them very ill indeed and now theyre pretty well rootless they broke up into any number of groups last century some moved to the carolinas some west some northeast but one of the groups was with tecumseh and they were dealt with very sorely by the americans just a year before the war began at a place called tippecanoe river they broke up their settlements while the braves were away the names enough to make a shawanese boil now it seems theyre implacably opposed to any further treating with the american indian department lawrence paused to light a cheroot hervey was already taking notes how warlike a tribe are they in nature i mean the superintendent took a long draw and sighed well who knows the guts may have been knocked out of them these past three or four years but ill say this the shawanese were consistently the most warlike in first opposing white settlement i think theyre a very embittered nation now not given to parley and any embittered indian can be a fearsome warrior theres a group trying to move up into michigan perhaps across the border even the shawanese are algonkians not iroquois but since the war theyve felt they had more in common than held them apart i believe the six nations would allow them space were not talking of many hundreds after all hervey listened for another halfhour making copious notes taking down suggestions asking any and every detail by the end he was reassured that he had a picture that would serve him well though he suspected that ultimately his orders would hardly permit much discretion it was a great comfort to know that the superintendent himself would come with him to detroit even if only for a few days henrietta bore the news as well as she had that of herveys patrol to niagara although here was a mission of perhaps months rather than a week she said very assuredly that as soon as it was apt she would travel to detroit to be with him how caithlin armstrong received the news hervey did not know it troubled him to be putting husband and wife asunder at such a time and he had even thought of leaving serjeant armstrong at fort york in charge of rear details but that would have been irregular and armstrong would never have had it anyway herveys orders specified not fewer than fifty sabres and that taxed the troop sorely what with sickness and general duties but he managed to draft something that would serve he gave over the orders to seton canning the next morning and then took two days alone with his wife and daughter while the troop made ready he imagined too that he would know by the end of this brief furlough what was to be done respecting lord towcester what he hervey must do for it was clear now that nothing would happen except by his own hand and throughout he prayed that the lieutenant colonel would not return before they left for detroit only the second prayer seemed to be answered lord towcester was detained in quebec and there was peace about fort york but hervey had been unable to see any proper course respecting the lieutenant colonels fitness for command do something he must however and so in the last hour of his furlough he had taken pen and paper and written his submission as fully as he was able he now read his submission aloud to henrietta and to his surprise she thought it well he read her the letter once more so that there could be no mistaking his intention matthew it will be well i tell you general rolt is by all accounts a sensible man he will know that a subordinate officer would not make such complaint without the gravest cause hervey nodded i do wish you would let me speak to sarah maitland though she would no said hervey gently but emphatically there must be no cause for lord towcester to claim that anyone is scheming against him general rolt would very properly sympathize with him if he were persuaded that there had been scheming as you wish my love she smiled and then she took his hand and kissed his cheek shall you look in the nursery once more before you go their daughter was sleeping her eyes were bluer and bigger and her hair more abundant still georgiana had the look of her mother and hervey could scarcely comprehend it he could only feel it deep in his vitals the force the obligation that was paternity chapter twentyone the finisher fort detroit michigan territory february never had hervey found a mission so simple in conception and yet so difficult in execution and it was nature that accounted for both the hundred and fifty miles of country between detroit and lake michigan were easy going for the most part empty plain broken occasionally by lowlying hills the rivers running straight either to lake michigan itself or east to the erie and the snow betrayed the tracks of anything that moved however the snow fell so often that a guileful enemy if such the shawanese could be called had only to lay up until the sky told him that snow would soon fall again and then continue his evasion secure in the knowledge that his tracks were being covered and the shawanese could read the sky it seemed for hervey and his troop had not seen a single brave or even an infirm old squaw in a fortnight of patrolling the line of the raisin and grand rivers he put down his pen and began to read over his letter to henrietta my darling wife yours to me of the day after our parting is now at hand my having returned only this very morning from a tour of the country your sentiments i return in all their measure i am so very content and principally because you declare yourself to be so i too pray that we may be reunited soon and i am so very glad that you say you will come here as soon as i send word fort detroit and the town of that name is an agreeable settlement and you would be comfortable there the americans are hospitable if somewhat brusque in their manners and my quarters are adequate or you might stay instead at fort malden on the canadian side of the river for there is a ferry by which our lines of communication run from fort brownstown where the troop is quartered and on to york i am brought to detroit some twenty miles or so north of there because the american generals flag flies here if you believe yourself to be strong enough for the journey then the rear details may arrange an escort for you for there is frequent traffic on account of the despatches c i am glad you have found a wet nurse with whom to leave our daughter though the weather is warming so rapidly now that in another month i am sure it would be not unwise to have her brought too i have seen a great many wild creatures here whereas we saw none before there is moose and elk and quite easy to catch since they tire easily in the snow and can be driven into deep drifts where they stick fast we do not shoot them since the noise would give away our presence to the shawanese i have seen fox and racoon and i think porcupine but our guides say they take to winter quarters so perhaps it was something else we have seen black bears several times we are not able to get near for they take off surprisingly fast at our approach but they stand much bigger than i imagined and at last we have heard wolves and so many of the dragoons are now content indeed we hear wolves almost every night sometimes they are a very discordant noise indeed when they all just seem to howl for no reason but to proclaim they are there but from time to time a single far distant wolf calling is a very melancholy sound indeed i am sure you will love to see all that nature displays here in all respects we are well seton canning and st oswald are greatly enjoying their liberty and it is very good for st oswald especially to have this chance of long patrols of his own serjeant armstrong awaits his news with surprising want of ease i never saw him so agitated if this duty continues as uneventfully then i shall send him back to york for a few days i should also tell you by the way that gilbert seems made for this weather he can trot with so high an action that snow as deep as his hocks hardly detains him and at a hundred yards he is invisible but the news i am least pleased with and which you must by now have yourself heard is that joynson is gone back to england an invalid besides being sorry for him in his unhealth i fear my letter with its enclosure for general rolt will not have reached him before he left indeed i cannot see how it possibly could and so i am left now with no alternative but to request an interview with the general as soon as he is come back from quebec though when i shall be able to return to york i have no idea i chide myself that i should have acted earlier in england indeed but in truth i cannot see how before this affair of his at niagara i had any evidence to go on that would stand scrutiny what one thinks of as being of overwhelming import in the regiment suddenly sounds thin skillee indeed in a generals headquarters and even the niagara business is not beyond refute i do so regret now the courtesy of writing first to the major but every bit of me as a soldier said i must it is a very dreadful thing to have done to complain of ones commanding officer and i can only suppose that i was trying not to compound my delinquency by submitting the complaint through the major for the moment therefore i can do no more than submit my request for an interview with the general and trust to god that he is a fairminded man and so with these presents i must conclude for there is a rider about to leave with despatches and i do so wish you and now our daughter to have this expression of love and admiration as well as assurances that it leaves me well and as content as i might be in the circumstances of our separation your ever loving husband matthew hervey brigadiergeneral sam power was a man whom hervey knew at once to be just the sort of officer whose generalship he would enjoy his family were farmers from the west of the territory and he had enlisted in the michigan legionary corps on its formation in serving first with the rifle and then with the cavalry company in when the regular army was enlarged he went to the new military academy at west point in new york state and was subsequently commissioned into the second infantry he had served with zachary taylor on the wabash winfield scott at niagara and andrew jackson at new orleans and he was not yet thirtyfive his blue staff uniform put hervey in mind of captain peto except that where at first meeting peto had been guarded distant almost hostile power was open warm and thoroughly engaging captain hervey i am so glad we meet sir and sorry for its being two whole weeks after coming to my country sit you down a vigorous handshake reinforced the welcome and coffee and applejack from the power familys farm sealed it its a great privilege for me to have a troop of his majestys dragoons at my disposal captain hervey congress must be ruing their paring but it is a good thing for our armies to be cooperating at long last hervey said it was his privilege too but hoped it could be one without bloodshed im not happy with these indian wars myself captain hervey i regret very much some of the excesses of my countrymen some of the nations have a right to feel aggrieved yet the settlement of this land is not something that any can now set their face against that is the reality from now on it should be the proper management of that inevitable fact the westward progress of the frontier i only wish we were managing it as well as you are in canada general power offered him a cigar and lit one himself hervey lit his and made appreciative noises the general smiled with satisfaction yes best havana we had them brought from just across the water when i was in new orleans if you follow hervey did but would not dwell on the notion and so the shawanese sir power sighed the shawanese god damn it they can be as awkward as a bent nail you know they believe the creator is a woman the finisher as they call her well they have a new prophet related to tecumseh and he claims the finisher has prepared a land of milk and honey for them near their brothers the ojibwa and their cousins of the six nations that means northern michigan and ontario for that matter the trouble is the departments lost track of the main group altogether theyre not even sure theyve left the indiana territory if theyre making north on the western side of the lake past fort dearborn he pointed to the map again there are too few troops to hand to track them let alone turn them back and then they could come into the territory from the north not easy of course but perhaps a sight easier than trying to run a line of blue in the south what do you propose then sir general power poured more coffee and relit his cigar i dont have you indefinitely thats a strong consideration but as the thaw comes on the rivers wont be easy for the shawanese to cross i reckon two infantry companies could picket the gap between the maxanic and the raisin and then if we cover the fords once in twentyfour hours wed pick up a crossing theyd never do it in less not with the spring melts and their ponies are grassfed so you shouldnt have much trouble catching them on corn were consuming that corn at a fair rate sir yes i know my quartermastergenerals working on it hervey thanked him presumably the shawanese cant just wade anywhere indeed no they cant all swim and they wont want to cross too close to the lakes for fear of running into folk or of not leaving themselves room to manoeuvre if theyre discovered i should like you to keep up your patrols along the grand river for the time being but be ready to move up to the maxanic in strength that just gives space to close with them before the country begins to open up the general pointed on the map how they might have the run of northern michigan ive taken several dozen winnebago scouts onto the payroll and im confident theyll come up with something the point is if we can confront them in strength overwhelming strength they mightnt draw a bowstring at all hervey said he would apprise fort york of the intention in his next despatch general power nodded im told your colonel is to visit by the way herveys spirits fell i was not aware of it sir but he thought that sounded a little curt and tried to seem more eager but i imagine he would wish to hes been in quebec these past weeks the earl of towcester is it hervey put his pronunciation to right i should be very happy to receive him with full honours here if he would like that i believe he would regard that highly sir chapter twentytwo bitter cold the maxanic river three weeks later fires burned all about a troops camp they had buffalohide blankets and firfrond beds but still hervey was cold nor was it a cold that bit at the extremities only but one which rendered him sleepless and unaccountably fearful he needed this sleep for he had been in the saddle for the best part of three days since the alarm how like the exercise on chobham common it had seemed when he had told his officers and ncos of his design and how different the reality was the cold and an enemy who thought in so alien a way and who fought not as soldiers but as men desperate to preserve their very being here on the shallow snowcovered hills of southern michigan a place he could only imagine might be pleasant without its white shroud he felt for the first time an uncertainty in the outcome for he could not take the initiative and he had never met his adversary before he felt the want of serjeant armstrong keenly too armstrong now also the father of a fine healthy daughter remained at brownstown from where the troops supplies intelligence and orders came hervey would have trusted no other for the task but he was paying the price at that witching hour of night when the wolf called menacing now where first it had been novel and diverting armstrong would have been about the place cursing sparing no one just waiting for a dragoon to complain of the cold or use it as an excuse for some dereliction in the end it was so much easier to be afraid of serjeant armstrong than something altogether unknown the winnebago scouts had soon repaid the investment in them they had told general power that the shawanese would pass around the headwaters of the maxanic and then of the raisin when the full moon next shone it was now the night before that moon but the sky was overcast and the dark was like the first quarters the thaw had begun a week before making the crossings treacherous and narrowing the shawaneses options but three days ago there had been a sudden relapse into deep winter with heavy falls of snow and then a fall of the glass so great that the surface of the snow was now frozen as one continuous sheet horses were losing condition rapidly their heads were frostcovered their breath freezing even as it left the nostrils fetlocks became chafed or clean cut with every step through the ice crust and a red trail had often marked their progress of late hervey forced himself from his bed to begin a tour of the sentries it would test all his skill in hiding his own dejection in this godforsaken wilderness at brownstown henrietta slept little better not for want of warmth or security but because she had hoped so very much to see her husband that day the ferry and sleigh ride from fort malden that morning had been pleasant a pleasure she was not expecting to have again for some weeks but on arriving at fort brownstown she had encountered lord towcester and his mood had been extraordinarily malevolent the reason for which she could only guess he had ordered her to return to york at once and she recorded in her journal in terms that overstepped any mark of a gentleman when she had made to protest he had pointed out that she was in military quarters and would hear him in silence he had even disbarred to her the ferry to fort malden since he required it for his own purposes he said you must take a sleigh to detroit madam he had told her and wait on your husband in that place or else cross there and wait at malden either way you shall not consume military supplies for another day more in this fort henriettas suspicions as to the cause of the earls ill humour if correct indicated that her initiative in writing to the duke of huntingdon had been speedier in its consequences than she had imagined but she hadnt the initiative here and she knew she had little option but to submit to the lieutenant colonels will she regretted its ill effects with serjeant armstrong however he had immediately declared that he would escort her himself to detroit but when lord towcester found out it sent him into a rage he accused armstrong of failing to comprehend where his duty lay and of loyalties inimical to the wellbeing of the regiment armstrong had argued forcefully that his captain had told him that the whole of michigan south of detroit was to be regarded as hostile until such time that they had apprehended or turned back the shawanese stuff and nonsense serjeant lord towcester had roared i have myself just come from detroit did i then pass through hostile country bah it had all the appearance of surrey serjeant armstrong pressed his case your lordship they were my orders and the intelligence is come from the highest level the americans have spies with the indians i dont think spies serjeant renegade indians whod sell anything for the price of a tot and orders you call them from americans tush sir one more word and ill have your stripes at this even the adjutant had looked uneasy armstrong had seen the futility of further argument however and had knuckled his forehead instead and so all he had been able to do by way of seeing henrietta decently back to detroit was detail three troopers and lancecorporal atyeo to escort the sleigh and threaten them to secrecy and a start before first light so that lord towcester would not learn of it in time to countermand the instructions henrietta stared into the darkness of her chamber resigned to being sent away but wishing praying that her husband might somehow come to her before the day did just after six there came a knock henrietta had woken a few minutes before indeed she had slept only very fitfully she rose put on her cloak for the fires embers were giving off little heat now turned up the oil lamp and opened the door a dragoon stood with a tray covered by a white cloth the serjeant said to bring you this maam he whispered henriettas spirits could hardly have been lower but she smiled at him warmly for she could see his unease serjeant armstrong is very good she opened the door wide to allow the dragoon to pass he put the tray on the table and removed the cloth steam rose from the spout of a coffee pot the serjeant said to tell you maam that its chocolate not coffee henrietta smiled again armstrong must have been very resourceful to find her favourite here what is your name she asked the dragoon stancliff maam well thank you private stancliff and please convey my thanks to serjeant armstrong too do you think i might have a little hot water later yes maam of course maam and the serjeant says to tell you well be leaving at seven maam if thats all right with you yes that will do very well for me you are coming too yes maam corporal atyeos in charge and therell be painter and morris as well henrietta did not know them but they sounded true enough men when private stancliff had gone henrietta sipped the chocolate and held aside the curtains to look out into the yard below she hoped still to see her husband just long enough for them to bid each other farewell even but there was no sign of him yet it was dark and all she could make out by the flickering torches was her sleigh the small but sturdy longcoated horse standing patiently between the shafts its breath white in the cold air she shivered a little afraid now at seven with half an hour still to go before first light serjeant armstrong saw off the sleigh and its escort take this with you maam he said giving henrietta her husbands repeating carbine if so much as a footpad comes anywhere near you atyeo and his menll see to them dont you worry but yes i know serjeant armstrong henrietta squeezed his hand and smiled at him much better to have something of ones own in case they dont notice ay maam something like that just point it in the air and keep pulling the trigger itd frighten a lion im sure it would she said finding herself trying to reassure him my husband has shown me it and again thank you so very much for what you tried to for arranging this and many many congratulations on the birth of your beautiful daughter you will be enchanted when you see her armstrong turned very red thank you maam i never thought id long to see anyone so much as i do that lass and her bairn she leaned across and kissed his forehead goodbye she whispered i hope to see you again very soon an hour later unable to bear it any longer serjeant armstrong took his horse and galloped after the sleigh at ten oclock two hours after first light hervey received word from his easternmost vidette that a party of at least twenty shawanese had crossed the headwaters of the raisin and were making for the lakeside road but that makes no sense at all said seton canning why expose themselves at the part most likely to be patrolled hervey cursed to himself because it isnt the most likely to be patrolled and they know it whod patrol the last road the indians would dare use do you think theyre trying to draw us away from here so that the slower ones can pass through possibly but a party of shawanese braves on the detroit road makes us look damned stupid to say the least they killed one of the trappers who saw them theyll make mischief right enough what do you want to do no one will be using the detroit road that much we know the general said they would close it as soon as there was word that the shawanese were on the move so the best we can do is send a division direct to detroit across country and expect to intercept the party as they strike northwest before the town not even shawanese possessed would ride straight for the fort do you want me to take the division if you please and youd better send someone to inform brownstown and detach a man to detroit when you get within safe distance good luck harry the sleigh horse stumbled and slid to a walk as they began to descend the slope to the stream crossing a wooden bridge distinguishable only by the snowcovered rails three feet high corporal atyeo walked his horse across to prove it in the prescribed fashion and then signalled his party on as he lowered his hand an arrow struck him in the neck and he fell like a sack from the saddle at once the troopers reached for their carbines and closed on the sleigh the driver already crouching low on the board two arrows struck private stancliff in the back knocking every bit of wind from him he fell without a sound morris and painter were good shots and fair swordsmen but could see no target for their marksmanship henrietta crouched in the well of the sleigh gripping the carbine tight numb with terror lets go called morris to the driver now cowering between the traces a flight of three arrows struck home and morris the norfolk farmers boy fell crying henrietta saw him fall she crawled from the sleigh to his side and pulled him to her oh miss miss he sobbed tears ran down her cheeks as she shook with cold and fright private painter slid from the saddle to crouch by them carbine at the aim if he were frightened he didnt show it crawl to the sledge maam we can fight em off from there they wont want to close with us henrietta did as she was told for morris was dead painter prised the carbine from his hand and took off his pouch belt then crawled to henriettas side dont worry maam ive never missed so much as a hare but private painter did not have a repeating carbine and was able to fire only once in the sudden rush of shawanese he knelt to aim one brave fell clutching his chest but before the dragoon could so much as bite the top off the next cartridge a hudsons bay tomahawk split open his chest like a spatchcock henrietta fought hard not to faint the warriors heads shaven but for a topknot cheeks stippled red with warpaint seized the troop horses one brave pulled the driver from under the traces pushed him to his knees and hacked his head from his shoulders as if he were butchering a sheep another taller than the rest and wearing a gold nosering took his scalping knife and knelt by corporal atyeos lifeless body he grasped the long fair hair with his left hand so special a prize he cut the scalp with two deft slices one with and one against the sun then loosened the skin with the point of the knife and pulled with his feet against atyeos shoulders until the scalp came away with a sucking sound henrietta had already hidden her eyes but her sobs came all the more it was the sight of atyeos scalp that raised armstrongs blood to the boil as he bore down the slope screaming murder at them fight me fight me you bloody bastards you bloody heathen coward bastards fight me any one of you the shawanese were stunned armstrong leaped from his mare still at full tilt the point of his sabre went clean through atyeos defiler he stood and roared his challenge the more fight me any of you one brave launched at him with a tomahawk but armstrong merely sidestepped and took off the mans hand with a neat stroke thats it thats it come on you savages one by one theres a different cut for every bastard of you but he didnt see the warrior crouching behind the tomahawk struck at that defiant head and stopped the tirade abruptly henriettas frantic sobbing sounded ever louder in the sudden silence a brave who wore two eagle feathers at his throat and carried a rifle walked towards the sleigh and pulled henrietta from under it she had the carbine in her hand still though he made no attempt to take it she pulled her arm free he did not grip it hard he took several steps back as if to admire his prize she levelled the carbine and squeezed the trigger the recoil snapped her wrist like a twig and the rifle flew from her hands she screamed in pain turned and ran back towards the bridge sobbing wildly a warrior trotted his pony to bar her way she scrambled down the bank to cross below but the ice broke as she took the first step she plunged up to her shoulders the shock silencing her still she fought she seized at the reeds on the bank and somehow managed to drag herself out watched silently the while by the shawanese then the cold began to numb where first it had bitten what little strength was left was leaving her and she knew it she began to sob uncontrollably oh my baby my baby oh matthew matthew please god please god she was on her knees before the warriors it was snowing again and bitterly bitterly cold please please she cried if only the indian would spare her she could drive the sleigh the last few miles to safety for all the cold and her dousing and her broken wrist she knew she could do it she must do it for her baby for matthew the warrior with two feathers cradled his rifle in the crook of his arm and fired the sleigh horse fell dead in the traces he turned and motioned the braves to follow and the shawanese rode off taking the other horses with them chapter twentythree reckonings fort brownstown next day seton canning spoke very softly and that is as much as we could make out hervey those dragoons must have fought like lions for her hervey nodded slowly using every ounce of his strength to keep his composure he wanted to give way but duty bound him tight even now what an end what a terrible terrible end his voice cracked tellingly seton canning watched him anxiously unable to find any word to help and henrietta she hervey i am sure she was not touched by any of them she lay under a buffalo hide huddled up to the horse there was no fear in her eyes she even looked i can hardly say this peaceful almost but shed been soaked from head to foot that much was clear whether she had tried to hide by the river i just dont know the snow had covered all the tracks hervey stayed silent for a full minute thank you harry thank you for i think i should like to be left to myself for now if you please seton canning rose but hervey had one more thought corporal collins is trying to track the war party you say the lieutenant shook his head its not a case of trying hervey collins wont give up till hes got every one of them with a noose round their neck hervey nodded again the rest of the shawanese we backed away easily enough when youd left they were a sorry sight the indian department men could scarcely believe it it seemed to make it more incredible still that henrietta should have died this way a few days cold and yes harry nature doesnt seem to spare her own even sir no matter in solitude there was nothing to stand between hervey and his darkest thoughts every instance that might have averted henriettas death every occasion that lord towcesters conduct had given him just cause to protest to higher authority and there had been many if only he had possessed the resolve to use them paraded before him like ranked troops at a review even the vision of sir abraham cole and manvers priory where yet they might have been enjoying their wedded bliss loomed like some infernal spectre he buried his head in his hands at the sudden vision of a crib on the fine lawn of that gentle mansion how might their daughter ever forgive him when she learned the truth there was a knock and the surgeon came in good morning hervey im so very very sorry i can give you something later if you want to sleep that is thank you ritchie perhaps ill be glad of it then but not at the moment ay ay whenever youre ready is there any more news the surgeon sighed no no sign of consciousness yet but hell live im pretty certain of it any man that can survive this long will live that shako is a hell of a fine thing it took the force from the blow and its as well that it broke his skull for thats what put armstrong out as if he were dead but how did he survive the cold then when henrietta was soaked to the skin so canning told me she was only minutes from death as soon as that happened unless someone could have helped her armstrong well enough said ritchie thank you lets just pray that armstrong recovers his faculties ay lets pray that well id better get back to see that hes still breathing properly im so very sorry hervey he put a hand on his shoulder you know that is the cold is not so fearsome a death as others henrietta would have slipped into a peaceful sleep she hervey gave the surgeon what thankful smile he could manage and sank back in his chair as the door closed the clock struck the quarter and then the halfhour and many were his visions of henrietta in that time happy visions of childhood courtship and wedding day shared perhaps by others and there were more intimate ones too of which he alone could know at length he buttoned up his tunic rose and left the room his lordship will see you now hervey said the adjutant in a voice distinctly subdued the commanding officers temporary quarters were only a dozen yards from where hervey had been alone with his thoughts but they might have been a league away he put on his shako and said he was ready the adjutant opened the door and both entered lord towcester nodded to acknowledge herveys salute youd better sit down in the circumstances captain hervey i should rather stand if you please your lordship the lieutenant colonel looked a little taken aback very well then let me express my deepest regrets at your very sorry news hervey ignored the sentiments your lordship there is one thing which puzzles me why was my wife leaving the fort and by that road captain hervey i hardly think this is the time or i am sorry your lordship but i very much consider that it is my wife had come here to see me there is no ordinance against that and the road she was on had been closed by order of the americans and myself herveys manner was cold insistent but respectful still lord towcesters eyes showed no more warmth than they had ever done his mouth had closed to a slit and his words began to come with a hiss was i expected to know that sir but why did you send her away herveys anger was now only barely concealed did i say that i had sir do you deny it still hervey kept his anger just in check though lord towcester could not know how hard he struggled captain hervey your tone is becoming impertinent herveys tone was still as cold as the air outside and seemingly as calm why did you send my wife away sir lord towcester huffed because sir she had taken to meddling i beg your lordships pardon the contempt was undisguised it seems that she had written to the duke of huntingdon raking over dead coals i consider your sending her away improper and i need hardly add that if you had not done so she would be alive at this minute what even if you did not know the road was closed i consider that it was a reckless thing to have done and i shall make my complaint to general rolt you impertinent devil roared towcester mr dauntsey you will take this officers sword the adjutant stood openmouthed my lord captain hervey has just suffered the most wretched bereavement that is no excuse for insubordination take his sword sir there will be no need of that rasped hervey i shall send in my papers this very day but i shall also lay before the major general my complaints including your late conduct at niagara and certain other matters of which i have been made aware how dare you captain hervey what conduct what matters you will discover your lordship but i believe i may say that it were better that your lordship placed a pistol to his head he saluted slowly and turned on his heel lord towcester struck the table in so great a rage that the veneer splintered stay where you are sir i have not finished with you mr dauntsey arrest that officer but the adjutant made no move back in his quarters hervey took the letter from his pocket he had had it now for longer than he had known the worst and his sisters neat round hand was a comfort even if as he supposed it bore ill news but what ill news could possibly compound his grief elizabeths earnest face was before him now and without doubt there was solace in it horningsham december my dearest matthew i bring you news that you will scarcely be able to believe our father has been made archdeacon and a canon of the cathedral i cannot begin to explain how this all came about for up until only a very few days ago we were certain that he was to be deprived of the living here but the bishop deems that the offences of which he stood accused and which charges were to have been heard by the consistory were all occasioned by misunderstanding the old archdeacon has been translated to ely where he is made dean and the bishop it seems believed it only right that father whose nerves have suffered so very ill these past months should have the preferment in his stead and so he is now archdeacon of sarum and by the time this letter reaches you he will have been installed and so you may write to him thus mama is restored to all her former spirits she even says she hopes the old archdeacon will have a perpetual chill in the ely fens and now that there is peace and ease in the vicarage i myself shall go to warwickshire to lord john howards people for his sister is to give a ball i do not think you met her she came to bath last winter when her brother took a house there for the season and i like her very much i pray that this finds both you and henrietta in excellent health and spirits by my reckoning this shall reach you not many weeks or even days before the birth of my nephew or shall it be niece i long to hear of that news which i do pray you will hasten to us here by the speediest of means and so i shall end for it pleases me more than i can say to write to you a letter with such happy content at last and i do not wish to dilute its happiness with common tattle god is very good to us your ever affectionate sister elizabeth hervey folded the letter carefully and put it back into his pocket he would write to elizabeth and at the same time to lord and lady bath to say that he had lost his wife that he had lost his wife he did not know how he would find the words however or even the courage but for one letter he was certain he could find both words and courage in ample measure he went to the desk took out pens and paper sat upright in the chair and looked out of the window despite the bitter cold his dragoons were going about their business as best they could for in the army life must always go on and with as little interruption as might be hervey dipped his pen in the inkwell and began to write his report to the major general the end historical afternote something was bound to give in the business of the cavalry and aid to the civil power on august at st peters fields in manchester one of the shadowy villains of my tale held another meeting the numbers approaching sixty thousand the magistrates ordered the local yeomanry to arrest orator hunt but the parttime cavalrymen botched it an antecedent troop of my own regiment was sent to rescue them and restore order which they did apparently with restraint but the damage was done and peterloo as the press dubbed it became a cause célèbre for the reform movement but it did have a positive side for it was a major factor in the establishment of professional police forces although it was not for another decade that the metropolitan police act was actually passed the unguarded border secured by the rush bagot agreement is now so much taken for granted that the war of seems incomprehensible let alone any tension since and yet there were occasional local disputes as the frontier moved west often as a result of the difficulty of accurate surveying i have a photograph of canadian army officers as late as the s covertly making a reconnaissance of the border approaches in new york state should any reader wish to see for himself the ground over which the bitter and destructive angloamerican war was fought i commend gilbert collinss guidebook to the historic sites of the war of dundurn press toronto the th light dragoons the only cavalry regiment of the british army to earn the battle honour niagara were disbanded in only to be reraised in almost disbanded again in amalgamated in and then again in the war office does not have many historians
