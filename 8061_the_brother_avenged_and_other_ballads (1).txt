the brother avenged and other ballads by george borrow london printed for private circulation copyright in the united states of america by houghton mifflin co for clement shorter the brother avenged i stood before my masters board the skinkers office plying the heraldmen brought tidings then that my brother was murdered lying i followed my lord unto his bed by his dearest down he laid him then my courser out of the stall i led and with saddle and bit arrayed him i sprang upon my coursers back with the spur began to goad him and ere i drew his bridle to full fifteen leagues i rode him and when i came to the noisy hall where the kemps carouse were keeping o then i saw my mother dear oer the corse of my brother weeping then i laid an arrow on my good bow the bow that never deceived me and straight i shot the kings kempions twelve of my brother who had bereaved me and then to the ting i rode away where the judges twelve were seated of six to avenge my brother i begged and of six protection entreated for the third time rode i to the ting for deep revenge i lusted up stood the liegeman of the king and at me fiercely thrusted up stood the liegeman of the king with a furious thrust toward me and the judges twelve rose in the tingand an outlawd man declared me then i laid an arrow on my good bow and the bow to its utmost bent i and into the heart of the kings liegeman the sharp sharp arrow sent i then away from the ting amain i sped and my good steed clomb in hurry there was nothing for me but to hasten and flee and myself mong the woods to bury and hidden for eight long years i lay amid the woods so lonely id nothing to eat in that dark retreat but grass and green leaves only id nothing to eat in that dark retreat save the grass and leaves i devoured no bedfellows crept to the place where i slept but bears that brooned and roared so near at hand was the holy tide of our lady of mercies tender the king of the swedes his followers leads and rides to the church in splendour so i laid an arrow on my good bow as i looked from the gap so narrow and into the heart of the swedish king i sent the yardlong arrow now lies on the ground the swedish king and the blood from his deathwound showers so blythe is my breast though still i must rest amid the forest bowers the eyes to kiss a pair of red lips small full many a lover sighs if i kiss anything at all let it be sophys eyes the eyes the eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with care too dear i prize the eyes the eyes of sophy ribeaupierre were i the czar my kingly crown my troops and victories and fair renown id all lay down to kiss but sophys eyes the charming eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with care too dear i prize the charming eyes of sophy ribeaupierre perhaps ive seen a fairer face though hers may well surprise a form perhaps of lovelier grace but oh the eyes the eyes the matchless eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with carei well may prize the matchless eyes of sophy ribeaupierre what with the polished diamondstone can vie beneath the skies oh it is vied and far outshone by sophys beaming eyes by sophys eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with care well may i prize the beaming eyes of sophy ribeaupierre the sun of june burns furiously and brooks and meadows dries but oh with more intensity burn cruel sophys eyes the wicked eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with care too dear i prize the wicked eyes of sophy ribeaupierre o soon beneath their piercing ray like some parched plant which dies wither shall i poor youth away and all for sophys eyes but bless the eyes whose witcheries have filled my heart with care till death ill prize and bless the eyes of sophy ribeaupierre harmodius and aristogiton from the greek

there he found fearstricken and amazd that he a rough oak trunk embracdinstead of the enchanting waist of his mysterious fair then straight abroad a voice he heard which sang the window through these were the words the voice profferd if my report be true come out to her whom thou didst wed upon my mead thy couch is spread from this he guessed with some elf maid that he had had to do the treasure digger o would that with last and shoe i had stayd without wild desires and ah no trust in satan had laid that prince of liars each saturday night when slept the rest away i strolld to the forest so murky and drear in quest of buried gold and then i beheld the hopping fire glow the briar behind and down to the earth my wishingrod low itself declind i dug then and gripped the chests ring amain and held it stout but the copper deceitful burst in twain and the fiends laughed out just just as long was the treasure my own as i trembled with fright but soon as i held it secure down down it sank from

trust will lay that prince of liars the fisher the fisherman saddleth his good winged horse to be on the deep seems to him his best course against the white strand loud and hoarse the wave breaks and towards the strand now the fisherman makes and up when the fisher his fishingline drew a fine golden fish on the hook met his view then he laughed in his beard ive of fish seen a store but neer one with golden cloth kirtle beforeif i a gold piece for each goldscale possessd with poverty i should no more be distrest with its tail the fish gan the bench furious to smite and a strange dance it seemed to the fishermans sight thou wealthy man be not i pray thee so gay a much quieter part a poor fisher should play the golden fish heard every word as it lay began straight to talk and discourse in this way im full as rich fisherman as thou art poor and soon for thee happiness i will procure straight cast me again in the ocean my home and a welldoing man thou i swear shalt become the queen of the ocean my mother is know she linen and bolsters on thee shall bestow my father is king in the depths of the sea and healthy and strong he shall cause thee to be my lover he sorrows for me in the brine my golden cloth kirtle shall also be thine for the sovereign of fishes i care not a straw on myself if i did i but laughter should draw for thy mothers fine cushions i care little more my own queen could make better ware any hour but if thou to a wooer thy troth didst allot the repose of two lovers destroy i will not the trembling gold fish in the water placed he from such wretched captures the lord preserve me if tomorrow a like one upon my hook bite i shall perish of hunger poor miserable wight he the rest of the day sat at home by his hearth and spake not a word that repeating is worth he early next morn in his boat his seat took and straightway adjusted a bait to his hook and soon as hed overboard cast the fishline the float it descended deep under the brine then he laughed in his beard and with bitterness said a catch of another gold fish i have made the thin lengthy line he updrew half unwilling and behold there upon the hook hung a gold shilling and i can forsooth and for certainty say that he for delight had no rest the whole day but as oft as the line he updrew from the tide upon the hook never a fish he descried for wheneer for the fish he upon the hook sought he found that a shilling of gold he had caughtthe cuckoo abiding an appointment made upon the weedgrown steep i stayed one morning mild when may was new and fresh the down was fraught with dew the meads were flowering bright the woods the branches yielding thousand buds my lips employed in song the while on morfydd of the merry smile twas then as round i cast my eye with mighty wish the maid to spy though howsoeer my sight i strained no glimpse of morfydd i obtained i heard the cuckoos voice arise singing the song which most i prize to each bard true most sweet i trow his music on the mountains brow therefore as called by courtesy i greeted him in poesy good day dear cuckoo with thy strain a herald thou from heavens domain to us the tidings thou dost bear of summer blissful season fair of summer which to greenwood shade entices forth the bard and maid which decks with foliage dense the grove and through all nature breathes of love o dear to me that note of thine it seasons love like choicest wine whilst doating fondness to chastise what cutting taunt in cuckoo lies but pretty bird i pray declare where lingereth now my lady fair o poet what delusion great doth fill this year thy foolish pate tis harbouring a useless pain one thought of her to entertain with all her store of winning charms she weds her to anothers arms believe me when i say to thee a mate of thine she may not be hush hush ill not believe thy voice dare not defame my bosoms choice that nymph the fairest neath the sun has sworn an oath a solemn one she vowed by her baptismal rite beneath the bough one blessed night her hand my own enclasping hard to live and die with me her bard the minister that mystic night was madog benfras matchless wight her suitors all may vainly sigh how should she wed whom wed have i tis false o bird what thou dost state and waste of time with thee to prate folly and drunkenness tis plain have got possession of thy brain hence with thy news and get thee coolthou art i fear a very fool o dafydd who the fool but thou talking this guise beneath the bough another husband chooses she whose charms deceitful captured thee the damsel of the neck of snow is now anothers wife i trow to love anothers looks not well the bow bach owns the blooming belle for what thoust sung within the grove with malice filled about my love may days of winter come with speed the summer and the sun recede hoar frost upon the foliage fall the wood and branches withering all and thou with piercing cold be slain thou horrid bird of hateful strain
