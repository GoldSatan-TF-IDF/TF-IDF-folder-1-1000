stones fall iain pears to my mother part one paris march the church of stgermain des prés at the start of what was supposed to be spring was a miserable place made worse by the drabness of a city still in a state of shock worse still by the little coffin in front of the altar which was my reason for being there worse again by the aches and pains of my body as i kneeled shed died a week before i arrived i hadnt even realised she was still alive she must have been well into her eighties and the hardships of the past few years had weakened many a younger person she would not have been impressed but something approaching a real prayer for her did come into my mind just before i struggled back onto the pew age has few compensations the indignity of discomfort the effort to conceal constant nagging pain is most certainly not one of them until i read the figaro that morning and saw the announcement i had been enjoying myself i was on a farewell tour the powers that be had scraped together enough foreign currency to allow me to travel my last visit to the foreign bureaux before i retired not many people could do that sort of thing these days and would not until foreign exchange restrictions were lifted it was a little mark of respect and one that i appreciated it was a fine enough service i thought although i was not an expert the priests took their time the choir sang prettily the prayers were said and it was all over a short eulogy paid tribute to her tireless selfless work for the unfortunate but said nothing of her character the congregation was mainly freshly scrubbed and intenselooking children who were clipped around the ear by teachers if they made any untoward noise i looked around to see who would take charge of the next round but no one seemed to know what to do eventually the undertaker took over the body he said would be interred in père lachaise that afternoon at two oclock at chemin du dragon all who wished to attend were welcome then the pallbearers picked up the coffin and marched out leaving the mourners feeling lost and cold excuse me but is your name braddock matthew braddock a quiet voice of a young man neatly dressed with a black band around his arm i nodded and he held out his hand my name is whitely he said harold whitely of henderson lansbury fenton i recognised you from newsreels oh solicitors you know we dealt with madame robillards residual legal business in england not that there was much of it i am so glad to meet you i was planning to write in any case once i got back really she didnt leave me any money did she he smiled im afraid not by the time she died she was really quite poor goodness gracious me i said with a smile why the surprise she was very wealthy when i knew her id heard that i knew her only as a sweet old lady with a weakness for worthy causes but i found her charming on the few occasions we met quite captivating in fact yes thats her i replied why did you come to the funeral a tradition of the firm he said with a grimace we bury all our clients a last service but you know its a trip to paris and theres not much opportunity for that these days unfortunately i could get hold of so little currency i have to go straight back this evening i have a little more than that so would you care for a drink he nodded and we walked down the boulevard stgermain to a café past grim buildings blackened with the filth of a century or more of smoke and fumes whitely formerly captain whitely so he told me had an annoying tendency to grip my elbow at the difficult bits to make sure i did not trip and fall it was thoughtful although the assumption of decrepitude was irritating a good brandy she deserved no less and we drank her health by the plateglass window as we sat on our rickety wooden chairs madame robillard we intoned several times over becoming more garrulous as we drank he told me of life in intelligence during the war the time of his life he said wistfully now gone for good and replaced with daily toil as a london solicitor i told him stories of reporting for the bbc of dday of telling the world about the blitz all yesterday and another age who was her husband i asked i assume he is long dead robillard died about a decade ago he ran the orphanages and schools with her is that why all those children were in the church i imagine so she started her first home after the war the first war there were so many orphans and abandoned children and she somehow got involved with them by the end there were about ten or twelve schools and orphanages i gather all run on the very latest humanitarian principles they consumed her entire fortune in fact so much so that i imagine they will all be taken over by the state now a good enough use for it when i knew her she was married to lord ravenscliff that was more than forty years ago though i paused whitely looked blank have you heard of ravenscliff i enquired no he said should i have i thought then shook my head maybe not he was an industrialist but most of his companies disappeared in the depression some closed others were bought up vickers took over a few i remember the lone and level sands stretch far away you know pardon nothing i breathed in the thick air of cigarette smoke and damp then attracted the waiters eye and called for more drinks it seemed a good idea whitely was not cheering me up at all it was quiet not many people around and the waiters were prepared to work hard for the few customers they had one of them almost smiled but managed to restrain himself tell me about her i said when our glasses were refilled once more i hadnt seen her for many years i only discovered she was dead by chance not much to say she lived in an apartment just up the road here went to church did good works and outlived her friends she read a great deal and loved going to the cinema i understand she had a weakness for humphrey bogart films her english was excellent for a frenchwoman she lived in england when i knew her hungarian by birth though apart from that theres nothing to say is there i suppose not a quiet and blameless life what were you going to write to me about hmm oh that well mr henderson you know our senior partner he died a year ago and weve been clearing out his papers there was a package for you for me what is it gold jewels dollar bills swiss watches i could use some of those we prospective oldage pensioners i couldnt say whats in it its sealed it was part of the estate of mr henry cort good heavens you knew him i assume we met many years ago as i say part of the cort estate curious thing is that it carried instructions that you were to be given it only on madame robillards death which was very exciting for us there isnt much excitement in a solicitors office let me tell you hence my intention to write to you do you know what is in it i have absolutely no idea i scarcely knew cort at all and certainly havent even cast eyes on him for more than thirty years i came across him when i was writing a biography of madame robillards first husband thats how i knew her as well i hope it was a great success unfortunately not i never even finished it the reaction of most publishers was about as enthusiastic as your own was when i mentioned his name my apologies it was a long time ago i went back to being a journalist then joined the bbc when it started up when did cort die curious how the older you get the more important other peoples deaths become nineteen fortyfour when i get back send me your package if its valuable ill be glad to get it but i doubt it will be as far as i remember cort didnt like me very much i certainly didnt like him and then we ran out of things to say to each other as strangers of different generations do i paid and began my old mans routine of wrapping myself up coat hat scarf gloves pulling everything tight to keep out the bitterness of the weather whitely pulled on a thin threadbare coat army demob by the look of it but he didnt seem half as cold as i was at the thought of going outside are you going to the cemetery that would be the death of me she would not have expected it and probably would have thought me sentimental and i have a train at four when i get back i will dig out my old notes to see how much i actually remember and how much i merely think i remember i took my train from the gare de lyon that afternoon and the cold of paris faded along with thoughts of madame robillard formerly elizabeth lady ravenscliff as i went south to the greater warmth of a mediterranean spring she remained in the back of my mind wherever i went whatever i saw until i returned to my little house in hampstead to dig out my old notes then i went to visit mr whitely london chapter when i became involved in the life and death of john william stone first and last baron ravenscliff i was working as a journalist you note i do not say i was a journalist merely working as one it is one of the betterkept secrets of the trade that you have to be quite serious if you wish to have any success you spend long hours hanging around in pubs waiting for something to happen and when it does it is often of no great interest i specialised in court cases and so lived my life around the old bailey eating with my fellows dozing with them during boring testimony drinking with them as we awaited a verdict then running back to the office to knock out some deathless prose murders were the best railway trunk murderer to hang ealing strangler begs for mercy they all had nicknames the good ones anyway i made up many of them myself i had a sort of facility for a snappy phrase i even did what no other reporter did which was occasionally to investigate a case myself i spent a portion of my papers money on policemen who were as susceptible then to a small inducement a drink a meal a present for their children as they are now i became adept at understanding how the police and murderers worked far too good at it in the eyes of my grander colleagues who thought me squalid in my defence i can say that it was an interest shared with much of the newspaperbuying public who loved nothing more than a good garrotting to read about the best thing was a beautiful young woman done to death in a particularly horrible way always a crowd pleaser that and it was because of this small expertise of mine that i came across lord ravenscliff or his widow from whom i received a letter one fine april morning asking me to come and see her this was about a fortnight after he died although that event had rather passed me by at the time anyone know anything about lady elizabeth ravenscliff i asked in the duck where i was breakfasting on a pint of beer and a sausage roll it was fairly empty that morning there had not been a decent trial for weeks and none in the offing either even the judges were complaining that the criminal classes seemed to have lost their appetite for work my enquiry was met with a communal grunt that signified a total lack of interest elizabeth lady ravenscliff do get it right it was george short who replied an old man who was the very definition of a hack he could turn his hand to anything and was a better reporter blind drunk than any of his fellows including me sober give him some information and he would write it up and if you didnt give him some information he would make it up so perfectly the result was better than the truth which is in fact another rule of journalism fiction is generally better than reality is usually more trustworthy and always more believable george who dressed so appallingly that he was once arrested for vagrancy put down his pint his fourth that morning and it was only ten oclock and wiped his stubbly chin like the aristocracy you can tell a reporters status by his clothes and manners the worse they are the higher up they are as only the lowly have to make a good impression george had to impress no one everyone knew him from judges down to the criminals themselves and all called him george and most would stand him a drink at that stage i was more than a beginner but less than an old hand i had abandoned my dark suit and was now affecting tweeds and a pipe aiming at the literary raffish look which i thought quite suited me few agreed with my opinion but i felt rather splendid when i looked at myself in the mirror of a morning very well elizabeth lady ravenscliff then who is she i replied the wife of lord ravenscliff widow rather and he was a baron said george who sometimes took the rule about giving all relevant information a little too far given a peerage in as i recall i dont know why he probably bought it like they all do john stone was his name money man of some sort fell out of a window a couple of weeks back only an accident unfortunately what sort of money man how should i know he had money whats it to you anyway i handed him the letter george tapped his pipe on the heel of his shoe and sniffed loudly not very informative he replied handing it back cant be for your looks or your talent or your dress sense or your wit and charm maybe she needs a gardener i made a face at him are you going to go of course dont expect much and be on your guard these people take a lot and give nothing back it was the nearest i ever heard him come to a political opinion chapter i presented myself the next day at the address in st jamess square an impressive town house of the sort occupied by the wealthy merchant and financial classes although these were gradually moving out to leafier parts of town i had found out all but nothing about lady ravenscliff herself so filled the gap with imaginings a dowager in her late sixties dressed in the high fashion of thirty years ago when she was young and i was prepared to bet tolerably pretty an air of geraniums about her my grandmother used to grow them and the particular heavy smell of the plant has always been associated in my mind with respectable old age or perhaps not perhaps a little blowsy and crude north country made good still socially insecure a chip on her shoulder from having wealth but little position to go with it my thoughts were interrupted when i was ushered in to meet a woman i took to be a daughter or a companion i guessed her age to be about forty or so while ravenscliff had been nearly seventy when he died good afternoon i said my name is matthew braddock i have an appointment with your mother perhaps she smiled in a vaguely perplexed way i very much hope not mr braddock she replied unless you are in contact with the spirit world you can have no rendezvous with her i received a letter from lady ravenscliff i began i am she she said in a soft voice and i will take your confusion as a compliment a slightly fumbled one perhaps but appreciated nonetheless she had enjoyed the little exchange i could see her eyes dancing in her otherwise expressionless face as though she was grateful for the first amusement she had had for many days she was dressed in mourning but made the black attire seem alluring she was wearing what was then called a lampshade dress with a jacket that fitted close around the neck and a simple necklace of very large grey pearls which stood out against the black velvet of the clothes i knew next to nothing of such things only enough to realise that the clothes were the latest in what women considered fashionable certainly even to an amateur like me the general impression was all very striking and only the colour suggested anything like mourning i sat down nobody likes appearing to be a fool and i had not made a very good start the fact that she was quite pleased with the way things were going did not help only later very much later did i consider that my inept beginnings might have had something to do with the lady herself for she was beautiful although if you considered her face there was no obvious reason to think so it was not what you might call conventionally handsome in fact you might have almost concluded she was slightly odd looking there was a distinct asymmetry to her features her nose and mouth too big her eyebrows too dark but she was beautiful because she thought she was so and so dressed and sat and moved in a fashion which elicited the appropriate response from those who saw her i did not consciously notice this at the time but it must have had some effect on me the best thing to do i decided was nothing she had summoned me so it was for her to begin this allowed her to take control of the meeting but that was no more than recognising reality so i arranged myself as best i could and tried hard to conceal my discomfiture i have spent much time recently reading the newspapers mr braddock she began what i am told are your innumerable contributions i am gratified your ladyship it was not for your literary talent although i have no doubt you are skilled in your chosen occupation it is because i have need of someone with an ability to amass information and study it dispassionately you seem to be just such a person thank you unfortunately i also need someone who can be discreet which i believe is not normally a characteristic of reporters we are professional gossips i said cheerful again now i was on to a topic i knew about i am paid to be indiscreet and if you are paid to be discreet oh in that case the sphinx will seem like a chatterbox in comparison she waved her hand and thought a while i had been offered no refreshment of any sort i have a proposition for you how much do you earn at the moment this was an impolite question by the standards of journalism i was paid adequately although i knew that by the standards of lady ravenscliff it was probably a pitiful sum masculine pride does not like to be so easily damaged why do you want to know that i asked cautiously because in order to secure your services i will no doubt have to pay you somewhat more than you receive already i wish to know how much more i grunted well if you must know i am paid a year yes she said sweetly you are i beg your pardon naturally i discovered this for myself i wanted to see whether you would give me an accurate figure or inflate it in the hope of getting more out of me you have made a good start as an honest man and you have made a very poor start as a worthy employer she acknowledged the reproof although without any sign of remorse that is true but you will see in a moment why i am so cautious i am waiting she frowned which did not suit her naturally even complexion and thought for a moment well she said eventually i would like to offer you a job it will pay a year plus any expenses you might incur and continue for seven years no matter how long you take to fulfil the task i will give you this will be an inducement for you to accept the offer and be discreet should you fail in the latter then all payment will be suspended immediately it took a few moments to absorb this it was a phenomenal sum i would easily be able to save a hundred a year and so could look forward to perhaps another four years afterwards without having to worry about money eleven years of blessed security in all what could she possibly want that would justify that sum whatever it was i intended to do it as long as it didnt involve too long a gaol sentence you are aware perhaps that my husband lord ravenscliff died a fortnight ago i nodded it was a terrible accident i still cannot believe it however it happened and i must now live as a widow not for long though i bet i thought to myself as i composed my face into an expression of suitable sympathy please accept my condolences for your loss i said piously she treated the conventional remark with the solemnity it deserved which is to say that she ignored it totally as you no doubt know death is not merely an emotional matter for those who are bereaved the law demands attention as well the police are involved she looked very queerly at me of course not she replied i mean that there is a will to be read estates to be settled bequests to be made oh yes im sorry she paused for a long while after that little exchange perhaps the calm presentation was more difficult for her than it appeared we were married for nearly twenty years mr braddock in that time we were as happy and content as a couple can be i hope you can appreciate that im sure of it i replied wondering what this was all about so you can realise that when i was read his will which gave a substantial legacy to his child i was surprised were you i asked cautiously we had no children ah and so i wish you to discover the identity of this child so that the terms of his will can just a moment i said in a rush holding up my hand the small amount of information shed given me had already generated so many questions that i was having difficulties holding all of them in my head at the same time just a moment i repeated more calmly can we go through this a little more slowly first of all why are you telling me this i mean why me you know nothing about me oh i do you come recommended really by whom by your editor we have known him for some time he said you were a fine ferreter out of other peoples secrets he also told me you could be discreet and incidentally told me how much you are paid there must be someone better than me that is modest of you and do not think i have not considered the matter carefully in fact there are few people capable of performing such a task lawyers occasionally employ such people but none i know of there are investigative agencies but i do not feel inclined to trust someone who does not come personally recommended besides they might well require more information than i can provide i do not know whether this child is alive when he or she was born who the mother was i do not even know in which country it might have been born there is just one sentence in his will and thats it nothing else at all nothing at all what did the will say exactly she paused for a moment and then recited conscious of my failings in so many matters and wishing to make amends for past ills i direct that the sum of be left to my child whom i have never previously acknowledged so you see it is not a small matter she looked at me evenly as she spoke i gaped money wasnt my speciality but i knew a gigantic fortune when i lost track of the noughts dancing in my head thats some failing i commented she replied with a frosty look sorry i wish to honour my husbands will to the letter if it is possible i need to inform this person of the bequest i cannot do that until i know who he or she is you really have no more information she shook her head the will referred to some papers in his safe there were none there at least nothing of any relevance i have looked several times but if your husband conducted an ah i really did not know at all how to manage this conversation even with women of my own social class it would have been impossible to ask directly your husband had a mistress when where who with a lady in the first flush of mourning it was completely beyond my capabilities luckily she decided to help me out i rather wished she hadnt as it made me even more uncomfortable i do not believe my husband was in the habit of taking lovers she said calmly certainly not in the last decade or so before then i know of no one and there is no reason why i should not have known had any such person existed why is that she smiled at me again with a slightly mocking twinkle in her eye you are trying to contain your shock but not doing it very well let me simply say that i never doubted his love for me nor he mine even though he made it perfectly clear to me that i was free to do as i chose do you understand i think so he knew perfectly well that i would accept anything he wished to tell me about and so had no reason to conceal anything from me i see i didnt of course i didnt see at all my morals were and still are those of my class and background that is to say far more strict than those of people like the ravenscliffs it was an early lesson the rich are a good deal tougher than most people i suppose it is why they are rich if you will excuse me for saying so why did he make life so complicated for people he must have known that it was going to be difficult to find this child it may be you will find an answer to that in your enquiries she would never have made much of a living as a saleswoman in a department store so it was perhaps as well that she was wealthy still it would be an intriguing problem and best of all i got paid whatever the result a year was a powerful incentive i was getting increasingly illhumoured about the succession of bachelor lodging houses i had lived in for the past few years i wasnt entirely certain whether i wanted domesticity and stability wife dog house in the country or whether i wanted to flee abroad and ride arabian stallions across the desert and sleep by flickering campfires at night either would do as long as i could get away from the smell of boiled vegetables and furniture polish that hit me full in the face every time i returned home at night i was bored and the presence of this beautiful woman with her extraordinary request and air of unfathomable wealth stirred up feelings i had long ignored i wanted to do something different from hanging around the law courts and the pubs this task she was offering me and the money that went with it were the only things likely to show up that could change my circumstances you have become very thoughtful mr braddock i was wondering how i would go about this task if i decide to accept your offer you have decided to accept it she said gravely from many people there would have been a tone of contempt in the statement she on the other hand managed to say it in a serene almost friendly tone that was quite disarming i suppose i have not without misgivings though im sure those will pass i need first of all to discover everything i can about your husbands life i will need to talk to his lawyer about the will i dont know have you looked through his correspondence she shook her head tears suddenly welling up into her eyes i cant face it yet she said im sorry i thought she was apologising for her laziness then realised it was for the display of weakness she was showing me quite right people like her werent supposed to get emotional about a little thing like a husband dying should i have taken out a handkerchief and helped to dab her eyes i would have enjoyed it it would have required me to go and sit by her on the sofa bring strength to her frailty i changed the subject instead and pretended i hadnt noticed i imagine i will have to ensure that no one knows why i am asking these questions i said in a louder voice than necessary i do not wish to cause you embarrassment it would cause me no embarrassment she replied the absurdity of the idea bringing her back to her senses but i suppose a general knowledge of your task might generate false claimants i have already told a few people your editor included that i am thinking of commissioning a biography it is the sentimental thing that a woman with much grief and money might do and as i am a reporter i said cheerful once more to find myself back on home territory i can ask indiscreet questions and seem merely as though i am fired by a love of the squalid and vulgar precisely you will fit the part very well im sure now i have made an appointment for you with mr joseph bartoli my husbands general manager he has drawn up a contract for you and you i think you should come and see me every week to report progress all lord ravenscliffs private correspondence is here and you will have to read it as well i imagine you may ask any questions you have then although i do intend to travel to france in the near future much as i loved my husband and miss him the conventions on mourning in this country i find very oppressive but i know i would shock and scandalise if i acted inappropriately so i must seek a little relief elsewhere you are not english another smile my goodness if that is how quick you are we are not going to make much progress no i am not english i am hungarian by origin although i lived in france until i married you have not the slightest trace of any foreign accent i said feeling a little ruffled thank you i have been in england for a long time and i have never found languages difficult manners are a different matter though those are more difficult to learn she stood and shook my hand as i prepared to leave she wore a soft utterly feminine perfume which complemented perfectly the black clothes she wore her large grey eyes held mine as she said goodbye a drink either to celebrate or to recover i wasnt sure but i certainly needed assistance to think about the wave of change that had just swept over my life in about fortyfive minutes i had changed from being a jobbing reporter on a year to someone earning nearly three times as much and able to do pretty much as i pleased if that did not call for a celebration i do not know what would and there is a decent pub in apple tree yard just round the corner from st jamess square which caters for the servants who work in the big houses and the suppliers who keep those inhabitants in the style they require two drinks later i was beginning to feel fairly grand i would take a house buy some new clothes a decent pair of shoes a new hat eat in hotel restaurants take a cab every now and then life would be very fine and i could do my appointed task with as much diligence as i chose lady ravenscliff it appeared was still in shock over the loss of her husband and the discovery of his secret life she had depended on him and looked up to him not surprising that she was now throwing his money around why investigate at all i wouldnt have done if her husband hadnt troubled to find out who his wretched child was why should his widow it seemed to me like inflicting quite unnecessary selfpunishment but what did i know about the mentality of widows maybe it was just curiosity being childless herself to discover what a child of her husband would be like maybe she wanted to find out something about the woman who had succeeded where she had failed chapter the offices of ravenscliffs general manager were in the city at moorgate an anonymous street of five and sixstorey buildings all erected for commercial use in the past half century there was nothing remarkable about the street or the people in it the usual bustle of traders and agents of young men with spotty faces top hats illfitting suits and shirts with stiff collars it was a street of insurance brokers and stockbrokers and grain traders and metal dealers those who imported and exported sold before they bought and contrived to keep themselves and the empire at whose centre they were in liquid funds i had never liked it very much this part of town the city absorbs bright youths and knocks the spirit out of them it has to it is the inevitable result of poring over figures eleven hours a day six days a week in chilly offices where no talking is allowed and frivolity is punishable by dismissal the stock exchange is different i was passing through once when some jobbers decided to set fire to the coattails of a grandee who was billowing plumes of smoke for several minutes before he noticed fights with bread rolls arcing over the trading floor are a daily event american funds assaulting foreign railways they work hideous hours for low pay and lose their jobs easily even though they make their masters much money it is not surprising that they have a tendency towards the infantile for that is how they are treated in the pubs and taverns of the city i had made many good friends amongst the jobbers and brokers but among the bankers few if any they are different they see themselves as gentlemen not an accusation that could ever be hurled at a stockbroker i did not know what to expect of mr joseph bartoli this is not surprising as he filled an unusual position although the evolution of capitalism will throw up more of his type as industry becomes more complex ravenscliff i later learned had so many fingers in so many pies that it was difficult for him to keep track of them nor could he involve himself in daytoday operations as a mine owner or steel founder might be expected to do for this he had managers in each enterprise mr bartoli oversaw the managers and informed ravenscliff how each business was developing the offices he occupied above a ships chandler were modest enough one room for himself one for clerks of whom there were about a dozen and one room for ranks of files and records but he was so large that the room he had taken as his own was nearly filled by his presence the little space left over was inhabited by a strange pixielike character with bright eyes and a pointed goatee beard somewhere in his forties medium height slender wearing a brown suit and carrying a pair of bright yellow leather gloves in one hand he said almost nothing all the time i was there and we were not introduced rather he sat on a seat in a corner reading a file only occasionally looking up and smiling sympathetically at me i wished i had been dealing with him rather than with bartoli he seemed a much more agreeable fellow in contrast bartoli wore an orthodox black suit but kept on scratching himself and running his finger around his collar as though it irked him his vast belly fitted behind the desk with difficulty and his red face and whiskers reminded me greatly of many of the regulars i often saw ranged alongside the bars of nearby pubs his voice was loud and heavily accented although it took me some time to realise what the accent was manchesteritalian i decided after a while sit down he said gesturing at an uncomfortable chair on the other side of the desk youll be burdock braddock i replied mr yes yes sit down he had the gestures of the foreigner extravagant and excessive the sort of mannerisms which an englishman distrusts i took against bartoli instantly and i must admit against ravenscliff for putting such a man in a position to give orders i was a great patriot then i do not know whether i say so in pride or in sorrow he looked at me piercingly as though sizing me up for some appointment and finding me wanting i do not approve of what lady ravenscliff has decided to do he said eventually i should tell you this frankly as you might as well know now that you will get little encouragement from me what do you think she has asked me to do i asked wondering whether he knew of the will the biography of lord ravenscliff he said yes well as you please but i cannot see what your objection is he snorted you are a journalist yes what do you know of business all but nothing thats what i thought ravenscliff was a businessman perhaps the greatest this country has ever known to understand him you have to understand business industry finance do you no and until yesterday morning id never even heard of him all i can say is that lady ravenscliff has asked me to do this job i did not solicit it if you want to know why she chose me you must ask her like you i could think of many people better able to do justice to the subject but that was her decision and she offered such terms that i would have been mad to refuse perhaps i will do poorly certainly i will unless i have the cooperation of those who knew him he grunted and pulled a folder from his desk at least i had not puffed myself up and claimed an expertise i did not possess the payment is absurd he commented i quite agree but if someone offers you a higher price than you anticipated for one of your products do you bargain them down he tossed it over sign then he said i think i should read it first you wont find anything unexpected you are to write a biography of lord ravenscliff and will submit the finished manuscript to her ladyship for approval you are forbidden to discuss anything which might be relevant to any of the companies listed in the appendix expenses will be paid at my discretion i had never come across a contract with an appendix before nor one so big but then i had never been paid so much either how do i get paid i asked as i read more for forms sake than anything else he had summed the contents up admirably i will send a cheque to your address every week i do not have a bank account then youd better get one i felt like asking him where do i start but knew that his already low opinion of me would fall even further the paper paid me weekly in a brown envelope by the time i had paid bed and board what was left over usually remained although only for a short while in my pocket until it was handed over to publicans or music hall owners i had thought when i arrived at the office that bartoli would give me all the information i needed on ravenscliffs business but in fact he told me nothing he would answer questions but first of all i would have to know what to ask i would need to make specific requests before he would let me see any papers and even then such was the hint he might prove uncooperative in that case i said cheerfully i would like to know if it is possible everywhere he went when throughout his career are you mad no i also want a list of everybody he knew or met bartoli looked at me lord ravenscliff must have encountered tens of thousands of people he travelled incessantly throughout europe the empire and to the americas look i said patiently i am meant to write a biography which people will want to read i am going to need personal details how did he start who were his friends and family what is it like travelling around the world this is the sort of thing people are interested in not how much money he made in one year or the next no one cares about that he annoyed me he treated me with neither seriousness nor consideration i have never liked being treated like that my colleagues believe i am overly sensitive to slights real or imagined perhaps so but it is a tendency which has served me well over the years dislike and resentment are great stimulants bartoli had converted me from someone who thought solely about the amount of money he was paid into someone who would have been determined to do the job properly even if he hadnt been paid at all chapter i emerged from the office thinking it was time to start work and there was one obvious place to begin seyd co was by the standards of the city of london a venerable institution it had begun near half a century before to report on the creditworthiness of traders wishing to borrow money from banks and its investigations had gradually come to cover all aspects of finance the more complex business became the more obscure the origins of merchants the greater the possibilities for duplicity and deception and the more opportunities for companies like seyds to make money by shining light into the murkier recesses of mans greed for the most part and officially their business was to produce guides the birmingham commercial list california and its resources all of which had to be bought by importers and exporters dealers and merchants to avoid imposition by scoundrels but very quietly and discreetly they did much more than that by its nature the city was full of rogues and thieves but thieves have their codes of honour and seyds winkled out those who did not follow the rules those who claimed financial backers who did not exist who forgot to mention convictions for fraud in faroff countries who mentioned their assets but not their debts whose word in other words was not their bond once upon a time a company like seyd was not necessary for the city of money was a small place and everyone knew their clients life was simple when bankers only accepted people they had dined with they dealt with gentlemen and there was nothing easier to know about than the extent of a gentlemans estate or the solvency of his family now it is a gibbering babel of unknowns is a man a penniless scoundrel or really one of the richest men in the habsburg empire does he really have a lucrative contract in buenos aires or in reality should he be in gaol for having run from his creditors how can one tell dissimulation is the first trick of banker and conman alike seyds discovered the truth not always and not perfectly but better than anyone else i knew because i had on occasion done some work for them i had been approached a few years previously to discover something of a man who was setting up as a company promoter in the north of england he claimed to be able to bring seven cotton producers together to combine into one larger unit that could then be offered for sale all he needed was some capital i had to take a day off work to travel north but i got the truth out soon enough ernest mason left the country a day before he could be arrested for fraud but only because i tipped him off he offered me money in return but my conscience rebelled at being paid thrice for the same work once by my newspaper as i wrote up the story of the fraudulent promotions once by seyd who paid me for my report and once by mason but undoubtedly many in the companys employ do so profit from their knowledge and do worse there is good money to be had in the city of london for those who really want it wilf cornford was too lazy ever to become rich had he possessed easy wealth by inheritance he would have been a scientist working out the various species and subspecies of the insect world instead he catalogued the character and follies of homo economicus it was his duty and his pleasure and he was one of the few men i have ever met who could be considered truly happy he could have been a power in the land for all would have been afraid of him had they truly appreciated how much he knew but he could not be bothered and so he told me once it would spoil his observations all those people who gave him such an interesting time with their activities would begin to behave differently if they knew they were being watched it was he who first had the idea of hiring me for the occasional bit of investigation down in the police courts and payment was occasionally some money and more often a useful tip about a forthcoming arrest or scandal which his network of blabbermouths had passed on to him on several occasions he had suggested i come to work for seyds properly but i had never taken him up i liked a more varied diet matthew he said in his even fashion when i knocked on his door and was admitted nice to see you again we havent seen you here for a long time wilfs way of speaking was as anonymous as his appearance he was a portly fellow in his fifties but not excessively so he spoke with a measured neutrality neither sounding like a toff nor yet betraying any trace of his west country origins for his father had been a labourer in dorset and he had been sent as a child to serve in the house of the local gentry there he had somehow learned to read and write and when the family had brought him to london for the season some thirtyfive years ago he had walked out one morning and never gone back he found a job at a tallow chandlers writing up the books for he had a fine script then he moved on to a corn broker then a discount house and finally to seyds i was busy with the mornington crescent trial he wrinkled his nose in disapproval as well he might this had not been a classic in the annals of british crime and the only interesting aspect of the case had been the sheer stupidity of william goulding the murderer who had kept the head of his unfortunate victim in a box under his bed so when the police came calling as they were bound to do for the woman had lived in his house even they could not have failed to notice the smell and the pool of dried blood which had dripped through the floorboards from the bedroom above and stained the parlour carpet goulding had not read the penny press and so was possibly the only person left in england who did not know about the wonders of fingerprints for identifying even headless corpses it was an openandshut case but the trial took place in an otherwise quiet period and the public does love its gore i really dont know how you do your job he said i would find it very dull in comparison to the account books you like to read oh yes they are fascinating if you know how to read them which i dont and that is one of the reasons i am here i was rather hoping you had come to give me information not ask for it do you know of a man called ravenscliff he stared at me for a minute then very uncharacteristically leant back and laughed out loud well he said indulgently yes yes i think i can say i have heard of him i need to find out about him how many years do you have at your disposal he paused and looked rather patronisingly at me you could spend the rest of your life learning about him and still never find out everything where are you starting from how much do you know already very little i know he was rich was some sort of financier and is dead and that his wife wants me to write a biography of him that got his attention really why you i summarised my interview leaving out the truly important bit and threw in for good measure my brief interview with bartoli what a strange choice he said when id finished staring up at the ceiling with a dreamy look in his eye a bit like a cat that had just finished a particularly large bowl of cream im glad you find it so i said rather nettled and if you could tell me what in particular he let out a long sigh its difficult to know where to begin really he said after a while are you really as ignorant as you say pretty much you reporters never cease to amaze me do you never read your own newspaper not if i can help it you should youd find it invaluable and fascinating but i forgot you are a socialist dedicated to eradicating the ruling class and bringing in the new jerusalem i scowled most people live in poverty while the rich grind the faces of the poor yes indeed they do how they grind them though is of great importance and interest know thine enemy young man if you insist on thinking of them as your enemy although as you are now a fully paidup servant of the worst of the grinders or at least his widow i have no doubt your views will have to undergo a certain modification had you been better informed you might have refused the money and thus kept the purity of your soul intact what do you mean the worst of them john stone first baron ravenscliff chairman of the rialto investment trust with holdings in the gosport torpedo company gleesons steel beswick shipyards northcote rifle and machine gun chemical works explosives mines now even an aircraft company although i doubt those will ever amount to much you name it very secretive man when he travelled on the orient express he had his own private coach that no one but he used no one really knows what he owned or controlled not even you not even me we did begin an investigation on behalf of a foreign client about a year ago but stopped why ah well why indeed all i know is that one day i was called in by young seyd the son that is and you know how rarely he ever comes near the place and asked if we were looking at rialto he took the papers and told us not to continue does that often happen never mr seyd junior is not like his father and is not known for his backbone he prefers life in the country saving souls and living off his dividends but hes an amiable enough man and never interferes this was the first and last time so what caused this wilf shrugged i cannot say i dont know that a biography would interest many people except me he went on with a slight sniff of disapproval ravenscliff was money its all he did all he ever did from the standpoint of someone like you obsessed with the tawdry details of humanitys failings he was an utter bore you couldnt even justify a paragraph on him which was why his death was so little reported i suppose he got up in the morning he worked he went to bed as far as i am aware he was a faithful husband was he i asked quickly hoping that my interest wouldnt seem suspicious wilf however put it down to natural squalor yes i fear so he might have owned a brothel and have patronised it on a regular basis of course but it never came to my attention what i mean is that he never had any notable alliances if you get my meaning with people now by people wilf meant the sort of folk he was interested in the rich and the powerful and in this case their wives and daughters shopgirls and women of that sort never came to his attention people had money everyone else was merely scenery he had no time and no interest in anything so frivolous i believe as far as i could discern the companies were collectively highly profitable do you know anything about his companies i shook my head very well then one thing you should keep in the back of your mind is this why were you asked to write about a subject for which you are perfectly unsuited even if you were presented with a full set of accounts for a company you wouldnt even be able to understand them so why you why not someone who stands a chance of doing a decent job that irritated me perhaps lady ravenscliff has a high opinion of my intelligence and ability to learn but for a year why should i care oh you should you should these are tricky people young man the rich believe they are allowed anything and they are right be careful of what you are getting involved in he sounded just like george short normally wilf spoke with the detachment of the scientific observer now he was in earnest you like me i said in astonishment i am touched i see you as a little mouse trying to steal an egg from an eagles nest thinking it is so lucky to have found such a feast he said severely i thought about this for a second then shrugged his warning aside you still havent told me where i might begin that depends he replied on on what i get in return i dont want to be too commercial here but we deal in information and information has a price you know that i thought you liked me not that much i have promised to be absolutely discreet on the matter of ravenscliffs companies its in my contract good for you but since when has discretion involved not telling me things i will make sure nothing is ever traced back to you i cant break my word so swiftly you could promise to break it after a decent interval then you know perfectly well what i mean i do i dont want tittletattle mistresses wild parties lady ravenscliffs lovers she has lovers i would imagine so ravenscliff was hardly a romantic figure and she so i understand is foreign but i have no idea i was merely saying that i am not interested in such things i am interested in money that is all ive noticed that you must tell me why one day if you dont understand it will be pointless to try and explain a bit like trying to explain mozart to someone who is tone deaf but you are so poor yourself i am paid a perfectly decent salary more than enough for my needs that is not the point just because i cannot paint doesnt mean i do not like paintings and before you draw obvious parallels you do not have to admire a painter to admire his works ravenscliff for example was a magician with money i admired his skill and invention that does not mean i admired him personally so tell me wilf shook his head we must have an agreement i hesitated then nodded very well anything that might interest seyd co i might pass onto you but i decide fair enough you wouldnt be able to keep it to yourself anyway you are a reporter and i strongly doubt that you will find out anything thank you for your confidence now tell me about ravenscliff certainly not im very busy today i will provide you with information some information the rest is up to you besides i already told you that our own labours were confiscated then whats the point i prepared a summary of his career and current businesses current as of about a year ago that is i must have forgotten to hand it over to young seyd very forgetful of me i will provide you with names i will listen to your speculations and offer advice and tell you if i think you are going wrong which you will undoubtedly do he levered himself out of his chair and opened a filing cabinet behind him pulled out a file and gave it to me it was only about five pages long is that it i asked incredulously wilf looked offended what did you expect a novel every word counts it is a distillation of years of knowledge our clients are financiers not gentlemen of leisure with nothing better to do than settle down for a good long read how many words do you need to describe one of your trials in any case i sniffed i was expecting a bit more youll survive the disappointment go and read it then if you want my recommendation go and read your own newspaper chapter it was past five when i emerged and a day of glorious weather not the sort of day to be working do not misunderstand me i am a conscientious man i work hard and have no trouble staying up all night or hanging around in the rain for hours when necessary but sometimes the allure of life is irresistible london in all its glory on a spring evening was everything that made work however honest seem very much a secondbest option i loved london and still do i have now travelled to many cities although at that stage in my life i had seen little but have never come across anywhere which even remotely compares with it just looking up and down the street in which seyd co was located provided enough material for a dozen novels the beggar sitting as he always did by the jewellers opposite singing a song which was so execrable people gave him money to keep quiet the delivery boys giggling to themselves over some joke the bearded man in strange clothes walking quietly on the other side keeping close to the wall perhaps he was the richest person in the street perhaps the poorest the old man with a military cast to him dignified and correct a doorman or porter whose best days passed some forty years previously when he breathed the air of india or africa but punctilious with shoes shined and trouser creases pressed like razors the merchants and brokers and agencies and manufactories which could be found down the grimy little alleys and in the courtyards had not yet disgorged their occupants they would stay as the light faded or until the work was done contracts were being drawn up shipments prepared cargoes checked over auctions of goods were under way in the hall over the road which had drawn merchants in furs just as earlier in the day the room had thronged with traders in wax or whale blubber or pig iron the food stalls to feed the office boys and clerks were setting up the smell of sausages and fish was just a faint tang in the air although it would get stronger as the evening wore on the odd pair walking together in conversation one a huge african dark as night the other a paleskinned weedylooking man with blond hair scandinavian at a guess sailors probably their ship docked a mile or so up river after a journey of thousands of miles to deliver its cargo of what tea coffee animals guano ore precious jewels or dirty minerals just one street multiply it by thousands and you have london sprawling over the landscape containing every vice and virtue every language every kindness and cruelty it is incomprehensible unpredictable and strange huge wealth and greater poverty every disease you could imagine and every pleasure it had frightened me when i first arrived it frightens me now it is an unnatural place as far from the garden of eden as you could imagine i had several things to do and most of them needed the duck i had not eaten all day i wanted to read wilfs words of wisdom and i needed to resign from my job the duck offered food a quiet table and sooner or later it would offer the sight of my editor propped up against the bar as he always was before he went in to oversee the production of the next mornings paper robert mcewen was a man of predictable habits at fivethirty in the evening he would travel from camden to the newspapers offices he would walk to the pub and stay for half an hour rarely saying a word to a soul under his arm would be a copy of that mornings paper if he was in a good mood it would remain there untouched if he felt we had been beaten in some particular he would pull the paper out impatiently look at it put it back or rap it on the counter the office kept a boy in the pub especially to watch him hes rapping would come the report and a collective groan would go up he would stump in glowering and sooner or later would lose his temper someone would be shouted at an office boy would be cuffed around the ear a pile of paper would be thrown at someones head then the storm would pass and we could get down to business and mcewen would become as he usually was concentrated moderate reasonable and sensible he could not be one without occasionally being the other and the evening would pass until near three in the morning when he and the paper could be put to bed duty done the world informed the presses rolling the chronicle to robert mcewen was not so much a newspaper it was a mission he considered it a moral force in the world most people including the majority of those who wrote for it thought it was just a newspaper mcewen disagreed he brought all the fervour of the lapsed presbyterian to his task and set about educating the public and damning the powerful in error with all the intensity of john knox castigating sinners the newspaper it should be said was a good one but not noted for its sense of humour not for the chronicle so much as a photograph let alone the nonsense dreamt up by the daily mail the cartoons the competitions or any of the other tricks devised to squeeze a halfpenny from the hands of the reading masses my line of business he considered to verge on the frivolous but crime is essentially a moral tale evil defeated sin punished frequently neither of these events happened and for the most part evil did very nicely indeed but that too could point up a lesson besides mcewen had a weakness for a story and the annals of the bow street magistrates court or the old bailey generated many a good one i had even won his favour or believed i had for he was notorious for never encouraging anyone his emotional range went from towering rage to silence and silence was as near as he got to praise my work generally passed without comment but i had of late been asked to write editorials on the liberal governments policy towards the poor and on its latest measures to combat crime i thus existed in two worlds for journalism is as classconscious as any other part of society reporters are the manual labourers most begin as clerks or office boys or work on provincial papers before coming to london they are trusted with facts but not with their interpretation which is the prerogative of the middle classes the editorial writers whose facility at opinion is assisted by their perfect ignorance of events these grand fellows who like to lard their editorials with quotations from cicero are paid very much more for doing very much less few even consider the idea of spending hours outside a courtroom waiting for a verdict or camping out by a brazier at the dockyard gates to report on a strike it was like a betrayal to go into the leader office they do not even share the same room with us for fear of contamination and sit with pen and paper to enlighten the nation on the deficiencies of the criminal justice bill or complain about rampant drunkenness due to the efforts of brewers to profit by driving the poor ever deeper into despair i enjoyed it though and thought i was quite adept as well although as often as not mcewen would rewrite my efforts so that my words advocated the exact opposite of my real opinions not the policy of the paper he said gruffly when i looked upset the paper supports public drunkenness it assumes that people are sensible enough to look after their own interests you although an advocate of the working classes seem to think they are too stupid to run their own lives write me the same opinion without being condescending to the entire population and i will print it otherwise you will maintain the supremacy of free choice but you dont like choice when it comes to trade he scowled at me that is a matter of the empire he replied and it was this was the papers pole star the one consideration to which all other matters referred which determined all the newspapers policies mcewen was an imperialist a man for whom the defence of empire was the first only and greatest duty he held strongly that we faced two great challenges the envy of germany and the greed of america both would bring the world to ruin rather than permit the continued supremacy of britain across the globe piece by piece his editorials had constructed a coherent policy with which to educate the public and berate the politicians imperial preference in trade to construct a trading block around the world which would develop the dominions canada australia new zealand south africa into equal partners a naval policy which would construct fleets of battleships able to take on germany and any other nation simultaneously a policy to encourage the production of children outright opposition to all welfare for the british population on the grounds that it would diminish the appeal of emigration and divert money from imperial defence this of course brought him into collision with the current government but central to all was germany and particularly kaiser wilhelm whom mcewen saw as a madman determined to foment a war once restrained by loyalty to his greataunt queen victoria since her death this had been replaced by bitter rivalry with king edward great britain must prepare for war and hope we would not be too weakened by the contest to meet the subsequent challenge from the united states the last election had been a severe disappointment all the firepower of the chronicle had been brought to bear on the task of ensuring that the empire was handed over to the wise guidance of the conservatives to no avail they had been decimated in and three years on they had been outmanoeuvred again the liberals had announced a shipbuilding programme for the royal navy without actually placing any orders announced a rise in the oldage pension without actually increasing it announced education reform and so many measures costing so much that no one knew how they would be paid for they had even put up income tax to per cent the prime minister asquith and his chancellor lloyd george could reduce the editorial pages of the chronicle to virtual incoherence as mcewen contemplated the full range of their folly in my opinion the newspaper had become so obsessed that it risked boring its readership to death not that anyone consulted me on the matter curiously my failure to please on the subject of public drunkenness did not mean i was sent back to the reporting room i kept on writing my opinions and mcewen kept on changing them although less and less as i learned how to sneak a radical opinion into an orthodox mould my finest moment perhaps was to convert the paper into a supporter of votes for women which mcewen held to be against the will of the god he no longer believed in in sheer irritation i wrote an intemperate and somewhat frivolous editorial pointing out that it was contradictory to suppose women were going to produce the next generation of imperialists without their having an interest in the empire itself it appeared the next day word for word not so much a comma changed i was certain that some terrible error had occurred that my piece of paper had somehow been accidentally taken down to the printers and published by mistake people had lost their jobs for much less than that but no the next evening he nodded at me and almost smiled why did you run that i asked because you were right he replied and i thank you for correcting me on the matter he never mentioned the subject again except that any trial or demonstration by the suffragists i was now sent to deal with and after a few weeks i realised i would rather spend my time with murderers who were very much more interesting conversationalists besides many of the women had read my editorial considered my arguments unsound and liked to explain at length where i had gone wrong moreover their reputation for moral laxity and free love was entirely undeserved i bought myself a drink and a pie and waited for mcewen to show up largely unable to concentrate on the papers wilf had lent me i was halfway through both when my editor walked in he was the sort of person who was not noticed in a crowd except when he wished to be and yet he was invited everywhere had an entrée into the houses of the great how was this so he never struck me as a fine talker was not notably handsome not well connected through his family it took me years to grasp that mcewen listened when someone talked to him whoever they were they felt he was giving them his full attention it is a rare gift and one i do not possess myself i have a tendency to judge others before they have even opened their mouths mcewen could ferret out the good and the interesting amongst dowagers and dockers alike and persuade them to take him into their confidence and there he was propped up against the bar looking not at all like a man able to exchange witticisms with debutantes or discuss tariff reform with cabinet ministers rather he looked like a newspaperman about to go into battle once again slightly wary preoccupied preparing for the struggle that attended the daily rebirth of a newspaper as it began its great cycle from formless idea to wrapping for fish and chips good evening sir i said he was always referred to in this manner in the world of the newspaper he was lord of us all the fact that he was a mere employee himself answerable to the owners never occurred to any of us in fact no one either knew or particularly cared who the owners were as their presence was never felt braddock it was a greeting no more or less friendly than his usual salutation i was wondering if i could have a word with you sir he took the watch out of his waistcoat and looked at it then nodded i was asked to go and meet a lady ravenscliff today sir taking it i beg your pardon the job commission whatever are you taking it its a very good offer she has made extraordinary i think i have to thank you yes you do good i thought youd go for it might i ask why you suggested me because it is a bit of a waste having you do crime stories good though they are no doubt but i think you need to spread your wings you need to spend some time in the company of those people you dislike so much why do you say that i tried to keep the hurt out of my voice but did not succeed very well you sympathise far too much with the people and lose sight of the facts you write about a murder trial and are so caught up in the circumstances that you are quite capable of omitting the verdict i didnt realise i was so inadequate i said stiffly yes you did he replied simply you know it perfectly well and please dont think i have a low opinion of you youd be a good leader writer will be once you lose the rough edges you mean i didnt go to the right school like those people you do give jobs to i said more loudly than i intended i did not recommend someone like that to lady ravenscliff he said evenly so dont get resentful i imagine she is paying you a fortune and you will gain inestimably from the experience as well on top of that there was something strange about ravenscliffs death and i want to know what you were the best person i could think of to discover it i thought he fell out of a window so he did open window of his study on the second floor he was working alone and his wife was out pacing up and down tripped on a carpet so he hated heights he was terrified of them and deeply embarrassed by the fact he never went near an open window if it was anywhere but on the ground floor and used to insist that all windows were tightly shut and does lady ravenscliff share your worries she never mentioned anything to me he gave me a sidelong look and i realised what he meant you think all i know braddock is that this is a matter of the utmost importance he said it with such intensity that i didnt quite grasp his meaning why because he said quietly ravenscliff owned the chronicle and i dont want it falling into the wrong hands find out for me please what his will said where his assets go who is our new master chapter i walked back to my lodgings something i often did when i needed to think it was more than six miles from the city to chelsea and it took me well over an hour even though i walked at a fast pace all the way the sight of the blackpainted front door gave me none of the pleasure that the prospect of home should give a man it was all that separated me from the boiled cabbage and wax polish the smells that gather in an overoccupied house whose windows have not been opened for a quarter century it was a dingy house in a dingy street in a dingy part of town nearly every second house i believed was occupied by widows who let out rooms to people like me opposite was one that functioned as a school for young ladies turning them into operators of the typewriter so they could push men out of their jobs as copyists and clerks a few houses were owned by shopkeepers or clerks desperately clinging to respectability by their fingertips all of human life from a particular stratum of society could be found in paradise walk behind the grubby windows and cracking stucco paradise walk never was a street more badly misnamed i can only assume that the speculative builder who threw up the illbuilt utterly anonymous houses some halfcentury previously had possessed a strange sense of humour even worse was that my window second floor at the back looked over the grand gardens and opulence of bohemian london successful artists had congregated in tite street parallel to my own but lived in a very different fashion one garden in particular i could see and used to gaze at the two children a boy and a girl dressed in white as they played in the sunshine the lovely woman who was their mother the portly father who was a member of the academy and dream of such an idyllic existence so unlike my own childhood which had contained no sunlight at all not all journalists are editors not all artists are members of the academy john praxiteles brock my fellow lodger was not then a success his torment at having to look out every morning at the proof of unattainable glory in the next street was balanced by his desire to rub shoulders with the famous who might assist him in his career he would come home occasionally bubbling with excitement and pride i said good morning to sargent this morning or henry macalpine was buying a pint of milk in front of me today alas it was rare that either said good morning in return perhaps his desperation frightened them perhaps the fact that his father was a sculptor hence his unfortunate middle name of retrograde opinions and unpleasant temper put them off perhaps they felt that youth has to fight on its own now he is more successful brock gives little encouragement to others either i awoke the next morning with a formidable hunger as i had eaten little and walked much the previous evening so i dressed swiftly and went down to the eating room where mrs morrison prepared breakfast for her boys every morning she was the only reason i stayed in the house and i believe it was the same for the others who lodged with her as a housekeeper she verged on the hopeless as a cook she was very much worse her breakfasts tended towards the obscene and she boiled her vegetables in the evening with such vigour that we were lucky if they were merely yellow when poured onto the plate in a pool of steaming water there to mix with the grey tough meat that she cooked in a fashion so personal that no one could ever really figure out how exactly she had reduced a onceliving animal to such a sorry wreck philip mulready a man who wished to win fame through poetry he later settled for a wealthy heiress instead used on occasion to declaim verses in honour of the poor animal sacrificed on mrs morrisons altar there thou liest unhappy pig so grey so pale and wan although sensitive to our landladys feelings he made sure that she was in the kitchen when calliope touched his forehead with inspiration she might well have missed the irony in any case mrs morrison was a good woman a widow doing her best to survive in a hard world and if the food was vile and the mantelpiece thick with dust she created a jolly warm atmosphere not only that she was prepared to mend our clothes do our washing and leave us alone all she required in return was a moderate rent and a little company now and again a pound a week and some chat was little enough to pay though a journalist now i remembered a former journalist i was not much of a gossip alas unlike brock who delighted in any excuse that kept him away from work mulready was also a conversationalist although he liked to amuse himself by talking in a way so convoluted and on subjects so obscure that the poor woman rarely understood what he was going on about harry franklin was her favourite he worked in the city in some lowly capacity but it was obvious he would not remain in servitude for long he was a serious man the sort any respectable mother would like to call her own every evening he retired to his room to study the mysteries of money he intended to learn his business so thoroughly that no one could deny him the promotion he craved he often returned late working for his employers without charge and all alone so that he could be on top of his job at all times he was an admirable fellow but dare i say it a little dull he was easily shocked by brock and mulready went to church every sunday and spoke rarely at dinner he missed little though and there was more to him than was obvious i could occasionally see a faint shine in his eye as he listened to the exuberance of his fellow lodgers sometimes see the effort that lay behind all that mortification of the soul and discipline of the body and he lived with us in chelsea not in holloway or hackney where most of his sort congregated franklin considered himself a man apart different superior perhaps to his colleagues and was desperate to match reality with his dreams it was not for me to decry his ambition not for me to say that being the general manager of a provincial bank presumably the sort of thing he aimed at i seriously underestimated his ambition there was a poor sort of thing to dream of at night when those in the rooms above and below saw themselves as michelangelo or milton his dream was as powerful as theirs and he pursued it with more determination and ability i need your help i told him as he prepared to leave for work he paused as he put on his bicycle clips it was typical of his general approach to life that he pedalled right across london twice a day because he would not pay the twopence for the omnibus besides an omnibus meant depending on others and risking being late franklin did not like being dependent on others he looked at me cautiously and didnt answer im being serious i assured him i need to learn about money he remained silent can i walk with you a little he nodded and we went out together he was a curious sight mrs morrison had stitched him a large stiff canvas bag to contain his top hat which might have been blown off or become soiled as he cycled and this he tied carefully to the back of his machine then he began to pull on two cloth leggings which he tied around ankle and thigh to protect his trousers and a form of scarf which went around his neck to defend his stiff white collar against the filth of the london streets you do know that you look ridiculous in all that yes he said equably speaking for the first time but my employers are sticklers for appearance many a lad has been sent home without pay for not being properly turned out what do you want to know about money for i thought you disapproved of it franklin had once heard me discoursing on the evils of capitalism but had not seen fit to defend his god against the heresies i spoke have you heard of someone called lord ravenscliff instantly i could see a look of mingled surprise and curiosity pass over his face i have been asked to write his biography but ive been told that his life was money or that money was his life one or the other why on earth would anybody ask you i was getting heartily sick of that question i have no idea i said testily but his widow decided i was the right person and is paying me for the job i will happily pass some of my good fortune on to you if you will allow me to use you as a sort of reference dictionary for anything i do not understand which is nearly everything he considered this very well he said briefly i will happily oblige when i have time i will be free this evening after dinner if you wish to begin then what sort of thing do you want to know everything i mean i know what a share is more or less but thats about it its not as if i have any money myself so its never been of much interest to me just a moment i ran back inside and up to my room grabbed the file from seyds and went back outside to the pavement here i said thrusting it into franklins hand this is meant to be a summary of ravenscliffs business could you tell me what its all about this evening he stuffed it into the bag along with his top hat and his white gloves and pedalled off i went in to confront mrs morrisons bacon and open the post i rarely got letters of any sort so the envelope which awaited me propped up against the toast rack held an obvious interest as it was thick made of heavy cream paper and addressed in a flowery hand london w was the postmark and it evidently fascinated mrs morrison as well as she referred to it as she poured my tea made mention again as she brought me my plate and hovered with excitement as she waited for me to open it i could see no reason to deny her the pleasure so opened it with a flourish using the butter knife as a letter opener it was from a mr theodore xanthos of the ritz hotel who referred to having met me the previous day careful thought suggested this must be the little elf i had encountered in bartolis office he said that as he had known lord ravenscliff for many years he might be of assistance in my work and would be glad to help if he could as he travelled a great deal on business he was not often in london but if i wished to come to his hotel before next friday then he would be most pleased to talk to me that was useful it was pleasant to think that someone wanted to help i tucked the letter in my coat pocket finished my breakfast thanked mrs morrison fervently for the excellent repast and walked out into the cool morning sun chapter until that evening the day passed uneventfully i went to sloane square where i knew there was a bank and asked to open an account the midland and county a joint stock bank i learned as opposed to a private bank these things become important when you study them seemed quite enthusiastic when i mentioned the regular payments of s d that would be credited to my account every week they were not so enthusiastic when i informed them that in fact i had absolutely nothing to give them at that moment but dealt with the disappointment in a manly fashion they gave me a book of cheques with strict instructions not even to think of using one until i had deposited some money i went then to the chelsea library to plunge into the world of money banking joint stock private discount bills of exchange bills on london for forward delivery consols debentures issue at below or above par yield dividend first preference or second preference shares bonds international domestic government or commercial clearly this capitalism was a more sophisticated beast than i had thought i had considered it to be a means of theft that was more or less magical in its operation but slowly realised it had its rules arcane and incomprehensible they might be but rules nonetheless some people at least understood how it all worked and what they could understand i could understand as well this determination was the sole result of my morning in the library that and a headache and the information that mr theodore xanthos was alas only a salesman working for ravenscliffs shipbuilding company a pity i had hoped he would have been more important than that but it seemed he was only a minor figure whose enthusiasm to assist came from a desire for a mention in a book which would never get written anyway i walked down to the worlds end for a sandwich and a pint and returned to easier more familiar matters in the afternoon the death of lord ravenscliff the obituaries journalism things i could grasp standing on my head mcewen said start at the end and work back and it was good advice even without his own particular interest i needed to know and understand the man and a mans death is often very illuminating i summoned the papers the times and the telegraph as well as the financial papers as they always report on their own more fully and read until my eyes popped out of my head and the library closed i learned a little but very far from enough the death first here the newspapers were singularly uninformative lord ravenscliff had been discovered by a passerby lying on the ground outside his house at two in the morning of march he was still alive but had died soon after death was due to head injuries sustained from a fall from a secondfloor window it was believed he had tripped on a carpet he was sixtyeight years old the details were much as his wife and mcewen had related and gave little else besides the similarity between the various reports was striking evidently not a single one of the reporters had written the account himself they all had a common source who must have more or less dictated the report more than that the brief summary of events appeared in all the papers some three days after the death that is on march an unusual delay in reporting the sudden and violent death of a peer even if one of recent creation ordinarily events would have proceeded thus ravenscliff found police summoned police go back to their station to report man on desk informs journalist who comes in for routine enquiries as one does every morning if it is not the stuff of which great scoops are made and this would not have been considered such he informs his colleagues in the pub at about eleven all make whatever enquiries they see fit and the first account appears in the evening the rest the next morning in this case matters went along differently the enquiring journalist was not told of ravenscliffs death either that day or the day after why not i decided that this would be my first enquiry i had to start somewhere and it piqued my interest besides i had seven years i was in no hurry it would give me something to do and would place no great strain on my patience or intellect i looked forward to it for the rest of my time in the library was passed in much less interesting reading only the financial times gave ravenscliff much of an obituary and even there the details were sparse ravenscliff was born john william stone in the son of a vicar in shropshire school university in he had set up the gosport torpedo company then followed a blizzard of complicated dealings that made my head spin gosport torpedo had been bought by beswick shipyard in newcastle which was listed on the stock exchange in beswick then combined with the gleesons steelworks in then bought out the yarnton chemical works then the salford railway factory ironore mines in yorkshire and coal mines near edinburgh then in he had put all his holdings into the rialto investment trust and sold that on the stock exchange as well the result the obituarist told me was an extraordinary construction which could begin by taking dust out of the earth and change it bit by bit into a fully operational and equipped battleship without ever having to purchase a single object from an outside company the entire combine was run with a legendary efficiency so much so that it boasted that it could go from mine to battle on the high seas in less than twelve months even more curious was the phrase among his business interests the obituary dropped a similar hint later on the most publicly known of his financial concerns what was the author leaving out what was he not saying what more was there mcewen had said he owned the chronicle wilf cornford had mentioned hotels and banks is that what they meant as in most obituaries the author said little about the man they rarely do but the reticence here was greater than usual it mentioned that ravenscliff left a wife but did not say when they married it said nothing at all about his life nor where he lived there were not even any of the usual phrases to give a slight hint a natural raconteur loved the sound of his own voice noted for his generosity to friends profligate a formidable enemy a brute a severe but fair employer a slavedriver devoted to the turf never read a book in his life a lifelong bachelor vice a collector of flowers this meant a great womaniser why it came to mean such a thing i do not know more browsing through the times annual index produced other articles of a general sort but i could not face reading them that day i had enough in my notebook at least to present a tolerably intelligent face to franklin that evening and i found the bombardment of names and share prices and capital ratios too bewildering to be contemplated on an empty stomach so i took the bus back down to fleet street where i went into the king and keys for a pickled egg and a drink this was the telegraphs pub and a dingy little hole it was with smelly gas lighting needed even on the brightest day as there were few windows to let in either light or fresh air it stank of sweat tobacco and sour beer why the telegraph liked it i do not know but there is no accounting for the loyalties and tastes of reporters it just happens like that on the positive side ma bell the landlady was fat and amiable always ready to extend credit or even lend money to regulars and kept the place open all day and all night it was for the telegraph what a university common room was for dons or the reform club for liberal grandees a place to call home also i suspect that the squalor of the place was its main attraction rather as some people form an affection for a mangy old cat because it is so revolting and unlovable hozwicki was there as i had hoped not an easy fellow stefan hozwicki but his appeal was his diligence he was unpopular amongst his fellows with a reputation for being somewhat superior this was unwarranted he was merely very antipathetic it was near impossible to like him and few had tried i had made some efforts thinking when he had begun about eighteen months previously that i could show him the ropes as others had done for me hozwicki did not want instruction which he considered patronising and in truth he was a good reporter alas he had never realised that writing good stories is only a small part of the job standing around complaining about editors moaning about this that and the next thing is far more important camaraderie is all by all means keep a scoop to yourself that is expected but do not hoard the unimportant most stories are picked up because a colleague tips you off and expects to be tipped off in turn hozwicki saw all of life as a competition he would never tell anyone anything instead of relying on and contributing to the pool of information offered up in the bar every morning he went round all the police stations on his own if he discovered something others had missed however trivial then he would keep it quiet he was ambitious and was determined to make something of himself no matter what others might think i do not know whether he would ever have achieved his ambitions he died at the front in the victim of his own diligence when others became war reporters he joined up determined to show himself a true englishman despite his name and place of birth which was i believe poland and while his fellows kept their heads down in their trenches he volunteered for nighttime scouting his body was never found he greeted me with little warmth but at least he didnt sidle off down the bar as i approached ive been doing the hill end murder all day he said conversation did not come naturally to him he either spoke to communicate information or he was silent at least it spared me the burden of having to make light conversation in return hozwicki was the only reporter in london who would not be offended by directness did you write about ravenscliff when he died he grunted was i about to point out a mistake offer some supplementary information was an answer to his advantage or disadvantage he could not yet tell yes he said tell me its an old dead story you lose nothing and might gain something in the future his eyes narrowed what whatever i discover have you heard that ive resigned he hadnt i felt a little offended as i say we are a gossipy bunch i didnt flatter myself that my departure would have been high on the list of interesting anecdotes mind but i had expected word to have gone around a little more quickly i have so anything i find which might make a decent story will not be written up by me do you understand he nodded good i want to know why it took three days for ravenscliffs death to appear in the papers because the police didnt tell anyone before then i frowned but why not i imagine the family wanted it that way they do that these people they ask the police the police obey something to ask ravenscliffs widow on our next meeting how do you know this simple in his account he had gone to bow street police station as he always did at halfpast nine in the morning it was his last call of the day he lived in the deepest east end and started with the city police stations at about five working his way west on his bicycle round about the same time as i was heading east to work normally they just turn the duty book round and let me look at the entries then i ask about anything which interests me and they give me a summary simple enough you know the routine i nodded not that morning it was the hairy beetroot on duty it was a good enough description sergeant wilkins weighed considerably over twenty stone and had a complexion that ranged from deep red on his cheeks to purple at the end of his nose even standing up made him wheeze with effort and going out on the beat was so far beyond his abilities that he had long since been confined to the desk by sympathetic colleagues according to the regulations he should have been dismissed as unfit for duty but the police always look after their own wilkins was a sort of saint universally liked even by the criminals whose cases he processed day after day the sort who looked as though each crime was a personal disappointment normally a more helpful and accommodating person could not be found but that day wilkins had refused to let him see the book and merely read off a couple of entries nothing else today he said heartily when a very loud violent singing drunk was dragged in by the feet a few minutes later wilkins had wheezed over to the door to see what was going on and hozwicki had quickly spun the book round to have a look he only had a few seconds but it was enough to st jamess square body found refer to mr henry cort fo refer what hoswicki shrugged henry cort another shrug fo he shrugged again annoying habit so why no story i was curious so i went to the morgue and they confirmed it a body had been brought from the charing cross hospital identified as ravenscliff i went back to the office and started to write it up just a holding story as i was going to get it to the desk then go out and get some more information i also told the editor so he could get the obituary ready and and nothing i went back to st jamess square to start knocking on doors i wrinkled my nose here hozwicki was fond of this sort of vulgarity in reporting his stories but before i could get anywhere one of the runners found me and told me i was wanted back in the office it happens it had happened to me often all newspapers then had their runners a collection of lads who congregated in the main entrance waiting to earn a penny or two carrying messages they were often remarkable boys dirty and cheeky but the best were exceptional and knew london like the backs of their hands they would cross town at amazing speed hanging on to the backs of buses running i even saw one going down oxford street on the roof of a taxi once waving insolently to bystanders so back i went hozwicki continued and was given a dressing down by the day editor i was not to waste my time on the death of someone so stupid that he had fallen out of a window he paused and looked at me i didnt respond so he went on how did he know he had fallen out of a window eh someone had talked to him about it do you know who all i could find out was that a very properlooking man had arrived in the office a couple of hours previously and talked to him for about half an hour even my short account of ravenscliffs death was then removed from the paper and ten minutes after he left the runner was sent off the story was squashed and when it did appear it wasnt written by me who did write it he shook his head not someone who works for the telegraph he said i did ask the editor later but he brushed it aside sometimes you just do as you are told he said but i think he was referring to himself as much as to me i finished my beer and thought about that i was sure that hozwicki was telling me the truth he seemed positively pleased to share his indignation obviously editors are wayward people everyone knows that they drop stories on a whim or to do personal favours or because of the owners it happens all the time but normally you can see why even if you dont approve why sit on a fairly straightforward story wait a minute hozwicki said what do i get in return for this nothing yet i said cheerfully except my thanks he scowled and my promise that when i have something to give in return you will have it think of it as an investment i said it may diminish to nothing it may pay rich rewards in due course i saluted him and left walking up the fugfilled steps into the open air of fleet street so fresh after that dingy basement it made me feel dizzy for a few moments chapter i would have liked to have hopped onto an omnibus and gone straight to st jamess square to ask questions of lady ravenscliff i had quite a few to put to her but it was six oclock and i had an appointment with franklin i was back in chelsea by seven and ready to go franklin unfortunately was a slow and methodical eater normally this did not bother me but that evening the habit drove me to distraction our evening routine was invariable at around seventhirty all four of mrs morrisons boys would assemble in the little dining room dark and gloomy lit only by spluttering gas light and waited while the clank of pans rose to the climax that heralded the arrival of our evening feast conversation varied at these meals sometimes animated sometimes nonexistent occasionally we would dine en grand seigneur and dally over our tea afterwards i could always win an audience by describing the latest murder brock would compete for attention with an account of a meeting with the artists he didnt really know mulready could clear the table by reciting some verse of an experimental hue only franklin said little for no one was really interested in the movements of the markets or the reception of a south american bond issue even though the coupon might have been set substantially below par he spoke a language far more foreign than criminals or artists or poets one which few cared to learn dinner that evening was a mutton chop apiece potatoes and a particular treat brussels sprouts rather than cabbage although it was difficult to tell the difference by the time they were served next there was tapioca pudding which produced a chorus of applause from the artistic types whose childish tastes were perhaps an essential part of their lives the conversation was not animated brock wished to begin a discussion on whether there was going to be a war with germany or not and seemed to think that i as a newspaper man would have a special insight into the thinking of the foreign office on the subject his was not an abstract concern in the fate of nations although as it turned out he was right to be interested for the war was the making of him when it came he became a war artist and what he saw so changed the way he painted that it thrust him to the forefront of the new generation which came to prominence when it finished the bleakness which made him unpalatable in those sunny days before the conflict started was perfectly attuned to the mood that prevailed during it and gave him a clarity that eluded him when he lived with us in chelsea no he had come up with this project for a gigantic portrait of the crowned heads of europe a scheme for which he was so totally unsuited that i did not know whether to wonder at his impudence or at his lack of reality he wished he john praxiteles brock to summon every monarch from tsar nicholas to the kaiser from king edward to the emperor of austria and every last kinglet of scandinavia and the balkans to sit together to be painted by him presumably not in the dining room of paradise walk chelsea it was a scheme so lunatic in conception that naturally we all encouraged him enthusiastically and he spent days doing little sketches using photographs from newspapers in lieu of the real thing it kept him busy and happy and i still dont know whether there was really any grain of seriousness about it i think not for although he was unrealistic he was not totally insane but the project took on a life of its own and everything that happened in the world would be related back to it he became a great supporter of the french monarchists as he did not see how he could fit a republican president into a portrait of kings he profoundly disapproved of russian revolutionaries and was outraged when the king of portugal was assassinated thus robbing him of a subject who had been noted until his unfortunate death for his handsome figure the dream of glory swept over brock like a wave as he contemplated his forthcoming knighthood when the project was shown at the royal academy then he came back to earth as mulready collapsed into gales of giggles the dinner came to its end on rather a poor note brock stumped off mulready began to feel a little guilty and franklin watched impassively eventually we went upstairs to the little sitting room kept for special occasions only it was dark chilly and thoroughly uncomfortable but franklin never allowed anyone into his room he tossed the file from seyds back towards me did you read it of course i did an accomplished summary but little detail so can you explain it all to me while brock and mulready were all gaiety even when discussing weighty matters franklin was all seriousness even in his frivolity he had no sense of humour whatsoever it made him a good employee and a dull though kindly companion at the dinner table he kept strictly to pronouncements of fact on which he could be highly pedantic was the battle of waterloo in june or july of mulready did not even care what year it was in to franklin it became a matter of the utmost importance and if he could not pin it down he would become restless sooner or later he would disappear upstairs to check and reassure himself that the world was still capable of being reduced to numerical order the file of seyds triggered an almighty outburst of this peculiar form of madness in many cases franklin explained it hinted but did not elaborate it asserted but provided no evidence it sketched out but gave no background detail it is incomplete i know i said sorry that i had introduced the poor man to such a source of annoyance but feeling at the same time that if his bloodhoundlike desire to hunt down the detail could be properly harnessed it might prove highly useful could you tell me what its all about i will not set it down word for word that would be intolerable and do little except highlight how little even with his expert tutelage i really understood at that stage ravenscliff he said was a new breed not an industrialist not a banker but a capitalist of the most modern sort here he had lost me he began again in the last few decades companies have sold themselves on the stock exchange people buy shares in them if a company is successful its profits increase more people want the shares so the price rises easy i nodded in the daytoday he went on settling into his stride now the managers of a company let us say a steel factory run the business there is also a board of directors which keeps an eye on the managers on behalf of the shareholders as they own the business the shareholders can tell the management what to do if enough of them agree often there are so many shareholders and they are so scattered they can never agree on anything and this is where ravenscliff saw his opportunity back in the s he realised that you do not have to own a company to control it so in he sold his torpedo company to beswick but rather than being paid in cash beswick gave him shares instead in fact he ended up with nearly a third of the total armed with this he called a meeting which voted that he should become chairman and so it went on through careful experimentation ravenscliff discovered that really he needed no more than about per cent of its shares in order to control an entire company and why should the other shareholders object the companies he ended up controlling performed well they paid their dividends the value of the shares constantly rose and so ravenscliffs power extended well thats very fine everyone is happy then i said not much for me to go on there and although i can see you find all this fascinating it is difficult to see how it is going to be made so for the reader of his biography is that all the report contains i must say i find it all a little disappointing franklin scowled personally i find it remarkable but as you say few are interested fortunately there is a little more for you when he established the gosport torpedo company in he had a great deal of difficulty persuading the royal navy to buy either it would not work which made it useless or it would work all too well which meant that a small dinghy in theory could sink a battleship naturally this made the navy reluctant to support him so he gave the machines to them i thought the idea was to make a profit it is but ravenscliff realised that an order from the royal navy was the best advertisement in the world what it had every other navy wanted before he had delivered a single machine he had gone around the world talking of the british admiraltys confidence in him naturally everyone else determined to have them as well even though the cost was formidable within five years he had armed every enemy and potential enemy we had with the weaponry to sink our fleets what could he do that was his argument he claimed he had been more than happy to give the navy an exclusive right to purchase his machines but they had refused and by the time the navies of the world realised that their ships needed more protection ravenscliff had taken control of gleeson steel which made some of the best armour plating in the world and the beswick shipyard which could turn out brandnew warships and so it went on by every aspect of the production of ships and weapons was under ravenscliffs control his factories produced the engines the ships the guns the shells earlier than most he saw the potential of steam turbines so bought control of a company that explored for and extracted oil in mesopotamia that was very clever of him franklin did not reply do you know what a trust is i considered replying that whatever it was in the world of finance it was likely to be a contradiction in terms but i rested content with shaking my head instead these were invented by the scots some twenty years ago it is a company quoted on the stock exchange except that it doesnt do anything except own shares in other companies now what ravenscliff did was put all his holdings in gleesons gosport beswick and so on into the rialto investment trust and sold shares in it keeping only a controlling stake do you understand the implications of that no i am truly glad that in your daily life you have no contact with money whatsoever he said vehemently you clearly have no instincts for it at all i am quite prepared to admit it i said it is nothing to be proud of very well think of this a quarter stake in the trust means ravenscliff controls it correct if you say so i do and the quarter stake the trust holds in beswick means it controls that correct i nodded so ravenscliff controls beswick with a quarter stake of a quarter stake that is six and one quarter per cent the same goes for another dozen or so companies which make up the main holdings of the trust to put it another way he controls companies capitalised at nearly seventy million pounds with a holding of a little more than four and a quarter million finally i understood although the size of the figures astonished me four and a quarter million was such a vast amount of money it made my head spin seventy million was almost beyond comprehension my landladys house i knew had cost her two hundred pounds so franklin continued your characterisation of ravenscliff as some sort of money man needs to be revised a little he was in fact the most powerful armaments manufacturer in the world and also perhaps the most ingenious financier in the world as well and franklin went on there is the founding mystery of his life which might entertain your readers if you can solve it i brightened up where did the gosport torpedo company come from what do you mean torpedoes are complicated things ravenscliff was a financier not an engineer but all of a sudden he pops up out of nowhere with a fully operational torpedo where did it come from are you going to tell me i havent a clue nor it seems does your man at seyds its a cunning document this it goes on at great length about what it does know which is little and artfully buries what it doesnt which is a great deal its only when you think about it that your realise this document is a confession of ignorance that was the essence of my long conversation with mr franklin who bless him presented all his information in a way which was almost understandable even better he clearly enjoyed it and ended by saying that if i had any more questions i should not hesitate i wouldnt i now had some inkling of how little i knew and how little everyone else knew i wasnt alone but no one else but me had the problem of finding anything out ravenscliffs way of life was intricate and veiled almost deliberately so he had successfully hidden the vastness of his wealth from the world to the point where he scarcely figured in the public mind the thought also occurred to me that if he could do that how easy it would have been for him to hide a child where no one could find it chapter i wasnt really sure why it was considering the task at hand that i devoted myself to trying to understand ravenscliffs manner of business i reckoned it was important to know the sort of man i was dealing with and so far i had learned little only his wife had referred to his character and i assumed her testimony was unreliable he must have had some friends surely someone who knew and understood him while the doings of the rialto investment trust would offer little insight into his passions and emotions they might at least lead to someone who had known him so i hoped anyway the following day i had a quick lunch with a friend who worked as a jobber at the exchange not a grand figure in that world but one who was around all the time and the jobbers bread and cheese depends on knowing even the least wisp of gossip fortunes are made companies rise and fall on catching a muttered comment in a pub or club or tavern before anyone else hears of it the firm which employed leighton was moderately prosperous so i understood and so must do tolerably well in listening not that leighton looked like a man who spent his time closeted in dark rooms listening to idle gossip if there was anyone less obviously suited to the life he led then i have never met him leighton gave the impression of one born to rule an empire or at least explore it it would have been more fitting to come across him a few miles from the source of the nile than the stock exchange he was huge and at one time had been a useful rugger player he had a booming voice incapable of speaking quietly and was inevitably overheard in all that he said he had prodigious energy and once took a bet that he could leave the exchange at six in the evening walk all the way to brighton and back and be at his post in foreign railways at nine the next morning ninety miles in fifteen hours naturally the betting was intense some thousand pounds was wagered on the outcome with andersons leightons firm making the book more or less the whole of the city was there to see him off and a large number cycled alongside him to make sure that there was no cheating even many of these gave up through tiredness or hunger but leighton marched on large red in the face and sweating profusely until the day cooled enough for him to become chilled through the night he walked never stopping for a moment even eating his dinner two bottles of burgundy three pheasant and four dozen oysters as he marched a member of his firm driving an automobile alongside him laden with food which was passed to him as required his return the next morning was rather like a roman triumph no work was done because of the excitement the finances of the empire were neglected until all was over even the rothschilds men emerged from their great palace in new court to be present at the conclusion a frivolity never witnessed before or since he walked up the steps of the exchange with fifteen minutes to spare and was carried shoulder high by his comrades to his place on the floor with firecrackers being let off bottles of champagne popping and the bread rolls flying he had become a legend with a job for life for who could ever dispense with the services of such a fine fellow of such things are careers and reputations made in the city of london such was leighton and as i could be certain that anything i told him would be all around the exchange within five minutes of our conversation finishing i had to be careful about what i said so i told him simply that i had been commissioned to write a biography and that i was completely lost grieving wife wanting a memorial eh he boomed cheerfully why not shes got the money or will have soon enough i cant say that it will be a book ill buy though why not ive never heard an interesting story about the man he came he amassed money he died there ive written it for you i think lady ravenscliff wants a little more than that did you ever meet him once but not to speak to not a very sociable man you understand but even he had to show up to the occasional reception and ball very handsome wife i must say charming woman do you know anything about her hungarian countess i think who knows anything about hungarian countesses i would guess she had not a penny to her name but the name was something rundown old schloss somewhere in the transylvanian mountains are they in hungary who knows who cares you get the picture though what about ravenscliff he pursed his lips perfectly polite but a bit frightening didnt say much always had a look about him as if he wished he wasnt there he rarely showed up to anything at all and would often enough leave as soon as he could his wife has little time for city society either so i gather not much of a figure then oh lord yes he was immensely powerful that was why there was such a panic when he died was there a panic i didnt notice anything well you wouldnt would you because you dont pay attention to these things but there was obviously there was why obviously because the instant reaction when someone like that drops out of a window is to think that maybe he jumped and then you worry that his investments have gone all wobbly so people start selling shares just in case the rialto investment trust i said proudly leighton nodded and the underlying investments what if he had topped himself because rialto was in queer street it has happened before itll happen again so the moment the rumour started spreading people started selling right again but and this is the curious thing they didnt fall much even before the stories were in circulation buyers were coming into the market picking up every share on offer and supporting the price we did a roaring trade on behalf of the consolidated bank in manchester dont know who they were buying for though so if you offer something for sale and no one wants it then you drop the price until you find a taker correct no one will buy shares in a company which might be insolvent so the quoted price can fall through the floor if on the other hand there is a buyer then the price stabilises no panic the owners of the shares are reassured and stop trying to unload them understand i nodded with rialto of course the price has been very low lately why of course same with all the armaments companies he said reflectively no orders the government isnt buying theyve been going through hard times anyway the point is all of a sudden there were buyers all over the place the shares went up can you credit it the question is who was buying somebody knew something but im damned if i could find out what and later cazenove came into the market acting for barings and the funny thing was barings seemed to be trading on their own account what does that mean buying for themselves not for a client so im told the thing is they werent trying to make money they were buying at full price whoever heard of a bank not trying to make money unless they were doing someone a favour this was when exactly when ravenscliff died no i mean what day exactly the day he died or the day the news appeared in the papers there was nothing in the papers that came two days later what would have happened if the news had come out immediately a few hours after he died heavy selling with presumably no buyers primed to intervene collapse in the share price possibly forcing the trust to sell off the shares it owned in other companies leading to a general drop of the market which is not good leighton sighed not really i thought about this it more or less explained the delay in reporting ravenscliffs death gave one possible explanation at any rate keeping the news quiet meant that ravenscliffs friends had time to prepare all very well have you ever heard of a man called henry cort leighton looked puzzled for a moment then shook his head city man i dont know just a name i heard not important i left him ordering another drink and a pork pie and went to think i was accumulating information but so far it didnt add up to much ravenscliff died assorted people of some considerable authority delayed the news becoming generally known stockbrokers intervened to stop a run on ravenscliffs company the foreign office was maybe involved of all the information i had this was the most curious at least that was the only thing i thought fo might mean everything else was the usual sort of thing i believed one might expect from the city i didnt sleep as well as usual that night i felt that i was proceeding in an amateurish haphazard fashion a bit of information here a bit there without having any real sense of what i was doing i was annoyed with myself even though i had only been at work for a few days i felt i should be more organised more businesslike in honour of my subject by the time i finally fell asleep i had resolved to start again at the beginning and go back to question lady ravenscliff more thoroughly she must have known him better than anyone i was aware that i was trying to do several things at once i was officially meant to be writing a biography of a financier i was supposed unofficially to be finding a child and i was also meant even more unofficially to be examining ravenscliffs death to find out what it meant for the chronicle i had to remember to keep in mind which one of these i was meant to be doing at any particular moment the next morning i sent a note to lady ravenscliff requesting an interview another to mr xanthos asking for the same and then took myself off to visit the family solicitor i should have known that ravenscliff would not have had a solicitor of the dickensian type who still existed in those days old clerk brown wooden desks glasses of sherry or port and reassuring conversation surrounded by piles of carefully docketed folders and archival boxes no ravenscliff liked efficiency and dynamism his solicitor matched his tastes mr henderson was a young man for his job perhaps in his midthirties and in my opinion somewhat bumptious the sort who had done well at school never broken any rules been a favourite with his teachers someone who was going to do well in life and who as a result never questioned whether it was worth doing i didnt like him much and he treated me with scant respect in return the sherry decanter was not disturbed in its rest by my presence still i was the representative of his most valuable client trying to do something which he was incapable of doing on his own he formed trusts and conveyed things finding illegitimate children was quite outside his range as our conversation progressed i occasionally even felt a slight sense of unseemly interest as though some long dormant imp buried deep in his wellrun life was stirring a little perhaps he had really wanted to flick an ink pellet at a teacher but had never dared you know that for public purposes i am supposed to be writing a biography he nodded and you are also aware of the real reason for my presence he nodded again in that case i can dispense with all the subtleties what do you know of this business he sighed in the manner of a man who prefers questions that require a yes or no answer very little more than is contained in the will that there existed a child that money was to be left to it and that material identifying that child was to be found in his safe at home which is not in fact to be found so it would seem it makes the life of the executors of the will very difficult why because the estate cannot be easily settled until all claims on it are resolved and that cannot be done while the matter of this child is extant so the estate will remain in limbo until it is cleared up one way or the other do you know what it was this material wouldnt it have been wise to leave it with you as it turned out it would have been very much wiser he said evenly i can only surmise that lord ravenscliff had a good reason for his decision what sort of good reason the obvious one would be that when he made the will he had not yet finished accumulating the material and wished to add to it tell me how the will was made he came here he came here and said that he thought it best to make his will he had realised he was not going to live for ever although to be truthful that was difficult to believe he was in exceptional health or appeared to be his father lived until he was ninety he had not made a will before then is that usual for men of fortune quite unusual yes but men like lord ravenscliff do not like to contemplate their mortality he had given us a rudimentary testament just enough to ensure he did not die intestate in case of an accident in that all his possessions passed to his wife this was a more complicated and complete version the details the bulk of his estate passed to his wife there were legacies to other family members servants and to his old college generous bequests i might say a legacy to a mrs esther vincotti of venice six months later he returned to add a codicil concerning this child and when he mentioned that you didnt ask for details that is hardly my role did he say anything about it no he simply dictated his wishes you werent curious henderson looked vaguely affronted at the suggestion many of my clients are wealthy men and many have discreditable secrets in their lives it is my job to look after their legal affairs not their spiritual wellbeing so you are no wiser than anyone else he inclined his head to indicate that incredible though it might seem that was the case and he said nothing about this material identifying the child no what is your opinion are you allowed one it didnt even make him cross yes i think i can have an opinion on that he replied i believe that whatever it is it was to be found in his desk and that someone removed it shortly after his surprising and unforeseen death but i will make no further comment he didnt need to of course the other legacies what about them i know nothing of either of them although naturally i have corresponded with the executor a michael cardano since the death whos he he used to work for rothschilds i believe more than that i do not know and he is capable of running a company i do not know but he doesnt have to the duties of an executor are very different he is the son of an old associate of lord ravenscliffs the father was ruined in and died in gaol i see tell me about this italian woman we have sent mrs vincotti a telegram she is due to arrive in london on wednesday at least i hope she is why does it matter oh good heavens yes especially with such sums as are involved in this case naturally we have to make sure that this is the woman that lord ravenscliff intended otherwise we would not be able to make the settlement that would introduce another complication and we would have to look for two people rather than only one how so his affairs cannot be settled until all the beneficiaries are contacted so we can ensure that it contains enough for each to receive their proper due for example suppose someone dies and leaves to one person and the same to another but there is only pounds in the estate what do we do obviously if one of those people is dead there is enough for the other person to receive the full amount if both are alive then there is not that is when matters become complicated so this child must be found if the estate is to be wound up swiftly lord ravenscliff left his wife a fixed amount and a life interest in the residue which devolves on various others on her death whether the legacy to the child is paid out is consequently a matter which affects all the other bequests so what is lady ravenscliffs financial position at the moment she is dependent on the goodwill of the executor and his willingness to make her an allowance out of the estate which he in effect controls did lord ravenscliff realise this im afraid i dont understand what i mean is why would ravenscliff have made his will in such a way that there was a possibility his wife would be left in such a situation did you tell him that there was such a possibility i advised him of all the consequences yes and he went ahead what conclusions do you draw from that that he considered it the best way of organising his affairs no i mean why did he consider i know what you mean but while lord ravenscliff communicated his wishes he did not tell me the reasoning that lay behind them and did you ever try to guess the obvious conclusion is that he thought that there would be no loose ends and do you think this mrs vincotti might be the childs mother that i could not say did lord ravenscliff make any regular payments to people when he was alive not employees or anyone like that of course to individuals with no known connection to his business henderson considered not using my services he may have made separate arrangements of course i see now the rialto investment trust what is the state of that at the moment and of his companies as you may know ravenscliff controlled a large number of companies through rialto and his holding in rialto has passed for the time being into the hands of the executor michael cardano precisely so what happens there i mean if the estate is not wound up in the daytoday the companies are run by expert management and need no external guidance but i imagine that the other shareholders will get together to protect their interests specifically they may decide to reassure themselves that it is healthy naturally the circumstances of his lordships death produces questions quite is there any suggestion of that i am a family solicitor mr braddock you would have to ask others however from my limited experience of such matters i would find it remarkable if there was not a move on the part of shareholders to do precisely that i see but they would find nothing untoward would they i mean there is no suggestion seek and ye shall find he said with the faintest glimmer of a smile no indvidual i have ever dealt with has been devoid of secrets i doubt there is any company unencumbered by them either but i know of nothing specific if that is your meaning one more question all of ravenscliffs businesses are in a sort of limbo is that right yes including the chronicle of course the executor will decide whether it goes to lady ravenscliff or whether it needs to be sold to raise the cash necessary for the bequests naturally that will not be clear until we know how many bequests are to be made mcewen would not be happy to hear that i thought so let me get this clear lord ravenscliff made his will about eighteen months ago and there was no mention of a child that bit was added six months later yes henderson nodded why he must have known this child existed why not put it in when he made his will originally i do not know and that was that with mr henderson i took the the paltry gleanings he had given me and went for lunch i needed a beer and a steak pie before visiting lady ravenscliff once more chapter i was apprehensive as i was conducted into a little sitting room in st jamess square a different room more cosy and intimate than the grand salon where we had met last time a fire burned in the grate making it pleasantly warm and suffused with a smell of apple wood on the mantelpiece there were trinkets of all sorts mirrors pieces of framed needlework little statues in bronze a handsome blue porcelain bowl the walls were lined with books evidently ravenscliff was a great reader and an accomplished one these were not there for decorative purposes as you see sometimes in great houses these books were to be read had been read in fact novels in french and english and german and italian works of history and philosophy medical journals books of travel the classics in translation and the original languages dictionaries and reference books i knew many of the english titles and had heard of some of the others zola tolstoy darwin mill marx i noted with curiosity know thine enemy books on sociology and psychology even a few on criminology it was an impressive range lucky the man with the leisure and energy to read them all ravenscliff of course was not a man of leisure curious it made me feel a little selfconscious about how much time i spent in pubs and on the far wall two paintings the larger a portrait of lady ravenscliff painted some twenty years ago i guessed i could see the appeal she was one of those people painters must love her left shoulder was facing the viewer and her head was turned so it faced out of the canvas she wore a golden red dress which showed off her long elegant neck there was no jewellery of any sort she did not need any her face and hair were quite enough she had been and still was a lovely woman henner came a soft voice behind me i turned lady ravenscliff was standing at the door with a faint smile on her face pardon jeanjacques henner he died a few years ago and i suppose his fame has faded but he was one of the finest portraitists of his generation thats me in before i grew old and wrinkled you are hardly that i muttered i really didnt feel like paying compliments in fact i never did and i had had little practice and this is john she pointed to the smaller portrait tucked away in a corner of the room he hated having his portrait taken he only consented because i demanded it as a birthday present he grumbled incessantly and would only have this little thing done its so tiny you can barely see him i looked so that was lord ravenscliff i peered intently but it gave me no clues he seemed nothing remarkable there was no look of bestriding arrogance or pride no hint of cruelty or kindness it was just a face that of a perfectly prosperous gentleman looking calmly out with only a hint of weariness about having to waste his time to placate a demanding wife he looked almost agreeable may i say im surprised he found the time to read so much i said as i gestured at the shelves i thought these men of business worked all the time he liked reading she said with a smile at my condescension but this is my room johns is upstairs he preferred less wellupholstered surroundings he did not like to get too comfortable when he was working ah thats right i can read i didnt mean yes you did she said brightly i blushed it doesnt matter in this country it is quite usual for women of my position to regard reading a book as somehow inelegant however you must remember that i used to live in france where it is not considered wholly inappropriate but i have loved reading all my life we must talk more about this some time i always think it important to know what a man reads tell me what do you think of this she picked up the blue bowl and handed it to me casually what was i to say it was a blue bowl with patterns on blue ones i shrugged she put it back well i said i hope a little coldly you wished to take your revenge by revealing my ignorance and you have succeeded you might as well enlighten me oh it is nothing of importance she replied and you are right that was offensive i apologise shall we begin again very well so tell me have you made any progress since we last met a little i have talked to a few people and done some background reading but i have to say that i have questions which must be answered before i proceed any further i did not like this the meeting had not got off to a good start dear me she said with a smile that does sound serious it is well go on she prompted as i lapsed into silence i had never done anything like this before and i wasnt quite sure how i should phrase the questions thinking of what to say and actually saying it now she was standing in front of me were very different mr braddock are you going to say something or just stare at me all afternoon its difficult to know where to begin at the beginning dont make fun of me what i need to know is whether you are being honest with me all the evidence suggests you are not and what she said definitely cooler now have i said or done to make you think such a thing were i a reporter once more i would leap to one obvious conclusion i said feeling better now that i had got under way your husband dies and you instantly go to his desk remove whatever evidence there is about the identity of this child and hide or destroy it then you call me in to look for something you know cannot be found so that you can appear to be a dutiful and obedient widow carrying out her husbands wishes in due course all the money which should have gone to this child comes to you she looked evenly at me in that case you are a very bad reporter someone with a flair for a story would also have considered the possibility that i discovered one way or another something about the provision in his will that i was so overcome with jealousy that i not only did as you say i also pushed my husband out of the window was she angry or distressed she held her jaw so tightly that i knew it was one or the other but her selfcontrol was so great it defeated any attempt to penetrate further i have considered that possibility i replied i see so are you here to tell me you do not wish to continue in my employ or are you trying to discover a way of keeping the money even though it comes from a murderess she was quite calm as she spoke which convinced me that she was furious with me so furious that i doubted whether it was going to be my choice i am trying to discover what happened which is the job you gave me part of it anyway i must say that i do not really think you are a murderess but i need to get circumstances clear in my mind you ask me to find this child and the task would be easily accomplished if the evidence was where your husband said it was someone moved it it might help considerably if i knew who so ask she had not forgiven me nor entirely resumed her pose of calm but i could see my remarks had mollified her a little did you move it no do you believe me who did move it i dont know who could have moved it i dont know that either or rather i could give you a list of people who have been in the house long enough to occupy you for months i imagine it would have been in the large drawer which contains a strongbox it would have been locked only my husband had a key forgive me for asking but could i see this desk by all means she stood up and walked to the door she was not the sort of woman whose clothes needed smoothing down however long she had been sitting they simply fell into place that was expensive couture i guessed or maybe she was simply one of those people who was like that my own clothes looked rumpled even when they were fresh back from the laundry was your husband disturbed or preoccupied at all in his last few weeks or months i asked as we walked up the stairs i walked beside her out of modesty as the sight of her from behind was too enticing to be polite perhaps he had been different more distant for some time before his death and in the last few days he was very preoccupied in what way i could see something in his eyes worry i think it was a premonition about his death yes the human mind is a strange and complex thing mr braddock sometimes it can see the future without realising it did you ask what concerned him i said steering the conversation away from this topic as fast as was seemly of course but he simply said there was nothing which i should worry about that all would be well i never doubted it until he reassured me but you have no idea none i assume it was something to do with his business affairs because i can discover no other possible explanation although i saw less of him than usual why was that he was working he would be out late ordinarily he would return in the early evening and he rarely left the house again he preferred to eat at home then we would read together sometimes he would have work to attend to but only in his office sometimes he would read his papers sitting by the fire with me next to him in the last few weeks he would go out again sometimes coming back late at night but he never told me why do you know a man called cort henry cort she gave no reaction either of pleasure or anything else i have known mr cort for more than twenty years she replied evenly john also knew him for a long time who is he he is i dont know how to describe him really he was once a journalist although i understand he gave that up long ago he was a correspondent for the times in paris which is where i came to know him so he was not an employee of your husband oh no he has independent means why do you ask a name that came up i replied i still didnt know what fo meant some religious order was your husband a catholic she smiled his mother was but john was brought up as an anglican his father was a vicar but he was not a great churchgoer i see i replied here we are she said opening a door on the second floor this was his office and where he fell it was a room about eighteen feet square the same size as the sitting room we had been in a few moments previously and presumably directly above it a simple but masculine room where the other had all the touches of a womans hand in this room brown dominated the woodwork painted as mock oak the curtains heavy velvet a smell of tobacco hung in the air heavy wooden filing cabinets filled one wall and there were no paintings only a few photographs in heavy silver frames family friends all his family she replied his parents sisters and their children he was fond of them all but they rarely met after his mother died she was a remarkable if rather strange woman foreign like me he got much of his drive from her his kindness from his father they all live in shropshire and rarely come to town would one have been close enough for him to have confessed an indiscretion i wrote and asked but they said they knew nothing by all means ask again if you wish she replied now this is his desk and i had assumed that these documents would have been in this drawer i saw that the whole lefthand pillar keeping the desk up was in fact one drawer which when opened revealed a metal top it was clearly immensely heavy but slid out on hidden rollers underneath which bore much of the weight he had this built to his own requirements she explained it was the sort of thing he liked to do he was a practical man she laughed thinking fondly no not a bit he was the most impractical man i have ever known i dont think i ever saw him do anything at all with his hands besides eat write and light his cigar i meant he liked solving problems to his own satisfaction then he would get other people to turn his ideas into reality i pulled at the lid on top of the strongbox it came open easily there were bundles of papers inside examine them if you wish she said but you will find they are all deeds of our houses and insurance policies and other domestic documents i have looked carefully but do so again if you want to later perhaps was the drawer locked or unlocked when you first came to see what was in here locked and the key was in johns pocket at the morgue is there another key i dont know i stood and looked at the drawer for a few minutes hands in my pockets thinking that was a waste of time no blinding flash of inspiration came to me to solve the problem and make everyones life easier i even considered ridiculous possibilities and lifted the carpet to see if a sheaf of papers was underneath lady ravenscliff looked on impassively i have searched thoroughly she commented i looked at her carefully i know you have i said and for the first time i really believed it this was not a conclusion that would appeal to anyone with a fondness for tales of detection ask me why i concluded that she was telling me the truth and i could give no satisfactory reason nothing had changed since i had walked the streets deciding that the exact opposite conclusion was the more likely i merely wanted to believe her so much that my desire became reality instinct guesswork selfinterest call it what you will from that moment on i worked on the assumption that my employer was an honest and innocent woman she was not however particularly grateful for my faith she scarcely seemed to notice it instead she gestured at the window this is where he fell she said quietly i walked over to the tall sash window in the wall opposite the desk it was gigantic some ten feet high as they are in buildings of this sort stretching low and almost to the ground the bottom of the frame was less than a foot from the floor the top only a couple of feet from the ceiling the two sashes were held shut by a highly polished brass clasp i tried to open it it was stiff but shifted eventually the sash slid up only with difficulty and some noise it was a long way to the ground and looking out i could see that immediately underneath was a long stretch of thick spiked iron railings how tall was your husband a few inches shorter than you she said and not athletic i assume not in the slightest he was not fat but set no great store by exercise shortly before he died he was wondering about installing one of these new elevators at the back of the house so he wouldnt have to walk up and down stairs i smiled good for him i was just wondering how he managed to fall out of this window if he tripped on this carpet here and stepped forward to regain his balance i performed the manoeuvre myself to show what i meant then he should have cracked his head on the bottom sash certainly even the clumsiest of men should have been able to steady himself by grabbing the window frame she was sitting in the little plushvelvet bucket chair by the fireplace now her hands clasped together in her lap i dont know she replied sadly i didnt come up here until much later i was out that evening and did not get back until late the police were waiting for me they told me there had been an accident and i went directly to the hospital he was already dead i didnt come up here until late that day and the window was open no one of the servants said he had closed it it was raining and the water was coming in and he tidied up the room as he does every morning and was it unusually disarranged that depends on what you mean by unusually once john was finished with a book or a newspaper or anything really he would just drop it on the ground i very much doubt he would have noticed even if the room was never tidied up he lived in this house to please me and because he thought it was the sort of house a man of his standing should live in it isnt of course had we lived in such a place we would have bought something very much bigger but he really had no taste for ostentation we have another house in paris which was bought solely for my benefit he was utterly uninterested in expensive living although he did like good food and wine and the sea he always wanted to live by the sea but had never managed it we had planned to buy a house on the coast somewhere the trouble was we couldnt agree where i wanted biarritz he wanted dorset curiously he was a very simple man you would have liked him had you given him a chance this sentence was added on so gently i almost missed it you think i wouldnt have done i think you assume all rich men of business must be cruel and greedy by nature some are no doubt but in my experience they are no better or worse in general than any other class of man how many people were in the house at the time of the fall no more than twelve my husband and the servants everyone but your husband was asleep i imagine so although i have no doubt that some of the servants misbehave themselves when they are not watched as long as they do their jobs i do not interest myself in such things another one of those comments which took me slightly unawares why do you ask because squalid little reporter with an eye for a story that i am i still cannot rid myself of the idea that your husband did not fall i have heard he had a terrible fear of heights is that correct she smiled yes it was it was what made me fall in love with him im sorry we were walking over a bridge in paris and he suddenly turned pale and grabbed hold of me i thought he was making an advance but in fact he was simply feeling dizzy it was the first time i realised he had any frailties but he needed to pretend so he did kiss me merely to cover up his weakness i teased him without mercy until he confessed and he was as shamefaced as a schoolboy she had such a sweet smile as she remembered this that it was almost a pity to bring her reminiscence to an end but i did find her memories inappropriate so i continued on remorselessly so would he have walked up and down by an open window not usually but he did love his cigars and he knew i hate the smell of cigar smoke he was prepared to take grave risks when necessary then let me ask you directly would anyone want to murder your husband absurd she said promptly in his life he was the kindest of men in his business he had a reputation for fairness he had rivals no doubt but not enemies he was an easygoing employer to the servants who in any case naturally referred to me first of all besides even the most violent and detestable men generally die in their beds but you know nothing of his business affairs that is not entirely true we talked a great deal although rarely about the details i was not greatly interested and he thought of me as a sort of antidote to work he was not obsessed with his work methodical is a better term i shook my head i wish i could say our conversation today has helped me i commented but it has made me the more confused i do not think i am giving you very good value for money at the moment you have a long way to go she said i do not despair of you yet what else confuses you the same question that has always worried me why are you bothering why do you want me to look for this child i told you to respect my husbands wishes and i am not convinced after all he did not respect his own wishes enough to make the task easy it is all i can offer you have you some further unfavourable interpretation ah you might as well say you have already accused me of being a murderess and on the whole i think i took that fairly well henderson told me that the will cannot be settled until this matter is cleared up so you are dependent on the generosity of the executor until then oh i see she said so rather than respecting johns wishes i am selfishly looking after my own is that what you are saying well in that case i would hardly have hidden the papers besides i did not come to this marriage a pauper i have more than enough money even if i receive nothing from john at all there is no motive or reason for you at all there do you understand i have offended you i apologise i would rather you say these things than think them in secret and i suppose they are reasonable we rich people are cruel and heartless are we not not like ordinary people not like you as i say i apologise i will tell you when i accept your apology she stood up i was dismissed or maybe not i did not know is there anything else no except who is this other woman mentioned in his will this italian lady signora vincotti i dont know i have never heard the name before i assume as i suppose you have already done that she was his mistress does that upset you she looked gravely at me of course i am distressed he did not trust me more pardon he kept a secret from me that wounds me he must have known that i would not have caused a scene over such a trivial matter it seems he kept more than one secret i pointed out she looked at me stonily any more questions yes to leave that amount of money to this woman suggests she was not trivial that is true are you not curious at the least i suppose i am what do you suppose i should do about it if you wish i could visit this lady on your behalf i understand she arrives tomorrow and will stay at the russell hotel in bloomsbury she thought about that i have a better idea i will visit her myself you may come with me a vision of two jealous women rolling on the floor trying to scratch each others eyes out floated before me i dont think i would recommend that it is not for you to recommend anything i will send a note this afternoon and make an appointment that put me in my place i could either go with her or not it would not make any difference to her decision i decided to go and at the same time she said lightly we may discover something that will put you out of a job tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke and i looked on horrified at the thought that i might have to witness her embarrassment she was a woman deceived and had discovered it under the most terrible circumstances im sorry i said it was not a useful remark and she paid it no attention i had no children she said eventually john said he didnt mind that it was enough to have me that i had brought him all the happiness in the world and he wanted no more i am a fool to be so distressed of course he had the right to do as he pleased it made no difference to our life together and does knowing really make any difference yes she nodded i should have been able to do that for him not some other woman who was so unimportant he never even mentioned her existence now if you will excuse me i have some matters to attend to my husbands papers are in those cabinets over there you may look at whatever you wish i have instructed the servants that you are to be allowed into the house at all times whether i am here or not you see i have nothing to hide and she left i contemplated beginning on the daunting array of filing cabinets which i considered would be most likely to contain something of use but could not face it the interview had left me disoriented shaking almost chapter i was feeling increasingly out of my depth commenting on a murder case was one thing unravelling someone like lady ravenscliff was another so i went to the ritz to see my little elf it was i gathered where xanthos habitually stayed when in london i learned that he maintained permanent rooms there at gigantic cost so he is some grandee then i asked slipping into reporterly mode i was in the lamb just round the corner in masons yard it was where the ritz went i bought a round of drinks to reinforce the question thats the good thing about hotels servants of the variety who work for the ravenscliffs have a sort of loyalty and it is difficult to chisel information out of them but people who work in hotels will tell you anything for a drink they have no discretion at all must be was the collective reply but no one really knew he came he went in general he was never there for more than a fortnight at a time but always wanted his rooms ready no women had ever been spotted but visitors and guests aplenty the bills though were paid that they knew but there the limitations of their trade came into operation xanthos was rich he was foreign greek they reckoned what did they care how a strange little greek came to be able to afford a suite at the ritz i knew salesmen they made good murderers lonely people shuffling from boarding house to boarding house washing their shirts overnight no family no friends never in the same place long enough they were the nomads of the industrial age always wandering always moving on there was no doubt a camaraderie a fraternity of such people but it did not seem much of a life to me and they did seem to commit murder normally squalid dirty little murders more often than they should have done or maybe they were too miserable to take the necessary steps to avoid being caught mr xanthos was evidently a different species of salesman altogether but the hotel people told me little in return for my money only that he had been in london the week ravenscliff had died and had left shortly afterwards that he came and went all the time and had his mail forwarded when he was away for more than a month or if the letter says please forward someone chipped in like last autumn when he went to badenbaden to take the waters he said in a mockposh accent or when he went to rome last april and that trunk arrived for him do you remember the trouble that caused shipping it off and no thanks when he got back either it might have been a postcard wed sent on for all he cared he was an interesting fellow i thought when he opened the door to his suite and a curiously attractive one short dapper unconventional with a bright smile and quick precise movements welcoming friendly quite unlike bartoli it is kind of you to see me i said we were in his fabled rooms and very splendid they were grand enough to intimidate someone like me who had never even been in the public area before let alone in one of the most expensive of the hotels apartments there was a huge salon ornately decorated with rich red wallpaper and gallons of gold paint what i assumed was a bedroom and bathroom next door and a separate dining room while i was there there was a constant toing and froing of people bringing food messages coal and logs for the fire even his coffee was poured for him by someone else on the contrary i am very curious about you he replied his eyes twinkled as he spoke in a voice which was well modulated but overlaid with so many accents it was impossible to tell what the original might once have been he nestled almost snuggled down in his armchair like someone protecting himself from a gale i halfexpected him to wrap himself up in a blanket as he spoke or tuck his little legs underneath him in that case the curiosity is mutual if i may no he said i will ask first i invited you and am providing the refreshments he paused for a considerable while as he leant forwards and poured two cups of tea lemon for him milk and sugar for me im a traditionalist very well what do you want to know just why dear lady ravenscliff chose you for this project i am sure you know as well as i why that might excite some interest amongst those who knew her husband and who i may add are protective of his memory there i cannot really help im afraid i had never met either of them before i was offered the task and as you no doubt gathered from my conversation with mr bartoli i have no experience whatsoever in things financial and she knew so many people who were expert do you think she wanted someone who was not employed by her husband an independent outsider could that be it why would she want that i flatter myself that what she wanted was someone who could tell a good story make her husbands life interesting there are few successful novels with bankers or industrialists as the hero fewer still that are written by bankers or industrialists that is true he replied and a sad condemnation of the bookreading public it is perhaps you are right perhaps that is all it is you sound doubtful although i thank you for being less offensive than mr bartoli the elf waved a hand oh dont worry about him he is just as rude to me and everyone in fact its his way he is a very efficient man the perfect doorkeeper for someone like john stone although i imagine he is concerned about what is to become of him now lady ravenscliff i am sure will not require his services i assume she is the beneficiary of his will aha i thought so thats it i smiled i really couldnt say i said i am hardly privy no i suppose not still you will have gathered that i am curious and as you come to know more about his business you will understand why how do you find lady ravenscliff a question only the foreigner would ask no englishman would ever be so direct i beg your pardon have you fallen under her spell im not sure i she is a fascinating woman i find beautiful intelligent accomplished warm witty yes indeed did you know she was once one of the most famous women in france really he frowned your nextdoor neighbours have the strange habit of the salon women gather male admirers around them the best attract the leading writers politicians diplomats poets you name it it is in the salons that the elites of france are formed lady ravenscliff is said to have been a great star it is said she even had the king your king in her collection then she married john stone moved to england and has lived a life of domesticity ever since odd dont you think love maybe so you sound doubtful are you about to offer an explanation no he said i was hoping that in the course of your researches you might i would find the answer fascinating it might be love i suppose he said with a sigh as though he found the idea disappointing i cannot give an explanation for something i did not know about as for her spell she is indeed charming and warm though that is tempered by her distress which makes her fragile he smiled she is formidably intelligent and if you think her fragile then you have very poor judgement she married one of the wealthiest men in the world and was his equal in all respects her fragility and charm are her strengths everything about her is a strength or can be made so i stared curiously at him but what are you mr braddock are you one of her weapons as well i believe i am an employee there to write a life of her husband no more than that no i got the sense he did not believe me but he decided not to pursue it you do not seem to like her very much i observed like her he said his eyes widening in surprise i adore her all men adore her just as much as most women hate her have you seen her in the company of another woman i have known her for what years it must be and i know her no better understand her no better than the first day i met her she is charming radiant lovely but have you ever seen her using her magic when she is hypnotising enthralling then believe me she is frightening it is a rare man who can resist her including her husband john he paused and looked at me you havent got very far if you can ask such a question of course he could resist her that was his appeal he loved her devotedly because he wanted to and she loved him because she could not control him as i say they were equals they fought like cat and dog you know his anger was cold hers volcanic my dear he would say through gritted teeth your behaviour is quite unacceptable and she would throw a plate at him it went on for hours i think they actually enjoyed it it was a central part of their marriage neither had power over the other and both were used to controlling others can you imagine the attraction of the only person you have ever met who will not do as you wish no i said shortly and at the moment it is not at the top of my list of questions xanthos sighed a pity the book will be the poorer for it it contains the essence of john stones nature i think she wants something more factual that may be so he said so go ahead ask me your questions i hadnt come very well prepared which was foolish normally when i interviewed people i made out in advance a little list of questions to give some form to the interview this time i had nothing so i asked randomly snatching questions from my mind as they floated chaotically into view i am struck i began although it had not struck me until then by the people ive met so far bartoli an italian you who i am told are greek lady ravenscliff who is hungarian and more than that he replied the head of finance for example is a man called caspar neuberger german oh hed be quite annoyed to be called just german he said with a faint smile i am chewish dear man chewish try calling him a prussian he was born in prussia and see what sort of reaction you get john used to refer to caspars military character just to see how long he would be able to control himself i stand corrected but you know what i mean the corporation of mongrels and halfbreeds yes i do see we are not a blueblooded company it is our great quality and the reason why we have left all our competitors in the dust john stone had two great remarkable qualities which you would do well to bear in mind one was his gift for organisation the other was his judgement of character he wanted people who would do a good job with the minimum of supervision he didnt care who they were or where they came from as he had no family to speak of the board isnt stuffed with useless relations as far as operations are concerned bartoli is a genius at seeing the evolution of the whole williams the managing director is a brilliant administrator but the son i believe of a bankrupt coal merchant caspar is extraordinary at finance and i sooner or later someone will tell you so it might as well be me am of mysterious but entirely unseemly origins but it all works john used to complain sometimes saying it had all been organised too well and there was nothing left for him to do that the company no longer needed him and what exactly do you do me oh im just the salesman the negotiator nothing more than that people want to buy i get the best price i am easily the most disposable of them all but what i do i do well my reputation is alas different do you want to know what it is by all means i am the angel of death he said softly and looked at me in such a way that for a moment i almost believed him then he brightened up and continued cheerfully you wouldnt think it to look at me but there we are i am the sinister one the worker in shadows the man whose hidden hand is everywhere john stones alter ego who does the dirty work he could not do himself no violence or turmoil happens anywhere on the planet without me being responsible for it somehow he smiled sweetly at me really not at all i am as i say merely a negotiator but it is a fine reputation you must admit i do not discourage it much it makes my life seem more interesting than it is and perhaps even gives me a small advantage in negotiations in fact i do little more than travel around europe haggling over details of contracts you are not in england very much no sales to the royal navy and the army are done in a different way i have nothing to do with it and wouldnt be very effective anyway the navy likes to deal with gentlemen and i as you no doubt realise am not a gentleman the obituaries referred time and again to the organisation of the companies whats so special about that arent all companies well organised xanthos laughed oh no you would not believe how some go about things john stone was remarkable to create such an organisation and keep control of it was a stupendous achievement there are other factories all over the world mines wells ships all perfectly choreographed and on top of that there is the money the banks the credit notes the bills of exchange the shareholdings the loans in many currencies and many countries and everything has to be in the right place at the right moment for the purpose of constructing these vast machines some of which take nearly two years to complete if people had any idea at all how remarkable this was then the businessman would replace the priest and the poet and the scientist as the greatest figure of the age but we are modest people he said with a smile and do not desire fame but surely someone orders a ship you build it get paid for it isnt it straightforward he sighed you dont understand governments do you or money no it is not straightforward a government orders a battleship say do they pay no of course not they pay a little the rest when it is delivered the greater part of the money you find yourself that in itself is fabulously risky beswicks demands for capital are as great as that of many an entire country the government places an order and we commit the capital then they change their mind no mr braddock it is not simple not simple at all i gather things are a bit difficult at the moment is that right he looked sternly at me a bit difficult we have been through terrible times in the last few years ever since the liberals took power orders from the royal navy have all but dried up and they are our main customer we and armstrongs and vickers and cammell laird have been hard put to keep going on occasion fortunately lord ravenscliff was more than able to see us through hard times we are in much better shape than our competitors so much about stone as a man of business why did everyone go on about that surely there must have been more to him that that did lord ravenscliff have close friends i have no idea surely he was my employer i liked and trusted him and i believe that regard was mutual but that is not friendship if you understand me that was a different world one which i and no business associate ever penetrated i know nothing about that side of him whatsoever whether he associated with princes or paupers what he liked to do when he wasnt working whether he had any indiscretions you do not know i do not know nor have i ever been interested and now if you will excuse me i have some letters to write still it was pleasant to meet you i have no doubt we will talk again im sure i will have many questions over the coming months i will gladly answer them all if i can as you may have discerned i was a great admirer of john stone he had no failings john stone never did anything without a good reason except fall in love and die and perhaps these stand out as exceptions merely because we do not know what the reasons were rather than because they did not exist do you count that as a failing or not chapter interesting i walked out of the ritz and up bond street in a reflective mood trying to unravel what i had been told and what i had learned the obvious interpretation of course was that mr xanthos truly believed i was writing a biography in which business would loom large he wanted to give me instruction about how to present the man but that reference to indiscretions niggled me why would he have mentioned it at all and then there was the conspiratorial side he was trying to draw me in make me an insider create feelings of loyalty of belonging by dropping exciting little titbits of information and lady ravenscliff a clear warning there i thought dont be fooled was the message but i could tease no more out of the conversation than that business had been tough but everything was under control was that the point to ram home the message that there was no business reason for ravenscliff to drop out of a window intentionally or otherwise that i should look elsewhere if that was on my mind but that would mean he knew i was not merely writing a biography of course i hopped on a bus and relaxed there is something about the clopping of the horses hooves the way the driver converses with his beast the slight rolling of the carriage as it trundles along which has always induced a sense of peace in me when it is not crammed with noisy spitting passengers at any rate i sat upstairs even though it was chilly and watched through gusts of pipesmoke as the great houses of portman place then the even greater establishments of regents park rolled by i had never really considered that people actually lived in these places before they had been as foreign to me as a palace or a prison more so than prisons even now i was gaining entry to such places and i watched with more interest the occasional flicker of domesticity that caught my eye the servant sitting on a ledge polishing the outside of a window another shaking a blanket to get the dust out some children elaborately dressed coming down a stairway from a great front door accompanied by their nanny the carts of tradesmen parked down the back alleys so meat and fish and vegetables could be delivered through the rear entrance unseen i was allowed in through the front door of st jamess square i thought for the first time in my life i felt superior to those people among whom i had originated then it occurred to me that in all probability i ranked in lady ravenscliffs mind equally with a governess the splendour of regents park does not last long it is little more than a few bricks thick an insubstantial theatre set behind and beyond are the drabber dwellings of camden to the north though lies an area of comfortable detached villas built for the man of enough but not too much property my former editor lived in just such a treelined street the houses set back from the wide avenue private in a way the greater mansions could never be this was the sort of thing to which i aspired in my dreams my imagination could take me no higher but even on three hundred and fifty a year for seven years it was way beyond my means or was it i had never even considered the possibility but now it dawned on me that perhaps i could live in such a place and the reality of my change in circumstances rushed over me in a wave of pride i imagined myself at heals buying fashionable furniture with a wave of my chequebook engaging a servant marrying a desirable woman like and here i paused for as that piece of imagination passed through me i saw the woman of my daydreams sitting on the sofa looking up from her sewing and smiling as i came in and she had the face of lady ravenscliff the absurdity brought me back down to earth with a sharp and quite unpleasant crash but i retained enough sense at least to smile ruefully at the tricks that the unbridled imagination can play the gallant cavalier who could in his imagination sweep the richest woman in the country off her feet meanwhile was hesitating outside the address of his old editor wondering whether he dared knock on the door without arrangement it was stupid though to come all that way and go away again so after a brief hesitation i summoned enough courage to march up the little path and knock then announce myself to the serving girl who opened the door i was shown into mcewens study and asked to wait it was very much more my sort of place than the drab room from which stone had controlled his empire big french windows opened onto the garden fresh flowers gave a pleasant scent unspoiled by stale cigar smoke an ancient battered leather armchair sat on a slightly careworn carpet on which was stacked a pile of logs for the fire it looked like a room much loved by its main occupant and which gave back warmth and comfort in return it was the room of a trustworthy man who appeared through the door a few moments later smiling and quite unoffended by my arrival mcewens familiar greeting no longer i thought the greeting of editor for subordinate of superior for employee reassured me entirely and made me more open than i had intended to be i thought you might show up at some stage he said cheerfully but not quite so quickly have you made some great discovery you wish to tell me about i hope it is something we can print rather than being merely salacious have you discovered what is to become of us im afraid i have little but questions i replied although i can tell you that the chronicle will be in the hands of the executor until the will is settled which may take some time yes i thought as much then it goes direct to lady ravenscliff i imagine maybe it all seems quite complicated at the moment mcewen was not used to employees even former employees being cagey with him he frowned in displeasure so i hurried on i thought you could tell me in a few seconds things it might take me days to discover on my own i have made little progress since i saw you except to become more confused in what areas just about every single one i have learned some things about his death as you suggested i do i have established that the companies were in good health unfortunately i do not see how it assists me in any way i didnt think it would he said i merely wished to satisfy my own curiosity on the matter why oh call it the instincts of an old newspaper man if you wish what have you discovered only that quite a lot of people became somewhat agitated the moment he dropped out of the window there was a man called cort for example mcewens eyes narrowed and he became more attentive cort ah i said you may remember him lady ravenscliff said he worked as a journalist on the times once did you know him he stood up and walked to the window tapping his foot as he always did when thinking eventually he turned round and faced meblockquote im very sorry braddock he said i have been extremely foolish and reckless on your behalf but why whats the matter who is this man indeed how does he come into a routine biography commissioned by a grieving widow he was looking at me shrewdly and i could see that i would get nothing out of him without giving something in advance he was genuinely worried and i was touched by his concern but he was a newspaperman through and through nonetheless information was food and drink to him its not a biography i said eventually thats not what she wants me to do she wants me to find out the identity of ravenscliffs child he raised an eyebrow i see and cort was one of the first at the scene of his death and i think may have suppressed the news of it for three days oh he said softly oh what i was fearful it was based on nothing just the way he had said it apprehensive almost alarmed certainly surprised even shocked whats the matter what is all this we received a request from the government not to run the news immediately as did every other newspaper we agreed as the health of ravenscliffs businesses is a matter of national interest besides we were assured it was merely to stop an unnecessary panic on the markets i thought there might be more to it hence my recommendation of you so i might have a man on the inside so to speak but i never realised it might be that serious he stuffed his hands in his pockets and looked at the carpet as he did when thinking fast then looked up at me once more write to her and say you are sorry but this jobs not for you what but it was your idea i know but this is not idle journalism hanging around the law courts and police stations this is not the sort of thing you should get involved in youre being melodramatic what on earth is bothering you what do you know about henry cort very little i said firmly there doesnt seem to be much to know he was a journalist he appears to be a gentleman of leisure of moderate means he knew lady ravenscliff many years ago and he was on the scene in some capacity shortly after ravenscliff died there was a reference to fo but i dont know what it means certainly not the foreign office as he is not listed i looked i concluded lamely yes well as you say you know very little so tell me more you clearly know something only if you promise to give due consideration to my recommendations i will i said stoutly but i dont remember whether i meant it good henry cort is possibly the most powerful man in the empire he held up his hand for he could see my look of incredulity please if you want me to tell you you must not keep interrupting i briefly came across him as you so rightly guessed at the times about twenty years ago supposedly he was a journalist but he wrote little yet he was sent to paris as a correspondent even though there was one there already no one knew where he came from why he was given the job except that it was said he once worked for barings and that his appointment was engineered by sir henry wilkinson a name which i am sure means nothing to you whatsoever you are right but it is not the first time that barings has cropped up in the last week he waved away my diligence with impatience until he died sir henry wilkinson was the head so they said at least of the imperial secret service it is said equally without anyone really knowing that henry cort is his far more efficient replacement it is said again without a shred of evidence or detail that he once singlehandedly prevented a catastrophe which would have brought the empire to ruin that he has killed men and ordered the deaths of others i opened my mouth to express something then thought better of it and shut it again an enterprise which operates on the scale of the british empire is beset by foes and dangers we have been fending off war for several decades and have succeeded quite well but it is only a matter of time before our luck runs out who will we fight how will we ensure the best advantage for ourselves who are our friends how do we guard our diplomatic industrial military secrets this so it is said is what occupies henry cort you are not serious about this i am youve not been reading too many yellow novels no but you know this presumably our enemies know it presumably but i do not know it for certain and perhaps neither do they what cort does and how he does it i do not know there are stories but nothing that i could ever pin down enough to print in a newspaper for example not that i would be allowed to even were i so unpatriotic as to consider it nor does it matter what i am trying to tell you is that if cort is involved in some way then so is the interest of the entire empire and that is not something that a junior reporter of no great experience should be dabbling in perhaps hes just a family friend ravenscliff did not have family friends nor does cort so what is going on i have no idea and i suggest you do not try to find out it will do you no good does cort know about you i very much doubt it that is i dont see how he could i see have you noticed anyone following you now i was really getting alarmed youre not serious i was repeating myself i know but it seemed justifiable a couple of years ago he said there was a german reporter in england a correspondent for a berlin newspaper he asked questions about mr cort he died a few months later on a railway track just outside swindon the verdict was suicide really the moral of the story is do not interest yourself in mr cort as you are english he will no doubt be more indulgent towards you as it is safe to assume you are not or not yet in the pay of our enemies of course im not but you are of course in the pay of a woman who is or was a subject of the austrohungarian empire which is in alliance with the german empire i gaped i should have managed better but i gaped youre making this up i said reproachfully i am merely pointing out that an excessively lucrative engagement for a spurious project might be interpreted in many different ways some not to your advantage i am certainly not going to give up a year because of the fantastical notions of some civil servant i said robustly if anyone wishes to ask me what i am doing i will explain fully and openly naturally i will but i am doing nothing inappropriate at all and it is my right of course but your right as an englishman can be misunderstood and may be held to contradict your duty so be careful are you still inclined to continue with this i thought hard he was a man i trusted until that moment i had not realised how much i trusted him but i could not entirely discount the money and uppermost in my mind there floated the image of lady ravenscliff sitting on the settee in her sitting room looking so vulnerable and needy missing her husband so greatly and placing herself in my hands asking my help me of all the people in london i may i said but not until i am sure that your warnings are correct i do not want to place myself in danger obviously nor do i wish to meddle in things which are not my concern but i have taken on a commission and so far i can see no real reason not to fulfil it he sighed and looked frustrated and disappointed i am not saying i am determined to continue merely that i wish to i thought that might be your attitude i am sorry for it i think you are making a mistake i sat and considered what mcewen had just said had made a deep impression and yet an old stubbornness was beginning to stir why should i be frightened off with just a word whispered in my ear why shouldnt i discover whatever i wanted to i was breaking no law in a way i was trying to discover if any had been broken and i was being told that i should be afraid and cautious englishmen should never be afraid or cautious not of their own government i looked up defiantly who does cort work for the government i mean which bit i have no idea the foreign office the war office the home office all or none it is in the nature of a task like this that it is illdefined you will not find any piece of paper saying what it is i doubt he is even on the rolls of the civil service we finally have a formal intelligence organisation and he is not part of that either oh he will be paid and his expenses met out of miscellaneous funds untraceable to any one department of state but one person cannot oh good heavens there are more than cort all over britain throughout the empire all over europe there are his men and his women i gather who watch our enemies and their doings they watch troops they watch politicians they watch what sorts of weapons are being produced by factories they watch ships in harbours they watch the people watching us i said we may eventually be at war in truth it has already started youve read the stories in the papers about german spies in this country about trained murderers waiting for the moment war breaks out to strike and cause havoc here on the streets of london hysterical nonsense are you sure our enemies learn fast they have watched the chaos a few anarchists with homemade bombs can cause how easy it is to kill a king in portugal a president in france to sow panic with a wellplaced bomb in a restaurant do you think they do not realise what potent weapons are fear and confusion personally i had always considered these mouthings in the newspapers to be simply a way of softening up the population so that repressive measures could be taken against the trade unions and poor people who wished to strike in order to gain a living wage it had never crossed my mind that someone like mcewen would actually take them seriously or that they might be true chapter the russell hotel in bloomsbury was a fairly new building having been completed only a few years previously all terracotta brick and marble it presented a formidable appearance to the outside world so much so that although i had walked past it on many occasions i had never even thought of going inside it was not for people like me any more than the ritz was or drawing rooms in st jamess square nor yet was it for the very wealthy in fact it was difficult to work out who exactly was meant to use it it was too far from the west end to be convenient for the people who congregated there and not really properly sited for those who worked in the city and most visitors to the british museum were not the sort who could afford its lavish prices that was a problem for the management not for me when i arrived there i simply spent my time staring at the multicoloured marble columns the carved ceilings the glittering chandeliers it must i thought be the sort of surroundings aristocrats were used to all the time i confess i felt rather grand i was beginning to get a taste for this sort of living and after only a week or so it was slightly worrying dreadful place lady ravenscliff remarked as she sat down opposite me once she had announced herself and i had stood up to greet her she was smiling indeed she seemed energised by the outing her eyes were bright and larger than i had noticed before she looked extraordinarily beautiful as though she had made a special effort to intimidate the opposition the idea of complimenting her never occurred to me dont you like it i find it somewhat ostentatious it is designed to impress the impressionable i suppose it does that very well she noticed the way i had blushed im sorry she said you will find i am prone at times to be opinionated and insensitive please never take anything i say on such matters to be of any value at all i was brought up with older shabbier buildings which did not force you to admire them all the time i suppose you might say i was as well i replied a little ostentation i find enjoyable she smiled so it is i stand corrected let us bathe in this exuberant vulgarity while we wait could you inform signora vincotti of our presence i did so while she sat immobile a dreamy smile coming over her face i did not know her very well but i guessed she was calming herself before what could well be an unpleasant interview and ten minutes later esther vincotti descended let me be direct and say there was no competition possible between the two women one alert intelligent beautiful elegant the other stout almost square in shape with a ruddy though amiable complexion over which she clearly took no pains at all never had i seen any woman less likely to be connected in some way to a vastly wealthy man she was aged around fifty and while her clothes were not poor she manifestly had little notion of how to dress for effect her hair was grey and no attempt had been made to make it look at all stylish or well groomed her face seemed good natured although it bore an expression which made it clear that if lady ravenscliff was anxious at the coming interview she was thoroughly frightened she sat down nervously once the introductions had been made with me acting as the gobetween as neither of the two women seemed willing to start the proceedings off and lady ravenscliff had she told me prohibited mr henderson the solicitor from coming anywhere near the hotel until she had finished neither however had a look of hostility about them lady ravenscliff had hardly moved a muscle but i guessed was utterly perplexed by the idea that her husband might have dallied with such an utterly ordinary maternal figure as this as a result she was hiding behind a mask of aristocratic grandeur which was both intimidating and to me exceptionally alluring it is very good of you to come here your ladyship i am most honoured to meet you signora vincotti said after a while and i must thank you for arranging for me to stay in this splendid hotel it is quite beyond what i am used to i do not think it is particularly good of me she replied and i am afraid i must wait before i know whether i am equally honoured by meeting you how well did you know my husband nothing like getting down to business fast i thought i had anticipated an interminable round of politenesses before the real subject was broached i do not know him at all replied the other woman she spoke with something of an italian accent but her english was much too good for her to have been anything other than english in origin i am completely at a loss as to why i am here all i know is that i received a telegram from a london solicitor telling me i had to come to london that it was a matter of the utmost urgency then they sent me a railway ticket first class i am totally mystified and very worried i am sure i have done nothing wrong this was not the reply either of us had been expecting lady ravenscliff registered something like incredulity although she managed to keep her expression under control you didnt know my husband i met him when i was a child i believe though i do not remember it where exactly in venice which is where my father lived and where he died and this was signor vincotti no that is my married name although i am a widow now luigi died several years ago leaving me with four children but my father provided for me and i have had a good life his name was macintyre he was a travelling engineer he died in an accident when i was eight and i was brought up by a family there you are even more wellprovided for now it seems said lady ravenscliff my husband has died as you may know and you are a beneficiary of his will signora vincotti looked thoroughly surprised by this that was very kind of him she said can you tell me why i noticed she did not ask how much i quite liked her for that we were rather hoping that you might tell us im afraid i have no idea none and you really never met him after your father died never until that telegram arrived i had quite forgotten him it was a great effort to recall him at all you speak very good english for someone brought up in a foreign country i commented i was brought up by an english family mr longman was the british consul in venice and lived there for many years but died when i was twenty as i had no connections to england at all apart from him and his wife i stayed and eventually married my husband was a civil engineer with his salary and my inheritance we lived very well two of my daughters are married already and of my two sons one will be a lawyer while the other intends to follow his father into engineering i congratulate you said lady ravenscliff was there something in the account of steady modest family life of seeing children growing and growing well that she envied did it make her sad that she could never boast about her own children to others oh hes doing so well were so proud of him was she sad she could never look into the face of a child and see an echo of her husband reflected back at her do you not wish to know how much the bequest is i put in as we seemed to be straying far from the point i suppose i should but i cannot see how it can be a great deal of money it depends on what you consider a great deal it is a total silence greeted this piece of information signora vincotti grew deathly pale almost as though she had just been told some devastating news there must be some mistake she said eventually in a voice which was so quiet and so trembling it was difficult to make out it seems not i hope you will excuse our curiosity but we are naturally interested in the reason for it lord ravenscliff was an immensely wealthy man but even by his standards this is a large sum i was aware i was talking like a member of the ravenscliff entourage like some retainer it made me uncomfortable in some ways but i also noted a certain smugness in my mind as i spoke i cannot help you at all i really cannot she said looking as though she might burst into tears at any moment was your father a rich man might they have been in business together i doubt it i was always told he was very poor quite unworldly but not so unworldly that he did not provide for me and this inheritance it was an annuity it comes from an insurance company a venetian one italian no no an english bank please do not take offence but could you tell me how much this is for it would help to gauge what sort of relationship your father might have had with lord ravenscliff you see i was also beginning to think like a man of money never before in my life would i have considered that income flow might help determine a mans relationships but it was now beginning to come naturally now i realised that for some it was the only thing which mattered i receive a cheque four times a year from barings bank in london for i calculated quickly using my newfound financial sophistication a quarter was about a year which meant a capital sum of something around hardly in ravenscliffs league his bequest meant that her income had just multiplied by eight a fortune by english standards and i guessed a vast fortune by venetian signora vincotti said lady ravenscliff i would like to ask you an even more direct question please do not take offence but it is essential that i know the answer she said it in a way which suggested she did not care one way or the other if the other woman did take offence what was wrong with her she really didnt have to try quite so hard to be rude vincotti looked at her enquiringly my husband travelled frequently to venice sometimes i accompanied him most times not i have never really cared for venice she paused for a moment let me put it bluntly was my husband the father of any of your children signora vincotti stared in shock at the question and i felt sure she was going to become angry as she had every right to be for a moment this was very nearly the case but she was very much more intelligent than her thickset homely features suggested she reached out and took lady ravenscliffs hand oh i see she said gently i see lady ravenscliff snatched her hand away dont be annoyed with me i mean no insult the italian woman said softly no there is no possibility no possibility at all that your husband was the father of any of my children none if you saw them and saw pictures of my husband as well you would not have to take my word for it in that case we need trespass on your time no longer lady ravenscliff said standing up immediately i am sure my lawyers will be in contact with you in due course my thanks for your assistance and with that she walked swiftly across the hotel lobby leaving me feeling thoroughly embarrassed by her appalling behaviour to make amends as best as i could by saying goodbye in a more friendly fashion and mutter about shock and grief none of which was true then i too hurried into the noise of russell square and found lady ravenscliff waiting for me her face dark with anger appalling woman she said how dare she patronise me if her father was as vulgar as she certainly there must be a physical resemblance she looks like a bulldog in frills she conducted herself with a good deal more dignity than you did even though she must have found the encounter very trying and it wasnt for me she turned around and confronted me for my mollifying remarks you think everything was calm and easy for me that discovering your dead husband has a child having to deal with people like that i didnt mean you are not in my employ to see both sides of the argument braddock mr braddock and in fact i am in your employ to do precisely that you want me to discover the truth not to be partisan its my money and you are being paid you will do as you are told i will do a good and proper job or i will not do it at all please decide what you want of me dangerous that the desire which comes upon me on occasion to strike an attitude put me in a risky position of course i wanted to do a decent job but i also wanted the money although after my editors sombre remarks i would have been quite happy to have the project brought to an end the perfect reply in my opinion would have been had she told me that she wanted to pay me a huge amount of money to go away unfortunately my upright manly remarks had the opposite effect she crumpled in front of me and began sobbing quietly so through pure instinct i responded in a supportive and consolatory fashion which of course made things even worse i handed her a handkerchief which fortunately was clean then i completely wrecked things by taking her hand and holding it firmly she did not snatch it away let us go into the square and find a seat i suggested it is a little public here on the pavement i led her into the middle of russell square and the little stall near the centre that served office workers there i bought two cups of tea and presented her with one i thought it was probably one of the most exotic things she had done for years she who never did anything in public nor anything without servants she looked a little doubtfully at the old cracked cup dont worry i assured her its quite safe she sipped in silence initially more to please me but then with greater enthusiasm i apologise for my rudeness she said after a while and of course i behaved horribly to that poor woman i will write and apologise please do not think badly of me i am finding all of this so hard i nodded in acknowledgement i understand i really do but while we are both amiably disposed to one another might i renew my request that you begin to tell me the truth the flash in her eyes clearly demonstrated that however much she might have been chastened the situation was very far from permanent i pressed on while there was still time mr cort i said what about him henry cort is in charge of government espionage he has been described to me as the most powerful and dangerous man in the country henry she said oh i dont think you have known him for years so you told me i do not believe you could be unaware that there is more to him than meets the eye she considered for a moment i think you also have been less than open with me she replied if i remember i asked what your interest in henry was and you replied merely that someone had mentioned his name i do not see why i should be open with you if you dissimulate with me a fair point very well let me summarise henry cort visited the police within hours of your husbands death and was quite possibly the man responsible for suppressing news of it for nearly three days in the meantime barings bank was brought in to support the price of the rialto investment trust which was your husbands financial instrument for controlling a large part of british industry i know what rialto is cort also used to work for barings i continued barings we now know pays signora vincottis annuity i refuse to believe that an old friend whom you have known for twenty years or more would conceal all of this from you she smiled quietly of course you are quite correct i didnt mention it because i did not know of his involvement when john died besides mr cort and i are not close that means you do not like each other if you like why not that is none of your business john necessarily had dealings with him but i insisted that they be conducted away from me i brooded over this it didnt help me at all why i mean what dealings john made weapons the government bought them naturally they had common interests dont ask me more i do not know how did you meet your husband what was he like she smiled recalling a fond memory he was the kindest man you could meet the best i ever knew she began that was not his reputation perhaps and i sense that it is not the opinion you have formed of him but you are wrong the man of money and power and the man who shared my life had little in common she paused and looked across the square at all the normal poor people strolling to and fro or hurrying across some looked as though they were taking a break from the reading desks of the british museum others came from the shops and offices of holborn i even hoped again this was a sign to which i should have given more attention that perhaps an old colleague from fleet street might appear and see me see me with her in fact i met him on a train she went on as this pleasant and dangerous fantasy flickered through my mind on the orient express is it true he had his own carriage she laughed more easily now no of course not ive told you he was a simple man in his tastes he had his own compartment of course there is no particular pleasure in sharing with total strangers unless you have to ostentation would have been detrimental to his business often on these trips he liked to travel as quietly as possible so as not to be noticed maybe she had really loved him she smiled as memories flitted past the very idea of her husband brought her pleasure and the thought of his death caused her grief i had anticipated a marriage of convenience and companionship at most a rich man seeks a beautiful young woman in the same way that such people might desire a racehorse or an expensive painting is that not true and the beautiful young woman desires security and luxury but they expect no gratification and little affection these so i understood they must find elsewhere perhaps this had been different the thing about john you see is that he was quite simple in his affections as well he thought of himself as a sophisticated man of the world and in business matters no doubt he was but he was not a man for gallantry had no idea how to seduce or flatter or be anything other than he was i found his uncomplicated nature beguiling she looked at me and smiled i can see i am surprising you she said you think i would want an elegant man of sophistication handsome athletic worldly i suppose you know nothing im afraid mr braddock nothing of me nothing of women at all she said it gently as a matter of fact but i still blushed hotly someone said that both of you met their match in the other she laughed who on earth said that mr xanthos do you know him she nodded not well but we have met often so is his opinion true i would hardly claim to be johns match what else did he tell you oh that you were once one of the most influential women in france or something like that here she let out a burst of laughter and almost choked on her tea her eyes sparkled with merriment as she put down her cup carefully and looked at me good heavens she said after a while what an extraordinary idea how on earth did he come up with that he said you ran a salon or something and that made me the most influential woman in france apparently well no she said still smiling broadly i think it was the first time i had seen her laugh genuinely and without restraint it transformed her no im afraid not a young girl from hungary would stand no chance whatsoever of establishing herself like that in paris not if she was respectable pardon some of the most famous salonnières are or were i do not know what it is like now courtesans very expensive ones but still i hope you do not think no no of course not i mean i was red in the face blushing deeply i could even feel the roots of my hair burning with embarrassment she looked at me enjoying my confusion but then kindly looked away across the square until i recovered myself i could see her mouth still twitching though is mr bartoli being helpful she asked to change the subject mr bartoli does not approve of me he has indicated he will give me as little assistance as possible she raised an eyebrow let me deal with that was her only reply and i realised mr bartoli was not going to be happy about it i asked about your husbands concerns i do not know what they were just that he had been quite busy in the months before his death i reproached him for it and said that he really should be working less hard at his age not more but he said that this was the way of business and if something important came up you could not postpone it simply because you were getting old besides he always maintained that working kept him young and i think there was something in that his mind was absolutely undiminished and he was in no way frail and this something important tell me mr braddock why do you ask so many questions about my husbands death i think you know perfectly well i said those papers disappeared when he died i have two ways forward either to look for the child or to look for the papers which will do the work for me as i am naturally lazy i think i should exhaust the latter option first of all besides i dont even know when this boy or girl was born or even in what country clearly if it was last year that requires one approach if it was ten or twenty years ago then it is different do you really have no idea at all no she said softly and a little sadly none whatsoever i really do not chapter i realise that i have said little about my own life in my account partly this is because i wish to tell the story of lord ravenscliff but mainly because i have little enough to say life as a reporter involved long hours often enough i failed even to get back to my lodgings for dinner and i frequently had to be up and out before mrs morrison had even begun to prepare breakfast lunch and dinner were eaten in pubs or taverns my circle of acquaintanceship outside my fellow lodgers and reporters was limited i briefly attended a reading group of worthy socialists who would get together to discuss texts on the evils of capitalism but i missed so many of the meetings and so rarely had the time to read the books we were meant to be talking about that i gradually let this drop i had no family nearby my parents lived in the midlands and i was the only member of the family to leave the town of my birth i think i was the first of innumerable generations to stray more than ten miles from the centre of coventry we were not close my wish to try my luck in london was perfectly incomprehensible to them so it had been to me i did not know why i wanted to leave so much all i knew was that if i stayed i would end up like my father working as a clerk in an office or like my brothers spending their lives in the factories and workshops of that city because they did not dare to do anything else i do not relish adventure but that prospect so terrified me that i was willing to swallow my fears when i left school i worked for a year or so on the local newspaper and convinced myself that i was good at it better still i convinced others for long enough to get a reference armed with this and five pounds given to me by my father who understood better than i then realised why i did not wish to be like him i caught the train to london it took two months and nearly all my money to get my first job working on the social anouncements page of the chronicle i later moved to football the obituaries and after nearly two years finally had my piece of luck the crime reporter was more of a drunk than was average and he was entirely unconscious on the pavement outside the duck when the first of the marylebone murders took place i volunteered to stand in for him and mcewen agreed in my desperation such chances come very infrequently i nearly said let me go cox is drunk again that would have damned me instead i robustly denied all knowledge of the poor mans whereabouts and said that i was sure he was out on a story i would fill in until he returned and so i did as he never did return mcewen did not need me to tell tales he knew perfectly well what cox was working on and his patience finally snapped i did a good job a very good job dare i say it considering my inexperience i was told to continue until a proper replacement was found but one never was eventually editorial interest faded and i continued as acting crime reporter for another year until someone remembered that i was not supposed to be doing the job at all then i was promoted given a proper position and told to keep going that had been five years previously i had dreamed of being a reporter on a london newspaper and i was one my ambitions for life should have been satisfied but however splendid a job may seem when one does not have it it rarely stands up to close acquaintanceship i was beginning to get bored with the life and even to find murder most foul just a little tedious but i had not yet fixed on a new goal to fire my ambitions once more that quite apart from the money was why i had taken up lady ravenscliffs offer with so little hesitation as far as the matter of ravenscliff was concerned i needed to look through his office with care perhaps the papers were there after all perhaps some diary or letter would provide all the information i needed and solve the matter in a few seconds i doubted it his widow wasnt so helpless that she couldnt find that herself and she had good reason to look carefully i knew already that most of the papers were financial in nature and that i could spend days looking at them with every possibility that i would miss the vital clue even if it was there so i decided to recruit franklin this wasnt easy not because he wasnt willing but because he had so little time off from work he was at the bank from eight in the morning to seven in the evening every day six days a week and on sunday he spent much of his time in church i thought initially this was calculated franklin attended a church frequented by the great bankers of the city and travelled a couple of miles to do his singing and praying when he could have walked a hundred yards round the corner to st marys chelsea but that was attended only by shopkeepers and landladies eventually i realised i did him an injustice many people choose a church they find inspiring some go for ancient and beautiful buildings some choose a church with fine music some prefer an eloquent vicar who can deliver a good sermon franklin found that being enveloped in an aura of money incited religious awe in him to sit around individuals who controlled tens of millions of pounds brought home to him the infinite possibilities of gods benevolence and the intricacy of his creation it sounds like a fundamental misunderstanding of christianity eye of a needle and all that but it was franklins nature he could do no other just as some people simply are incapable of loving a woman who is not beautiful so franklin could only think of the divine in terms of the endless flow of capital his piety was no less for being so strange in origin just as a mans love for a woman is no less passionate merely because it may require a decent inheritance to make it flower he believed that the rich were better people than the poor and that to be around them made him better as well wealth was both the indication of gods favour and provided the means to carry out his wishes on earth harry franklin you will understand had no trouble whatsoever in reconciling god darwin and mammon indeed each depended on the others the survival of the fittest meant the triumph of the richest which was part of his plan for mankind accumulation was divinely ordained both a mark of gods favour and a way of earning more benevolence true christ was a carpenter but had he been living at the start of the twentieth century franklin was sure that the messiah would have paid good attention to his stock levels steadily expanded his business into the manufacture of fine furniture while also investing in the latest methods of mass production by means of a stock market flotation to raise the additional capital then he would have brought in a manager to free himself to go about his ministry inevitably i suppose the idea of being allowed into the hallowed halls where once trod the feet of the supreme capitalist of the age gave him pause in fact the mere idea of ravenscliff terrified him and when he arrived at the house in st jamess square on the following sunday morning he was more nervous than i had ever seen him he seemed to shrink as we were let in gazed around with reverence as we walked up the stairs tiptoed past the doors which led to the reception rooms on the first floor and said not a word until i had firmly shut the door to ravenscliffs study i dont want to disturb your reverie i remarked but can we get started he nodded and looked anxiously at the chair the very chair on which the divine bottom had once rested as its owner perused his books i made him sit on it by the desk just to torment him a little i will read the letters if you take care of anything with numbers on it so what am i looking for he had asked me this before several times in fact but so far i had avoided answering him while i had lady ravenscliffs permission to use him i was not allowed to tell him exactly what all this was about i want you to look for interesting payments i said lamely nothing to do with his business interests although you may look through that if you wish i want to get an idea of how he spent his own money in the hope that it will tell me what he was like did he buy paintings bet on horses how much on wine did he give money to charities or to hospitals or to friends did he have an expensive tailor bootmaker a french chef paint me a financial portrait of the man i need all the information i can get as everyone i have talked to so far has given me nothing but generalities i meanwhile will read through everything else and see what there is franklin found the idea of columns of money reassuring although the thought of prying into ravenscliffs private papers made him apprehensive as it did me but somewhere in those huge piles of paper might lie the little nugget that would answer all my questions i had searched the room again the previous day and still found nothing so we set to work each in our different way i worked like a reporter spending ten minutes reading then jumping up and staring out the window humming to myself picking up this pile then the next more or less at random hoping that luck would give me something of interest franklin in contrast worked like a banker starting at the top of the first sheet working his way steadily down through the pile then on to the next number after number column after column file after file he sat still and impassively only his eyes flickering across the tallies his pen occasionally jotting a brief note on a pad of paper before him he made no noise he seemed almost to be in a dream and a happy dream at that well i asked after about an hour and a half when i could stand it no longer have you found anything i havent franklin held up a hand for quiet and he continued reading then jotted down another note what did you say i said what have you got so far ive only just started he began you cant expect i dont but i want a break do you have any idea how bad his handwriting was each word is a torture i want a diversion for a few moments so my eyes can recover ill look at them myself another time he offered this stuff in contrast is fascinating absolutely fascinating but i suspect of no earthly use to you at all i groaned the worst of both worlds franklin was going to tell me more about stock prices he did i absented myself mentally from the room after a few minutes as he waxed lyrical about debenture stocks and dividend payouts and operations in the market not as sound as everyone thought you see he concluded some time later how long ten minutes or an hour i could not say what isnt franklin frowned have you been paying attention of course i replied robustly ive been hanging on every word id just like a useful summary im a journalist remember i dont like detail very well a summary ravenscliffs enterprises in england have been burning up cash he has been sucking money out of the operation at a quite phenomenal rate for almost a year i stared hopefully at him this was more my line i could understand this hand in the till to pay for wine women and song gambling debts racehorses jump out of the window to avoid the shame of ruin how very disappointing how much about three million pounds i looked at him aghast that was a lot of racehorses are you sure pretty sure that is ive looked back at the past seven years accounts they are very complicated but he had a private set prepared every year which summarised his total operations i imagine no one else ever saw them without those i doubt i could ever have noticed what he was up to but these are quite clear do you want me to show you he brandished a thick folder of complicated looking papers in my direction no just tell me very well if you take the amount of cash at the start of the year add on the cash received subtract the cost of operations and other expenses then you get the amount of cash at the end of the year do you understand that i nodded cautiously the official accounts use one figure these again he waved the file in the air use another which is very different all the shareholders except for ravenscliff who evidently knew better believe that the businesses have considerably more money than in fact they do three million as i say and that means that means that if anyone ever found out then not only rialto but all the companies it owns shares in would drop like a stone if youll forgive me franklin seemed momentarily alarmed that he could be frivolous on such a subject even accidentally the companies are not bankrupt but they are worth nowhere near as much as people think including these people i looked it was a list of names with figures on them the prime minister the chancellor the foreign secretary their opposite numbers in the conservative party and many other mps judges and bishops what are these numbers their shareholdings in rialto multiply by the price the prime minister in the case of a total collapse would lose nearly the leader of the opposition enough reason to get barings in to prop up the share price more than enough id say so what do i do about this you keep your mouth firmly closed if you must do something try to find out if any of the people on this list have been selling their shares i have savings of and of these are in the rialto investment trust i intend to sell them first thing on monday morning it has taken me four years to save that much and i dont intend to lose it i imagine anyone else who knew about this would have the same reaction he looked protective as he thought of his nest egg for my part i had not a penny saved in the world as yet but i could imagine how i would feel at the prospect of losing the result of several years parsimony where has this money gone then he shrugged no idea there is nothing else to say i cant imagine that such a quantity of money could just vanish i quite agree but its not here or at least i havent found it i told you i wasnt finished and there are some files missing i only found this one because it was in the wrong place so what do i do if i were you id forget id ever seen it if you say so much as a word you will start a financial storm the like of which london has not seen for decades i could see that he was enjoying this brush with the occult secrets of the mighty i wasnt i knew better than he realised what we were dealing with he was right i should leave this alone forget all about it but i was a reporter i wanted to know what was going on where that money had gone the fact that it had nothing to do with ravenscliffs child was irrelevant i had completely forgotten about the little brat franklin brought me back to myself i must go he said i have to go to church how he could think of such a thing when he had just discovered proof that all these people he liked to associate with in the pews were not quite what they seemed i did not know but franklin was not the sort who would allow one sinner to call into question his entire outlook on life i suspected he would pray fervently that god would show him his favour by allowing him to get a good price for his rialto ordinaries the next morning i nodded he left but not without reminding me of his advice one other thing he added as he opened the door file threetwentythree personal disbursements try that apart from anything else it seems that his lordship has been supporting the international brotherhood of socialists for the past year i sat in ravenscliffs study for the next hour in a reverie occasionally emerging from my mood to study the notes franklin had made i did quite well not that i uncovered any significant new financial information of course that was quite beyond me but i at least managed to understand it and i discovered by comparing handwriting that the accounts detailing the true situation at rialto had been prepared for ravenscliff by joseph bartoli his righthand man my simple solution to the problem simply asking bartoli what was going on disappeared if bartoli was part of some elaborate fraud he was hardly going to open up to me eventually i put down the file and took out file threetwentythree it was as franklin had said ravenscliffs personal expenses and exactly the sort of documents i should have been studying if there were any payments for illegitimate children they should be here buried among the itemised notes for clothes shoes household expenses food servants wages and so on the lists went back to and there were many entries which were ambiguous i realised after a while that detailed study would yield nothing an entire schoolroom of bastards could easily have been hidden under the heading of miscellaneous expense s d all it established was that by the standards of the wealthy if perhaps no longer quite as wealthy as i had imagined ravenscliff was not at all extravagant his greatest expense was his wife s d and he spent more on books than he did on clothes the payments franklin referred to were on a separate sheet on the top of the file easy enough to understand they were headed provisional list of payments to the international brotherhood of socialists no ambiguity there and a list of dates and amounts this was curious it was a lot of money nearly in the past year nor did it occur in the more detailed sheets of expenses underneath it and what on earth was someone like ravenscliff doing giving money to a group who one assumed were dedicated to abolishing everything he stood for had he had a damascene conversion did that explain the sucking of money out of his own companies i went back to his appointments diary and there jotted down for a few days after his death was the entry xanthos ibs i did not like ravenscliff by instinct but i was beginning to find him fascinating a bookreading socialistsympathising childbegetting capitalist fraud wilf cornford at seyds had told me he was nothing but money he was beginning to be very much more than that too much more in fact they told me you were still here came the voice of lady ravenscliff from the door i looked up it was getting dark in the room and i glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece nearly eight oclock no wonder i felt uncomfortable i was hungry no more nor less than that that was a relief working away i said cheerfully and have you discovered anything not on the main question no i said dragging my thoughts away from the disappearing millions and resolving to follow franklins advice merely some things which revive the nosy old journalist in me i handed her the sheet of paper about the brotherhood she looked at it with a very prettily arched eyebrow then her glance returned to me did your husband start going around calling for world revolution in his last months i asked tell the butler over the kedgeree that property was theft and how he should throw off his chains not to my knowledge he rarely said anything over breakfast he usually read the times then this is a bit of a curiosity dont you think she looked again at the piece of paper it is have you ever heard of these people no i said a little disingenuously it was true but these sorts of people had been talked about at my socialist reading group if such an admission could have produced in her a look of alarm at my dangerous political associations i might have mentioned it but i suspected it would produce nothing more than contempt and even pity earnest men in scruffy clothes in a dingy room arguing about things they had no power to alter well it was a bit like that i imagine they are some sort of revolutionary group i said lamely how very odd she tossed the paper aside and changed the subject i was wondering whether you have eaten and if not whether you would care to do so i am not in the mood for company but do not wish to dine alone you would do me a great kindness if you accepted i looked up my eyes caught hers and my world changed forever i was paralysed literally i could not move rather than simply looking at her eyes i seemed to be peering deep into her soul i felt as though i had been punched in the stomach how can i put it lady ravenscliff vanished from my mind to be replaced by elizabeth i can give no better account of the transformation in my mind her vulnerability and her pride were both part of it i suppose as were her beauty and her voice and the way she moved a strand of darkbrown hair hanging down over her left eye made all the difference in the world as did the slightest glimpse of a collarbone above the top of her dark dress something happened to her as well i believed although i could not tell whether it was real or simply a reflection of what was going on inside my head i could not tell if i truly saw something or glimpsed only what i wanted there to be i looked away eventually and had i been required to move just then i do not know if i would have managed to do so without trembling i had no idea what happened or rather how it happened i still do not i was naturally aware that it was quite ridiculous for me a young man of twentyfive to become transfixed by a woman nearly twenty years older than i a member of the aristocracy my employer and a recent widow still genuinely in mourning for her husband a woman whose annual pin money was as much as i was likely to earn in the next decade how much more ludicrous could anything be then i became aware that although i hoped that elizabeth had noticed nothing she too had fallen quite silent and was looking away from me at the fire you are tired i said trying to be hearty but merely sounding nervous instead it is kind of you to invite me but i really must see what i can discover about this matter tomorrow i wanted to get out of that house out of her presence as quickly as possible it was all i could do not to bolt for the door she looked back at me and smiled wanly very well i will dine alone will you come back with your discoveries only if there is something to tell i do not wish to waste your time we rose and i shook her hand she did not look at me nor i at her i was sweating when i got into the street although the air was cool i felt as though i had just escaped from a furnace or from some mortal danger all the way home her face and her perfume and her smile and those eyes danced in my head and refused to obey my instructions that they should leave me alone they were phantoms nothing more again i slept badly that night chapter i will not describe the next day not because it wasnt interesting but more because getting anything done was a supreme act of will when all i wanted to do was sit and stare and think thoughts i should never have allowed inside my mind and at six oclock when i again entered the house i knew the entire day had been spent killing time waiting for the moment when i could see her again and not wanting to because anything which was likely to take place could only be a disappointment after the previous evening even though nothing whatsoever had happened then she received me we talked about little of importance there was an awkwardness in our conversation which i had not noticed before i could not talk to her as an employee someone doing a job for her an expert at my task but i dared not adopt any other tone and in any case was hardly experienced enough to do so after a particularly long pause during which the fire in the grate seemed to become of excessive importance to both of us it was better than avoiding each others gaze she turned back to me once more may i ask you a question of course did you wish to kiss me last night i didnt know what to say tell the truth that would alter things totally i could never stand in front of her and talk to her in a normal way again and i did not know still how she would reply as i have said the ways of the aristocracy and of foreigners and of women were a mystery to me i did not understand her in the slightest i could not untangle what i thought from what i wanted to think all i knew was that the sudden shortness of breath the racing of my heart had returned even more powerfully than the previous evening yes i said after a long pause very much there was another long silence what would you have done if i had she smiled but only very faintly i would have kissed you back she said i am glad you did not my heart fell my small experience was limited to girls who either wanted to be kissed or did not not women who wanted both at the same time but i knew what she meant your ladyship i think in the circumstances you might call me elizabeth she replied if you wish to do so and also i think it would be best to talk of it no more we both know quite well that relations have changed between us it is foolish not to recognise it to some measure but how had they changed i wanted to ask what am i meant to do what do you want of me you must think very badly of me i am quite shocked by myself although not as much as i should be i am an immoral foreigner and blood will out that does not mean i feel free to act on my desires that was something at least although i did not know what all sorts of explanations went through my head this was a woman crazed by her loss who was defying fate by having such thoughts by deliberately acting in such a fashion or she was a woman who so i assumed had not made love to anyone for years and was no longer in control of herself i even considered that she might like me that i was the only person who could offer her any sort of understanding that i was the only person who knew anything of what she might feel that was the most dangerous insidious option matthew she had said something im sorry i said i was a little distracted i said please tell me of your discoveries my discoveries i wanted to say who on earth gives a hoot about my discoveries all i wanted to do was tell her how i had wanted to take her in my arms and run my fingers through her hair and have her look at me like that again lost children fraud failing companies what trivial nonsense was all this in comparison but it was her conversation not mine and she had a better notion of how to be sensible than i had where had she learned that how do people gain an intuitive grasp of when to stop when to go forward in such circumstances is it just from age and experience oh them i said well theres nothing exciting there except for a couple of things did you know that the rialto investment trust is having its annual meeting soon i didnt well it is i thought i would go along just to get a sense of these people from my limited experience of these things it wont be very interesting but you never know and you know mrs vincotti told us that her father had left her some money a certain amount which came from barings every month she nodded that wasnt an annuity it was money sent by your husband and from what she said it has been paid every quarter for years the records only go back ten years but we can assume that he was responsible for payments right back to the beginning she looked interested then her face fell but does this help not obviously mrs vincotti cannot be the person we are looking for if he paid her money he would hardly need to instruct his executors to launch a search for her she cannot possibly be either the child or the mother of the child i cannot explain the payments at all except to say that they are not helpful so i propose dropping the matter unless something else suggests they are relevant it seems john had a less straightforward life than i thought she said i didnt think he had any secrets from me now he is dead i am discovering nothing but there was of course the greatest secret of all all my instincts were to lay it in front of her your husband was a cheat and a fraud he was stealing money from his own companies on a vast scale but how could i say that to a woman who had looked me in the eyes like that who had such hair if i kept silent it was not for the sake of the shareholders of rialto on the subject of the brotherhood or whatever theyre called i said hurrying along ive found out little except that it is obviously a group so small that it poses little danger to the onward march of world capitalism and consists of people so fractious that they were thrown out of another group called the union of socialist solidarity two years ago for being disruptive the union of socialist solidarity in turn walked out of the international organisation of workers well you get the idea so how many of them are there not many i havent found out much they dont sound very interesting either she said calmly are you sure there isnt some explanation consistent with his record as a capitalist exploiter of the masses not that i can think of without more information she shook her head dont concern yourself with this at the moment its not much money and does not seem to be relevant to your task i think you should concentrate on that i just had this vision of his longlost son turning up as a wildeyed revolutionist in which case he would have known exactly who he was no true she turned to me and took my hand i need this business settled she said softly it is beginning to prey on my mind i have to start a new life not spend my days tidying up the old one please help me promise you will concentrate on the important of course i would anything once more as she held my hand and looked at me i wanted to reach out for her once more i did not but my resistance was already becoming enfeebled chapter i did not entirely ignore her request to concentrate on the lost child but my enquiries went nowhere over the next week or so and slowly i did what you do in such circumstances paid a young man at births and deaths to go through the registries week by week and month by month to see if any child had been registered naming ravenscliff as father the chances of this producing anything were small entries are named by the childs surname and it was more than likely that this one would not have his fathers name i made enquiries of foreign journalists in london about how to go about finding children in france spain italy and other places and wrote letters asking for assistance again this was unlikely to produce results quickly if at all but i was determined to do a thorough job after a week or so of this the only possibility left was to write to every orphanage in europe this i decided to put off for as long as possible then i returned to my interest in ravenscliffs money not least because i was beginning to find the topic of money in general quite interesting i had been working for lady ravenscliff for more than a month my bank account now had in it and every week my income so greatly exceeded my expenses that i even took to making out little columns of numbers calculating how much i would have this time next year or the year after that having money was very much more interesting than not having it i almost began to understand from a lowly point of view what made someone like ravenscliff tick one thing had occurred to me and that was that the start of ravenscliffs attempt to siphon funds out of his companies had come around the time that seyds had begun an investigation into rialto and suddenly dropped it the owner young seyd had been responsible for that decision wilf had said so it was reasonable to consider him for a while his father had trained him up for the business but as wilf had said he had no taste for it he was clever enough to leave well alone and appoint good people who knew their jobs then he withdrew his only connection was to attend the quarterly board meetings collect his dividends and put his name to all those forms which require a chairmans signature if i have conjured up the image of the typical secondgeneration owner slowly dissipating his fathers accumulated wealth in a life of indulgence and idle luxury then the image is entirely incorrect for young seyd had a secret life he was a vicar in the church of england to which calling he had been inclined since his earliest youth only the authority of a very determined father had stopped him from being ordained as young as possible and once that authority vanished young seyd had taken the cloth with almost unseemly haste it was a strange mixture pews and pulpits on the one hand and corporatised intelligence on the other but he seemed to reconcile the two with little difficulty crockfords clerical directory supplied all the information i needed to find him young seyd lived in salisbury i believe i am doing gods work in both he said with a smile once he had allowed me in with some obvious hesitation it must be said knowing their sins will be discovered helps to keep the men of wealth honest it means that the poor will be treated more justly and i must say that what i learned during my apprenticeship about the weaknesses of men and the temptations of power has prepared me well for life in the church i liked him i had not expected to as my opinion had been coloured in advance by wilfs scarcely concealed disapproval but young seyd his father had now been dead for more than a decade but the name persisted impressed me more of an eighteenthcentury vicar than a member of the newly reformed and muscular church of england not for him the business of evangelising workers or natives no seyd was happy to let men be if they came to him well and good but he did not believe he had any right to bother people unnecessarily he christened married and buried his parishioners he read his books and he lived a quiet contented life with his housekeeper a cat and many friends and he kept a distant eye on the doings of his company which was why i had gone to waterloo and taken a morning train to salisbury once i was in his house a fine new villa in manor road luxurious for a vicar but modest for the owner of a company and he had some tea brought for me i plunged straight into my tale there seemed little point in dissimulating to do so with such a decent man he was perhaps in his early forties then and was just beginning to show the effects in his body of a life without want was somehow unseemly also in the train as i had watched the wiltshire countryside pass in front of me i had rehearsed all possible ways of broaching the subject without broaching it if you understand me and got nowhere i could not discover any means of phrasing the questions which would get me the answers i wanted without being precise so i explained that i was writing a biography of ravenscliff for his widow although this was to be for private circulation only i said that she was allowing me unparalleled access to all his papers how some could not be found how wilf cornford had mentioned the abortive investigation by seyds of a year or so previously at this the reverend gentleman began to look uneasy but i continued anyway saying that it was most important and his wifes dearest wish that i should have access to everything there was to know its important for my work you understand but it might also be important for the executors of his will depending on what it contains that is these things seem to be terribly complicated yes yes and thank heavens they are otherwise seyds would have nothing to do at all so youll give me the report im so grateful to you and of course i will treat it in the strictest the reverend seyd held up his hand i am afraid that i cannot do that he said gently why not i was visited at my club in london by a man who explained that he would prefer this investigation to be discontinued and just because some total stranger you are also a total stranger he said and the first was more persuasive than you are how so he spread his hands in a gesture of resignation and he worked for ravenscliff i decided to do as he requested but what could he possibly say to make you do that by what right again he did not reply do you still have this report he shook his head i gathered up all the papers and brought them all here a fortnight later my house was burgled i see i said quietly and you think ravenscliff was responsible i do not know certainly it would be consistent with everything i knew about him he was a terrible man mr braddock utterly without principles or loyalties the atmosphere was so heavy it felt oppressive seyd had alarmed me but i was fascinated as well and here sitting in front of me with his dogcollar on was the first man to say something other than the standard line on ravenscliff fair decent a wonderful husband good employer kindly a wizard with money all that had been repeated endlessly finally i had found someone with a different view and he wasnt going to tell me why i decided then and there i wasnt going to leave until he had how far had the investigation progressed not far not far enough for anyone in london to make sense of it not even wilf cornford no one had yet put all the pieces together maybe they wouldnt have done but i put them together mr braddock he said defiantly i thought you had no connection with that sort of thing mr cornford has a low opinion of my expertise that is unwarranted i spent many years at my fathers side before his death and i learned a very great deal about the way the modern company operates he also taught me how to read balance sheets when most young children are playing games or struggling over their latin irregular verbs you must tell me what you found you must he shook his head i am who i say i am i continued in the vague hope it would make some difference a reporter a writer i want the truth that is all then you are an innocent or very brave i am neither if you wont tell me then at least answer some questions did your investigations deal with ravenscliff sucking vast sums of money out of his companies and defrauding his shareholders seyd was deathly quiet and looked at me carefully why do you say that because he was i said recklessly i discovered it it had already started by the time you shut down your inquiry is that why is that what you discovered as well not the best way of playing giving away your best cards with no guarantee of anything in exchange had seyd been more like ravenscliff he would have smiled snapped up the information and refused still to reply maybe he intended to but instead he said nothing at all he frowned rubbed his hands together in a jerky agitated movement put some sugar in his tea then a few moments later put some more in tasting the result brought him back no he said no it wasnt but it does explain why somebody wanted no investigation at that particular moment why was he doing this do you know you cant expect me to answer your questions if you dont answer mine you know that would be quite unfair i am trying to protect you so is everyone else i talk to very kind but i dont want to be protected i want to do a good job which everyone else also seems to think i am incapable of doing pride eh if you want do you know i was recommended for this job because my editor thinks i am a poor reporter whos he mcewen of the chronicle he looked interested at this but i continued and since then every conversation has started why you why you why you i am heartily sick of it spoken like a true twelveyearold he said gently i glared but mcewen is a good man how very curious and he fell into a thoughtful mood during which he poured some more tea into a clean cup do you consider yourself a patriot mr braddock a loyal englishman naturally i said somewhat surprised so much so that i never think about it yes few people do no doubt that will change in the coming years mr mcewen does think of it he is a good man and a trustworthy one you know him oh yes the change that had come over him had been slow but distinct apart from the ecclesiastical garb there was nothing of the vicar left in him the mild slightly slow mannerisms had been replaced by a precision which momentarily shocked me the investigation concerned lines of credit he began quietly that is the means by which ravenscliffs gigantic operations are funded the whole structure of his cash flow credits the loans he makes to others to buy his products where the money goes do you understand me so far he lends people money to buy his own goods what you see with ravenscliffs operations is the material side the factories the goods but there was also another side the banks and the finance money flowed into the banks was turned into goods which were sold and turned back into money again no one truly understood it but him no one can i think that is the main purpose in the last two decades ravenscliff devised a financial structure so complex it is all but impossible to penetrate but i have read the accounts no i do not know what you have seen but you have seen only partial accounts the profits or losses of one company mean nothing because they are part of a much greater whole which spreads throughout the world did you know that ravenscliff controlled some six banks in america and europe they were set up solely to organise financing for various deals there are other accounts in other banks dozens and dozens under the control of the chief salesman xanthos which exist solely to bribe foreign officials buy presents purchase favours ive met him i said and no doubt found him a charming little fellow ah yes i did are you going to tell me something different he is a crook he pays bribes to whoever needs them a pimp who supplies prostitutes to willing civil servants when required a thief who steals the details of other companies bids for contracts a fraud who falsifies details of his products capabilities whatever is necessary to win an order mr xanthos will do it hes a trader from the bazaar with an oriental regard for the truth that was his value to ravenscliff who looked the other way so he did not know how these orders came about ravenscliff took care of the big bribes i could read it all you know they had a sort of signature and i came to know the style of each of them by the end xanthos used several banks mainly the bank of bruges in belgium but also one in milan and others in bucharest manchester lyon and dusseldorf are you sure he did not answer we started to unravel all this thread by thread but couldnt see the point of it that was what was so puzzling what was it all for why had he made everything so complicated no one could discover it wilf cornford wondered whether it was all the doing of caspar neuberger the director of finance who loves complexity for its own sake but i wasnt satisfied so i looked further i hope you are not going to stop telling me now i will tell you if you truly wish i do you know what a submarine is of course beswick shipyard developed one of the earliest that was in any way a practical weapon the americans were the first but beswick came soon after for the most part they were more of a danger to their own crew than to anyone else but beswick got a contract from the government to develop a new radical design which could carry torpedoes beswick as you may know also owns the gosport torpedo company and it was looking for new markets the royal navy decided to buy some and fund the development the contract with the government was that this should be entirely secret and above all that there should be no sales none at all to foreign governments not like the torpedo then precisely they had learned their lesson the navy realised even at that early stage that this new vessel might become a formidable weapon ravenscliff gave his word six months later he was building a dockyard for the russians who were then our most bitter enemies to build submarines torpedoes and anything else they wanted that was the moment his finances became opaque and the reason to conceal any sign of treason i looked carefully at him are you serious you dont mean to tell me that no one noticed when was this at the start of the s ravenscliff built up the russian navy to the point that it could challenge the royal navy in the black sea all this long before britain and russia became allies and when it was one of our most dangerous enemies did anyone notice no nothing could be traced back to ravenscliff at all the money was raised through bond issues in paris the companies were registered in several different countries with the shares owned by companies set up for the purpose their owners in turn being hidden there was not a single thing to suggest that ravenscliff had anything to do with these factories so how did you discover it that is what we do and as is often the case the weak spot was the human side of things the expertise you dont just build a factory put in a bunch of illiterate peasants and start turning out complex weapons you need people to train the workforce to oversee things not many the russians already had many engineers but they had little managerial expertise and that was ravenscliffs speciality i found some of the people who had worked at the yard and they all came from beswick eventually one only one told me the whole story and then you received a visitor as you say and now you know the story as well so you had better be careful ravenscliff was utterly singleminded he is dead but his spirit as they say lives on in people like xanthos and neuberger and bartoli he chose them and trained them the company embodies his methods it is alive and can work without him you might say he transferred his soul into it so that he will live as long as his companies exist it is the only form of immortality a man like that could expect and more than he deserves did you ever meet him seyd shook his head never i got to know him through numbers it is not a bad way of making an acquaintance and safer what did your numbers tell you you see i am having trouble what was it all for im a simple man myself i dream of a house and a garden and a wife i want enough money never to have to worry i do not want to end up in the poor house or a paupers grave ravenscliff had all that decades ago what did he want seyd looked thoughtfully at the carpet well he said not money i really think he had no great interest in money that is often the case with these people not fame or position either he took the peerage with the greatest of reluctance and never sought any sort of public role few people had ever heard of him and he liked it like that what does that leave power no i dont think so ive no doubt it pleased his vanity but not greatly no i believe his motivation was pleasure i beg your pardon seyd smiled pleasure mr braddock not something usually associated with heavy industry or armaments i know but he seems to have approached what he did rather as an engineer approaches a problem or an artist a picture he took pleasure in creating something that was harmonious integrated and balanced he could have been an architect i think or maybe he would have liked these new crosswords where the delight lies solely in solving the puzzle he liked taking an insuperable problem and conquering it ive no doubt he liked the admiration that generated and certainly never refused any profits but i suspect he would not have done it had he gained no delight from it you might even call him an aesthete the pleasure was in the mind he set out to create the most perfect organisation the world has ever seen and he succeeded numbers tell you that they hint the rest is guesswork and experience i think i am more confused than ever maybe so but it is the only explanation of ravenscliff which answers now you know what i know in an abbreviated version what are you going to do about it knowing him through numbers what do mine tell you i summarised what the single file had contained seyd listened attentively frowning in concentration as i spoke so hes burning up his cash is he well i would rule out fraud if i were you why he was too elegant a man to be fraudulent in that way it is too crude for him so he was using the money for something what how should i know you seem to have taken that task on yourself find out if you want and if you can the interview was over all reporters with a little experience know when there is no more information to be extracted and i knew that i had got as much out of young seyd as he was able or willing to give i stood up the vicar out of politeness stood as well he did not urge me to stay to sit down again i walked to the door then turned one question then which you should not mind answering the man who came to see you at your club what was he like seyd considered trying to find an objection but coming up with nothing he was in his late forties fair hair thinning on top medium build no moustache or beard a large unusually large mouth entirely unremarkable i do not know who he was and have never seen him again chapter i got back to london at eight that evening and went straight to the ravenscliff residence i had nothing particular to do there no reason not to go home via a chop house or pub for a good nights sleep the only reason i went to st jamess square rather than chelsea was because i wanted to see her i was almost aware of it i did not of course have a key but i had been given free run of the house and could go in and out as i pleased i noticed a slight hesitation when the door was opened as though the servant thought it unbecoming for a young man to turn up to a house of mourning so late in the evening she was probably right i asked about her mistress and was told she had already retired for the evening which made my heart fall i then realised there was nothing i wished to do there but i could hardly turn on my heel and leave so i walked up the stairs to ravenscliffs office to make a pretence of studying his papers i did nothing instead i sat in the armchair by the empty fireplace and thought about its owner an aesthete and an ascetic from seyds description building his complex incomprehensible organisation in such a way that almost no one in the world could appreciate it perhaps that would have spoiled it maybe the secrecy of what he was doing was the source of the pleasure or not i didnt know i was a long way out of my depth in a matter of days my orderly life had been reduced to a complete mess not so long ago all i had to do was get up write about crime generally committed by simple straightforward people and go back to bed again and what was the dominant thought in my mind the eyes of a widow nearly twice my age her faint smell of perfume the way she moved the glimpse of skin above her expensive handmade dress the softness of her voice what she had said to me what it implied what it might lead to what i hoped awful awful awful i groaned to myself as i thought about it truly my a year would be hardearned if it went on like this ordinarily i would have done as i had done so often before made a list decided what the most important things were to get done and then proceed singlemindedly to do them i tried to dismiss the thoughts of elizabeth from my mind and think once more of lady ravenscliff to work out some practical means of getting this job done quickly so i could be free to go back to the chronicle or some other paper which might have me but once i did that then the result was even more depressing for the fact was that i had made no real progress at all i looked blankly at the shelves of notes and files i was sure there was something in there somewhere but the idea of actually looking for it filled me with revulsion i think i must have stayed there for about an hour it was quiet and peaceful and after a while it almost became comforting there was a photograph of ravenscliff on the mantelpiece i took it out of its frame and looked at it for a long while trying to fathom the character behind the face before folding it and putting it in my pocket and eventually i was able to lever myself out of the chair and prepare to rejoin the world to go home to sleep and then to start afresh the next morning it wasnt so bad the worst that could happen would be failure id still have my i was almost content as i went back down the grand staircase walking slowly looking at the pictures on the walls as i passed i knew nothing of such things they seemed perfectly pleasant decorations to me but as i was passing the door to the sitting room i heard a noise nothing exceptional just a bump and a scrape i knew it must be her and i hesitated all my anxiety and irresolution flooded back a sensible person would have carried on down the stairs discipline and selfdenial should have been called upon a commonsensical realisation that the only way of returning to my mood of calm was to avoid the woman disturbing it as much as possible keep her at arms length be polite and professional i didnt want to be or to do any of those things i knocked quietly and tentatively on the door and then pressed my ear against it nothing so what do you do now i asked myself tiptoe away like some nervous schoolboy that would be humiliating even if no one else knew about it is that how bold wouldbe lovers behave or open the door and walk in i had a right she had looked at me my heart was pounding and i was almost breathless as i gripped the doorknob turned and pushed the room was dark the curtains drawn only a fire almost extinguished in the grate and a candle the expensive modern electrical lighting was not switched on i thought i must have been mistaken until i heard a voice so quiet i could hardly make out the words who is it it was her but the voice sounded entirely different dull and without the musicality that normally made it so appealing slightly slurred as though i had woken her up from a deep sleep oh its you she said as i stepped into the room and the light from the landing fell on my face enough for her to recognise me come and sit down shut the door the light hurts my eyes this was not what i had expected going into the room so dark i could see only shades and shadows in the candlelight was disconcerting even slightly frightening are you all right you do not sound well she laughed softly and looked up at me for the first time her hair was unpinned and fell down over her shoulders in a rich dark mass she wore some sort of thin gown which shimmered slightly as she moved embroidered in reds and blues japanese motifs very fashionable she was extravagantly impossibly beautiful i caught my breath as i looked at her for her eyes were darker than usual the pupils wide almost as though she was terrified of something what is the matter she laid her head on the back of the settee and pushed her hair back over her ear but said nothing just smiled please tell me its nothing a little medicine to calm my nerves it is strong and i havent used it for many many years perhaps you need a doctor for a different prescription i could summon one very quickly if you wish she smiled again and looked at me with what might have been affection or indulgence or even sympathy it is not the sort of medicine which needs a doctor matthew she pulled back the sleeve of her robe and i could see a broad red mark around her upper arm below it there was wound with a trickle of dried blood coming from it she laughed again at my incomprehension oh my god i have employed the most innocent man in london she said you poor dear boy you really know nothing at all i must have been looking horrified by this stage so she became more serious herself morphine matthew she said soberly the great releaser the comforter of tormented souls i would have been shocked had i had the time to arrange my thoughts but in fact i wasnt thinking anything at all at that moment i just sat there closer to her than i had ever been my heart pounding do i frighten you or do you frighten yourself she asked but not in a way which suggested she wanted a reply shall i tell you what you are thinking no reply from me i was so far out of my depth i knew that the faintest wriggle might cause me to sink and drown you have been thinking of me night and day you dream of me of wanting to take me into your arms and kiss me that is what you would say were you able to say anything at all you are silent now but in your mind some part of you is trying to turn it to your advantage perhaps this is your opportunity perhaps i would not resist if you leaned forward and took me now but you dont want merely to kiss me of course you want to make love to me you dream of me becoming your mistress you long to see me naked in front of you wanting only to be possessed by you is that not true dearest matthew her voice was entirely even there was nothing in its tone or expression to suggest whether she was enticing or mocking or both perhaps was so drugged i could hardly imagine her talking like this had she not been she didnt even know herself either way her words and actions paralysed me of course everything she said was entirely true but there was cruelty in her saying it are you lost for words matthew do you think that if you say something it might be the wrong thing and ruin a moment full of such wonderful possibilities are you so very timid and naïve with women that you do not know what to do next then she put her hand round the back of my neck and pulled my head towards her and whispered words into my ear such as i had never heard from the mouth of a woman before even the very lowest hissing almost serpentlike her voice became making me feel even more like a prey being immobilised so i took hold of her and began to kiss her becoming ever more rough as she not only did not resist but responded only when my hands moved down to touch her body did she stiffen then push me away and stood up she walked over to the fireplace and looked into the mirror a few moments i must ask you to leave she said without even turning round what she gave me no answer what had gone wrong what had i done i was sure i had made no terrible error if i had been unduly forward it was only on her provocation and she knew it so what had happened it is late and i am tired no youre not get out elizabeth get out she screamed and wheeled round at me her face ablaze picking up the blue bowl from the mantelpiece that bowl the one she had used to humiliate me to put me in my place it served its purpose again as it crashed into the wall behind me and shattered into a hundred pieces she was terrifying i was terrified then the fury drained from her face and she became calm again it was as though i wasnt there as if she was talking to herself perhaps it was the drug that was causing this whole thing maybe i had come under the influence of it as well and this was all some nightmare i must try and sleep tonight i hope i can then she started talking in french and i understood not one word of what she was saying eventually i realised she had completely forgotten about me didnt even realise i was there i slipped out of the room and out of the house i was shaking chapter by the morning i felt terrible and had convinced myself i was completely to blame she was a widow still in shock i had tried to take advantage of her i had wanted to in any case the drugs repelled me i knew they existed of course you couldnt be a crime reporter without coming across them but to see a woman like her so reduced was a terrible thing it made her all the more fascinating as well i was more obsessed than ever failure is more beguiling than success all i could think of was what might have happened and i relived the scene in my mind again and again each time with a different outcome i thought of it so much and so intently that i halffelt i was going mad as i tossed and turned on my uncomfortable bed hoping desperately that sleep would come and relieve me eventually i got up it was still only half past five in the morning and there was no one else up in the house i tiptoed out the last thing i wanted was to come across anyone else and have to talk and walked out i drank some tea at a stall in the kings road there to serve the delivery men on their rounds but could not face the idea of eating anything at halfpast seven i was in st jamess square far too early to knock on the door but with nothing else to do i was determined to return and talk but i had to wait i walked round in circles sometimes fast sometimes dawdling a passing policeman looked at me carefully i went into st jamess piccadilly but the air of holiness had no effect on me at all i looked into the shop windows sat in piccadilly circus watching people pass by as they hurried to work it was raining slightly and i was getting wet but i didnt notice i was only aware that i was damp and cold but it might have been happening to someone else and eventually i decided that the time had come and that i could properly knock on the door it was twenty past eight good heavens sir whatever has happened has there been an accident it was one of the maids a cheerful plump girl with a country accent who let me in the sort who in another life i might have taken a shine to no why do you ask as i took off my coat i turned slightly and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and knew precisely why she asked i looked terrible i had not shaved my clothes were rumpled my shirt collar dirty i had bags under my eyes from exhaustion and there was an unhealthy grey pallor to my skin i looked very much as if id been in an accident i panicked i couldnt possibly put my carefully thoughtout conversation into action looking like that i wanted to seem calm reasonable man of the world and i looked like a tramp that was why the policeman had been looking at me in such a professional way i think id better leave her ladyship asked me to take you to the sitting room when you arrived said the maid she said you were expected can you find your own way i was being anticipated and outthought at every step so i was that predictable she must have given that order before she even went to bed so easy it was to read my mind i felt a sudden surge of anger but i did as i was told i was perfectly free to leave i could easily have said that i had changed my mind and walked out i could easily have acted outside her plan and surprised her regained the initiative by showing i was not so simple but i desperately wanted to see her i had absolutely to see her otherwise i thought i might collapse certainly all the time in between would be merely wasted an interval before i was again in the same room with her it was the only thing that mattered so up i went and was brought coffee on a silver tray with cream and sugar and some toast which i ate the fire was lit and i dried myself i tided up my clothes as best i could only the stubble on my chin reminded me of what i must look like certainly elizabeth did not when she came in she shut the door came over with her arms open and a smile on her face and kissed me on the cheek how wonderful to see you matthew i am so glad you came wrongfooted again i had anticipated the capricious cruelty of the night before had considered the possibility of coldness and distance even an apologetic embarrassment i had hoped that she too had had no sleep i did not imagine that she would act like a society lady welcoming a friend all my preparations my preformed speeches collapsed uselessly your ladyship i said stiffly she looked at me with an affected air of pique and distress she was entirely herself again with the passing of the drug from her bloodstream she was once again vivacious lively entirely in control of herself and the situation she also looked as if she had slept well apparently that is one of the benefits of morphine if it is taken carefully come and sit by me while you finish your breakfast are you well you look a little haggard she added i sat in the armchair feeling myself to be behaving rudely as i did so she was pushing me into revealing myself as petulant and immature i didnt like that youre upset she said this time seriously and gently i suppose you must be i remained silent will you forgive me i know i behaved appallingly please believe me when i say that i intended no hurt you are the very last person in the world i would wish to upset i suppose you are going to say you dont know what came over you that it was all the fault of the of the drugs i said stiffly no i wasnt going to say that at all she said sadly she did not look at me i could not have stood that it was too crude a weapon for her to use however effective it would have been i had hoped you would have understood she said when it became clear i was not going to say anything at all but you dont no now she did look at me but not in the way she had done the night before this time her gaze seemed wholly innocent and regretful still i did not dare meet it you poor young man she continued does it sound condescending if i say that of course it does it isnt it is merely the truth shall i speak plainly then in an unladylike way shock you some more with the way i talk of subjects which you think i should be too refined to mention i have seen the look on your face you know there is little you can hide from me however skilled you may think yourself i suppose i must have glowered at her as eventually she continued at the moment you are confused and angry you wished to make love to me i encouraged you then capriciously changed my mind you thought you knew what was going on inside me but in fact you understood nothing at all otherwise you would realise i was trying to protect you i do not need to be protected by you i said stiffly not by me from me she corrected look at you one small misunderstanding and you are a wreck you have been obsessed with me all night you havent slept you look like a tramp do you know how easy it would be to ruin you utterly i dont think thats because you do not know what you are talking about there was a long break as the maid came in with another tray of coffee elizabeth thanked the woman and watched as the coffee was poured talking to her as she waited i in contrast said nothing at all acutely aware that i was radiating misery from my chair eventually the maid left and the door was shut elizabeth sipped her cup thoughtfully for a while then put it down do you not think it strange that a widow grieving for her recently lost husband should behave in such a way or did you merely think that foreigners must be like that not at all proper like the english i am angry matthew and frightened and last night i wished to take it out on someone as i say i am ashamed of myself but not for any reason you might have imagined what do you mean john died in the stupidest way imaginable he was careless thoughtless his moment of absentmindedness means i have to spend the rest of my life without him obviously i knew that would happen eventually he was much older than i was but i wanted more time with him the only person in the world i have ever truly cared for ever i had a debt to repay he fell out of a window and robbed me of my chance i wanted to punish him but i cant of course so i thought id pick on you she stopped and i opened my mouth to reply but realised i didnt know what to say its very easy a glance here a suggestive movement a provocative question and your sleep evaporates and you take on that look of tailwagging devotion that i detest so much john was dead but i could easily replace him although not with someone half as good as he was please dont think i thought all this through that i was simply playing with your affections i didnt know what i was doing and then last night i came to my senses only just though do you really think it would have been better had i allowed you to make love to me it would only have postponed the rejection and made it ten times worse when it came it was vain and cruel of me i apologise for that without reservation but i do not apologise for saving you from the consequences of your naïveté you are no match for me matthew only john has ever been that you have a high opinion of yourself no she said sadly a very low one i dont understand a word you are talking about i suppose you dont one day when you are as old as i am you are beautiful the words rushed out of me they sounded stupid she smiled once that would have pleased me she said words like that truly meant were like gold to me when i was young now i no longer care you loved him yes she said very much why she sighed and looked across the square at all those people whose lives were nothing like her own she seemed almost interested in them he was my comfort my friend my warmth the fixed point of a turning world always there she stopped and looked at me almost mischievously i have had lovers you know in the past decade or so i do hope i have managed to shock you again im learning i replied but i have never loved anyone else do you understand the difference i have had neither the money or the leisure to explore such subtleties censorious well perhaps you are right but there is a big difference i hope you discover what it is one day because you will never truly love someone until you do she fell silent again a look of terrible sadness on her face do you believe me when i say i want you to find this child or do you think there is some other motive behind it i really dont know any more i do want it when john died it was a terrible shock i suppose i still am in shock i have lost him for ever but when i read the will do you know what my reaction was anger shame disillusionment maybe all of them none of them i was happy there was a piece of him still alive somewhere i dreamed of finding this child i imagined a tenyearold boy sometimes sometimes a young woman about the same age as i was when i met john i hoped there were many children even getting to know them bringing them to live with me having a family in this world because i have nothing now nothing of importance just wealth beyond the dreams of avarice it is all johns fault you see i looked puzzled he taught me the pleasures of love and companionship of trusting people and knowing them before that when i was young it was all just a game who you knew how you made your way in the world there was no time or space for real warmth john gave me a world of affection and i fell in love with that as much as i fell in love with him do you know the pleasure of doing nothing with someone of simply sitting in the same room with them or of going for a walk where neither talks he taught me that and now it is all gone and the world is my reality again i am frightened and alone matthew more than a man like you can even imagine and you never had children she shook her head gently i fell pregnant a year or so after we married i was so happy i couldnt believe it i used to just sit and clutch myself and cry with the joy of it i thought my life would be complete what happened it was born and they took it away from me she shook her head the midwife wrapped it up put it by the fire to keep it warm and sat around to keep it company until it died they didnt let me see it again its what they do did you know that i said nothing the doctors told me that i couldnt have any more that another pregnancy might kill me so she said brightly her eyes shining that was my chance you see it took years to recover fully john stayed with me every moment every second brought me back to myself as close as i could get anyway i lost my dreams then and they never came back i will find this child for you i said if it lives do you doubt it many children die young i said there was a very long pause she sat silently thoughtfully and i realised that i was back back in her power again if you want to put it like that tell me i said after a while what do you know about the state of your husbands companies at present she was not interested that his shareholdings are in the hands of the executor and will remain so until this is settled precisely i took the buff folder out of the bag i had begun to carry around with me look at this she did as instructed but quickly just long enough to register incomprehension this indicates that a large amount of money has been removed from them it also perhaps explains why the announcement of his death was delayed how so have you seen the list of prominent shareholders theyd lose a fortune if shares in rialto declined half the politicians in the land have bought shares she looked scornful bought she said with a snort you dont think they bought them do you how else then i realised what she was saying i know little of the details of johns business but i know how the world works these were gifts inducements bribes if you want to be honest about it they wanted rewards for giving him contracts he obliged because he could remind them of his generosity if necessary and now of course i can do the same her eyes very briefly flashed with excitement then they dulled again i do not intend to she said but you are right it is a reason for mr cort to become so interested and the money that i do not know do you realise the implications of this folder perhaps but maybe you should tell me it means that your inheritance will be very much less than you imagine indeed if news of it comes out the companies could collapse and you would be left with nothing at all i see she seemed to be taking it all very calmly is your knowledge of the law as good as your knowledge of finance they are both equally feeble as you know in this case i am going on what your husbands solicitor told me so what should i do i dont think there is anything you can do dear me what a time this is she said with a smile you tell me one day i am about to become the richest woman in the world and the next tell me i am to be a pauper no one can accuse you of precision there are many things i do not understand here i will tell you them if you wish then you have to take a decision do you want me to pursue them or do you want me to concentrate on the original matter of the child go ahead then confuse me some more was you husband interested in spiritualism she stared at me spiritualism yes you know tableturning séances auras from the beyond that sort of thing this finally woke her up she threw back her head and laughed john tableturning of course he wasnt he was the most practical downtoearth materialistic person i have ever known he had no interest or belief in such things none at all why he didnt even go to church then why was he attending spiritualist meetings im sure he was not im sure he was listen i read out some notes i had taken from his appointment book madame boninska she said when i was finished otherwise known as the witchwoman she was found murdered two days after your husband died i had silenced her this time she had nothing to say she wanted to find it all amusing but could not manage it why would your husband consult a medium the obvious next question is whether there is any connection with her death or his let me tell you a story she said a long time ago when i was young and beautiful i lived in paris i lived a fine life and often invited people for dinner friends and acquaintances politicians writers musicians that is the origin of xanthoss rather inflated notions of me it amused me greatly and when i encountered john i invited him i wanted to show off i suppose perhaps even make him jealous although i had no notion that he was anything other than an acquaintance at the time a pleasing man a good companion someone with whom i felt comfortable anyway he came although not often he didnt approve of idle conversation with artists and gradually his scepticism made me feel it was a foolish way of spending my life as well one evening he took me for dinner at a restaurant with some of his business associates and some of mine they didnt mix very well a doctor began talking about hypnotism which he practised on his patients and mentioned spiritualism auras and emanations he took it seriously and offered to take everyone to a séance with a medium who was then in the city this was the time when madame blavatsky was causing such a stir and there were many imitators of her around do you remember blavatsky i read about her for background it is of no consequence some of the other guests were enthusiastic about the idea and started talking about spirituality and the poverty of the modern age which had taken the poetry out of mens souls i leave you to imagine the sort of thing nothing could provoke john more he became quite angry and the fact that i was willing to go to this séance made him angrier still he always held that such things were the selfindulgent foolishness of the decadent or the miserable superstition of the peasant mans future lay with the roar of a blast furnace not with the rattling of a teacup it appalled him that grown men were willing to countenance what he considered to be obvious charlatanry it was the first time i had seen him angry and i thought it strange he should become so agitated over something if he thought it so absurd of course it wasnt really about that at all it was about me what i was what he wanted me to be we had our first fight then and there it was undignified embarrassing and convinced me he truly loved me did you do you agree with him in my youth i was interested in all these things it was a fashionable amusement and i imagine it still is in my case it was the same as playing bridge something to amuse a company of guests where we could all act out our roles everyone acted as though they believed it because they thought everyone else did believe it not that that matters the point is that john had nothing but scorn for any of that sort of thing and he was not a man to change his mind so it is not possible that say he might have consulted a medium in the hope of discovering the identity of this child perhaps of talking to it if he had known it was dead john so overcome with grief at the loss of a child he had not cared about enough to discover talking to shades through a charlatan no not a chance in the world but he went so you tell me if you can discover why and it does not distract you from the main line of enquiry then do so let it be another surprise to add to the ones i am already having to deal with is there anything else and the morphine that is none of your business there was a chilly finality in her tone which brooked no objection she made me feel like some sort of impertinent servant and i think i reddened with embarrassment she did not help me out and cover over my mistake instead she instantly reverted to a formality a businesslike manner to indicate that i was being punished i noticed that this was one of her many weapons in dealing with men she would become intimate friendly imply a closeness then pull back and revert to formality her grasp of language was flawless in that regard she could hint at intimacy or distance friendship or disapproval in the mixture of tone and language and gesture the slightest suggestion of disapproval and i was prepared to do anything to win back her favour i do not think this was considered on her part she could not help behaving in such a way i wasnt completely ready to be selfeffacing though if she could be stiff then so could i you have instructed me to forget about your husbands payment of money to anarchists i continued i suppose you know more than i do and think this is irrelevant as well please say what you want and i will obey your wishes oh matthew im sorry she said beseechingly instantly warm again please do not be angry with me even if i am angry with you you are a bringer of evil tidings you know you cannot expect me to be happy with what you tell me and not feel resentful it is not your fault my life has become a nightmare in the past few weeks but it has i ask you to be gentle with me you are not gentle with me im sorry if i have hurt you in any way it was not my intention please believe that i did not but the very words spoken gently and with warmth made hope fill me once more and undid all the good work i had done in convincing myself that our relationship was one of employer and employee nothing more of course i do i said reading this over i seem like a fool perhaps i was i have already explained that elizabeth came from a world of which i knew nothing i suppose it is evident that my disdain and suspicion were matched from the beginning by an equal fascination her whole way of life the money the servants the clothes the paintings the leisure the sheer plenty was intoxicating to associate with it was impossible to separate her from those surroundings but i think she would have been every bit as intriguing had she been very much poorer she was captivating the moods the flashes of anger and equal bursts of kindness the way she moved from vulnerability to a steely determination the sense of humour that could give way to sudden seriousness her unpredictability was hypnotic even in the way she treated others like mrs vincotti it wasnt pleasant but it made me sensible that she did not treat me like that not often at least it made me feel special i basked in it because i needed it it was a sensation i had never experienced before and when all was over it was something precious i took away with me she made people men let us be clear feel better than they were more capable more handsome more worthwhile it was not fraudulent a technique she had to bend others to her will so she might get what she wanted although it was that as well it was i am convinced quite genuine a sort of generosity even though it was something that she used to her own advantage one last thing then the money what about it it has obviously gone somewhere it might be helpful to discover where if that can be done my friend franklin no she said sharply absolutely not you gave me your word that you would maintain a complete discretion and you must keep to that but this is a very specialised matter i tried to explain account books high finance that sort of thing i know nothing about it and it wasnt what you hired me for if you had known you needed someone to ferret out the secrets of a balance sheet i have no doubt you would not have chosen me you are an intelligent man matthew and we must make the best of what is available i do not say it would not be helpful to have expert help merely that you must not breathe a word of this to anyone franklin i thought to myself with a groan seyd both knew and understood even more than i did i thought i could rely on both of them but what if i was wrong what if franklin decided to show off at work maybe curry favour with his superiors i think you should unload your holdings of rialto investment i do not know how much franklin grasped i said splitting the difference between candour and dissimulation in an equitable fashion i felt a little warm around the collar as i spoke and she looked at me enquiringly i hoped i was a better liar than i felt i was sure that i could prevail on franklin to keep quiet after all anyone else and my editor hinted that some people consider you to be an agent for the dual alliance and are alarmed that much of the empires capacity for manufacturing weapons has fallen into your hands it hasnt she said shortly at present it has fallen into the hands of the executor where it will stay until these matters are resolved i looked at her curiously ah i said discover this child mr braddock she said with a faint smile and the thanks of the kaiser will be yours i looked at her aghast she sighed with exasperation a joke matthew a joke oh right good chapter after i left elizabeth i went round the corner to the pub to breathe in rancid air of normality and to order my thoughts please do not think that there was much chance of this i will edit much from the account and describe only those facts which concerned the matter of lord ravenscliff in fact they occupied my mind for only the smallest fraction of my time the rest was taken up almost obsessively with my feelings for his wife i will not dwell on them anyone who has been in my situation will understand all too well anyone who has not will be unable to imagine it so i will instead pretend that with clear head and reasoned thought i applied myself to writing down in my little notebook the facts and the theories one stood out the circumstances which led to the impossibility of finding this child meant that control of ravenscliffs business empire had fallen semipermanently into the hands of the executor and who was this michael cardano exactly the more i thought about it the more excited i got what about corts intervention when ravenscliff died he had concealed the fact for three days and with the time bought had arranged for barings bank to intervene and prop up the share price had the price collapsed the city would have wanted a full accounting reassurance that the businesses were sound and in such an atmosphere it might easily have been discovered that they were not sound at all even worse perhaps regrettable information about the integrity of many senior politicians might also have been revealed a crisis in government together with the collapse of the greatest manufacturer of weapons in the country not an ideal preparation for a trial of strength against our greatest foe it was easy to see how a man like cort might have considered the theft of a folder of papers a small thing to avert such a calamity and i assumed from my limited knowledge of the subject through reading spy novels that breaking into a house and stealing papers was simple enough that was one question answered to my satisfaction although perhaps not completely but there were many others the big one of course was the money i had not learned a great deal about finance from franklin but i knew that if a large sum of money is extracted from a company it has to go somewhere where did ravenscliffs millions go then there were the lesser problems of the anarchists and the spiritualist why was ravenscliff associating with people for whom i assumed he had nothing but contempt to that last question i had no answer but as i did not have the expertise even to begin tackling the first ones i decided this would be the place to start someone like the witchwoman was very much in my line of business i had covered the murder after all i closed my notebook stuffed it in my pocket and drained my beer i still had my scribbled notes on the story so i read them as the omnibus clattered towards tottenham court road the witchwoman had not been a particularly successful member of her trade largely because of personality i had not managed to get anyone to give an opinion as to the quality of her aura or the respectability of her spiritual intercessors although she went under the name of madame boninska this was obviously a fake all people claiming to be mediums adopted names like that and dropped heavy hints about gypsy blood and exotic lineage it was expected no one would ever believe that someone born in tooting bec would have much skill in dealing with the farbeyond her real name and age remained a mystery the police doctors guessed she must have been at least in her sixties although they freely said off the record that her bloated and ancient carcass was so raddled by the effects of drink that she could have been ten years younger or ten years older nor was her real identity ever discovered all that was known was that she had arrived in england a few months before her death and had previously plied her trade in parts of germany and france offering her services to the gullible who went to places like badenbaden or vichy they had little enough to do were glad of the distraction and she had made a decent living there was a slight suspicion that she had also supplied more human intercessors for the comfort of male customers but that was never pinned down why she had abandoned the continent for london was unknown but abandon it she had and had set up above a shop selling umbrellas from which vantage point she began to make her living giving personal appointments to solve problems or group sessions for reasons which escaped me but seemed to be little more than light entertainment on rare occasions she made house calls but preferred to receive her clients in her room which was decorated in dark colours with aromatic candles burning all day and night and windows permanently shrouded in heavy curtains the police investigation revealed why she did not like to perform elsewhere she would have had to try and convince her customers without the benefit of all the little bits of trickery and stagecraft that were found stacked in the next room the cupboards with fake doors the bells with string so they could tinkle mysteriously controlled by unseen forces the source of a mysterious purple light which looked as though it had been bought from a theatre the echo chambers so her assistant could make the noises of spiritual beings unseen by the rest the woman was a total fraud in other words and it was unfortunate that we reporters who love a good tale of human foolishness printed all this in cheerful detail before the police managed to interview her clients as many of them refused to come forward out of simple embarrassment if she had ever had an appointments book it had vanished as well as had the assistant who it emerged had been a prostitute trying to improve herself all in all then a squalid business as was her death for she had been strangled with the velvet tie of the robe she wore when performing the murderer had acted with force and thoroughness making sure of the matter by then crushing her skull with a heavy brass candlestick there had been little struggle the room was hardly disarranged at all and it was unclear when the murder had taken place there was a suggestion that the assistant whose name was mary might have come back shortly afterwards someone thought they had seen her in the street but if so she had then fled rather than contact the police which was unfortunate as the police never for a moment considered that she might have been responsible with her had gone the most valuable source of information for she alone of the living might have known who had come that afternoon at what time madame boninska had probably been killed and why for nobody else had seen anything that day and without her evidence there was no chance of solving the case more alarmingly perhaps i realised i had given lady ravenscliff some slightly inaccurate information madame boninska had been found two days after her husband fell from his window but the police doctors were not at all certain when she had actually been killed the degree of uncertainty meant it could have been before ravenscliff had dropped from the window perhaps after the police had concentrated their limited efforts on finding mary who was the only one who could enlighten them and when they proved unsuccessful had more or less given up their collective opinion was that she would turn up eventually and they could reopen the case when she did until then they had other things to worry about i had not been excessively diligent murders are rare and it did have some of the exotic characteristics which turn a squalid death into an interesting story but in general we follow the police lead unless there is good reason not to do so in this case the official reasoning seemed sound the girl was crucial and there was not much to be done until she rematerialised i wrote a sidebar on mediums and a piece on the fashion for the occult while i waited for some development but could push it no further if they couldnt find her there wasnt much chance i could and i did not have the leisure to try now i did and i also had a very much better reason to do so than a few column inches in the chronicle so i prepared to do all those reporterly things that i had omitted first time round the first thing was to talk to the neighbours the police had already done that and i had seen their notes one night in the pub but i was now interested in different questions they had asked if anyone had been seen arriving or leaving on the day of the murder to which the answer had been no no one in particular but i was now interested in two days previously as well when ravenscliffs diary said he had an appointment this wasnt likely to lead to much but i wanted confirmation that he had gone there so i called in at the umbrella shop as the proprietor had been the most useful of interviewees to the police and i hoped he would prove the same for me he was the only person in fact who had noticed anything at all and had been the one who had discovered the body it was rent day and he had gone to collect as the lady was too uninterested in the material things of this world to take the mundane matter of paying debts too seriously he had refused to go away kept on knocking and had eventually gone in she apparently had something of a history of pretending to be out when he came to call and she was three months in arrears mr philpot was the sort of man who had no first name the sort whose wife addresses him as mr philpot after they have finished making love if they ever do he is the butt of jokes from his betters who scorn his ilk for their respectability and lack of imagination and utter dullness the very epitome of the english lower middle classes a shopkeeper with standards to maintain and a small place in society to defend i liked him i have always liked the philpots of this world with their honesty and trustworthiness and decency i even like their smallmindedness for they are content with what is theirs and proud of the little they have only if that is threatened do they become testy but what group of mankind does not they respect their betters and fear those below them they go to church and reverence the king and sweep the pavement outside their shops every morning all they want is to be left alone and in return they provide the nation with all of its substance and solidity if a factory worker kills his wife or an aristocrat fathers a child it is scarcely remarked upon if a philpot does so it is a shock philpots are held to higher standards than most of mankind and on the whole they live up to them so i was predisposed to like mr philpot in his neat waistcoat with the armbands keeping the cuffs of his glistening white shirt out of harms way with his meticulous little moustache and welltrimmed fingernails and shining black shoes and to like his shop with its hundreds and hundreds of umbrellas every single one of them black with only the handles each one pointing outwards like a row of grenadier guards on display allowing just the slightest hint of flamboyance to brighten up the dark oak of the counters and floor philpot made me feel as though the world was in good hands until i met elizabeth i had taken it for granted that i should eventually marry the daughter of a philpot who would be as diligent in the home as her father was at work we talked for some time before i introduced the subject of his erstwhile tenant it is always best to do so if possible to establish your credentials as a decent upright man i sympathised with his embarrassment and consternation at suddenly finding his shop mentioned in the newspapers in connection with such a terrible event the shame of the neighbours discovering that he had rented out his little flat to a charlatan and a prostitute it might be that eventually he would live it down but his good name had been tainted and i only let her have the place out of the goodness of my heart he protested i couldnt see anyone else renting her anything and she pleaded with me not to throw her out when i discovered what she was up to when i let her have it i never dreamt for a moment there might be anything improper about her she was an old woman i felt sorry for her i wont make that mistake again let me tell you but you knew what she did how she made her money eventually i found out and i told her shed have to leave i wasnt going to put up with that and she agreed said that in a short while shed go she just wanted to stay until the end of the month then she was going to look for something much better i thought you said she didnt even pay the rent on this place nor did she but she said she had friends who would look after her i wish theyd looked after her while she was in my flat thats all and who were these friends did you ever find out they didnt exist it was just a story she thought i was a proper fool shed have said anything to keep me quiet and i did more fool me what was she like old i know that i mean did you like her when you first met her why do you want to know you come here asking these questions but you havent said why ive had enough trouble from all this i quite appreciate that sir i said and there is no sinister reason i assure you but i am helping a friend who became entangled with this woman he is a trusting man a bit like yourself but very much more innocent he fears that some of the things he said philpot nodded shame and embarrassment were things he understood all too well although i think that anyone who goes to someone like that i quite agree i quite agree and so does he now but you see he lost his wife in a tragic accident and has grieved ever since she was all the world to him and he never recovered he allowed himself to think that maybe just maybe he might be able to have one last word with her well she would have seen him coming thats for sure said philpot although not without sympathy she would have had the money out of his pocket in two seconds and told him anything he wanted to hear in return ive no doubt precisely i said exactly what happened he feels deceived and angry until he saw the stories in the newspapers he believed he was talking to his dear departed and contented himself that all was well with her he felt happy for the first time in years ah these newspapers said philpot shaking his head they should be ashamed of themselves i agreed and now i continued all he wants is that people should not know of his foolishness so he can grieve once more without being laughed at that shook philpot to the core a good man able to sympathise with others to be laughed at was the worst humiliation of all i see i see he said yes of course he would want that well tell me your questions well what id like to know is if anyone saw him coming and going to these ah séances he is of average size grey hair well dressed very distinguishedlooking look i have his photograph i took out the photograph of ravenscliff philpot looked stroked his moustache with thumb and forefinger and thought for a moment then he nodded i do remember him he said he came a couple of times as i recall he was so much better dressed than most of the people who went up the stairs very handsome umbrella he had german with a handcarved handle of mahogany since he obviously warmed to any subject that had an umbrella in it i continued to press in a gentle way there you are you noticed his umbrella and that is one of the things that he asked me to look into you see the last time he came he was so overcome by what he thought were his wifes words that he rushed out and left his umbrella behind he didnt yes so he asked me if at all possible if i could recover it he only took it with him because madame boninska said it would help summon the spirits if there was something she had touched in the room philpot understood immediately and was shocked by the sacrilege you must go and look he said immediately i insist that is kind of you i wanted to ask but i understand perfectly poor man here take these keys and go and look for it i went out of the shop door into the fresh air or as fresh as the air near tottenham court road ever became and walked up the stairs in the little passage next door the flat was oppressive and dark and gloomy and would have been even if a murder had not been committed there i opened the curtains and then opened the windows as well everything was neat and tidy though the general appearance was thoroughly bizarre stuffed animals prints on the wall of psychic events odd pieces of equipment and furniture lots of black velvet i wasnt interested in any of it immediately i started going through drawers looking under beds and mattresses down the sides of chairs under furniture any scrap of paper or notebook or strongbox or photograph anything at all would do an address book old railway ticket deed or document there was nothing absolutely nothing which was not right everybody accumulates something even an old bus ticket but in this place there was not a single scrap which made me wonder it had probably been the police of course i would have to check but i had never come across a police investigation where they had taken everything away like that have you found it what the umbrella have you found it it was philpot poking his head reluctantly round the door oh no im afraid not its gone im sorry to have been so long but i found this room very oppressive i think i looked everywhere twice because i couldnt keep my mind on things philpot found this sensitivity unbecoming and said nothing i followed him down the stairs and into the street gloomy place i said but it will be perfectly pleasant once its cleaned up why not get a ragandbone man to come and take everything away open the windows for a week get in a painter everyone will forget soon enough about all this philpot was grateful for the reassurance but shook his head not yet he said i cant think of it yet ill take your advice soon enough though and no news of the girl what was her name mary no vanished she has i think i was more shocked to learn what she was than anything he lowered his voice and eyes as he thought about her you never knew where she came from the police asked me did she tell you where she lived no she didnt of course i knew where she came from but they werent interested facts mr philpot they said just keep to the facts so how do you know the way she talked of course she was brought up in shoreditch now im not saying she lived there chapter it was time to summon the runners i went back to the newspaper offices for the first time since i had resigned and asked at the reception desk if the boys were about some of them were in dragon court a mouldy dank little square just over the road which was surrounded by seemingly abandoned buildings few of them had any glass left in the windows the boys had broken most of it playing football or cricket which is what they did when they were waiting for a job three of them were there one was hopeless a mournful character of small intelligence and no initiative whatsoever pale and pimply with an air of being underfed and neglected wearing clothes two sizes too big for him one derrick was reliable and the cleverest grew up to become a highly successful catburglar listen boys i said ive got a job for you twice the usual rates and a bonus of a guinea for the one who succeeds i had learned from elizabeth that if you want instant obedience with no argument you pay and pay so handsomely it takes the breath away none of these boys i suspected had ever even seen a guinea before the very idea of one made them go quiet and reverential i told them what i wanted told them the girls name told them she came from shoreditch told them about her occupation these were not innocent little angels and repeated the description i had got from the police about twenty years of age with light brown hair blue eyes and of middling height it wasnt much good but at least it eliminated all the sixfoot tall orangehaired and redeyed prostitutes in shoreditch now pay attention i said this is important if you come across this woman dont frighten her let her know that no one means her any harm there is no question of the police being involved in this i might even be able to help her if she needs it but i want to talk to her and will pay her a guinea as well got that the urchins nodded i told them to find me either at home or in the pub or at the ravenscliff house if they came up with anything that done i went back to the king keys to find hozwicki once more this was a long shot not finding hozwicki as i knew hed be there but the possibility of his knowing or telling me anything what do you want you havent paid for the last bit of information i gave you true enough but i would have thought an old comrade in arms i gave up normally in such circumstances all you have to do is stand a round or two of drinks and all is well but this tactic i knew wouldnt work either believe me i said with as much sincerity as i could muster if i could tell you something i would but i dont want to put you in danger hozwicki looked sceptical but at least started paying attention it is all far more complicated than you can imagine i thought i was writing a biography for a grieving widow now it seems i am being pursued by a bunch of anarchist murderers i dont want you to get into the same position he looked at me what are you talking about the brotherhood of socialists ever heard of them hozwicki glared at me you think that just because i am polish i know every revolutionary in the east end hardly i mean there are so many of them you cant know them all can you i just thought you might have come across the name so why are they after you i dont know but this has something to do with ravenscliff i dont know hozwicki rubbed the end of his nose and thought never heard of them he said finally yes you have yes i have but im not going to tell you anything look stefan if theyve got a grudge against you then steer clear of them or get a gun do you have a gun of course i havent ill give you the name of a man who can get one for you i dont want a gun perhaps but you may need one who are these people hozwickis good and bad sides were wrestling for control of his conscience which put quite a strain on him he did not answer for some time in fact he didnt really answer at all instead he pulled out his notebook tore off a sheet and scribbled on it here he said im not going to help you but go there and ask questions thats all ill do for you written on the sheet was an address the anarchist club jubilee street for those who have forgotten what london was like before the war or who never knew the very idea of an anarchist club sounds absurd most people are more familiar with the reform or the athenaeum and when they think of clubs they think of leather armchairs port and cigars with quiet waiters padding about bearing silver platters the idea of anarchists enjoying such surroundings cannot help but bring a smile to the lips and yet there was such a club although it was closed down when the war began and never reopened more than that it was a popular place the east end was a seething mass of revolution in those days wave after wave of immigrants had swept in bringing jews nationalists and revolutionaries fleeing the authorities in russia and elsewhere it was a cause of great tension on the one hand it made britain most unpopular in those countries which preferred to have their revolutionaries either dead or in gaol rather than freely plotting evil on the other the mass of men seeking work annoyed our own labourers who found their housing taken and their wages undercut but government after government refused to do anything the employers liked the cheap labour and i suspect the foreign office enjoyed tweaking the noses of autocratic governments abroad so the authorities reached a sort of pact with the unwelcome guests as long as they caused no trouble in england they could plot to visit whatever mayhem they liked on their own country nonetheless the authorities kept a firm eye on what was going on as much as they could i had learned from the police however that this wasnt very much these letts and poles and panslavs and russians and whoever not only spoke a wide variety of languages often in obscure dialects they also seemed to change name with bewildering rapidity several criminals were tried in court for offences using only nicknames the elephant fatty the bricklayer because the authorities had no idea who they were now the trouble with revolutionaries is having got into the habit of opposing their own authorities they end up opposing everything else as well that is to say no sooner had a party formed to install say the principles of marxist socialism or anarchist freedom in liberated lithuania than it tended to split into two on the question of what exactly socialism or anarchism was or even what lithuania was so the anarchist club was formed fraternal loathing was suspended while members were within its portals there you could find speeches on all manner of subjects as long as they were intense and impractical as i approached it that evening i took a bus from fleet street to commercial road then walked up jubilee street to my destination i tried to imagine lord ravenscliff with his silk top hat and cashmere overcoat rubbing shoulders with such people i almost succeeded but eventually gave up it was too absurd the club smelled but was no worse than most pubs it was also a good deal quieter chilly though and not very clean anarchists did not approve of housework that was for their women and on the whole there were few women dedicated enough to cook clean listen to the rhetoric and foment revolution all at the same time i guessed there were about thirty men in the large room and only four women everybody was dowdy and poor looking and although some were dapper enough with waxed moustaches and strutting walks most were subdued and moved with an air of caution they did not give a very convincing imitation of murderous lunatics all were foreign i guessed many were jews and they seemed different from the unionists and syndicalists i had written about in my days of toil few had the true air of working men they did not stand or move like men used to working with hand and body they also looked very much worse fed greyer of face can i help you a cautious voice heavily accented a small man jacketless and collarless stood beside me looking at me cautiously not surprisingly i was hardly dressed fashionably but it was obvious from my healthy complexion and unpatched clothes that i was both english and not a natural member of this place i was hoping to meet a friend i said stefan hozwicki do you know him i do but he isnt here the man replied relaxing a little it seemed stefans name was a sort of passport a guarantee of my good intentions which was kind of him although mysterious if i did not exactly slip into the background here i couldnt imagine hozwicki doing so either youve not been here before the man said my name is josef by the way welcome thank you my name is matthew brad he held up his hand we do not have second names he said with a smile it is uncomradely and also there are far too many people who do not wish to give them so matthew will do nicely his mouth twitched with amusement as he watched me try to look comradely i quite took to him he was short only about five foot four high weedy and underfed badly dressed and looked less than healthy his hands twitched nervously all the time as though he was trying to pull rings off his fingers but the rest of him was totally still and calm his eyes watched me through thick lenses and they were kindly and a little sad you have come for the talk ah yes i suppose so im not sure why im here to tell the truth comrade stefan no doubt has his reasons im sure comrade stefan has i said and was quite proud of myself for suppressing the twitch of amusement it was only because i was quite touched hozwicki as i have mentioned was not exactly the most friendly of people he trusted no one and liked even fewer to tell me to come here where he must have realised i would hear him being referred to as comrade stefan thus exposing him to ridicule if not worse if i ever repeated it in the king keys was a gesture not exactly an open offer of friendship but probably the closest to it i or anyone else would ever get who is the speaker might i ask ah he said it is comrade kropotkin the anarchist aristocrat the russian revolutionary the anarchist prince all titles dreamt up by the headline writers on the daily mail who excelled at such things he was an odd fellow by all accounts a genuine russian prince who had turned to rural collectivism and revolution he had been imprisoned in russia thrown out of switzerland france and america and came to rest in a comfortable part of brighton where he went for long walks with his dog and was perfectly sweet to the neighbours when not advocating stringing them up from the nearest lamp post and what is he talking about the evils of darwinism is it evil comrade kropotkin has argued in the past that darwinism is but a reflection of capitalism because it emphasises competition and struggle over cooperation and coexistence it justifies the exploitation of man by man and strengthens the class ideology of the oppressors excellent so what will be new today that we must find out if we can understand him there are so many people of so many different nationalities here with so many languages that english is the only one everybody has a chance of understanding i dont suppose you speak serbocroat not really a pity i would have pressed you into service to give a running translation our serbs are very bad at languages who else i mean what other languages are represented josef screwed up his eyes to think well there are russians and germans many latvians and lithuanians and poles a few serbs one dane although he comes only rarely many english although for some reason few irish which i find strange as they are the most oppressed of all some ukrainians and a few belgians the french tend to stay in france and of course we have many many people who speak only yiddish a veritable internationale i said with what i hoped was a tone of approval and how many policemen he gave me an odd look but realised full well that i was lightheartedly broaching a serious point that is serge who hasnt arrived yet you arent tempted to throw him out oh no obviously the police are going to infiltrate so why bother we do nothing here that is of great interest to them it is not as if we hold open meetings on bombmaking those are by invitation only precisely he said with a twinkle in his eye seriously the authorities here are stupid and coercive but somewhat milder than their counterparts abroad as long as we do not frighten them they leave us alone more or less and nothing frightens authority more than not knowing what is going on then they fantasise about plots and evil and react so we show there is nothing to be afraid of and this serge knows you know about him the subject has never come up but i imagine so do you wish to meet him you are a journalist i take it how did you know that because the moment you open your mouth you start asking questions because you clearly know nothing about anarchism and because you are a friend of stefan who is a journalist as well you dont work for the daily mail do you certainly not i said almost offended that is good you dont mind me coming oh no the more publicity the better comrade kropotkin has written many articles for newspapers here and abroad showing the origins and nature of what we believe he has just finished a long article for the encyclopaedia britannica and now if you will excuse me the courteous anarchist moved off towards the stage he walked with a limp i noticed and he looked as though moving was painful for him he weaved an erratic course as he went stopping frequently to greet people pat them on the back talk briefly with them one woman he bowed to in an oddly oldworld fashion she was dressed simply with a muffler around her head as though she had a cold and a sprig of flowers in her hair she briefly broke off her conversation with a large unshaven man to greet him and half turned to respond with an unsmiling cold nod of the head these eh what i turned to see a grim man staring at me as though i had just advocated the abolition of taxes for landowners powerful intelligent his eyes radiating annoyance at his feeble grasp of language he waved his arm chairs they must organise he spoke with such a thick and indeterminate accent that it was difficult to realise his understanding of english grammar was rudimentary as it was almost impossible to make out anything at all what i repeated almost panicking he picked up a chair put it into my hand and propelled me roughly across the room until it was next to the one in a line and made me put it down then he gestured to all the other chairs again ah right he was not the sort of man who would brook any refusal i half expected him to whip out a revolver and shoot me on the spot if i so much as looked reluctant so i picked up another chair and then another and slowly set them out row by row good very good a thunderous clap on the back and a broad smile signified my labours for the common good had met with approval drink he thrust a bottle of beer at me contrary to the regulation of drink act and scowled or maybe it was a smile hard to tell i smiled back as best i could i really didnt want a drink but again i felt it unwise to refuse we toasted each other smiled again indulged in another bout of backslapping and then he drifted off and you will be comrade matthew the journalist friend of comrade stefan came a cold female voice behind me it spoke with a heavy german accent but was both grammatical and comprehensible i spun round i opened my mouth to speak suave and sophisticated able to deal with any eventuality that was the way i wanted to be and very definitely the way i wasnt i couldnt say a word are you here to hear the speech it is not often we get journalists here so i imagine you are here to see comrade peter she spoke quietly and was one of those who did not look at the person she was speaking to stared hard rather somewhere above my left shoulder communicating a contempt which fully matched the harshness of her voice um get a good seat he mumbles she tossed back her head and swept a strand of loose hair from her eyes with one finger i had watched her intensely had memorised her every gesture and that was something she did not do it was as though she had taken on a different persona entirely almost as though she was a different person i felt utterly confused surely it could not be so she was dressed in the manner of everyone else in the room thin old clothes utterly unbecoming with thick black boots buttoned up to the neck with a row of buttons one of which was undone one missing her face was severe and more serious it looked as though it had been angry often her skin was pallid old looking weary the smile had no warmth in it at all no i decided and you are call me jenny she said flatly is it your real name what does that matter with women names are ownership who your father was who your husband is we must choose our own names you agree absolutely just what i was thinking myself i do not approve of frivolity sorry habit divest yourself of this habit she had pronounced she had finished you will find the meeting instructive if you pay proper attention she almost clicked her heels together i swear and then very briefly for a fraction of a fraction of a second as she turned away i caught her eye grey and i got that familiar shock running through my system the curdling feeling in my stomach the outpouring of breath the sudden speeding up of my heart stefan or no stefan and despite the undoubted appeal of a manyhoured talk from a russian anarchist i decided to leave and quickly at least i managed not to run but i made my way to the door through the groups of people coming in the opposite direction as quickly as i could josef stopped me just as i was about to regain my freedom you are surely not leaving i must im afraid i i tried but failed to think of some good reason ive just remembered some work i have to do dreadfully sorry really looking forward to it another time then he said with no great interest as you see the doors are always open even to journalists thank you that is kind and i have found even the little ive seen interesting very interesting tell me who is that woman over there i nodded as discreetly as i could why do you want to know oh we talked you see and there are so few women here i wondered if you want to find out you should ask her yourself besides i dont know a great deal about her shes been coming occasionally for the last six months or so it was the first thing she did when she got off the boat the boat yes she is german had to leave because well that doesnt matter but shes tough and committed if you want to know more ask her but dont expect an answer i didnt want to push the matter too far so i left grateful only that hozwicki hadnt shown up the last thing i needed was to have to come up with another excuse kropotkin arrived only about ten minutes after i left i saw him from my vantage point across the road it was part of the training part of the way i had trained myself at any rate the ability to wait it is a skill possessed by very few people most get bored after only a few minutes they become agitated and dream up dozens of good reasons why they are wasting their time simply to justify giving up i had learned not exactly to like it but more to let my mind drift so that time seemed to pass more quickly it had a peaceful aspect to it it is a small talent i know but it is rare and one i am quite proud of so i found a dark corner in an alleyway running along the side of a grocers shop on the other side of the road which gave a clear view but which wasnt lit up by the gaslight i pulled my coat more firmly around my neck and i waited and waited i saw stefan hurry in along with several others saw a carriage draw up and a tall man with a thick bushy beard get out that i thought would be kropotkin let us assume ten minutes to get started then three hours of meeting at least i pulled my pocket watch out of my waistcoat and peered at it it was eight oclock it was going to be a long evening it was almost interminable even my skilled placidity in these situations was only just sufficient to get me through my mind fixed on this jenny it hammered away time and again at the whole business and i could not make head nor tail of it i was only sure of one thing i had been lied to once again so i waited cold very hungry and distraught nine oclock ten oclock half past ten a few people drifted out from time to time perhaps they did not find the princes words satisfying perhaps they had heard them before some hung around outside talking others walked swiftly off none interested me eventually jenny came out bundled up in a coat with a hat on her head but there was no mistaking her she was with a man the one who had told me to set out the chairs he also had a hat pulled down over his face his right hand was in the pocket of his overcoat and he touched her stroked her back with his left hand in an unmistakable gesture of intimacy and she responded leaning her body against his there was no mistake i did not imagine it so i followed a more hotblooded person than i might have accosted them hello your ladyship fancy seeing you here but i decided that knowledge was a better revenge i would discover everything first of all so i tagged behind at a good distance just keeping them in view ducking into the shadows whenever the man paused to tie his shoelaces or strike a match against a wall or when they stopped on the pavement to talk this they did often enough to make me realise they were afraid of being followed nobody stops that often but i had learned from a master george short had cut his teeth as a runner before becoming a reporter he knew all the tricks of how to follow without being seen and i suspected knew how to pick pockets and listen in to conversations in bars and restaurants as well when i was getting going he taught me some of his skills you never know when it might come in handy hed said these university graduates think its all about a wellturned phrase they wouldnt be able to get a story if it bit them on the leg his skills had never been that useful before but now i saw their point it is a question of getting into the rhythm of the person you are following watching them intently until you can predict what they are going to do moving in harmony with them so that you are already tucked away in the shadows before they have even begun to turn of knowing how far back to be of knowing how to walk lightfootedly but naturally so that you are unsuspected even if you are seen i followed them for a mile or so down jubilee street along commercial road up turner street then into newark street a row of houses rundown and poor they stopped outside one of them which was all in darkness and talked i heard nothing but i did not need to he wanted her to come in that was clear she refused initially and my spirits rose a little but then she took his hand allowed him to lead her to the door and they vanished inside if i had been in a state of shocked disbelief before it was nothing in comparison to how i felt now i could describe my emotions for a very long time but in fact they were very simple i was jealous to the point of insanity she was mine i told myself it was another one of her lies to add to the growing list and such a man such people clearly they werent notes of her husbands payments to the brotherhood that i had found in that folder they were hers he had discovered and was trying to find out what she was doing this man was probably one of that group and she was paying him my stomach turned over with disgust i would expose her to the world i would destroy her reputation so completely she would have to leave the country for ever how to do it hozwicki obviously id promised him a story it would be better than he dreamed of then seyds id pull her husbands companies down until their worth would fit in my back pocket in small change the thought calmed me my patience slowly returned and i became thorough when the man emerged i followed him until he got back to what were evidently his lodgings then took a bus back to the west end i went into an earlymorning café it was by now four in the morning and borrowed some paper and an envelope from the owner i considered a long and violent denunciation but such things are never effective they make the writer seem hysterical so instead i kept it short dear lady ravenscliff please accept my resignation as your agent in the matter of your husbands will yours sincerely matthew braddock i delivered it by hand to her house then took the bus back to chelsea it was still only six when i slipped quietly into the house and no one was yet up not even mrs morrison i tiptoed up the stairs avoiding the squeakiest of the treads and collapsed on my bed it was an eternity since i had slept properly but i was afraid sleep would elude me now as well i shouldnt have worried i was still thinking this when my thoughts began to disintegrate and i plunged into oblivion chapter if i harboured the idea that this might be an end to it then i could not have been more wrong i slept until two in the afternoon but was hardly refreshed when i finally surfaced i did have a couple of moments grace before the full recollection of the previous evening came back but it was not much of a respite i was dirty unshaven and my bones ached still from tiredness so i went downstairs in search of hot water there was no one around which was unusual normally at that time of day mrs morrison should be in the kitchen with her halfwit of a scullery maid arguing over how to peel carrots so i put a large pot on the hob myself and yawned while it heated on the kitchen table was a telegram addressed to me i knew the moment i saw it who it was from and the surge of pleasure i felt should have warned me how feeble was my resolution of only a few hours previously i considered tearing it in two and throwing it in the bin i dont need her thats all over but couldnt quite manage to be so manfully confident what if there was something in there to show i was wrong so i dithered while the water boiled and the kitchen filled with steam and eventually reached a compromise i would open it read it and then tear it up in righteous anger come immediately elizabeth the first word was enough to turn all my steely resolution a little rusty all sorts of stories flooded into my mind a lost twin devoted sisters torn asunder and now reunited all nonsense it could not possibly be so could it the doubt was small but enough because i wanted it to be so i washed and shaved and dressed in clean clothes and by the time i was ready to face the world i was decided i would see her just in case but i would make her wait and use the time to find out some more it was the first time she had wanted to see me more than the other way around and i liked the feeling too much to lose it quickly i went back to fleet street hozwicki wasnt in the king keys so i went to the telegraph walked up the stairs to the newsroom and found him sitting alone in a corner with a typewriter he was the only person in the entire place to use one everyone else wrote their stories out by hand and i noticed he kept on getting irritated glances from others in the room every time he pressed a key it was a womans machine not for men i need to talk to you im busy i dont care i must have said it in an impressive fashion as he stopped typing and looked up at me so talk not here i dont want your colleagues to learn about comrade stefan i hadnt meant it to come out as a threat but that was how he took it he stared stonily at me come outside for a walk it will only take five minutes he considered for a second then stood up and put on his coat i could see he was angry i imagine i would have been as well from his point of view he had extended a hand of friendship and i was using his gesture to blackmail him i would have felt guilty about it if id had the leisure to think straight well then what do you want now he stood on the pavement as the crowds of people parted to walk around us and indicated he was going to go no further we were just outside the telegraphs doors i didnt mean to threaten i said i had no intention of saying anything but i have to talk and i dont have a great deal of time what happened yesterday i heard you came then left too boring for you it probably would have been but i didnt find out there was a woman there she called herself jenny in her forties german accent he nodded tell me about her why it doesnt matter not unless no i interrupted no games not today no bargains no youscratch myback nonsense i need to know now i must know who is she he looked at me carefully then nodded and you wont say why you want to know not a single solitary word but you must tell me he stared at the pavement for a few seconds then turned on his heel and walked off turning up wine office court past the cheshire cheese where there was no one around eventually he stopped and turned her name is jenny mannheim he said but thats not her real name she arrived from hamburg about six months ago it appears she was involved in a murder there and had to flee the country when she got here she contacted some groups of exiles but has steered clear of the germans she doesnt want anyone to know she is here shes afraid of the police or of being murdered herself in revenge shes a very tough woman ruthless in argument and quite capable of being ruthless in action i imagine her life is the struggle it is all she cares about and all she talks about she is entirely cold and deeply unpleasant so im afraid i cannot tell you much more even what i know did not come from her i avoid her as much as possible and so should you if youve any sense so how do you know about her she approached these groups which well they dont trust many people theyre used to spies and informers and police agents trying to infiltrate them theyre careful naturally they wanted to make sure she was who she said how did they do that easily enough they wrote letters to comrades in germany they checked she was on the boat she said she was on they used people in the police there to see if shes done what she said she had shes a nasty bit of work even by the standards of her type quite pretty though it would be interesting to see the reaction if you said that to her face she left yesterday with a man i gave a brief description as best as i could it wasnt necessary jan the builder hozwicki said flatly thats what hes called he sometimes works on building sites josef pointed him out to me once and told me to beware of him again no one knows his real name and since you no doubt already know yes he is a member probably the leader of the brotherhood of socialists and are they hozwicki looked at me dangerous people who you do not want to know you remember the holdup at marstons brewery the armed robbery at that cheapside jewellers about a year ago he was referring to two violent but unsuccessful crimes they were what are called expropriations to fund the cause anarchism is split into two those who think such things justifiable and necessary and those who believe they ruin everything we are striving to achieve we he nodded so tell me more about these people hard its not as if they advertise themselves but there cant be many of them most are lithuanian or latvian most would be executed or imprisoned if they went home they hate russia and all things russian and everyone else they seem to have money presumably from robberies more than that i cannot tell you i dont know they are not interested in listening to speeches or theoretical discourses they think that is bourgeois they think violent action is the only true revolutionary activity i think that if they could they would happily murder kropotkin as well as any other russian what is all this to you stefan i asked i was genuinely curious why are you part of all this rigmarole he frowned as he turned to look at me im jewish and im polish he said why do i need to say any more i do not wish to kill anyone matthew i want to set the world free so mankind can realise its full potential and live in harmony an aspiration you no doubt think is foolish naïve and absurd i shrugged as aspirations go it is not a bad one i am merely sceptical about its chances of success you are not alone but compromise here he turned with a smile playing over his mouth which made quite a change he had a pleasant smile he really should have used it more often compromise is a weapon of oppression wielded by capitalists to ensure nothing ever changes of course it is i said heartily damn good thing too he grinned and now we understand each other im glad ive always appreciated your efforts to be kind do not think i was unreceptive but i grew up in a world of suspicion and it is not a habit i can abandon easily you are a good man for a lackey of the system i will take that as a compliment i said and i in turn appreciate your willingness to talk to me i will use the information cautiously shall we say and one day i will give you a proper explanation he nodded if you know what is good for you youll steer clear of jan the builder and anyone associated with him were old drinking mates i said and whatever you do dont start making eyes at jenny mannheim shed eat you for breakfast and pick her teeth with your bones he nodded and strode off to his work leaving me pondering his last words they had brought me back to the subject of my obsession i had forgotten about her for the time i was talking to him now she came flooding back to my mind an associate of jan the builder i had information but no understanding in fact i was worse off than before every time i added a nugget of information to my paltry hoard it made the rest seem the more confusing so i now knew more about this band of anarchists knew a small amount more about this woman i had encountered the previous day but i still knew nothing about their connection with ravenscliff what was more i did not care my obsession with elizabeth had grown to the point that it was almost uncontrollable i agonised over whether i would go and see her as i had been asked to do i knew i would sooner or later i knew i would not be able to keep away but i put up a fight i did not embrace my fate eagerly or without resistance even as my feet took me down fleet street past charing cross up haymarket and to piccadilly circus i told myself i had not made up my mind i could at any moment hop on to a bus and go home i had free will i would decide in my own good time i went through all the reasons for treating her command with the disdain it deserved and they were overwhelming went through all the reasons for obeying her and they were paltry and still i walked on hands in pockets eyes looking down at the pavement getting ever closer with each step to st jamess square i still told myself that i had not yet made up my mind as i stood on the doorstep and as i rang the bell and it was true i had decided nothing the only decision i could take was to walk in the other direction indecision made me sleepwalk towards her go through the door when it was opened by the housemaid climb up the stairs to the little sitting room where she was waiting for me had my heart given way then i would not have been surprised and might not have been ungrateful but it did not and i walked in to see her sitting on the settee by the fire a book on her lap looking at me gravely and i felt that familiar flood of emotion coursing through my being as i knew that i was back exactly where i needed to be sit down matthew she said softly gesturing to the place beside her with an immense effort of will i sat in the armchair opposite so i would not have to suffer her perfume the sound of her clothes as she moved or the feeling that with the slightest gesture i could reach out and touch her i was safe immune there she noticed of course and knew why i had done it it was a gesture of weakness not of defiance she understood it all she continued to look gravely at me but was not trying to fascinate there was a seriousness in her glance which hinted at sympathy and understanding although i knew all too well that i read far too much into such things and always tried to give the best possible interpretation you asked so here i am i said i wrote because i received this distressing message from you i thought the least i could expect was some sort of explanation do you really think you need one of course i was entirely perplexed by it i searched her face intently trying desperately to see through to the thoughts underneath i knew that everything depended on what i said next why i do not know i was simply certain do you ever tell the truth do you ever do as you are told if you remember i told you quite plainly that you should not give any attention to the anarchists you agreed promised and immediately broke your promise i think i have more of a right to be cross than you as your misdeed was premeditated that was you last night i asked still somewhat incredulous yes it is necessary she said and instantly her voice her expression her face were all transformed it was eerie and frightening like seeing a wax puppet melt and reconstitute itself as a different character the changes were infinitely subtle but the effect was total the lines of the frown around the bridge of the nose the set of the jaw the slightly hooded look of the eyelids the tilt of the head and the hunchedup wearied pose of the shoulders fragments of movement changed her from a society lady of aristocratic bearing into a grim hardliving independent revolutionary from the east end i still could not believe it and even worse could not see how she did it then in a twinkling of the eye the anarchist jenny vanished and elizabeth reappeared smiling mockingly at me it is really not so difficult she said i always had a talent for mimicry and acting it was merely a question of studying to get the clothes and the look and the opinions just so and i have spoken german since birth it is my first language i suppose it would be too much to ask for an explanation an honest truthful one of what you were doing there she considered no i think it might well be a good idea do you want the long version which would indicate a willingness to forget about that unfortunate letter of yours or the short one the long one i said in a tone lightly tinged with reluctance she rang the little silver bell on the table and asked for refreshments then picked up my letter and tossed it onto the fire i think i told you that john was preoccupied in the last few months of his life one of the reasons was this he always kept a careful eye on his businesses it was his duty he believed to ensure that they were run well obviously he could not watch everything for this he had managers on whom he relied to tell him what was happening and to implement his wishes at the same time he would often make visits to various plants and factories to see for himself so he could take the temperature as he called it he loved these trips you think of him no doubt as a financier a man who sat far away from everything dealing with the abstractions of capital he wasnt like that at all what he liked was putting it into operation in the shipyards and the foundries and the engineering plants he liked to see how a decision on his part could galvanise thousands of people into action he loved his factories and although you would no doubt not believe it he loved the people who worked in them the engineers the fitters the builders the skilled workmen he valued them far more than the people of his own society jenny the anarchist hates him he was the worst sort of capitalist because he believed it was more than mere exploitation he was proud of paying more than his competitors proud of providing decent accommodation for those he employed last october he went up to the shipyard in northumberland and stayed for nearly a week he often did this every year i think he spent about ten weeks away going round one plant or another sometimes there was a good reason a huge decision on investment problems with a contract or something like that other times there was no reason at all he simply wanted to be there and smell the smell as he put it he spent as much time on the factory floor as he did in the offices spent time talking to the men and stood watching he believed you could tell the health of a company by the way it looked and felt you didnt need to see the books did you ever go with him not often but then he didnt often come with me on my trips either each of us to our own particular universe he was happy in his i in mine there were some things we could not share and he needed to be without distractions he would say that the factories would talk to him and he had to listen sometimes they would say one thing the accounts another then he would become curious and stay until he was satisfied this time he came back perplexed all had been well he said the yard was happy the operations were smoothly run they had recently finished a gigantic project to dig out new dock which involved dredging a large part of the river itself so ships could be launched more easily the cost of dreadnoughts is so astounding that i was always amazed by his ability to contemplate it it didnt bother john at all for him large sums of money were just small sums with more noughts on the end something was either a wise investment or not whether it was for one thousand pounds or one million did not alter the principle all was well he was satisfied apart from one small thing one of the accounting clerks had been dismissed for peculation a small amount of money nothing more than twenty pounds completely insignificant but he had been a young man full of promise who had been earmarked by one of the managers as someone who could be trained up and given a great deal of responsibility in years to come the manager felt to blame that his assessment of the young mans character had been at fault he had decided not to bring charges but mentioned it to my husband most people in johns position i am sure would not have bothered about it all companies mislay a certain amount of money it is considered inevitable john thought differently he had spent years developing his organisation and wanted to achieve perfection it did not matter to him whether it was twenty pounds or twenty thousand or even two shillings it should not have been possible and if twenty pounds could disappear maybe twenty thousand could too so he looked further and came to the conclusion that this was not the only time such a thing had happened although he could not discover many details but he did find out where they were going to an address in east london which only a small amount of investigation revealed was occupied by this man known as jan the builder what infuriated john was that he could not discover how these payments were being authorised the man responsible clammed up and refused to say anything at all so he decided to tackle the problem from the other end and that was where i came in yes i said we had now got to the point the only point if truth be known which interested me embezzlement and failures in accountancy procedures were all very well but i was still fixated on the eyes of jenny the red staring icily in a meeting hall why did you come in perfectly simple i offered and he accepted my offer not willingly or readily but i am quite persuasive you find it all perplexing no doubt that is because you know nothing of me apart from what you see you think of me as a pampered lady used to gliding through a ball or a dinner party but quite unfitted for real life too delicate and refined shocked even at the vulgarity of a middleclass hotel is that correct i tried to protest and say nothing of the sort but in essence it was an accurate summary as i say you know nothing of me i have a long name of impeccable lineage but that covers a multitude of things hungarian aristocrats are not necessarily wealthy or pampered i was neither john could not send one of his people to get close to this group they would have been spotted easily these payments were coming from inside his companies and so he felt unwilling to trust anyone connected with them he needed someone who could be convincing and whom he could trust he did not for a moment think of using me i decided to do it i go to baden for the waters every autumn indulgent of me i know but i find it pleasant to talk german again and when i was there i began to read about anarchism and marxism and revolutionary politics very interesting by the way then i borrowed the identity of a german revolutionary whom the german police had executed in secret an accidental fall down the stairs it was convenient for them and lucrative to let it be known that she had been released and had gone into exile xanthos organised it for me i suppose money changed hands in his usual fashion i studied the clothes and the mannerisms the way of talking i went on to hamburg then travelled back on a tramp steamer to london i arrived as jenny the red brutal uncompromising more ardent than most men i got to know these people and they slowly began to trust me in a way they would never have done a man or someone english no one john could have found would have been anywhere near as convincing i gaped at her story and the pride with which she told it it was so astounding it was ridiculous it was all very well to lay claim to a hard and poor childhood with nothing but a book of genealogy to burn for winter warmth but i still did not easily credit it your husband allowed you to do this no he expressly forbade it so nobody gives me orders mr braddock she said sounding not a little like jenny the red certainly not john when i proposed the idea it was only a lighthearted suggestion his opposition made me determined to see if it could be done we were quite often apart an absence of a couple of months was quite simple i was established in my new identity well before he even discovered that i had gone against his wishes and as i had been successful and was determined to continue whatever he said there wasnt a great deal he could do except accept my help but why did you want to she shrugged because because what i wanted to perhaps i was a little bored i will get little sympathy from you if i say that the life i lead has its dull side none at all but it does nonetheless most of the people i know are content to while away their lives playing bridge and going to house parties i have little taste for such things which is why i have to go to paris or italy for stimulation john generally understood and let me come and go as i pleased he let me do this for him however reluctantly because he trusted me and knew he could not stop me i was never really able to do much to help him beyond the things you do as a wife i shook my head to try and knock all the contradictory thoughts out of it so we could get on so elizabeth lady ravenscliff née countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szala transformed herself into jenny the red revolutionary anarchist of frankfurt repeat that sentence and see how easily you believe it then you will grasp my difficulties let us say just for a moment that i find all this credible i said which i dont what did you discover i discovered in brief she said evidently amused that jan the builder was part of this group which called itself the international brotherhood of socialists who are in fact little more than criminals fanatical of course they are deeply embittered about the fate of their country which doesnt exist at the moment but they use their anger to justify whatever they want to do and that includes murder robbery and extortion they are violent suspicious and for the most part not very intelligent only jan is clever but he is also the most violent of them all he mixes his ardour with cunning and ruthlessness he is quite a magnetic character women fall all over him including jenny that is not any of your business she said quietly you will have to believe whatever you think is most likely i blushed to the top of my ears with embarrassment the woman had successfully thrown me into turmoil yet again she could do it so easily and there was nothing i could do to defend myself i even think i must have derived some pleasure from being so tormented certainly i put myself into that position often enough what else i asked i discovered that the money had been coming through regularly that it was for a reason and as long as it kept on arriving they were content not to launch any expropriations that is to say they did not bother themselves with robbing jewellers shops or murdering people they do however have a formidable stock of weapons i have been to target practice with them on romney marshes pheasant i said hopefully no people not real ones though dont sound so disappointed is this blackmail payments to stop them launching some operation against one of your husbands companies i have not yet found out only jan knows and he will not say i have tried to persuade him but i risk his suspicion if i press too hard that is why i still go despite johns death i believe i am getting close to discovering what all this is about and having come so far i will not give up now i tried but failed to erase from my mind all thoughts of how she might try to persuade him and i confess here i am deeply ashamed that i found those thoughts irresistible exciting rather than disgusting as they should be nor did i find i could reject them as absurd as easily as i should that was my contribution and john was burrowing into the finances to figure out who was sending the money he had not told anyone else that was his worry what do you mean he thought he had created a monster that his companies had come to life and were acting on their own that they no longer responded to his orders but followed their own instincts that was why he told no one he did not know who he could tell i think he may have discovered what it was all about i replied he was due to have a meeting with xanthos about it but he died instead i only saw him briefly for a few hours when he came back and we didnt have time to talk very much i was away for the weekend at the rothschilds at waddesdon charming people do you know them they were not johns bankers but they are such congenial company youd like them shed done it again as fast as i settled into talking to one person she shifted and became someone else from the grieving widow bored with english mores to the critical snobbish woman who had been so cruel to mrs vincotti to jenny the anarchist to the lustful woman who had driven me to a pitch of frustration and now to the society gadabout do you know natty rothschild darling such a sweet man of course i didnt know the rothschilds and i was sure i wouldnt find them charming at all i felt as though i was talking to an actress who was playing several roles at the same time all from different plays i glared at her it was the best i could manage as an explanation for the feelings behind it would have taken too long and said too much besides im sure she knew exactly what i was feeling i think the obvious thing to do is to go to northumberland myself and see if i can discover what he did i will go tomorrow it is something i can do well and it will be pleasant to feel competent for once do you want me to come as well she asked great fantasies swept through my mind at the very idea and for the first time i was ready for them i shook my head no absolutely not chapter i went the next evening on the night sleeper to newcastle leaving from kings cross at ten fifteen i had never been on a sleeper before and i found myself childishly excited by the adventure not only that i went first class money was no object so i thought i would indulge myself my expenses were being met and i now had so the bank had informed me in a handwritten letter s d in my account i was tired which perversely spoiled the occasion i would gladly have stayed up all night in the crisp linen sheets listening to the rattle of the wheels and seeing the sparks from the chimney fly past the window in the darkness like a private firework display it was a twoberth compartment i was not sufficiently used to my new status to buy myself a single and my travelling companion was a solicitor from berwick a middleaged man with a wife and four children whose father and fathers father had been solicitors in berwick before him we talked over the brandy that the great northern provided before bedtime served on a mahogany tray brought round by the porter and i found his conversation soothing and congenial he was a happy man was mr jordan who had created an entire universe of society in his little town on the edge of the country on other occasions i might have found him dull i suppose his life of bridge and supper parties would never have suited me but i took comfort in the fact that he liked it and found my liking was tinged with longing i feared for mr jordan i felt that the anarchists and the ravenscliffs would succeed in sweeping all away sooner or later and the world would be the poorer for its loss and then i slept the sort of sleep which is entirely perfect it was glorious and i remember thinking as i was in the deepest part of my unconsciousness that if death bore any resemblance to this then there was nothing to fear at all when i woke up the sun was shining weakly and the porter of the night before freshly shaved and tidy was gently prodding me morning tea sir toast your newspaper hot water is on the shelf waiting for you theres no hurry at all sir but if you could be up and about in an hour my travelling companion had already gone so i had the compartment to myself and i made best use of it the sleeping car had been uncoupled and pushed into a siding where it was quiet except for the twittering of the birds and the occasional noise of a steam train passing it was a lovely day all the better for the fact that what i was doing there stayed out of my mind completely as i drank my tea read the newspaper shaved and dressed in the leisurely fashion i decided that men of means must always employ i tipped the porter generously then walked peacefully out of the station and into the middle of newcastle the air seemed heavier the smell of coal hung in the air in a way i had not noticed in the compartment the buildings were black with decades of soot from the air every single one of them and the architecture was grim and foreboding there was none of the bright stucco of west london grimy though that often was few trees and even fewer people on the streets only the delivery men and a few people on bicycles were to be seen newcastle was a working town a working mans town and it was currently at work i looked at the scene for a few moments my bag in my hand and decided there was no great rush i was a man of business that was why i was dressed in my best suit my funeral and wedding suit which i had changed into before i left it was damnedly uncomfortable but that served a purpose it reminded me of my task and my role i behaved as i thought i should behave and walked into the royal station hotel just over the way and took a room for the night then spent the next hour unpacking and lying on the bed wallowing in the opulence and comfort i had never stayed in a hotel before not a proper hotel like this one on the rare occasions i had travelled i had stayed in boarding houses which rented rooms by the night the sorts of place which were always cheap sometimes clean and generally run by people like my own landlady in london this was altogether different and i took my time to get used to the room and to the lobby then spied out the restaurant it wasnt that hard i decided if elizabeth could pretend to be a german anarchist i could masquerade as a member of the professional middle classes for a few hours then i was ready i asked for a cab to be summoned and directed it to the beswick plant where i was to meet mr williams the general manager i will sketch over most of my conversations as they were not of great significance i had sent a telegram the day before saying i had been retained by the executors of the ravenscliff estate to sort out certain matters regarding the will i let it be thought that i was a lawyer as it would have been far too easy to discover my ignorance had i pretended to be anything else even with this disguise there were moments of awkwardness as mr williams knew very much more about company law than i did he was a grim tight little man at first sight and did not relish his time being wasted only as our conversation progressed did i realise there was very much more to him he was an interesting character in fact and his initial caution derived principally from the fact that he detested people like me or rather people like i was supposed to be londoners money men lawyers with no understanding of industry and no sympathy for it williams had more in common with the artisans in his yards than he had with the bankers of the city although both gave him grief he was an intermediary beset on all sides i won him over eventually i confessed that i knew nothing of the city whatsoever told him of my own antecedents surrounded by the bicycle shops of the midlands made myself out as much as possible to be more like him than the bankers of his imagination and experience and eventually he relaxed and began to talk more freely why are you here exactly i did my best to look a touch shamefaced it is completely foolish i said but the law requires that the executors confirm the existence of assets in the estate that is if the deceased leaves a pair of cufflinks to a friend then the executor must confirm the existence of those cufflinks i am here merely to confirm that this shipyard exists i take it that it does it is not a figment of the imagination we are not making some error here mr williams smiled it does and as the law is a demanding beast i will show it to you if you wish i would like that very much i said with enthusiasm i would be fascinated he pulled out his watch and glanced at it then sighed like a man who can see his day being wasted and stood up come along then i normally do my rounds at lunchtime but there is no reason why i should not vary my routine a little your rounds i asked as we left the office williams having told his clerks where he was going you sound like a surgeon it is the same idea in some ways he replied it is important to be seen and to take the mood of the place we have to do more and more of that as so many of our people now join unions does that annoy you he shrugged if i were them id join a union he said even though it makes my life more complicated but i have always done this his lordship thinks thought i should say that it is important did you know him well i asked i never met him he sounds an interesting man he was very much more than that williams said but he will never be recognised as such actresses are better known than men of industry even though the latter generate the wealth which keeps us from poverty so what was so great about him williams looked at me thoughtfully then said come this way he took me through a doorway along a corridor then up a flight of stairs then another and another and another he flitted up nimbly enough i puffed behind in the dark wondering where we were going until he reached another door opened it and stepped out into the bright sunlight this is what was so great about him he said as i stepped through it was breathtaking a sight such as i had never seen before never even imagined i knew all schoolboys knew about british industry how it led the world we knew about the rise of the factory and mass production of iron mills and cotton mills and railways and daily we saw the results sheffield steel railway engines from carlisle ships built in dozens of yards all around the country we saw the iron girders of bridges visited the crystal palace and knew all about the other marvels of the age how such things came to be was rarely taught to people like me they merely existed i had only ever seen the outside of factories and there were few enough of those in london and certainly nothing of any great scale even in my home town the biggest employer the starley meteor works only had a couple of hundred people i stared in utter amazement and with emotions verging on awe the yard was gigantic so big you could not see the end of it whichever way you turned it was simply swallowed up in the haze of sunlight through smoke a vast mass of machinery cranes yards buildings storage areas assembly sheds offices stretching out before my eyes in every direction plumes of thick black smoke rose from a dozen chimneys the clanking thudding scraping and screeching of machinery came from different parts of the scene it seemed chaotic even diabolical the way the landscape had disappeared under the hand of man but there was also something extraordinarily beautiful in the intricacy the blocks of brick buildings set against the tin roofs and rusting girders and the dark brown of the river faintly in view to the east and there was not a tree not a bird not even a patch of grass anywhere to be seen nature had been abolished this is the beswick shipyard williams said the creation of lord ravenscliff more than anyone else it is only one part of his interests he reproduced factories like this across the country and across europe although this is by far the biggest what you see is not a factory it is a sequence of factories each one carefully linked to the other parts and this in turn is linked to the other sites across the continent it is the most complex elaborate structure that mankind has ever constructed and you run it all i asked genuinely impressed i run this plant how i mean how can one person have the slightest idea what is going on in that chaos he smiled that is where ravenscliff was a genius he developed a way of controlling all this and not just this but all of his factories so that any moment you can find out what is going on where it is happening so that chaos as you call it can be tamed and the hidden patterns and movements of men and machinery and capital and raw material can be forced to act in a way which is efficient and effective elegant i suggested that is not a word a businessman often uses but yes it is elegant if you wish not many people can or want to understand it but i would even say it has a sort of beauty to it when it works well and the reason for of all this is mr williams pointed out to the east towards a dark grey shape can you see that there vaguely what is it that is hms anson a dreadnought tons three million different parts are needed for that ship to do its job every one must work perfectly every one has to be conceived designed fabricated and assembled into its correct place so that the ship will perform properly it must sail in the tropics and in the arctic it must be able to fire its guns under all conditions it must be ready for full speed at a few hours notice capable of sailing for months at a time with no repairs and all of those pieces have to be gathered together and put in place on time and within budget that is the point of all this would you like to see it williams led me down the stairs and across a cobbled road to what seemed very like a cab stand the plant is three miles long and two miles deep he said as we got in the back of a horsedrawn buggy that was waiting there i cant waste my time walking around so we have this system of carriages around the place the horses are used to the noise and we clattered off it was like going through a city but a very strange city with no shops few people walking about and no women everyone was dressed in working overalls instead of houses there were warehouses vast and windowless blocks of offices equally grim in appearance and other mysterious buildings which mr williams pointed out as we passed thats foundry no he said where the plate is made the gun works where the cannon are assembled and so we went on the old horse clopping its way with me in the back listening to mr williamss explanations and veering wildly between elation at what man could achieve and a certain feeling of gloom at the thought of the power of this vast organisation and this mr williams said with the slightest quaver in his voice as we turned yet another corner is the reason for all of it many people have seen a dreadnought far out to sea or even in dock they are impressive breathtaking sights even then but only if you see one close up out of the water do you get any real sense of how enormous it is for then all that is normally concealed the gigantic bulk of the ship that is under the waterline becomes visible it went up and up and up until i thought its very top was lost in the clouds from end to end it was so vast that the prow could not be seen at all it disappeared in the haze of smoke pumped out by the factory chimneys i had no idea how advanced the building work was it looked as though it would take years before it was ready and even then i could not easily imagine how anyone expected such a thing actually to float let alone move mr williams laughed when i asked we launch in ten days time he said from laying down the keel to final fitting out should take twelve months we are now eight months in and making good time im glad to say every day we run over costs us in lost profits well what do you think i shook my head i truly believe it was one of the most remarkable moments of my life to be confronted in this way with full proof of mans audacity and invention how anyone even dared to contemplate building such a thing was quite beyond my powers to imagine and then i saw the people the army of tiny figures scurrying up and down the scaffolding shouting at the cranemen as gigantic squares of armour plate were lifted up the riveters methodically pounding rivet after rivet through the holes already made the supervisors and the electricians and the plumbers taking a break after their labours many hundreds of men machines ranging from the huge hydraulic cranes to the smallest of screwdrivers all working together all apparently knowing what they were to do and when they were to do it all to produce this beast which had started out on its long route to the high seas in a decision taken by ravenscliff months or years before he spoke and it was done thousands of men millions of pounds reacted to his decision and were still following his orders even after his death what did i think nothing i was overcome by the scale of it all by the power one man had created now for the first time i could see why all the descriptions of him were superlatives powerful frightening a genius a monster i had heard or read all of these they were all true only such a person would have dared im afraid that i cannot offer you a tour of the ship itself mr williams said interrupting my reverie he was pleased by my reaction i could see i think i must have had a look of stunned amazement on my face my silence was very much more eloquent than anything i might have said it is dangerous when it is in such a state and in fact there is little to see which would interest anyone but a specialist in naval architecture i simply wanted you to see it up close it is an impressive sight dont you think i nodded but continued to gaze up and along to take in the vastness of the thing it was dark the hull had completely blotted out the sun and the depths of the huge trench in the ground in which the ship was taking shape were cold and windy and dark i shivered it does get cold sometimes it even starts to rain inside the dry dock even though it is a fine enough day outside the construction generates a lot of heat and vapour that condenses against the sides and falls as rain it is quite a problem sometimes one of those little difficulties that even the most perceptive of planners cannot imagine in advance i hope by the way you are convinced that this yard does actually exist now i nodded i think the executors might concede that one i said with a vague smile and i must thank you for your time it has been most generous of you not at all as you may have noticed i am very proud of this place it gives me great pleasure to show it off and your workers are they proud of it as well oh yes i think so they should be they know they are the best in the world and they are paid well we cannot afford even one incompetent riveter or mechanic they have to be paid well and supervised very closely when we launched intrepid last year the whole city came to a halt so everyone could watch they knew theyd done something remarkable come along we walked back to the cab and the horse walked wearily off once more taking a different route this time after a few minutes mr williams asked the driver to stop please forgive me he said with a smile i must just check with one of our people in here do come in if you wish i followed him into the entrance of a block of offices which was attached to another giant building of such size that ordinarily it alone would have made one pause for thought but i was almost getting used to them now another building the size of st pauls oh well i wanted my lunch mr williams led the way into the warren of offices where dozens of clerks sat at rows of oak desks each with his piles of paper then through more where men with drawing boards were working mr williams popped his head into one room and called one of the men out i have to see mr ashley for a few moments would you be so kind as to take mr braddock here to see our little arsenal the young man clearly pleased to have been chosen for such a task and to have attracted the attention of the most powerful man in the northeast said he would be delighted his name was fredericks he told me as he led the way he was a senior draughtsman working on gun turrets he had worked at beswick for twelve years now ever since he was fourteen his father also worked here in the yards his brothers and uncles did as well a family firm then i said more for something to say than anything else i dont suppose theres a single family in newcastle which doesnt have someone who works in the yard he replied here we are he pulled open a heavy wooden door and then followed me through again i was astonished even though it took me some time to work out what i was looking at guns but not ordinary guns not like in museums or put out for display at the tower of london these were more like tree trunks from some vast forest twenty thirty feet long three feet thick tapering meanly and menacingly towards the muzzle and there were dozens and dozens of them some long and almost elegant others short and squat lined up in rows on huge trestles thats our biggest fredericks said pointing to one of the longest which lay in the middle of the building shining dully from a protective layer of oil the mark with the breech it weighs fiftyeight tons and it can throw an pound shell nearly eleven miles and land within thirty feet of the target if the people operating it know what theyre about which i doubt they will and these are all for hms anson shell take a dozen of them think of the effect of a single broadside and these can fire once a minute we think you think i got the impression that everyone who worked here knew i didnt think guessing was allowed he looked a bit disconcerted by this well you see its not the guns we know they work its the gun control the hydraulics anson will have an entirely new design the trouble is you cant test it in advance too easily he nodded its what i work on i think it will be just fine but if it isnt so what are the other ones for if twelve go on anson there must be another couple of dozen of those great big ones here he shrugged who knows its not as if they tell us but its the same all over the yard theres enough guns and plate and girders to build a battle fleet out of the spare parts with more being made but there are no more orders whos they scuttlebutt gossip talk in the pub who knows where these things come from people are worrying about layoffs once ansons finished what about foreign orders he shook his head perhaps theyre being kept secret he laughed you dont know shipyards sir there arent any secrets from the workers do you think there is anything that affects our jobs we dont know about i looked thoughtfully at the vast pieces of metal lined up in that gigantic chilly room and shivered it was calm in there peaceful almost it was impossible to connect the atmosphere with what those things were for or what they could do tell me i said perhaps you can help i am looking for a man called james steptoe he works here i believe fredericks expression changed instantly no he said shortly he doesnt not any more are you sure i am certain he used to work here he was dismissed oh why theft he turned away and i had to grab him by the arm i wish to speak to him i dont nobody likes a thief nonetheless i must talk to him ah here comes mr williams perhaps he will be able to tell me wellington street thats where he lives he said hurriedly please not a word i whispered back and then mr williams came within earshot and that was the end of the conversation but in some ways it was the most interesting part yet of my visit a pity i hadnt had more time with the young man who seemed serious and observant im surprised you let me in there i remarked as we went back to the cab i mean i read in the newspapers all about spies trying to steal secrets about guns and things mr williams laughed oh steal away if you wish there is nothing you have seen which is so very secret what a gun looks like tells you nothing it is how the metal is made how the hydraulics work how it is aimed thats where the true secrets lie and we are careful about that except for the gunmetal part why he winked and bent towards me conspiratorially because the germans already know how come i asked eager to hear a tale of espionage because they invented the process we stole it from them he leaned back his head and chuckled theyre the best in the world at that the germans very advanced so you have spies in germany oh good heavens no lord ravenscliff had shareholdings that is very much better he had a substantial shareholding in krupps the german steel company not in his own name of course through an intermediary bank in hamburg they were able to obtain whatever he wanted and schneider in france i was astonished i didnt think it worked like that at all but secret processes from here are not learned by the germans by the same methods in reverse mr williams looked shocked of course not his lordship was an englishman and a patriot fair enough i thought on the other hand what about that tale seyd had told me about building submarines for the russians how patriotic was that so tell me mr braddock the manager said as we headed back to the factory gate what did you find most impressive about beswick anson i imagine i considered certainly it is a staggering sight i said quite beyond belief really it was worth the journey just to see it but oddly i do not think that was the most impressive i think the fact that this yard exists and can produce such a thing more remarkable still the idea that anyone can organise this anthill of a place is the most surprising i had said the right thing williams almost glowed at my words that was lord ravenscliffs genius and why the greatest compliment to his skill is to say he will not be missed do not misunderstand me he said with a smile as i raised an eyebrow it is what he wanted to create an organisation so perfect it could run by itself or rather with only the managers each of whom knows their business i believe he succeeded how so the job of any company is to make as much profit as possible as long as that is the main aim of the managers then there is no need to direct them they will collectively take the right decisions and you will soon find out whether that is the case we had arrived by the gate a cab one of several was waiting patiently to take me back into the centre of newcastle williams courteously held the door for me as i got in indeed it will be very interesting have a safe journey back to london i hope you have enjoyed yourself chapter at eight oclock after a rapid meal i left once more this time walking away from the works and into the rows of houses to the west of the city centre mr james steptoe lived somewhere in that rabbit warren it was a dreary journey into monotonous redbrick streets each house exactly the same as the next all built i suspected by the works and for the works each had a door and two windows facing the street all the doors were green all the windows brown there were no trees few patches of green and surprisingly few pubs i supposed that the works had intervened there as well and banned such places in order to keep its workforce sober and efficient or it was looking after its health and acting responsibly take your pick but it was neat and well ordered no doubt about that and a few streets of newer houses showed signs of a different way of thinking curved porches more fanciful roofs small enough and mean enough no doubt but a place to live and be comfortable there were churches and schools and shops all laid out with thought and care i had seen very much worse in the east end which was a hellish confused nightmare in comparison with this disciplined uniform place which if it was a barracks at least allowed its occupants to pretend the road i was looking for was off a street and off an avenue all were named after imperial heroes and events of the not too distant past i wondered how many of the inhabitants noticed after a while did it make their hearts swell with pride that they lived in victoria road did it make them work harder or drink less for having a house in khartoum place were they better husbands and fathers because they walked to work along mafeking road then into gordon street was mr james steptoe i thought as i knocked on the door a more respectable patriotic englishman for living at wellington street hard to tell his mother who answered the door certainly looked respectable enough as she peered uncertainly at me the trouble was i could make out only a little of what she was saying i supposed she was speaking english but the accent was so thick she might almost have been another serbocroatian anarchist this was a problem i had not anticipated still if i couldnt understand her she seemed to understand me well enough and invited me in and showed me to the little parlour kept for best after a while james steptoe came in warily and cautiously he was shaped rather like a bull almost as broad as he was tall with a thick neck emerging from his collarless shirt and black hair covering his forearms where the sleeves had been rolled up he had thick dark eyebrows and a shadow of beard around his mouth he looked like someone who played rugby or worked down a mine rather than pushing pens and dockets i shook hands and introduced myself are you the police a short sentence gruffly spoken but a great relief i understood it mr steptoe was bilingual certainly not why should i be im eating he said i do apologise for disturbing you i can either go away for a while or wait as you please but im afraid i must talk to you this evening i have to return to london tomorrow morning he studied me carefully are you hungry if i write out his words in normal speech and say i could understand them do not think that he spoke in a normal or easily comprehensible fashion he did not my time with mr steptoe was a triumph of concentration and much of what the rest of his family said escaped me entirely i said i had eaten thank you but could easily eat some more he nodded at this then led me down the little corridor into the kitchen it was a bit like being presented at a court ball eight faces examined me intently as i came in and stood a little sheepishly by the little stove i felt like an interloper a foreigner a threatening presence father this is mr braddock from london this is my mother the old woman smiled severely my sister annie my two brothers jack and arthur lily my fiancée and uncle bill jack move mr braddock here wants your chair london said the father who tended to speak in oneword sentences thats right i said im here to sort out a few legal matters with regard to lord ravenscliffs estate i need to discuss a few matters with your son everybody knows all about that said he dont think you have to hide anything from them what else is there to say ive been tried and found guilty havent i everyone knows or did he see the light and leave me some money im afraid not i said with a grin and he didnt leave me any either if that makes you feel any better so lord ravenscliff believed that you were innocent of the accusations made against you this caused a stir he could have bloody well told me said steptoe junior as far as i understand he came to his conclusion about three days before he died he had no opportunity to tell you there were looks all around the table half pleased half resentful that i should have the power to affect their lives in such a fashion now there is a problem i continued while lord ravenscliff may have been convinced he did not put down in writing his reasons so i have the task of redoing all his work in other words to find out what was happening so i need from you a full account when it is complete lady ravenscliff will write to mr williams at the plant you will get your job back and i am sure be paid in full for the wages you have lost it was a handsome offer and one which i was not entitled to make but it did the trick nicely from then on they were falling over themselves to tell me whatever i wanted to know so please tell me the precise circumstances of this accusation lawyerly i thought it was all lies said the mother defiantly jimmyd never yes mother it seems were all agreed on that he said patiently he thought for a while then glanced around at his family with a slight smile and asked his mother to make another pot of tea as she filled the kettle from a big bowl of water near the back door and put it on the hob he began im a bookkeeper you know he said my dad here didnt like it because hes a shipbuilder a boilermaker and didnt like the idea of me working in a suit he reckoned id get grand ideas and get above myself but i was clever at school i always got high marks in arithmetic and spelling and my hand was good copperplate when i wanted my teacher liked me and put in a word with the yard and got me taken on in the offices i began there about eight years ago and learned the business of bookkeeping i went on courses even to improve myself and did well i was promoted and paid more and i didnt get above myself i dont think his father scowled amiably as though to concede the point anyway my job was to make payments out for bills that came in not the big ones you understand miscellaneous and sundries is my department and theres no rhyme nor reason to a lot of it so when i got in this bill for twentyfive pounds i paid it cash in an envelope posted to the address on the docket a couple of weeks later all that remained was a twentyfivepound deficit and enough evidence that i must have been the one to have taken it all the other pieces of paper had vanished i was asked to explain no one believed me and i was fired and told i was lucky i wasnt going to gaol i was that upset i could have cried i did in fact i couldnt believe it had happened to me and even wondered whether i had made some mistake but there couldnt have been there were only two possible explanations either id stolen the money or the request for payment had been real i knew i hadnt stolen anything so that meant the dockets must have been removed i dont make mistakes you see but i was in a right way there was no chance now of ever getting another job again not in newcastle pretty soon everyone would hear something thats the way it works i was going to go to live with my second cousin in liverpool start again and hope no one would find anything out i was even acting as though i was guilty only this lot he gestured at the people sitting round the table who noddedstood by me not even the union would help they didnt help thieves they told me not worth their time they had enough to do with deserving cases he snorted bitterly as he sipped his tea his father looked uncomfortable and then i got this short letter asking me ordering me more like to come to the royal no signature nothing i almost didnt go but i thought why not i was wondering you see what it was about and i had nothing else to do so i went and knocked on the door and there was his lord ravenscliff i mean all alone i was terrified i dont mind telling you just the room was frightening enough id never seen the like before even grander than the music hall with its velvet curtains and golden furniture and ravenscliff he paused to shift uncomfortably in his chair and stirred some more sugar into his cup you never met him you say if you had i would have to say no more he was a frightening man bulky not fat and he never moved much didnt have to just looked at you and that was enough didnt speak loud either he made you listen to him did nothing to make you comfortable or at ease just told me to sit and then looked at me for ages didnt move a muscle all the while and me getting hotter under the collar and more and more upset i didnt do it i blurted out when i could stand no more and if you want to put the police on me then go ahead have i said anything about the police so why am i here well not for the police he said quietly i could have you arrested and thrown into gaol without even leaving london you know you are here because i want to ask you questions what sort of questions not why you did it that is of no interest to me at all how you did it does concern me though the controls should be proof against people like you and they werent so in return for your freedom i want to know how you did it so i sat down again will you for the last time listen to what i am saying i didnt do anything i did not steal anything not a penny not even half a penny thats right his mother interrupted nodding her head in approval and when he told me that i was so proud of him ravenscliff stared at me with no expression on his face at all i couldnt tell what he was thinking that was frightening you know normally you say something and you know how well its gone down not with him you couldnt tell a thing prove it he said i cant i said bitterly thats the trouble and i told him what had happened everything ive told you and more he nodded as i spoke it was clear he knew the procedures perfectly well then he asked me questions every bill is stamped with a number which runs in sequence if one was removed it should have been obvious the same goes for payment slips i know i said i can only think that it was stamped with a duplicate number so that if it was removed then there would be no gap that would mean that someone deliberately made out a fake bill then removed it and not me either why not you because i wouldnt have paid it myself would i i would have made up a bill got hold of the stamp and numbered it with a duplicate number and then slipped it into someone elses pile for payment at the end of the day after the money had been sent out it would have been easy enough to go to the files find the bill and remove it then gone to the address and picked up the money that is a convincing explanation mr steptoe he said but it means you are accusing one of the people who work with you in your office no i said quickly because i didnt want to accuse anyone lots of people come in and out all day i see ravenscliff walked to the window and stared out of it i was confused a bit but i didnt feel as though i should ask but still i wondered this was a rich man fretting about twentyfive pounds look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves but this seemed stupid and then he told me to go didnt say anything more just dismissed me like some footman i decided then and there to prove it id been sitting at home feeling sorry for myself but he made me mad i wasnt going to be labelled a thief not by him and not by anyone i came home and talked it over with my dad he told me i had to try and we talked to my cousin another cousin not the one in liverpool who works nights he talked it over with does anyone in newcastle not know about this i interrupted he looked surprised i didnt tell a soul only my family of course i told them they had a right to know it affects them as much as it does me you know to have a thief in the family but they stuck with me of course i told them i see im sorry go on anyway it was all organised id go in with my uncle and cousin on the night shift and go to the office it was easy enough to get a key from one of the watchmen whos a soninlaw of my aunt betty then id settle down and start going through the books and leave with the shift when it went off in the morning and i prompted and it took ages i went through every slip of paper going back months and then compared those to the shift books showing who was on duty every single one i couldnt afford to miss anything i nodded i knew how he felt i wondered if the ravenscliffs made a habit of somehow getting total strangers to do their hard work for them elizabeth had done the same with me after all eventually i had it six payments of between twentyone and thirtyfour pounds each none with matching dockets that told me that whoever was doing this knew how the office worked because anything over thirtyfive has to be countersigned by the chief clerk whoever was doing this knew not to be too greedy but you didnt find out where the money was going not exactly not exactly he held up his hand to ask for patience i asked second cousin henry i groaned who also works in the office to keep a look out and eventually the chance came along henry couldnt take the thing obviously but he did copy it out with the address for payment can you remember what the address was of course the one i told lord ravenscliff newark street london e the house i had seen jan the builder going into steptoe had got up and vanished he returned a few moments later with an envelope i looked at the piece of paper inside it was a bill for s d in respect of miscellaneous goods supplied dated january with a number in the top righthand corner which steptoe explained was the invoice number on the file and which was duplicated on another legitimate bill at the bottom was a note c pay b ham i asked what that was thats another way of tracking money he explained this indicates that the money was ultimately to be drawn from a bank account belonging to a different part of the organisation i see so this means cash payment drawn on bank of hamburg account no i thought so this young man had discovered that payments were being made frequently to this bunch of anarchists in london using a loophole in ravenscliffs pride and joy the organisational structure he had set up over the years it was being done by someone who understood it well perhaps even better than ravenscliff did who was responsible for this do you know the young man nodded i do and you told the company i did not why because its not my job to betray my workmates to the bosses i was happy to clear my own name but not at the cost of blackening someone elses all around the table nodded in agreement i had quite forgotten they were there but evidently what steptoe had said had been discussed by them this was a family decision not his alone so i nodded in approval as well as though it was exactly the decision i thought he should have taken in fact it probably was i can tell you who was behind it all though i looked at him well let me take a guess then obviously not one of your workmates so you are about to tell me it was one of the bosses themselves otherwise you wouldnt say a word correct he grinned at me in a fetchingly boyish fashion thats right he said with some satisfaction he told me everything once id figured it out he was brought in one day about six months ago and told that he had to do this slip fake invoices into the piles and remove them afterwards naturally he asked why although he didnt expect to get a reply why not because were expected to do as were told not understand the reasoning for it he expected that hed be told off and told that he was just to do it not wonder what it was all about what business of his was it instead he got a long explanation and who was this from mr xanthos whos a boss very high up he is i see go on then anyway mr xanthos said that people think selling things like battleships and guns is easy it isnt says he you have to persuade people and that involves things that people had best not know about like helping to make up their minds with little presents doing the necessary and thats what these payments were thats what he said little presents to people with influence which would bring in the orders and guarantee jobs right along tyneside for years of course it wasnt a good idea for people to know about this it had to be done secretly and it had to be kept quiet if anyone found out about it so this friend of yours went away thinking he was helping the company to bend the rules a little to secure jobs and that it was all being done with the companys approval thats right but xanthos had told him that no one was to know mr williams and all the others didnt want to know and wouldnt thank him for saying anything he only told me when i asked him a question in the pub difficult that was im not welcome in pubs any more not ones used by the factory that was a week or so before the accident what accident was that bad thing shouldnt have happened poor kid but he was going through one of the steel yards at the end of the day and there was a slip so it seems a post holding the girders in place gave way and they came tumbling down across the floor he was in the way never stood a chance and this was about three weeks ago they had the funeral and a lovely thing it was the company paid and gave money to his mother because he was her only support and so they should have but many wouldnt have theyd have said it was his own fault that he shouldnt have been there there was a moments silence as he finished are there many accidents in the yards i mean the father shrugged some of course its only to be expected two or three a year mostly its peoples own fault this man the one who died hes not going to be telling anyone else about these payments now is he did he tell anyone else except you steptoe shook his head no he was too frightened of losing his job and who could he tell i only got it out of him because he felt bad about what had happened to me so if he hadnt told you then no one would ever have been able to find out about this and if the accident had happened only a little bit earlier steptoe nodded have you told anyone else apart from your entire family that is he grinned not even them not all of them may i suggest that you keep it that way i do not want you to have a pile of girders falling on you as well the smile faded what do you mean the only other person to know anything about this was lord ravenscliff and he fell out of a window i stood up and dusted the cake crumbs from my lap thank you mr steptoe and thank you all ladies and gentlemen i said bowing to the entire table it was most kind of you to talk to me and feed me such excellent cake now is there anything i can do for you i want my job back i will talk to lady ravenscliff i said and get her to intervene do not worry on that score in the meantime please write down your account in careful meticulous detail and send it to me i will suggest to her that she offer you payment for your services that seems only fair chapter the annual meeting of the rialto investment trust was to be held on the morning after i returned at eleven i had only been to such an event once before and it had been deadly and interminably dull a south african mining company that had been and i had been sent because the poor soul who normally attended such things was off sick ever since the boer war south african mining companies had a claim to be news in the way that the doings of most coal mines or cotton companies were not so i went with strict instructions not to fall asleep just spell the name of the chairman right and remember profits for this year and last dividend for this year and last thats all anyone is ever interested in so i went and did as i was told sitting alone the real shareholders avoided me as though i had a strange smell and i didnt get any of the tea and biscuits either and took down everything i was told to take down i still maintain it wasnt my fault that i missed a share issue to raise more capital even had i been awake i would not then have understood what they were talking about but now i considered myself almost an expert in all matters financial words and phrases like scrip issue and debenture stock could trip from my tongue with the same facility that grievous bodily harm or assault and battery had done only a few weeks before and just to be on the safe side i persuaded wilf cornford to come along as an interpreter i was there with a notebook pretending to be a reporter once more how wilf got in i do not know apart from us there were about ten other journalists itself notable as such meetings normally only attracted one or two and at least a hundred shareholders this said wilf was unprecedented something he said was up and so it was although while it was going on it was about as thrilling as a committee meeting at a town council all motions to amend and comments from the floor so densely wrapped up in convoluted phrases that their import was somewhat lost the nominal chairman of the event was mr cardano the executor of ravenscliffs will he did a good enough job i thought he made a brief and entirely empty speech about ravenscliffs great qualities and abilities which i noted was met with suspicious silence before passing matters over to bartoli who sat on his left looking studiously neutral this gentleman then rattled through the annual accounts at such speed that he was back in his chair only a few moments later the only bit i properly appreciated was his closing sentence and in view of the excellent year and good prospects for the coming year we recommend an increase of dividend of per cent to four shillings and a penny per every one pound nominal he sat down to a smattering of applause there then followed questions although not from the journalists who were not allowed to speak an unnatural state which made them chatter amongst themselves to indicate their discomfort when would the ravenscliff estate be wound up very soon promised mr cardano could the executor reassure investors about the state of rialtos finances absolutely yes the figures were there for all to see reassurance was surely unnecessary and what about the companies rialto invested in on that he could not reply but application must be made to those companies however their published accounts suggested they were all doing splendidly and so it went on there were votes on this and votes on that hands were raised and lowered again cardano periodically muttered words like carried or not carried wilf squiggled in his seat and finally there was a motion to adjourn and everyone stood up i tried to sidle up to cardano at the end but he was surrounded by other members of the board almost like an emperor being shielded by a praetorian guard and no journalist got near only one man approached he got to a few feet away and cardano looked at him how did i do was clearly on his face this man nodded and cardano relaxed and left the room an important figure then but who was he i kept him in sight as he stood being buffeted by those making their way to the door not remarkable really middleaged slim short dark hair thinning on the top of average size a clear open face cleanshaven a vague smile on a generous wellproportioned mouth he turned and nodded a brief bow as a stout man about seventy with a round face and white toothbrush moustache looking like a retired lieutenantcolonel in a county regiment tapped him on the shoulder i could not hear the conversation but i grasped enough good to see you cort said the exofficer in a booming voice then they moved out of earshot i would have loved to have heard more but it was enough i had a face for the name i now knew what the mysterious henry cort looked like he didnt look so frightening to me then i was dragged off by wilf who seemed properly agitated and said in a quite unprecedented display of emotion that he needed a drink i could not imagine him drinking at all let alone needing one but who was i to refuse well he said when we were settled into our chairs in a pub round the corner usually frequented by schroders people after hours but now empty that was a battle to remember i frowned bemused what was the meeting boy ive never witnessed anything like it were we both in the same room he stared did you not see what was going on i saw enough to make me drop off my chair with boredom if thats what you mean oh for heavens sake well what what did i miss the ambush man the counterattack the routing of the forces of dissent didnt you understand anything i shook my head wilf sighed sorrowfully you are really not up to this you know just tell me i snapped oh very well you noticed i hope that the board bought off the shareholders by bunging money at them the dividend precisely it was clear from the accounts that they should only really increase the payout by about per cent but they increased it by per cent and they will have to go heavily into reserves to do it the idea im sure was to keep the shareholders quiet until the money is paid out in about six weeks time that dealt with some of them and it was clever cut the ground from under the enemy from the start but they kept on coming did they how what do you think all those motions and proposals and questions were about ive no idea whatsoever a number of shareholders are suspicious and others want to take control of the trust they banded together there must have been meetings all over the city for the last week im sure they did a deal they thought would hold vote in new management then have a good look at the books then perhaps dissolve the trust and pay out the money i dont know it doesnt matter because they were defeated really yes they were that cardano is not daft takes after his father no doubt but clearly there were other discussions going on as well the per cent he controls as executor and other groups of votes blocked every motion and voted instead to postpone all decisions until the ravenscliff estate is settled quite a lot of the shareholders were voting against their own best interests if you ask me and you are going to tell me you dont know why i know you are precisely but i will find out so help me and i can tell you who or at least a bit of who it was barings for one i couldnt quite figure it out but they seem to have amassed a stake of about per cent thats a guess of course i will be able to confirm that in a few days i didnt know they had any they handled the flotation but i assumed they had long since sold any shares they bought some the day after ravenscliff died i said feeling quite proud that i knew something wilf did not and gratified by his look of interest as a result how do you know it was barings i persisted oh well it was a show of strength wasnt it tom baring himself came along to cast the votes so keep your noses out youre wasting your time that was the message which one was he about seventy receding hair the one with an orchid in his buttonhole the retired major talking to cort whos cort nothing its not important this tom baring who is he exactly one of the baring clan extraordinary man i know what you mean about being a retired major he looks the part but he is one of the countrys great experts on chinese porcelain not that i care about that of course of course so hes a big cheese one of the directors its not a family partnership any more of course its been a company ever since the disaster twenty years ago but the family still has huge influence the thing about tom baring is that hes lazy very good very effective when he can be roused but he cant be roused very often for him to come here is a powerful message barings thinks this is important enough for him to abandon his porcelain get up to london and appear he only does that when its really vital the stuff of dinner conversations for years i commented it is so dont be frivolous people will be trying to figure all this out for a long time so what do you think it means i have no idea only that for the time being barings is behind rialto and wants everyone to know but there is obviously more to it than that someone was trying to launch a coup much of the lead was taken by a man from andersons who were also buying rialto shares shortly after ravenscliff died i put in again wilf looked impressed i was rather pleased with myself but who are andersons fronting for eh he asked what about the man they proposed as chairman wilf looked contemptuous a nothing a face thats all no my friend it is someone else and he wont escape me for long you wait and see he drummed his fingers on the table a strange light was glimmering in his eyes as he took an enormous swig at his glass barings wishes to make it clear it is convinced there is nothing wrong with rialto but perhaps it is only doing this because it knows full well that there is something very wrong indeed and it is prepared to risk losing its stake to keep it hidden what motive could a bank have for being prepared to lose money eh tell me that the prospect of losing even more money he rubbed his hands together ah this will be fun well i thought ill let him get on with it i didnt want to share the crown jewels of my knowledge with him but i knew so i thought what it was all about in fact it was obvious any proper investigation of rialto would throw up the fact that the accounts were fictitious that millions had been siphoned off the underlying companies but and it was a fairly sizeable but what was the point wasnt it just postponing the inevitable i wandered home thinking i would have a quiet hour before dinner a whole evening when i did not have to think about money or aristocrats at all i almost felt pleasure as i turned the key in the lock of paradise walk and breathed in the foul air of the entrance but not for long mrs morrison shot into the hall the moment she heard the door and bore down on me with a severe distressed look quite unlike her normal air of amiability mr braddock she began i am most upset most upset how you could be so disrespectful i do not know i am very disappointed in you im afraid i must ask you to leave my house what i said in shock pausing as i took my coat off what on earth is the matter i have always given my boys complete freedom and expect them to respect this house to invite unsuitable people is unacceptable mrs morrison what are you talking about that woman what woman the one in the parlour lady ravenscliff i thought but the surge of pleasure was quickly tempered by feeling of dismay that she should see the circumstances in which i lived the meanness the shabbiness i looked around at the brown painted wood the dingy wallpaper the cheap prints on the wall at mrs morrison herself and almost blushed i am sorry she came here i said fervently but have no fears she is entirely respectable certainly not unsuitable in any way shes a trollop she said hesitating a moment before she used the word and then deciding it was justified dont pretend to me mr braddock i know one when i see one and she is i wont have it i had rather expected mrs morrison to be overcome with the flusters at the idea of having a real lady in the house and my relief that elizabeth had not got the tea and cakes routine was only matched by my dismay that she should be characterised in such a way had she been a trollop she would have been far beyond my purse even at a year but mrs morrison she is my employer now she stared at me in blank astonishment we had reached an impasse with neither understanding what the other was going on about until a noise of movement resolved the matter the girl coming through the door of the parlour was no lady in fact mrs morrisons characterisation seemed pretty judicious she was about twenty i guessed garishly and shabbily dressed and moved with an air of cheeky insolence mingled with caution and suspicion why i say that i do not know but that was my impression who the hell are you i asked incredulously well you asked for me didnt you no i was told youd pay me a guinea a guinea for her i wasnt that desperate i could see why mrs morrison was so angry with me women was the one thing she did not allow certainly not one like that i can assure you i and then an idea came into my head who said id pay you a guinea jimmy whos jimmy never met him before hes a kid and the penny dropped is your name mary course it is i breathed a sigh go back in there and wait for me please i all but pushed her back into the parlour shut the door then turned to mrs morrison i apologise from the bottom of my heart mrs morrison i cannot say sorry fervently enough this woman is not what she appears believe me she is a very important witness absolutely crucial to my work at the moment i have been looking high and low for her and i must talk to her before she takes fright and runs away let me do this and i will explain fully afterwards please she was uncertain enough to win me time so i hurried into the room and closed the door mary was standing in front of the dead fire gripping her little handbag as though it was some vital defence i stood and looked at her she wasnt bad looking i realised in an underfed pinched sort of fashion many a man would i drove the thought from my mind and told her to sit down i took over the place by the fireplace so i could look down on her so you were the assistant of madam boninska i said you know the police are after you she nodded dont worry i wont tell them although i should say they do not have the slightest thought that you killed her they want you as a witness nothing more they always want more she said she had a dull flat and entirely unattractive voice which went well with the vaguely blank look in her eyes and they dont pay as well as you do how much i pay will depend on how much you tell me i said so dont get any ideas just yet were you there when this woman was killed did you see who did it no she replied i didnt see anything i was out i came back and found her and thought theyll blame me for this so i ran for it quite understandable i commented but do you know who did it she shook her head she had no enemies in the world she said she was a lovely woman she looked at me like a bird eyeing a worm a guinea i did in fact have the money in my room but was loath to let it go to her then i sighed ran quickly up the stairs then returned and counted the money out onto the table dont touch i said as she leaned forward what was she like a cow she said a mean vicious cow i hated her i almost danced for joy when i saw her lying on the floor she was always drunk she smelled and she had a way of talking to you made you feel like dirt i hated her dont you have to be charming to clients in that line of business fortunetelling i mean oh yes for a bit she could crawl as well as anyone when she wanted until she got hold of them then shed drop all that when she was squeezing money out of them there was no more of that what do you mean shed get people to these séances and get them to tell all their secrets thinking they were talking to spirits then shed say you dont want your wife or your partner or your parents to hear about that do you give me an example one woman came she twisted her into saying shed had a friend you know she was married you see and the mistress got this womans jewels her rings all her money off her she killed herself eventually because when she was bled dry the mistress wrote a dirty little letter to the husband i had to deliver it she showed me the notice in the paper she pinned it on the wall like it was some great achievement she was proud of it and you she shrugged what do i care more than you admit never mind i want to ask you about a man who came to see her this man i showed her the photograph of ravenscliff yes i remember him i felt a surge of excitement rush through me at the words tell me everything the money on the table depends on it he wasnt a client she said after thinking about it for a while not for the tableturning and such normally she got all dressed up for that put on her special clothes and started talking in this voice trying to be mysterious and spooky you know this was different they talked do you know what about no but she wanted money off him did she get it not the time i was there he was angry about something that i heard unless you tell me therell be nothing for you and you dont know what he meant she shook her head not very helpful this madame boninska what do you know about her not much i mean she didnt exactly tell me anything did she she treated me like dirt she either looked down on everyone or tried to pull them down you should have heard the things she said about the people who came to see her so nice and sympathetic she was to them until shed got her claws into them then they learned more about her go on dont know really she wasnt russian not a foreigner at all but shed been abroad for a long time that she told me at the russian court high places in germany so she said they all loved madame boninska so why did she come back to england i reckon everyone else had tumbled to her and she hadnt anywhere else to go but she reckoned shed hit a gold mine here she was going to make her fortune she was going to get her due thats what she said then she did of course someone killed her and if that wasnt her due i dont know what was you have no idea ive told you she told me nothing i was a servant thats all i think i preferred the street but i hung on just in case she was telling the truth just in case she was going to get hold of some money there was no money in the flat when the police found the body she shrugged i couldnt blame her how much did you steal i asked quietly nothing she was clearly lying so i smiled at her back wages if you like this gold mine was it anything to do with this man do you think another shrug i did wish shed stop it she managed to give the impression she couldnt care about anything in the world which might be true of course i think so she was excited enough after he went this money you didnt steal was there anything else in the drawer some papers didnt look nothing important did you take those no theyd gone as well i had been beaten at every turn every time i did something thought of something someone had been there before me all i had established for my money was that ravenscliff wasnt interested in the spirit world but i had guessed that anyway that this woman had known something but i had no idea what it was maybe she had learned something in russia or in germany what could she possibly know that was important to a man like ravenscliff how well did they know each other were they friendly distant like strangers him you could almost see him holding his nose when he talked to her wouldnt shake her hand or anything like that no he wanted something and then hed never want to see her again did he get it dont know all i heard was her muttering to herself why why why that over and over again its too much to hope that you know what she was talking about she shook her head i sighed tell me i said very dispirited do you recognise any of these people i showed her a picture of lady ravenscliff she shook her head then i offered the group photograph of the beswick board and she looked and shrugged again chapter it turned into an eventful evening in paradise walk perhaps the oddest the little house had ever known i had just managed to persuade mrs morrison that the reputation of her house really wasnt under any serious threat when the doorbell rang a fact unprecedented and unimaginable respectable people do not ring the doorbell unannounced at eight oclock respectable people do not have unexpected visitors at eight oclock the very sound caused consternation and excitement even more the visitor it was wilf cornford who had a look of beatific pleasure on his face except when he looked at me then he frowned in disapproval i do believe you have not been keeping to your side of the bargain young man he said sternly i assumed that you would tell me things of importance and i find or at least i suspect that you have not been why is that because i have been talking to a sales manager from churchills the machinetool people and he told me that gleesons had ordered near eighteen months ago three new lathes the sort used to bore gun barrels so and then i dropped into a pub in moorgate and talked to a broker who deals in such things who told me quite categorically that gleesons had not sold off its old lathes in fact that the lathes it already possessed were exactly the same as the new ones is this interesting why would gleesons need eight lathes for boring guns for battleships when it has no orders for battleships i am truly not dissimulating when i say i havent got a clue i want a little bit more information from you if you please what else have you found out that you havent told me i thought for a while then decided to take the plunge i have discovered that a couple of million has been sucked out of ravenscliffs companies in the past eighteen months and that the shipyard is awash with spare parts i described the scene as best i could also that every politician in the land has shares in rialto and if you want minor details that ravenscliff had discovered some hole in his management structure that he couldnt understand and that the estate is tied up because of a bequest to a child who is probably dead wilf leaned back and sighed with contentment ah yes he said a great man even in his fall pardon had you told me all of this when you started i could have put all the pieces together very much faster you know i didnt want the pieces put together at all i said crossly my job was to find this child not investigate his companies i couldnt give a hoot about beswick or rialto anyway what pieces have you put together ravenscliff was a gambler he took the biggest gamble of his life and was losing i wonder how much longer he could have kept it going could you just tell me what you are talking about dont you realise he was building himself a battle fleet what obviously he had no new orders profits dwindling shipbuilders everywhere are in despair and yet he was ordering new lathes new armour plate the factories are bursting with parts what do you think these are all for how many spare guns do you think anyone needs three maybe no my friend he was building ships he committed five six million pounds and didnt stand a chance of getting it back it was simply a question of how long he would manage to keep going before everything came crashing down what is remarkable is that the likes of barings are still pretending theres nothing wrong you are sure that hed lost his bet did you not read the last budget no the government has spent so much money on oldage pensions that there is nothing left at all the only thing that could possibly change the situation is if a war broke out and that doesnt seem likely at the moment but ravenscliff was a clever man the cleverest and he wasnt worried if you were him and you were in that situation what would you do nothing nothing i could do except jump out of a window maybe or keep going and hope for a war he stared at me thats absurd he said there must be another explanation besides how does it explain the shareholders meeting i was merely repeating what you said not advancing my own opinion you know what about the shareholders meeting i have discovered who was behind the attempted coup détat i do very much hope you are going to tell me theodore xanthos he looked dreadfully smug as he said it but hes just a salesman i said scornfully wilf was now the one to adopt a looked of superior condescension just a salesman xanthos is responsible for about half of rialtos sales eleven million a year for the last twelve years so he gets a commission of one and threequarter per cent figure it out i shut my eyes and tried to use my newly learned financial skills thats about heavens that more than two million pounds so not just a salesman eh admittedly he has to pay all his own bribes out of that really of course you wouldnt want them traced back to the company would you i suppose not the comment however made me think no but even if hes been spending at the rate of a year in bribes i said incredulously oh yes at least that wilf said airily its quite normal i shook my head it wasnt my idea of normal the point is xanthos often operates through a bank in manchester which was where the payments to andersons to buy the rialto shares came from a few favours called in and they confirmed it which means that xanthos was trying to take control of rialto how does this fit in with anything wilf was standing now and reaching for his hat my dear boy i have no idea i was hoping you could tell me that chapter i arrived to see elizabeth the next morning there was nobody around so i let myself in and went up to the little sitting room to wait for her and got a shock when i walked in sitting on the settee was theodore xanthos mr braddock he said amiably as i entered what a pleasant surprise im surprised to see you as well i replied have you come to visit lady ravenscliff ah yes but i fear we will both be disappointed i have just been told she has gone really yes quite gone to cowes so i am told for the week she and john went every year it was one of lord ravenscliffs great pastimes he loved the sea which i always found curious why well he was not one of natures sportsmen you know nor a great romantic the lure of the elements did not burn brightly in him we once crossed the alps together in a train and i do not think he looked up once all that scenery that magnificence and grandeur and he never once took his nose out of his book the sea on the other hand had a very strange effect on him in what way it hypnotised him almost something about it you english and your sea very peculiar now we greeks are quite immune you know even though we were a seafaring nation while your ancestors were still grubbing around in forests when did she leave early this morning i believe i imagine all her bags went yesterday and she comes back i dont know last year they spent a week there then travelled to france for a month a month then he came back here and she went to take the waters in germany badenbaden yes i believe so he paused and looked puckish aha you are wondering how you will do without her for such a long time i told you you know i tried to warn you but she is quite irresistible i wished to consult her on a matter of importance and so did i so did i but here we are abandoned and forlorn ah well we must make the best of it have some of this excellent coffee i didnt want it but lady ravenscliff has her servants so well trained that the wishes of visitors are quite irrelevant he gestured to the tray on the table then poured delicately and without spilling a drop how are your researches i gather you have been to newcastle were you impressed i looked at him how did you know that good heavens mr braddock how can you even ask such a thing lady ravenscliff begins to act in a very unusual fashion hires someone who is quite unsuited for the task she gives him and you expect someone like me not to be curious of course i have tried to find out everything i can about you its not as if you are very good at hiding your tracks i didnt realise i was supposed to of course you didnt i found newcastle very interesting and mr steptoe was he interesting as well poor man the shock of the question quite threw me naturally it did i was perfectly unprepared for it and in any case was hardly trained in dissimulation it was not really necessary as a journalist i was clever enough to know that xanthos was trying to frighten me clever enough to acknowledge to myself that he was succeeding and above all quick enough to realise that my best response was not to play on his terms i looked enquiringly terrible accident so i hear run down in the street by a horse and cart went right over him broke his back dead poor fellow he smiled sadly i stared horrified i do wish elizabeth was a little more generous with the cake he said waving at an empty platter ive eaten it all i hope you dont mind a curious way of writing a biography when you havent even written a letter to his family in shropshire i concentrated on my coffee trying to stop my hands from trembling my editor advised me that when researching someones life it is best to start at the end and go back to the beginning i always take his advice have you ever travelled mr braddock not really you must it broadens the mind and it is good for the health and staying here isnt violent place london street crime innocent people attacked and murdered just for their wallets not even for that it happens all the time not so very often i said you forget i was a crime reporter so you were i mention it only because i need a contract taken to buenos aires for signature a trustworthy person to take it would be well paid really seven hundred pounds the boat leaves from southampton in a few days time otherwise i will meet the same fate as mr steptoe a strange thing to say but i suppose it is a risk we all face good heavens is that the time i must run he stood up brushed nonexistent crumbs from his jacket straightened his tie and looked at himself in the mirror where is the bowl what bowl he gestured at the mantelpiece oh that it got broken he stared at me it was just a pot he paused then recovered of course he took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the table then left it was addressed to me it contained a cheque for drawn on the bank of bruges in london and a ticket for the manitoba sailing from southampton in two days time chapter it goes without saying i imagine that i was agitated disturbed and very frightened this was all so far outside my experience that i had not the slightest idea what to do xanthos had given me money and said that if i did not take it he would kill me or have me killed not in so many words but even i could grasp his meaning poor mr steptoe was already dead so was someone else at the works so was ravenscliff and with such people dying who was i to think i was safe i needed time and i needed somewhere i could put aside the nagging feeling i had that i was being watched and followed this wasnt madness on my part i used all of george shorts skills in reverse and discovered it was true two people in fact for the first time i wondered how long they had been behind me without my even noticing they tailed after me all the way down piccadilly but i led the way into my territory not theirs into a land where i knew every little alleyway and many of the people on the streets every step made me feel safer less alone they werent that good and this made me feel stronger and less helpless i went down the strand carelessly as if i had not noticed them then into fleet street and into the duck always nearly empty at that time of day so i could be sure i would not be surprised i bought a drink which i needed badly and settled into a quiet corner peace i needed that as much as a whisky both in combination slowly had their effect i calmed down then became positively angry how dare he not a sensible response as it was obvious that he dared only too readily but it brought me back to myself and put to a temporary rest the quivering frightened and somewhat shameful creature which had taken over my mind xanthos had threatened me damn him why then he could have said the same at any stage over the past month or so was it because his scheme at the shareholders meeting had gone awry and he was planning another way of getting what he wanted and where was elizabeth had she really gone to cowes or was she the thought struck horror into my mind he was trying to take control of ravenscliffs companies and she was ravenscliffs heir curiously it was the thought of the little greek sitting so calmly on her settee which made my mind up i would like to say it was courage or patriotism or chivalry or some other manly virtue which aroused me but it was not it was the feeling of being supplanted of having the image in my mind spoilt which fired my determination i would be damned if i was going to southampton at least to get on a boat to south america i was all alone so be it i could not go home so i wrote a letter to mcewen in the pub and left it with the barman to give to him when he came in it set out as fully as i could everything i knew and left it to him to decide what to do about it then i sent a message for the runners for five shillings each they agreed to follow the followers and also make sure they were distracted while i left the pub by the back entrance one i believe was hit in the face by a large stone sending him to hospital the other had his wallet stolen the lad involved dancing down the street waving it above his head and tossing the contents on the ground until the pursuit got too close and he was obliged to show how fast he could run by which time i was far away threading my way through dark alleys and back streets down to the river then west but not home i dared not go there instead i went to whiteleys department store in bayswater bought a suitcase and some clothes what a wonderful thing it is to have money then to waterloo station and caught the to southampton by this time i felt almost comfortable in my new role i knew what i was doing and why i was doing it for the first time in weeks i was also completely certain that i was not being followed as the runner id paid to tag behind me signalled that all was well having money and being preoccupied by a higher purpose did not mean i was immune to the pressures of the english class system though merely being able to afford a firstclass ticket does not entitle you to be in a firstclass seat or at least does not mean you will feel comfortable there i endured it for half an hour until we passed woking then i stood up and marched down to the scruffier but altogether more comfortable depths of second the english ruling classes on holiday are terrifying not least because they are not on holiday they go to cowes and i imagine to henley and ascot with the same steely determination that grenadiers march into enemy fire they are on display they are working the only work they do in fact looking elegant saying the right things being with the right people is as vital for them as getting my punctuation correct is for me or connecting up a pipe correctly is for a plumber except that plumbers and journalists are more forgiving one slip and the ruling classes are doomed it seems no wonder they talked with such a nervous twitter no wonder they spent much of their time nervously glancing at their reflection in the window as the drab suburbs of south london drifted past a family of five a mother three daughters two of marriageable age and a son who would have benefited from being put into old clothes and running around the streets throwing stones through windows poor child he was so well behaved it was almost unendurable to be in the same compartment as him now second class was a very different thing and i spotted two hacks from the times feet on the seats in a compartment filled with smoke i felt at home and safe and secure the moment i sat down beside them even though in the normal course of things they were not my sort of journalist gumble was a war man so i couldnt really see what he was doing there jackson had been crime but had vanished about six months ago he seemed almost embarrassed to see me and it took some time to discover why eventually after much questioning he sighed took out his notebook and handed it over for me to read whatever be her opinions as to its intrinsic joys the woman who accepts a yachting invitation must see that she has dresses suitable for the occasion i read i looked up at him and he grimaced apologetically one of the new designs for cowes is carried out in nattier blue marquisette over satin closely pleated in accordion fashion to give the narrow straight effect in a pleasing manner an upturned collar of lace and tiny roundcut chemisette you poor fellow i exclaimed and he nodded gloomily what on earth did you do missed the verdict in the osborne murder he said six months in fashion to teach me the error of my ways i read on there was a day when serges were the only materials utilised for yachting dresses but the weather during this week should make it possible to wear linens tussores shantungs and foulards i dont even know what it means nor do i he replied taking back the notebook and stuffing it into his pocket once more its all in the dressmakers handouts no idea what theyre on about at all i turned to gumble youre not in the doghouse as well are you afraid so i was in afghanistan doing really well i thought but there isnt a war in afghanistan is there theres always a war in afghanistan anyway its a long story if you think jacksons got troubles what do you think of this he also got out his notebook and i again read their majesties dinner party included the crown prince and crown princess of sweden the princess victoria and princess victoria patricia of connaught the commanderinchief at portsmouth the duchess of teck and elizabeth lady ravenscliff this morning they joined their yacht for divine service the service was conducted by rearadmiral sir colin keppel adc in attendance were bloody hell i said i know two years dodging bullets in the khyber pass no i mean lady ravenscliff why are you interested in her youre right of course her in mourning shes such a fixture i suppose they couldnt do without her dont know what is happening to standards but do i care i do not you dont happen to know where she will be in cowes is she going very inappropriate she might well be a guest on the victoria and albert of course my heart sank i thought that finding her would be simply a matter of going to her hotel and knocking on the door but if she was half a mile out to sea on the royal yacht it was going to be more difficult than i had anticipated do you know he went on i think youre the first person ever to be interested in this rubbish i gave him back his notebook i hadnt realised she moved in such grand circles who would have thought it so youre just going to the isle of wight to do this ah no i hope to write something interesting about the tsar if i can only get something then i win fame and favour what about you didnt i hear that youd been fired i resigned and i am going in fact thats a bit complicated where are you staying i shrugged no idea i thought id book into a hotel they looked at each other then laughed i hope you like sleeping on park benches then jackson said if you can find one unoccupied id not thought of that you can bunk with us were at the george as long as you have no revolting personal habits none and thanks youre welcome you sleep on the floor and pay half the costs we get the receipt fair enough the times was more generous than other papers over expenses the rest of the journey was almost pleasant i was given a swift grounding in cowes week by my two new companions the only thing left out was anything to do with boats as the times that year had decided not to bother sending anyone who knew about racing too expensive they even offered me work as a stringer to take care of some of them the foot handicap or better still the kings cup they didnt suppose i wanted to try my hand at mrs godfrey barings bal masqué did i i declined the boats never having been on one and not having the slightest idea how you would even tell who had won but astonished them by accepting the ball if elizabeth was there if she was still alive it was the sort of thing shed attend cowes was crammed and the solent was like piccadilly circus on a busy friday evening the little ferry which took us and our luggage over from the mainland had to weave its way through hundreds of yachts big and small onemasted and threemasted long and sleek and modern old and rather run down as well as what seemed like most of the royal navy lying a mile offshore for review on shore it was even worse the ferry was so full it looked as though it might sink at any moment and we were hurled out onto dry land into a crowd of people women with parasols arm in arm men in white ducks and blazers holidaymakers in boaters small children nannies and servants jackson led the way to the george a small hotel next to a printing shop very expensive and less than luxurious a small room with three people in it was apparently quite luxurious for the time of year and even though we could scarcely all fit inside we hoisted our bags onto the beds then retired to the bar three pints of osborne pale later we felt quite recovered and ready for battle i had almost forgotten why i was there i was no longer afraid not for the moment anyway jackson and gumble at least knew what they were meant to be doing jackson positioned himself to take notes on what the likes of mrs algernon dunwether considered appropriate for her midafternoon wear it seems that the wealthier women were obliged to change clothes up to six times a day which was why houses close to the centre fetched such a premium while gumble wandered off to the offices of the cowes gazette to get the daily lineup of what those with titles would be up to all evening i by contrast was at a loss i had vaguely imagined i would simply run into lady ravenscliff walking along the promenade but clearly this was not going to be the case so while i thought it over i strolled up the esplanade to egypt house a large modern pile of imitation tudor brickwork that the barings had taken for the week this i stared at for a while then looked out over the solent to where the victoria and albert was anchored then walked back into the town centre i asked one of the boatmen from the royal yacht but he hadnt got a clue who was staying on the bloody ship and who was i to ask anyway frustrating although i found that a laziness slowly crept upon me even though there was enough on my mind to make me alert and nervous i had only ever been to the seaside properly a couple of times sunday trips to southend to waste time and money even there not the most elegant of places i discovered that the motion of the sea had a decided tendency to make me sleepy and stupid it has always had that effect on me and still does perhaps i had more in common with ravenscliff than i realised and so did the beer of course and by the time i got back to the george not really very far i was as dull as it was possible to be i forced myself to keep on walking as i knew that if i lay down id fall asleep for hours and kept on going until i hit water again an inlet which divides cowes in two there is no bridge just a strange contraption which looks like a floating wooden shed that is pulled this way and that across the water by chains ferrying passengers from one bank to the other i perched myself on a bollard watching the people girls and boys in sailor suits men who worked in the boatyards women coming over some from grand houses others more modest after their shopping going home to cook dinner or have it cooked for them and then i woke up with a start and pulled my hat down over my head hunched my shoulders to avoid being noticed by the man who had walked up the ramp and turned to stare back as the wooden gates which looked as though they had been borrowed from a farmyard swung shut it was him there was no mistake could be none he was dressed differently looking now like a bank clerk on holiday in a dark suit and starched white collar he had shaved oiled his hair to look the part but he still looked like a labourer could never really pass as english still had the immobile features the lack of expression in his eyes which glanced around cautiously every moment rather than staring ahead stupidly as i am sure mine had been until that moment jan the builder took out a cigarette and lit it as the ferry floated off into midstream but didnt seem to notice anything strange about me i did my best not to look too attentive as the ferry stopped on the other side and all the passengers got off to be replaced once more by new ones tried to keep my eyes on him as it came back over and at last i could get on board myself but it was a waste of time ten minutes and twopence later i reached the far bank and he had vanished i walked quickly up the main road out of town doubled back down side streets dotted with seaside villas of greater or lesser grandeur turned left and right for more than an hour but nothing if the jolt in my chest when i saw him hadnt been so extreme and painful i would have concluded it had been a mistake but it was not i was sure it was not i have read many adventure stories in my time and many of the problems in them seem to arise from the fact that the main protagonists never think of going straight off to confide in the police when they come upon some dastardly deed instead they keep their information to themselves and all sorts of trouble results of course they always manfully sort everything out in the end but often i wonder how much easier it would all have been had the authorities been kept properly informed in advance besides i had no desire to sort it all out myself manfully or not so i went back to town and straight to the police station and there i realised why the strapping heroes of fiction do not spend their precious time on such activities the authorities on the whole are not interested had i been reporting a stray dog or the theft of an umbrella or the loss of a pocket book then i have no doubt that constable armstrong would have snapped into action as quickly as you like instead he looked at me as though i was the problem sucked his teeth thoughtfully and frowned in a manner which suggested very strongly that he considered me to be someone who needed humouring i suppose even anarchists must have holidays he said in a jocular fashion must be hard work all that overthrowing and all this is not a joke very well tell me whats bothering you and so i did but by the time the policeman had realised that i had only heard at secondhand that jan the builder was an anarchist revolutionary didnt know his real name only heard at secondhand that he had a gun didnt know for certain he had one on him only saw him at a considerable distance had only seen him once before and couldnt swear that he wasnt on holiday he began to lose patience were not going to get martial law declared on the basis of that are we sir he commented i scowled and stumped out chapter what on earth do you think youre doing dressed up like that jackson asked i looked aggrieved it was past eight oclock i hadnt eaten and i was almost ready to go you asked me to do this ball didnt you he stared at me then burst out laughing youre meant to report on it not go to it you idiot you dont seriously think theyll let you in do you youre supposed to stand by the gate and get a list of the guests as they arrive not trip the light fantastic with the duchess of devonshire oh i looked at myself in the mirror i had been rather proud of my appearance i was dressed as a fisherman having rapidly bribed an old man in the port to let me have his oilskins and hat to this i had attached lots of flies and bits and bobs of the sort that fishermen use so i thought and i had a large wicker basket with a plaster lobster in it which id bought from a shop which sold tourist trinkets besides jackson said scornfully its a bal masqué not a fancydress party i stared at him i think he heard me deflating theres a difference this sort of ball the men dress as usual the women wear masks thats why its called a masked ball i have to go i said even if i have to break in i have to find lady ravenscliff why shes it doesnt matter i need to find her i doubt youll find her at a ball shes meant to be in mourning she dined with the king thats different that is allowed just but a ball it would be a scandal its bad enough that she came here at all if she did i mean if everyones masked shes the sort who would slip in someone there will know where she is ive got to go just in case not as the representative of the times youre not its more than my jobs worth i must have been looking properly desperate because he dropped the scornful jocular tone and looked at me shrewdly youre about the same size as gumble take his clothes then wont he need them yes he opened the wardrobe door and started pulling out clothes youd better hurry hell be very annoyed when he finds out so an hour later as the evening was just tipping over into darkness i was walking up egypt hill a road that led away from the promenade and skirted the gardens of the baring house i had thought of trying to talk my way in but gave up the idea journalists can do much get into courtrooms police stations peoples houses by sheer brass neck but gatecrashing a society party i thought might need practice so drawing on the wisdom of george short once more never be direct if you can be devious i kept an eye on the wall until i came across a place with a suitable tree that had branches hanging down across the stonework half a minute later i was in the garden adjusting my bow tie dusting down gumbles suit and walking more boldly than i felt up to the house itself nobody gave me a moments attention it worked perfectly i was given a glass of champagne by a passing waiter and strolled into the main reception room already full of people and heady with the smell of perfume where i leaned against a wall and watched to get my bearings and work out precisely how i should behave remember such an event was as foreign to me as an esquimaux wedding party i needed to tread carefully and i felt ridiculous evening dress was not my normal wear id been more comfortable in the fishermans oilskin the fact that most of the women were far more ridiculous looking than i could ever dream of being was no consolation why they ever consented to such absurdities how it was considered the height of fashion eluded me had they possessed the stylishness of elizabeth ravenscliff they might have succeeded but most looked like plump middleaged englishwomen in a mask not for the first time i was glad that i lived in the world of pubs and press rooms besides how did society operate was it permissible just to go up to someone and start talking would i cause a scandal if i engaged some young girl in conversation having achieved my aim of getting into the party i realised that i hadnt thought too much about what i was meant to do next i wanted to see elizabeth to warn her to talk to her but how to find her even if she was there all the women were in masks and although i reckoned i could count on her to be more beautifully turned out than anyone else in the room it was impossible to tell which one she might be some of the masks were tiny and did nothing to disguise the identity of the wearer but a fair number were very large all i could do was wander around hoping she would notice me if she was there she didnt or maybe she was but didnt want to acknowledge me i was rapidly beginning to think this had been a bad idea glad you could come said a hearty voice beside me as i retired to the wall again and tried to be as visible as possible i had attracted the wrong person a tall greyhaired man with a bristling moustache and a red face mainly from a collar two sizes too small for him so the fat of his neck hung down over it was standing beside me looking vaguely hopeful he seemed bored with the whole thing and desperate for any reason not to have to compliment some absurdity in frills good evening sir i said then remembered who he was im pleased to see you again tom baring peered at me uncertainly a look of vague panic passing across his face he knew me had met me had forgotten who i was such were his thoughts i knew nothing quite like embarrassment for making someone try harder a meeting at barings last year i said vaguely we didnt meet properly ah yes i remember he said surprisingly convincingly in the circumstances family duties you know he looked a bit more interested i had a family that had duties in fact the only interest in the meeting was the possibility that i might have been able to ask your advice about a piece of porcelain a fairly desperate way of winning his confidence and establishing a connection but the best i could do and it seemed to work he brightened immediately oh well only too glad ask away please do it is a dish of some sort i was given it its chinese really well it is meant to be i continued with perfectly genuine vagueness i was given it as a present you see and i wouldnt trust any old dealer to tell me truthfully what it is id be too easily deceived im afraid i was wondering if you could tell me of an honest one no such thing he said cheerfully theyre all rogues and scoundrels now i will certainly tell you the truth unless its really valuable in which case ill tell you its worthless and offer to take it off your hands he laughed heartily tell me about it about nine inches across with blue foliage bamboo and fruits that sort of thing markings any stamps i believe so i said straining to remember hmm not much help from your description it could be s or made last year and sold in any teashop id have to look at it where did it come from i was given it it used to be on the mantelpiece in lady ravenscliffs sitting room to say she had given it to me was stretching a point perhaps he raised an eyebrow not the ostrokoff bowl i think thats the one good god man its one of the loveliest pieces of ming porcelain in the world the whole world he looked at me with new interest and no little curiosity i have asked to buy it on many an occasion but have always been turned down ive been using it to eat my breakfast baring gave a shudder my dear boy the first time i saw it i almost fainted he gave it to you do you have any idea what it is worth what on earth did you do for ravenscliff that im afraid i am not at liberty to say oh well quite correct quite correct he said still quite breathless and flustered the thought of my boiled eggs had so rattled him that he was no longer in full command of his faculties for my part the memory of it flying past my shoulder and smashing into the wall came flooding back to me an extravagant gesture i almost felt flattered well i shouldnt but well battleships oh you mean ravenscliffs private navy i smiled and tried to look nonchalant about the whole thing i suppose you know about that of course i had to be brought in over moving the money around i was very doubtful i must say but as you may know we owe ravenscliff a great deal just so what exactly do you do i looked cautious i keep an eye on things quietly if you see what i mean did at least for lord ravenscliff until he died yes indeed great loss very awkward as well bad timing ah yes damnable government dithering like that although ravenscliff was remarkably sanguine all will be well he said dont worry he knew exactly how to persuade them to take the plunge then he dies typical of the man that he foresaw even that possibility though when we heard i must say we rather panicked if the shareholders found out whats been going on difficult i said sympathetically can you imagine telling our shareholders that the bond they thought was for a south african gold mine was in fact for a private battle fleet id be picking oakum in reading gaol by now but at least id be in good company he laughed i joined in perhaps a little too heartily yet here you are here i am as you say thanks to ravenscliff putting some nonsense in his will so no one can look at the books for a bit it has bought us time although not much im damnably worried about it so is his widow i understand i said ah yes i suspect she may know more than she should there was little ravenscliff didnt tell her how is that well i dont know exactly what he said of course but i hear that she has hired some man to find this child which of course has the effect of making its existence all the more real the more he bumbles around asking questions the better it is oh god i thought are you all right baring asked no i said ive had a bit of a stomach ache all day would you think me terribly rude if i excused myself im so sorry by all means is lady ravenscliff here by the way of course not he said shes in mourning not even in cowes really i was told she was staying on the royal yacht certainly not i was there for tea this afternoon no i imagine she is still in london i know she is no respecter of convention but even she would not i didnt really care one way or the other i turned round and walked out of the ballroom as slowly as i could manage got to the big french windows which opened on to the garden and when i was out of sight broke into a run heading for the wall where id come in as quickly as i could and there i sat for an hour or more halflistening to the sound of the orchestra the occasional footfall as a couple walked past or the men came out for a cigar the women for some fresh air but not really interested in any of it everyone had been right i had been chosen because of my complete unsuitability my job really had been to confuse matters the child did not exist had never existed it was a safety net designed to protect ravenscliffs companies should he die before this great undertaking was completed the government wanted battleships but dared not order them barings and ravenscliff put up the money and gambled they would change their minds of course it had to be secret the slightest whisper could bring the government down and ravenscliffs empire and did i care one jot no i had comforted her in her distress sympathised with her loss worked desperately to find the information she wanted come to her with my little discoveries been deceived by the look of gratitude in her eyes when i assured her that all would be well and when i began to find out more than i should xanthos turns up to give me a good fright dear god but i hated the lot of them let them fight it out between them i got up finally stiff and cold even though the night was warm and crawled over the wall into the freedom of the normal ordinary mundane world where people tell the truth and mean what they say where honesty counts and affection is real back into my own world in fact where i felt comfortable and at home it was my own fault really i should have listened ive mentioned that i tend to sleep well most of the time the great gift did not desert me that night fortunately even though jackson snored abominably and the floor was hard i fell asleep by two oclock and slept as though all the world was well in the morning i had to work to bring back the memories of the night before but found when i did so that i was free of them so i had been made a fool of used manipulated deceived not the first time and not the last and at least i had figured it out for myself even the thoughts of revenge which had flickered through my mind the night before held no more attraction yes i could have told my two snoring companions everything but i couldnt really be bothered and besides what good would it serve i could destroy ravenscliffs companies but they would only be replaced by others just the same and it was a lovely fine morning of the sort when it was good to be alive i even took gumbles complaints about having stolen his clothes and jacksons insistence on keeping my plaster lobster as a souvenir in good part i was resolved to think no more of the matter i would spend elizabeth ravenscliffs money i would think no more of battleships let alone of mediums anarchists or any other rubbish none of it was my business i did not care i would become a journalist once more and go back to my old life somewhat richer than i had been to begin with what possible reason did i have to complain anyway i was paid well and if it was to make a fool of myself so be it i was a wellpaid fool at least and that evening i decided i would go to southampton and i would get on a boat and i would go to south america having posted xanthoss cheque off to my bank first of all more money if they wanted to give it away why should i turn down the offer id earned it i bought my two colleagues breakfast a good breakfast the best that cowes could provide with lashings of bacon black pudding eggs fried bread fried tomatoes tea toast and marmalade the works and then decided that as jackson was going on the press jaunt to the sandrart i would go with him i now had nothing better to do i was a free man unemployed my own master oh yes the tsar of all the russias nicholas ii you would have thought no doubt that having such a grand gentleman in town would have caused a stir it was not every day after all that the worlds greatest autocrat the last true absolute monarch in europe dropped into a small town off the south coast in fact he hadnt he hadnt even put a foot on shore the only evidence of his presence was the shape of the imperial yacht the sandrart about half a mile off shore anchored a few hundred yards from the victoria and albert and with a collection of navy gunboats posted around doing guard duty as a sop to the journalists who wanted something to put in their daily bulletins there was to be a tour of the yacht i had expected that gumble would come along as well but he turned his nose up at the idea you dont think that the tsar is going to be on board with a lot of smelly journalists tramping all over the place do you either the entire family will take refuge on the v and a or theyll come on shore and i may have fallen low in the estimation of my editors but i am damned if i am going to spend my time looking at imperial curtains i am going to walk up to osborne if hes on land hell be there so jackson and i went i merely curious jackson trying to pretend he wasnt the main thing i discovered from the morning was that i have a tendency to seasickness in very small boats we were rowed out in the yachts cutter which was fine until we were about a hundred yards offshore then it wasnt my only consolation was that half of the press corps well about four of us out of ten or so also began smiling bravely nor was it worth it gumble was quite correct in thinking that the imperial family would make themselves scarce not even an imperial nanny remained on board all we had was a bunch of russian sailors whose outright hostility to his majestys loyal press was palpable we were escorted round the apartments at military speed nothing was pointed out or explained no questions were taken no photographs allowed all i got from the experience was a sense of wonder at how unnautical it all was the state apartments were decorated like any house you might have found in mayfair thirty years ago with padded chairs chandeliers and even a fireplace in the corner only the disconcerting rocking motion reminded you that you were on a boat sorry a yacht at all and then we were put back into the cutter and rowed back to the shore not even a glass of vodka but jeremiah hopkins did at least take his revenge by vomiting in the bottom of the boat just before we arrived back on land compliments of the daily mail he muttered as he stepped over his donation to get off a messy business the freedom of the press he added as he straightened up and walked unsteadily towards the nearest pub for my part i didnt think that was the best solution to the problem of my stomach steady land and fresh air seemed a better idea so i decided to walk to osborne to find gumble he had been correct in his judgements so far he might be right now i walked to the ferry crossed over and strolled up york avenue to the main gate i was not alone clearly news of some event had got around the royal family and the imperial family said one woman in tones of hushed awe when i found myself walking beside her theyll be coming out when theyve finished their visit theyll drive down to the esplanade before going back on board their yachts isnt that wonderful and thoughtful of them we walked in step this reverential matriarch and i strolling together like two old friends in the warm sunshine of the early afternoon she told me how she had found out so much information from her kitchen i do not know she should have been a reporter that the two royal families had crossed to osbornes private landing stage by boat but intended to show themselves to the town before returning two monarchs two consorts and a bag of children would be on display i could not really see the attraction of just watching people drive by but i was clearly in a minority on that one when we arrived there was already a crowd of a few hundred mainly townspeople by the look of them lining the wooded path which ran from the road to the grand entrance gate gumble was there also looking extremely displeased with the situation his request to go inside had been flatly turned down there would be no interview and he had to stand there like some common shop assistant with not the slightest chance of coming up with anything worth writing about at all i commiserated but there wasnt much chance he would have said anything interesting anyway i concluded not the point i wanted an interview what he said was irrelevant he replied you could always make it up i suggested well in fact thats what got me in trouble in the first place he said reluctantly i quoted habibullah khan on the reforms he was introducing in afghanistan unfortunately he was out of the country at the time and had just reversed them all so he complained bad luck i said yes so no making things up for a while i do wish theyd get a move on i want my lunch i had stopped listening i was staring over at the other line of spectators a blur of expectant faces all patiently waiting except for one who came into sharp focus as i looked then looked again a poorly dressed woman with a cheap hat pulled down over her face clutching a handbag i knew she had seen me i could see that my face had registered that she was hoping i had not seen her she took a step back and disappeared behind a burly man and a couple of squawking children who were waving little flags on sticks oh my goodness i said and looked up and down the row of people to see if i could catch sight of her again nothing but i did see pc armstrong my sceptical constable of the day before still hunting anarchists are we sir he said cheerfully when i walked up to him this was a long time ago there were no barriers or controls on people then constable is he here then not that ive seen but well let me know and well deal with him he said complacently im certain he is though armstrong looked sceptical but ever so slightly worried why ive seen someone he knows i pointed and he called over other policeman on duty both then strolled over and began walking up and down looking out for anyone they considered suspicious they had seen nothing and found no one by the time the great gates swung open and a murmur of expectation swept through the crowd in the distance a line of three black automobiles rollsroyces came slowly down the driveway the canvas tops were open so they wouldnt obscure the view as they turned the bend i could see that the leading car had two men in the back resplendent in uniform the second had two women they were wearing hats tied over their heads with scarves constable stop the cars for gods sake i said as i ran up to him close the gate armstrong panicked he could control the crowds as long as all was well but wasnt capable of doing anything other than watch people and tell himself that everything was fine dont worry he said dont worry dont worry and his lips kept moving even when he stopped speaking as though he was reciting a prayer and it was too late anyway the big black machine was coming through the gate slowing down so that the crowds could applaud and see and to allow the cars behind to catch up and make a proper procession of it i was looking up and down the line of faces desperate to see elizabeth convinced that something dreadful was about to happen it was the way she was clutching her handbag which worried me most all i could see in my mind was her hands the knuckles white as she held tightly onto that cheap canvas bag held it up over her stomach so she could put her hand into it the cars were now going at no more than two miles an hour the flags were waving the people were cheering the kingemperor of great britain and the indias sat on the right looking bored the tsar of all the russias was by his side gazing at the crowd with the air of someone who found all this populace slightly distasteful and then i realised my mistake i saw a man a big burly man wearing a suit like a bank clerk step forward some ten yards away from me his hand underneath his jacket i shouted and he turned to look at me then dismissed me from his thoughts i was ten yards from him he was only ten yards from the car but it was getting closer all the time and i was just standing there speechless and immobile but a man can run faster than a slowmoving car much faster when he is terrified i began to run and the closer i got the better i could see i could see his hand pulling out from under his jacket saw the black thing in it got closer still and saw the barrel and i saw it being lifted and pointing just as i got close enough to leap heard the explosion as i fell then another one as i collapsed on the ground and i felt the most incredible unbelievable pain which blotted out almost everything else except for the one last image as i looked up from the dust and gravel and saw elizabeth standing over me gun in her hand a look of wildness in her eyes chapter i have read much nonsense over the years about being shot the main things being firstly that it doesnt hurt and secondly that the noise sounds more like a faint popping rather than a loud bang rubbish firstly the noise of the gun going off sounded like the crack of doom i was sure my eardrums had burst secondly it hurt like the very devil and from the very moment that the bullet entered my shoulder and then it hurt more until i lost consciousness and hurt still more when i woke up again in hospital in my case at least it was also untrue that i could remember nothing wondered where i was and what had happened i remembered perfectly well thank you very much then i went back to sleep it was morning i guessed when i woke up again and i stared at the ceiling gathering my thoughts before showing any sign that i was conscious but i got an unpleasant surprise when i turned my head to look around sitting beside me reading a newspaper was the small almost dainty figure of the man i knew to be henry cort a cup of tea on a small table by his side mr braddock he said with the faintest of smiles and how are you i dont know i said ah then let me tell you you have been shot i know that i suppose you do not too seriously im glad to say although it made a nasty wound and you have lost a lot of blood if it hadnt been for your friend mr gumble who knows something about bullet wounds from his time in afghanistan you would have bled to death probably however the doctors tell me you will recover perfectly well in time she shot me yes yes so it seems what happened why dont you read this its the dispatch penned by mr gumble for the times and so we know it must be of the highest accuracy he gave me the morning paper then summoned a nurse to help me sit up enough to be able to read it this took a very long time but at least it gave me an opportunity to get back to my senses the pain helped as well it wasnt that bad but it reminded me i was still alive i was given some water and tucked into bed properly and fussed over quite charmingly all of that took about half an hour during which time cort sat quite impassively doing nothing and managing not to look bored then when i was feeling tolerably human again he once more handed me the newspaper feminist outrage at cowes i read i looked at him terrible these women eh he said i frowned and read some more cowes an outrage was offered to our royal visitors today by a suffragist in what is regarded here as a childish and unseemly exhibition an attempt to embarrass the people of this country by the parading of supposed grievances in front of visitors is considered another blow which women suffragists have dealt to their own cause miss muriel williamson let off firecrackers close to the royal party as they were leaving osborne house having paid their respects in the death chamber of our late queen in a manner deliberately designed to alarm the fact that it could well have been a much more serious matter gives considerable cause for concern miss williamson who we understand has only lately been released from an asylum he should be ashamed of himself i said weakly oh he is cort said he really is he took some persuading to write that and why did he because i was able to convince him that a near assassination of the tsar on english soil would not be good for our standing in the world and of course the prospect of a foreign posting on the strong recommendation of the foreign office why did elizabeth shoot me another interesting question cort said thoughtfully she says you got in the way you hurled yourself heroically on the assassin but not quickly enough to prevent him from bringing his gun to bear on his target she decided it was too risky to be squeamish so shot you both just to be on the safe side she killed jan the builder so you may consider yourself fortunate the question i have not yet managed to settle in my mind though is who is responsible for all this dont you know i was lying down again staring at the ceiling so heard his words without being able to see his face it was curious it was more like a conversation with myself and as long as i talked to myself as quietly as i liked i found it easy enough to speak cort picked up his chair and moved closer to the bed i was working on the assumption he said that ravenscliff had organised it in order to make the need for his battleships a little more pressing but if so why did his wife stop it and in such a dramatic fashion and so we come to you me it has nothing to do with me at all of course not no i was merely hoping you might be able to shed a little light on matters why dont you ask lady ravenscliff well as she has recently shot two people im not sure her word is so very reliable even more difficult of course is the fact that she claims she has been acting under the belief that i was responsible for it all why she has a long memory he said cryptically it is of no importance but there you are you see she thinks i was responsible i think she was you on the other hand the victim the innocent bystander so to speak may be considered objective so am i right that john stone really was behind it all and wanted the blame to fall on the germans why do you think that cort shrugged john stone felt betrayed he had been persuaded to launch a private venture building battleships and was facing severe difficulties because the government would not place the orders he had been promised he therefore decided to organise an international crisis which would generate the orders he needed who persuaded him to build the ships a group of concerned citizens influential ones i might say who felt that the governments naval policy was disastrously misguided but the government was elected oh never mind it was true i really didnt care as i was saying he continued i hoped you might provide some nugget of information which would allow me that did it a nugget it was all anyone expected of me some fragment the significance of which i did not even realise only someone like cort would understand its importance i was too dimwitted to grasp it myself it was nothing to do with ravenscliff i said still quietly but deliberately so now speaking softly to make him bend ever closer so he could hear me are you sure yes it looks like it was i know the tsar dies the assassins are arrested or killed their homes are raided by the police and surprise surprise they find documents indicating that they had been paid by the bank of hamburg an outrageous plot by the germans just the sort of thing you would expect of such barbarians the russians would be outraged and would declare a war of revenge the french would follow and the british might join in whatever the result ravenscliff would benefit he owned shares in all the major armaments companies and controlled many of them he would also sell his battleships at a good price but if anyone had looked closer they would have spotted ravenscliffs hand behind it all the bank of hamburg was his personal bank in germany the payments were authorised by the beswick shipyard he would have come under heavy suspicion would it have made any difference could the government possibly have admitted that one of their citizens had done such a thing or would they have buried the information are you asking me cort said or is that rhetoric im asking publicly i imagine it would have been covered over i cant imagine any government admitting something like that certainly that would have been my recommendation privately however i think not precisely ever so quietly ravenscliff would have been removed what would it have been falling under a train a heart attack cort shrugged i continued the trouble is that ravenscliff died before this scheme took place and he was not behaving like someone hatching a dastardly plot to embroil the continent in war far from it he was trying desperately to find out what was going on he had learned that there was something strange taking place inside his company honest young men were turning into thieves payments were being made without authorisation but that could not happen everything had to be authorised which meant that someone someone fairly senior must be authorising them but he did not know who all he knew was that it wasnt him i stopped here and tried to turn but could not cort lifted my head and helped me sip some water from a glass on the little table beside the bed he did it surprisingly gently it made me feel safe a dangerous feeling so instead of the usual means a man like him had of dealing with such matters he turned to the only person he knew he could trust absolutely his wife she tried to find out the truth and did so up to a point she established the money was going to jan the builder but until the very last moment did not know why it was a closerun thing when ravenscliff died there was a battle for control of rialto on the one hand barings was buying up shares was it you who organised this he nodded on the other so was someone else theodore xanthos tried to take advantage of his employers death and was thwarted only by barings and you then he tried to organise a shareholders revolt but was blocked again because the estate was in limbo ravenscliff had tangled up his will to buy time in case of his death something which he must have foreseen or at least considered as a possibility xanthos also tried to distract ravenscliff by attacking the one thing he held more dear than his companies he lit upon the witchwoman in germany and brought her over to england she i think was attempting to blackmail lady ravenscliff she told me she had had affairs the witchwoman was the sort who would find out about them cort smiled appreciatively at least i think thats what it was did you kill her i asked me cort asked why do you ask that you took all her papers that was you wasnt it thats true i didnt want anything to fall into the hands of someone like you by accident but there was nothing of interest you have a very odd notion about me mr braddock i think you must have been listening to lady ravenscliff too much nobody likes you very much i am wounded he said and almost looked as though he meant it why did you threaten poor mr seyd he looked displeased poor mr seyd as you call him has been in the pay of germany for years he said you dont think he started investigating rialto by chance do you i stared blankly at him so who did kill her he shrugged i have learned over the years to concentrate on essentials i suggest you do the same he had a quiet gentle voice i thought entirely reasonable but you did steal ravenscliffs papers i have them he didnt seem inclined to elaborate anyway i continued trying to digest this in my opinion this had nothing to do with ravenscliff he was arrogant enough not to doubt his own judgement he could not believe any decision of his could go wrong he was supremely confident that this gamble of his would work there is no sign that he was worried on that score at all but he was coming to grips with the one thing he feared more than anything his companies had come alive he had created a monster and it was acting in its own interests no longer taking orders its job was to maximise its profits xanthos saw a way to make them astronomically large and enrich himself at the same time and when ravenscliff threatened to stop it i believe his own invention killed him i doubt that xanthos personally pushed him out of the window but i am fairly certain that he was responsible for it he threatened to kill me a few days ago a man called steptoe was killed by him a few days ago another employee at beswick died as well i dont know if he was acting in concert with other managers bartoli jenkins neuberger may all be part of it or they may have been even less aware of what was taking place than ravenscliff himself i dont really care thats your job and that is your understanding of what has taken place yes ravenscliff was much too clever to channel money for an assassination through his own companies he was a master of the art of hiding much larger sums you were meant to trace the money heavens even i managed it interesting i had assumed xanthos was operating on ravenscliffs instructions are you sure he was not he would hardly have had to spend so much time finding out what xanthos was doing if he already knew and lady ravenscliff would have been nowhere near cowes yesterday i mean in the matter of assassinations why not let the professionals get on with it he thought this one over in that case i think i may owe lady ravenscliff an apology she must think very poorly of me thank you mr braddock you have been most informative i wish id talked to you earlier you must forgive me i assumed that you must have had some hidden role certainly you did seem to go out of your way to draw attention to yourself i thought i was being discreet yes well there we must differ he stood up and folded his newspaper i do hope you recover properly and with good speed but im afraid i must leave i have a great deal to do giving lady ravenscliff her freedom of course being somewhere near the top of the list and he quietly left me alone to my thoughts which were in some turmoil after what i had just said i beat the mattress with my fist in frustration so hard that my shoulder opened up again and i had to be rebandaged by the nurses who scolded me then gave me some nastytasting medicine which made me drowsy once more when i woke up again it was night and she was there heavens but she was beautiful so delicate and lovely sitting and looking out of the window so i could study her for a long time the only time i had caught her unaware that she was being looked at i could see what she was really like when no one else was watching there was nothing she merely sat waiting totally immobile with no expression on her face no movement at all just perfection no more and no less a work of art so exquisite that it was breathtaking i had never encountered a woman so lovely and in all the years afterwards never met anyone who came close and when i moved she turned and smiled i felt a glow spread through me just to be the recipient of such warmth and concern made me feel better matthew how are you ive been so worried for you i cannot apologise enough i should think not i said with an attempt at a smile you did shoot me i have been in agonies about it terrible thing terrible but you are still with us and so is the tsar when did you know he was the target not until jan stepped forward hed told me to come with him that this was important we stayed in a boarding house for a night he was unusually terse and illhumoured but wouldnt say anything i tried my best but he became threatening so i had no choice i just had to stay with him i knew something was going to happen and i began to worry about what it might be it was only when he stepped out that i was certain and knew what i had to do about the same time that you realised as well im sorry i shot you but you would have been no match for him he would have murdered the tsar even with you hanging on to him i couldnt take the risk i quite understand i said gallantly and what is a little bullet wound in comparison to a european war and i owe my freedom to you as well mr cort told me what you had said yes i replied thats the bit thats puzzling me why i am normally a truthful person i said evenly ive only started telling lies since i met you she frowned in slight dismay and confusion just a little enough to make the bridge of her nose wrinkle attractively before she smiled again i was looking at you when you shot me you see the expression in your eyes i really dont think you were trying to miss me of course i was she said a little petulantly i was petrified thats all you read far too much into my eyes they are the most beautiful eyes i have ever seen i have tried often to get you to look at me just to have that feeling of excitement that it causes in my stomach when i close mine i can see them i dream of them i know them well but why would i want to shoot you i mean really shoot you you know how often do you take the waters at badenbaden she looked momentarily confused then replied every year i go in the autumn i have done for many years now why do you ask that and mr xanthos he is an enthusiastic watertaker as well no she said im sure he is not but you were both there last autumn yes strange that an arms salesman should go to a place like that unless he was visiting someone like you she raised an eyebrow her face so very expressive it was was turning cold and when you were both there you came to the attention of madame boninska otherwise known as the witchwoman a nasty bit of work who made a tidy living out of blackmail she knew a gold mine when she saw one she followed you back to england and decided to try a little blackmail how long did you pay up before you refused matthew you are talking such nonsense have these nurses been putting something into your tea morphine maybe i said with a quite nasty tone drink some you know more about that sort of thing than i do that stopped her attempt at good humour so i continued she wrote to your husband who went to see her there she gave him the details that his beloved wife was having an affair with another man his own employee was betraying him not only planning to take his company away from him but to take his wife as well lord ravenscliff was not a man to go down without a fight he had already amended his will so that everything would fall into the hands of an administrator should he die i am fairly certain that if he had had his meeting with xanthos the next day xanthos would have been dismissed and then he would have thrown you out as well i have heard enough to know that he was thorough and ruthless when he acted he moved fast and decisively and he hated disloyalty above all but you were his equal so xanthos told me and he was right you moved fast one swift move and he was out the window did you put your arms around him and tell him how much you loved him before you gave him a little push or was it some melodrama opening the window and threatening to throw yourself out until he came to stop you and made the mistake of turning his back on you before that you had offered what a loving gesture to find out what xanthos was up to persuaded your husband he could trust no one else that put you in the perfect position to relay xanthoss instructions to jan the builder you werent doing this nonsense to find out what he was planning the tsar would be murdered war would break out and ravenscliff would get the blame but quietly no publicity xanthos would take over his companies then you and he would marry she hit me so hard that i was dizzy with the pain and my nose began to bleed profusely and when i say hit i dont mean some dainty slap about the face such as an irate female might deliver i mean punched with her fist and having hit me she hit me again even harder then stood over me eyes blazing with cold fury teeth clenched she stood over me breathing hard i really thought i was about to die instead she marched to the door pulled it open and turned round how dare you talk to me like that she spat who do you think you are i couldnt talk i gasped through the bedsheet which i was having to use as an impromptu bandage the pain was so great it even overwhelmed the pain of my wound it occurred to me that saying what i had all alone in a room with her had not been the cleverest thing to do being punched on the nose was getting off quite lightly really others had not been so lucky you have come to your conclusions i will not argue against them i told you i loved my husband you disregard all of that and now you are going to run to henry cort i shook my head why not why not that is what a good englishman should do isnt it i shook my head again why not because youre all as bad as each other i dont want anything to do with any of you ive had enough i halfexpected a cold sneering contempt icy disdain it wasnt there she gave me one last look one of those dark hypnotic glances she did so well and i almost failed to notice the way she turned away swiftly so i could not see her face almost as if to hide tears she was always a good actor i never saw elizabeth again in any of her guises she left cowes that day i was told and soon enough closed down her house in st jamess square and crossed to the continent where she lived for the rest of her life ravenscliffs will was settled and as he had calculated by the time his ships were nearing completion the government was persuaded that they were needed he had been right all along the battleships were in place in august and joined the grand fleet at scapa flow guarding the north sea against the german threat across the water i am sure i was not alone in thinking that the cause of the war had a certain familiar style to it if so then no responsibility for events in sarajevo attached to theodore xanthos ravenscliffs companies prospered during the war but did so without the salesmans assistance as he met a tragic end falling under the wheels of an underground train at oxford circus late one friday evening a month or so after i got back from cowes it was as his only obituary mentioned singularly unfortunate as it was probably the only time xanthos had ever even been in an underground station the other managers continued in their jobs so i assumed they had been given a clean bill of health when i was well enough my landlady loved my invalid status and fed me little but beef tea and seed cake for a month i decided to go travelling at long last the bank in sloane square wrote me an almost reverential letter to say that the sum of had been deposited in my account and that they would be pleased in fact they were positively salivating to hear my instructions they also cashed the cheque from mr xanthos i felt i had earned every penny so i kept it all i travelled the world for a few years visiting the marvels of the empire i had read about but never dreamed i would see with my own eyes i wrote a book of travel memoirs which was politely enough received and was turned down for military service in on the grounds of my injury i was briefly hurt to my patriotic heart by this but as the news of the war rolled in i was hard put to suppress the feeling that being shot by lady ravenscliff was in fact the luckiest thing that had ever happened to me then i went back to work as a journalist covering campaigns in africa and later in the near east later after my marriage and the birth of my first son and as i had a pleasantenough voice i became a pioneer of radio news a job which brought me a small measure of fame and which was the reason i was accosted at her funeral nearly half a century later thus my story even then at the moment i last cast eyes on that captivating woman i knew i had only grasped part of what had transpired i did not feel inclined to revisit the matter though people like cort and the ravenscliffs had taken up enough of my energies and nearly killed me although i was not so foolish as to forget that the encounter had transformed my life and for the better i was a free man afterwards my horizons lifted my ambitions transformed but the more i travelled the more able i was to forget about them all and i succeeded for very many years until i was accosted at a funeral and a large package meticulously wrapped in brown paper with the address of henderson lansbury fenton the strand was delivered to my door part two woodside cottage wick rissington gloucestershire june dear braddock you may be surprised to get this package if you ever do i apologise for the melodrama however having been the custodian of these documents for many years i now have to consider what to do with them my doctors inform me that this is now a matter of some urgency i considered that a bonfire might be best but could not bring myself to such an act of immolation thus i pass on the responsibility to you i am dying whereas our mutual acquaintance is i understand in rude health and has found happiness in her latter years i do not wish to disturb that and not merely because i continue to act faithfully on the instructions of john stone accordingly i have instructed my solicitor mr henderson whom you may recall not to pass this on to you until she also has died i leave it to him to determine what course to take should she outlive you as well as she may well do she is as you recall a tough woman there are two bundles one is an account of my early life you would be astonished if you knew how many spies are authors manqué in which she figures somewhat i wrote it in when i returned to england after living abroad and i could never bring myself to amend it in the light of later information the other contains those papers by john stone which you so earnestly sought when you were in his wifes employ i apologise for not having enlightened you about them but i hope you will fully understand my reasoning when you have read them mine will shed light on a woman i consider to have been the most remarkable i have ever known i hope your reading will at least go some way to modifying your opinion of her which i was sorry to learn was ultimately quite unfavourable i fully accept that your opinion of me will be even less so if you read this i do not pretend it shows me in anything other than an unpleasant light your account of the events you took part in was impeccable except that you failed to understand how intense was the love between john stone and his wife this one element however changes everything i fear that your prejudices then may have prevented you from taking it sufficiently seriously i have followed your career with great interest in recent years and taken much pleasure in hearing your reports on the radio only the belief that you would not have been overjoyed to hear from me has prevented me from renewing our brief acquaintance yours very sincerely henry cort paris chapter my father is the gentlest of men but has always been subject to periodic outbursts of insanity which render him incapable of work he did not come from a rich family and was brought up by his aunt and uncle but inherited somewhere along the line enough money to ensure a modest life he trained as an architect the idea being that he would inherit my greatuncles business but illness prevented consistent application to any project instead he lived quietly in dorset where he would occasionally build an extension to a house or oversee the rebuilding of a church roof for much of the time he would read or work in the garden as i was used to his long silences and sudden refusals to answer questions i did not think anything of behaviour which others considered decidedly queer my mother died when i was very young and apart from that i never knew much about her only that she was beautiful that my father had loved her i think her death broke his heart certainly it was about the same time that he became ill he recovered somewhat but my young life was periodically interrupted by sudden disappearances which i was told were due to father being called away for a project only later did i learn that he spent these periods in a special hospital where he was slowly coaxed back to health i left home at eight to go to school and never really returned my best friend he was as miserable as i was invited me to his home for the holidays which was where i realised how difficult in contrast was my own family life he had a father who was cheerful and playful and a mother who became the first love of my life warm graceful and utterly devoted to her family they lived in a big house in holland park during the winter months and in a lovely adam house in the borders in the summer they became my family for mrs campbell all but kidnapped me telling my father she was quite happy to have me indefinitely he thought it was for the best and surrendered me he was a good man but the responsibilities of parenthood were too much for his frail constitution i visited him every summer but each time he was more vague and eventually i think he stopped recognising me altogether certainly he stopped caring whether i came or no money is not something which concerns the young that my fathers hospital bills were paid that my school fees were settled did not excite any curiosity in my juvenile mind it did not occur to me to wonder how this was happening i assumed that the campbells had taken on this responsibility as well i loved them all the more for it and i do believe no boy was ever more devoted to his real parents than i was to these delightful people nonetheless i repaid them poorly and was constantly in trouble i was illdisciplined forever fighting indulging in escapades which were often dangerous and frequently illegal i would break into the headmasters study at night simply for the pleasure of escaping undetected would leave the boys dormitory to go wandering illegally through the local town would destroy the clothes and possessions of older boys who had bullied my friends my school work ranged from indifferent to poor and although considered intelligent it was clear i lacked the application ever to be a serious student a boy of small years must necessarily be a poor criminal the ability to judge chances is insufficiently developed i was finally run to ground in a housemasters lodging not my own housemaster who was a decent enough man but another who was universally disliked apparently looting his small store of wine in fact i was not as i have never been a drinker rather i was busy trying to spike the bottles with vinegar using a syringe of my own devising that could i believed introduce the contaminant without having to remove the cork this was to be his punishment for the merciless beating which he had inflicted on a boy in my house a somewhat diffident frightened lad who naturally attracted the bullies to him like flies around a horses head i could not protect him and felt more the injustice of the master than the suffering of the boy but i did what i could to ensure that his misery did not go without some reply i should have been expelled certainly the offence more than merited it especially as there was some suspicion that the discovery also solved the mystery of who had locked the chapel doors and concealed the key so that the salvation of three hundred pupils was at risk until it was found four days later punctured all the rugger balls the night before a tournament with five other schools and committed a series of other offences against the corporate wellbeing i admitted nothing but since when did headmasters follow strictly the dictates of legal procedure but i was let off lightly a thorough thrashing detention for a term and nothing more a few bruises and cuts to add to the burn mark i had on my arm received as a baby when i rashly put my hand into a fire that was all i did not understand it and as the campbells never referred to the matter nor did i someone though was looking after me william campbells sudden death when i was sixteen was as great a shock as i had ever endured and the atmosphere of despair and gloom in the house affected everyone we that is i and my adopted brother freddie were kept completely in the dark it was our comrades at school as kind as young boys are who told us that he had blown his brains out because he could not face the disgrace of ruin with great consideration they provided the details when we did not believe them and it was true mr campbell was caught up in the dunbury scandal and his fortune was destroyed that however was not the worst of it it was whispered that he had been part of a fraud to deprive other investors of massive amounts the precise circumstances were never very clear to me the matter was hushed up he and others involved had been in the governing party at the time and in any case i was not really old enough to understand young men of my type are prone to be impatient of details and give their loyalties without regard to evidence i remembered him as the kindest man in the world nothing else was of any importance to me it was clear that my schooldays were coming to an end though mrs campbell assured me that the funds were there to continue to pay the fees but i felt i could no longer impose myself on their goodness i must begin to make my own way in the world and so i began to consider how that way might be made i was not denied assistance it is one of the curiosities of the english that they are often excessively judgemental in the abstract yet match that with private kindness the name of campbell was hardly mentioned any more amongst his friends and old political comrades it was as though he had never existed yet for those whose lives he had ruined there was constant sympathy and discreet help mrs campbell herself refused to take any assistance she remained as devoted to her husbands memory as she had been loving while he lived she refused any offer of help that came from the opinion she was also one of her husbands victims and took her fall with pride and defiance she moved out of the grand house into more modest accommodation in bayswater where she maintained a household which ran with only two rather than twenty servants and eked out a dignified if straitened existence for the rest of her days i believe she had at least one offer of marriage but refused as she did not wish to abandon the name her husband had given her it would she said be the last betrayal i insisted that come what may freddie should finish school and go to university he was immensely talented and more importantly devoted to learning my arguments prevailed he gave up all fine notions of working to support the family and eventually proceeded to balliol to read greats and become ultimately a fellow of trinity living out his life in studious contentment rarely straying from the narrow acreage bounded by the high street in the south and crick road in the north eventually his mother came to live with him and died last year cutting an everstranger figure pottering around the streets dressed in the widows weeds of twenty years ago for my part i gave up the prospect of a similar trajectory with only nominal reluctance i was not as clever as freddie nor as disciplined even though my love of reading was as great as his and my gift for language greater but part of me had always hankered after something more although i had never been able to decide what that was i spent a few months in an architects office but found it uncongenial although drawing delighted me then as it still does i next moved to work in one of the great finance houses in the city but discovered that while the strategy of high finance had its interest the daily grind of counting money drove me to distraction i might have made a splendid baring but as one of that familys clerks i was sorely tried still i did this for several years and gained greatly by the experience i spent a whole year in paris much time in berlin and even on one occasion was sent for two months to new york at no stage did it occur to me that i was receiving remarkable treatment for a young man with no connections unproven ability and minimal experience i realised that most people of my sort spent their time six days a week in a dreary office from eight in the morning until seven at night but i assumed it was merely good fortune on my part that i was not one of them i was picked for one job and acquitted myself well and so was chosen for another and so on the idea that any other factor was involved did not come into my thoughts in july though i received a letter from a mr henry wilkinson this was shortly after my twentyfourth birthday a grand man indeed deputy undersecretary at the foreign office a post he had occupied for some twenty years he was not much known outside the minuscule world of diplomacy and the name meant nothing to me but i knew that the invitation to lunch could not be ignored and when i requested permission from my chief to absent myself it was given very speedily no one seemed curious about what it was all about which was not really surprising as they knew perfectly well already i went the following wednesday to the athenaeum and met the man who was to be in effect my employer until he died still in harness six months ago many people have the idea that civil servants are sleek wellgroomed and wellbred people suave in manner and given to murmuring incisively instead of indulging in ordinary speech like the majority of the population such people exist but the diplomatic service in those days still found a place for the eccentric the unusual and in at least two cases i have met the certifiably insane henry wilkinson did not look like a senior civil servant he was dressed in a tweed jacket for a start which violated all codes of conduct for his class his employment and his club which would have denied entry to most members who dared commit such sacrilege he was much given to grunting and loud exclamations his emotions far from being closely controlled and disciplined overflowed all over the room and his conversation was filled with loud laughs groans chuckles and sighs he fidgeted incessantly so much so that i came to dread sharing a meal with him because his hands were always picking up the salt cellar and banging it on the table or twiddling his fork around while he was listening or he would cross his legs uncross them and cross them again leaning back and forward in his chair as he spoke he never sat still never relaxed even when apparently enjoying himself he also ate virtually nothing a meal consisted of chasing a piece of meat around the plate for a few minutes before he consented with the greatest reluctance to push a sliver of carrot or a fragment of potato into his mouth then a few moments later he would thrust the plate aside as if to say thank heavens thats over he was a wiry man with a thin foxy face redeemed only by a most charming smile he also had the annoying habit of almost never looking directly at you this he kept for special occasions and when he did his eyes bored straight through you as though he could count the dots on the wallpaper through your head every now and then during our lunch some grandee would bow discreetly at him but he waved them all aside without even looking at them it was not so much a lunch more of a viva voce examination i was discouraged from asking any questions and when i did they were ignored what was my opinion of britains place in the world who were our greatest enemies who our rivals what were their advantages and weaknesses how best to exploit their divisions how did the health of our great industries relate to the longevity of the empire what proper relationship with the continent should britain pursue did i think we should continue to bolster the ottoman empire or connive at its downfall my opinion on the continued convertibility of paper specie into gold the double metal question the effectiveness of the bank of england in the late crisis in the american markets the use of financial power as a proper instrument of diplomacy most of these questions i was sure i answered badly i was no diplomat reading secret briefing papers from ambassadors around the globe most of what i knew was to be found in the times every morning perhaps i was a little better informed on financial matters but as i had been pummelled by questions for a long time without making any apparent impression on him i was beginning to be discouraged which no doubt made my answers less satisfactory you are asked by your government to commit a crime mr cort do you do it or not what factors determine your answer this question came out of the blue after a response on my part to a question about whether i considered dividends of north american railway stock to be sustainable an easy one that of course they werent and it took me so completely by surprise i hardly knew what to answer it would depend on my position in relation to the government i said after a while a soldier invading a foreign country i suppose commits a crime but is not held personally accountable an individual with no official status might be in a less comfortable position assume you are a private individual then it depends on who is asking this of me i assume it is a crime for the good of the country i would have to have a very profound trust in the judgement of the person making the request why do you ask such a question this was my second attempt by that stage to discover the purpose of the meeting it was brushed aside as the first had been your duty to your country is a matter of personal relations he asked arching his eyebrows in something i took to be scorn i was becoming a little annoyed by this stage having endured these incessant questions for more than an hour so that my plate lay almost as untouched as his i thought i had been remarkably patient yes i snapped back we are not talking about the country we are talking about its representatives only some of whom have the authority or stature to decide what is in the national good also i speak as one of her majestys subjects who has a right to have an opinion on such matters besides i was not aware that our government committed crimes i glared he now smiled sweetly back as though i had just said how pretty his little daughter was i met his family once some years later his daughter slightly older than i was the most terrifying female i ever encountered the brains of the father multiplied by the remarkable force of character of the mother she was not however particularly pretty goodness gracious me he said i dont believe you just said that of course it does not unless they can be avoided of course let me give you an example suppose we learn that france our great civilised but entirely annoying neighbour has advanced plans for an invasion of this country suppose we know how to obtain these plans should we do so of course that is a matter of war no he replied wagging a finger in correction no war has been declared we would be committing an outright theft from a nation which has done us no harm and whose government is currently almost cordial towards us despite popular opinion which cordiality may turn out to be a mere deception it is obviously legitimate to discover if someone wishes you harm naturally it would be permissible to steal this information and if someone tries to prevent this theft a guard or soldier even a member of the public what measures could be taken against them any that were required including killing them i very much hope that could be avoided but if that was the only way of gaining information that might save thousands of lives then yes i see let us reverse the question then suppose a frenchman comes to this country to steal our plans for invading france what measures could be taken against him should his whereabouts and intentions become known we plan to invade france i asked astonished again he found my response amusing we should he said with a chuckle it is the armys job to prepare for all such possibilities however i very much doubt such a plan exists our generals have a long tradition of being woefully unprepared and in any case they seem to find shooting people armed only with spears quite difficult enough nonetheless such plans should exist as it is obvious that sooner or later there will be another war in europe and we do not know if we will be able to stand by and watch no matter assume if you can that the generals are better prepared and more farseeing than they are how to react to the presence of this frenchman on our soil stop him how by whatever means necessary but he is only trying to do that which you have already declared legitimate i act to save the lives of my countrymen and would do so again in this case lives of englishmen are more valuable than lives of frenchmen not in the eyes of god perhaps but i have no responsibility for the wellbeing of the french while i am bound to the inhabitants of my country so that is two murders you have committed quite a bloodthirsty fellow are you not mr cort i am nothing of the sort i said i specialise in the syndication of international loans so you do so you do and you travel widely in pursuit of your business france germany even italy i gather you are competent at the languages of those countries as well yes he smiled id like you to do me a little favour he said changing the subject abruptly when you are in paris next week id be most grateful if you could pick up a package for me and bring it back would you oblige me in that matter plans to invade england i asked oh goodness me no we have those already theyre really quite good no this is something quite different this is of no great secrecy or importance routine correspondence that is all i merely want to ensure it gets here swiftly i planned to get someone else to do it but alas he had a small accident and cannot assist me id be happy to assist i said except that im not going to paris next week i believe my employers have no plans at all to send me anywhere at present he smiled sweetly so kind of you to come and meet me today he said i have greatly enjoyed our little conversation i hardly knew what to make of this strange encounter and was eager to discuss it with my chief mr hector samson of syndication he however although normally very strict about timekeeping never referred to my absence for so many hours and when i raised the matter changed the topic so swiftly i realised he did not even want to know the only indication i had that my employers were aware of the meeting was a letter dropped on my desk late that afternoon i was to go to paris the following monday to supervise the final details of the flotation of a loan for an american railway company they of the unsustainable dividends although naturally such misgivings were not to be communicated to the other participants that was their problem all barings had to do was get rid of the stock as swiftly as possible anyway it was a small matter already settled the centre of which was to be in london with only a small participation from one paris bank barings own correspondents in france could and regularly did supervise such matters and barings were notoriously tightfisted about extravagances like sending people on journeys even i could reason out what had happened i filled up much of my time on my recent voyage from calcutta reading some of those stories of espionage which are so popular these days which amused me greatly i sometimes wonder if those few people who suspect my activities believe that i live a life of equal excitement i am glad to say i do not all this running around over deserts and feats of daring against sinister foreigners and secret societies makes splendid entertainment but i do not know anyone of sense who conducts business in such a way all governments naturally can call on people who are more proficient with muscle than with brain in certain circumstances thats what armies are for the task of discovering a rivals intentions and capabilities is by and large conducted in a more civilised fashion in general it is as dangerous and exciting as a busy day on the baltic exchange except that is for my first venture into the business which very nearly resulted in my deciding to have nothing to do with henry wilkinson hang the empire was my opinion if it depends on this sort of thing it happened like this i took the train to dover as my employers directed crossed the channel by steamer to calais and arrived at the gare du nord at seven in the evening i then went to my hotel in the rue notredame des victoires not a grand hotel by any means the baring family was far too cautious with its money to allow luxury it was why many people hankered after a job with the rothschilds who had a finer appreciation of their employees comforts but it had running water was clean and was only a short distance from the bourse i have stayed in much worse my business such as it was could be dealt with in half an hour the following morning and so i had the evening to myself or to attend to the note that was pushed under my door ten minutes after i arrived it contained an address and a time nothing more rue poulletier nine oclock now the hero of a spy story would have managed to discover the whereabouts of this address and get there with such ease it might not even be mentioned i on the other hand took some fortyfive minutes to acquire a map which even gave the location shops never close in adventure stories alas they shut promptly at seventhirty in reality and then another hour to get there perhaps there was a tram which might have taken me but i never discovered it it was raining a fine persistent and depressing drizzle and all the carriages were occupied i had no umbrella so had to walk my hat getting sodden my coat turning into blotting paper into an area of paris i had never even visited in daylight before this was the ile saintlouis an infested ratridden tangle of criminality and sedition lying at the very heart of the city it had once been fashionable and welltodo but those days had long since passed every building was crumbling and neglected there was no street lighting and i guessed not much progress had been made in installing modern sewage and it was deathly quiet the police of paris never venture onto the island between sundown and sunrise it becomes an independent country in the dark answerable to no authority and anyone who goes there must take full personal responsibility for his fate most of the revolutionaries many of the anarchists and criminals who grace the pages of the popular press with their activities give their address as the ile saintlouis they inhabit great houses which once echoed to the laughter of the aristocracy and now are cut up into dozens of squalid little rooms for rent by the month the day or the hour it is a den of cutthroats and fugitives perfect for people who need or wish to disappear the address i was seeking lay right at its heart past the raddled women standing in the alleyways past the men with narrow faces and suspicious eyes who watch as you walk by past the long shadows and sudden noises of something moving behind you past the soft laughter that you hear faintly down side alleys it was terrifying i have never in my life been so petrified and if this disappoints then i am sorry to disabuse you still further of any notions of heroism i did not join a banking house to get my head kicked in down some malodorous parisian alleyway i was cursing myself and that wretched civil servant for bringing about my presence there i could have turned on my heel and walked out the banks of the seine were scarcely a hundred yards away and there at least was some gas lighting the bridge to the iledelacité was another few minutes walk even less if you ran in total panic not caring for your dignity i did not take this course instead i stopped at every flicker of light coming from an open window and consulted my map wiping the rain from my eyes and slowly made my way forward getting ever close to my destination keeping all thoughts of what on earth i might find there at the back of my mind i have always had a stubborn streak in me it can be a disadvantage sometimes i could not decide whether i was being manfully determined or childishly stupid i continued until i reached the door on the left that the curt instructions had mentioned i gently pushed it with my hand it was not locked it was hardly on hinges at all and was kept in place mainly by its own weight as it dragged on the floor and leaned against the door posts knocking seemed a little absurd in the circumstances so i put my shoulder to it and levered it up and forwards until a gap large enough for me to slip through opened up the passage inside it was completely dark and the musty smell of neglect and damp hung about it i waited to see if my eyes could make something out but the blackness was so total that this accomplished little unlike the wellequipped agent of novels i had no matches there was no sound except for the patter of rain outside and the chuckle of the water as it ran down the street the thing i was most aware of was my feet which were soaking wet and icy cold as standing feeling frightened and cold accomplished nothing i gingerly made my way forward arms out like a blind man and bumped first into a wall this way then into another that way then i caught something brushing against my sleeve as i turned and realised i had touched a banister there was a staircase carefully i put my foot on the first step thinking to go up quietly that was useless the wood gave a crack like a gun going off as my full weight came upon it so i abandoned all notion of discretion and concentrated simply on not falling feeling my way up step by step until i came to a landing there the stairs ended and there on the left i felt a door assuming i was in the right street and the right building about which i had no confidence whatsoever i must have arrived at my destination i listened carefully but could hear nothing i knocked softly at first then in frustration and annoyance hammered on the door as loudly as i could i heard a low groan after my first knock and the sound of someone falling out of bed after my second then a muttering next a sound like someone being sick then urinating in a metal pot the door opened just a crack at first then more widely an oil lamp was held up its glare preventing me from seeing who was holding it come in then i heard a gruff voice speaking in a mumbling french i could barely understand so in i went i had never been in a room so filthy or so rank before and my first instinct was to turn tail and flee the occupant saw this reaction on my face but instead of being offended found it as funny as one can find anything when one is nursing a violent hangover he was at least dressed after a fashion though not shaved and i guessed he had not shaved for days for the grey stubble on his chin he was a man past fifty shone in the rays of thin light that came from the smoking lamp he put down on a rickety table he was short broad and powerfully built stooped over but with lively eyes that never rested long in one place a deeply lined face with a thin scar down his left cheek which was otherwise blotchy from drink and hard living but despite his surroundings and his gross inelegance he had a purposeful air almost one of confidence all this was communicated in a few seconds and i cannot say that i realised any of this until much later at that particular moment the smell and the dirt was all i noticed ive come from mr wilkinson for a package i said youre the new boy are you he said with the heavy sigh of the deeply disappointed he had switched to english after he had examined me carefully with those eyes i noticed that there was the faintest foreign accent to his voice not french certainly but his original language was so covered over by time and lack of use it was difficult to ascertain what it might have been do you have something for me no no piece of paper no other letter no why because how am i meant to believe you really do come from mr wilkinson you may be working for the french government which would not be good for you at all he said it in a quiet fashion which was deeply threatening i can offer you no proof whatsoever i replied and i am not sure i would even were i able to do so whats your name cort i replied henry cort a curious name not very english dutch flemish i bridled a little at that i can assure you i am thoroughly english i said stiffly my fathers family arrived in england from the low countries to escape persecution but that was nearly two hundred years ago and your father is alive yes although he suffers from persistent ill health my mother is dead i sensed a faint quickening of his interest at this although there seemed to be nothing behind it and your fathers occupation he is an architect when his health permits most of the time he is too frail to work i see and you were born in eighteen sixtythree he leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he considered this piece of information then he leant forward grabbed my left arm and pulled up the sleeve of my jacket snorted then banged his knees with his hands and looked up my apologies for the interrogation although not for the doubts unless you become as suspicious as i am you will not live long in this game i do not intend to play any game i replied nor do i see how what i have just said can convince you of my honesty he almost smiled at this remark you must allow me to preserve my secrets but mr wilkinson knows what he is doing he sent no proof of your identity because your very existence is its own proof he stood up dont look so puzzled its of no significance have you done this before i didnt understand a word he was talking about all i knew was that even the dangers of walking alone across the ile saintlouis would be preferable to staying in that dingy room a moment longer i understand i am meant to collect a letter of some sort if that is the case please give it to me and i will be on my way he snorted as though i had just said the most imbecilic thing in the world then reached under the mattress of his bed as he did so i noticed a pistol jutting out from under the dirty grey pillow there you are he said take it and go deliver it to mr wilkinson as swiftly as possible do not stop do not let it out of your possession for a second he handed it over and i looked at it but its not for him i protested it is addressed to a mr robbins i know of no such man he stared at the ceiling as though invoking the lord to come and smite him yes he said heavily how curious however fortunately your job is not to think but to move those little legs of yours in the right direction until you have accomplished your task if i say it is to be handed to mr wilkinson then to mr wilkinson it must go understand now go away he turned and lay down on the bed with a heavy sigh the interview was at an end i glared at him with all the hauteur i could muster turned and left my dignity was as offended by the encounter as was my sense of smell i marched down the stairs thankful only to be heading for the open air once more my mind full of all the cutting remarks i might have made to put the appalling man in his place and remind him that he was dealing with a gentleman not some servant which i tried unsuccessfully to persuade myself was his own station in life i walked towards the river and safety going more swiftly than usual because the sooner i was off that stinking island the happier i would be my annoyance pushed all thought of danger out of my head as i walked and my mood lightened with every step i took apart from a heavy blow on the head and the sensation of falling forward onto the pavement stone of some sort i noted with weeds growing up between the cracks one with a bedraggled purple flower on it that was the last thing i recalled for some time it didnt even hurt to begin with chapter when i woke up again i felt as though my head was splitting stars danced in my eyes and i could feel the blood pounding through my temples i looked around as much as i dared considering there seemed to be a real possibility that my head might come off entirely mainly i saw the ceiling from which i deduced that i was no longer in the street but had been picked up by someone and brought into a house what was i doing there what had i been doing i groaned tried to sit up then collapsed back again it was the smell that made me realise where i must be then i remembered the letter my hand rushed to my pocket and felt for the reassuring crinkle of paper nothing i tried another pocket then another then just to make sure went back and tried the first once more nothing it had gone oh my god i said as the realisation hit me oh no looking for this i was lying on his bed which smelled of dog and unwashed man i turned my head and saw the man i had met earlier sitting calmly in a chair with the letter he had given me on his lap the relief i felt was indescribable thank you sir i said with genuine emotion you rescued me from those scoundrels who attacked me did you see them who hit me i did he said still calm as ever what he made no effort to help me out why did you hit me to steal this letter but youd only just given it to me well noted he said to be attacked in such a manner was bad enough to be made fun of as well was wellnigh intolerable and i decided that it was time to give this man a lesson he would not readily forget i had spent much time at school in boxing and felt that i could readily overcome the resistance of a man well past his prime so i began to rise but found that my legs were unwilling to support me i waved my fists in his direction and even as he pushed me lazily back on to the bed with a contemptuous look on his face i realised how utterly ridiculous i must appear i slumped back down my head spinning and groaned loudly head between your knees until you stop feeling sick i didnt break the skin youre not bleeding then he waited patiently until i was once more able to lift my head up and look at him right he said i hit you on the head because i do not wish to die through association with an idiot your behaviour was not only juvenile but also dangerous do you have no sense at all you were utterly unaware i was behind you even though i went out of my way to give you as much warning as possible have you learned nothing remembered nothing did you ever even once look round to check who was behind you no you strolled down a dark alley hands in your pockets like some idiot tourist i did hit you harder than was necessary i am sure i apologise for that but i was so outraged i felt like hitting you even harder and you should thank me for my restraint if my head was spinning from the blow he had inflicted on me it was spinning even faster now as i tried to understand what on earth he was talking about i was asked to come to your lodging sir i said stiffly and collect a letter that was all nobody mentioned anything about playing hide and seek through the streets with a murderous lunatic he paused then looked at me more soberly you arent oh my god who are you what are you i told him that i was a banker working for barings he snorted then laughed out loud in that case i owe you an apology he said with the air of a man who didnt really think that he owed me anything of the sort you must think me a very strange fellow i think i could manage a better description of you than that i said come with me he helped me off the bed steadied me as i almost fell over again then guided me to the door and down the stairs he took me to some sort of bar it was nearly ten oclock he led me over to a table in a dark corner got me to sit then called for brandy i was not used at that stage to drinking brandy but he insisted and after a very short while i found that my head stopped hurting and my speech became voluble so he began once more i apologise and owe you an explanation i was under the impression that you knew what you were about what mr wilkinson is thinking of sending me someone so unprepared is quite beyond me he knows how i his trail of thought came to an end as he drank his brandy down in one go and called for another the place we were in was the sort of establishment i would never dream of entering or would not have done then i imagined that every single person in it all were men was some sort of cutthroat pimp or robber i later learned that this assessment was entirely correct he grunted my name is jules lefevre in fact that is not my name but no matter it will do i provide certain information to his majestys government which it otherwise might find difficult to obtain you are french i asked perhaps now it is important that the information i provide reaches its destination it is also important that it does not fall into the wrong hands it being of a confidential nature do you understand i believe so i said in which case it is important that those people carrying these letters know how to keep them you agree that this is important absolutely i said good so that is what wilkinson has asked me to do with you teach you to look after yourself are you sure he said he was sending someone to me to finish his training and he would identify himself by coming to ask for a package that seems like you i know but no one has ever mentioned anything of this to me i feel i should have been consulted i could tell i was sounding more petulant with every word i uttered and decided to keep quiet you could say that my future was decided solely by a desire not to appear silly to a man i scarcely knew well you werent i suppose there was a good reason now what i did to you just now could have been done by anyone and your lack of attention could have had severe consequences the only good thing to come out of it would be that you would be dead and unable to mess anything else up my head was still spinning and still hurt foully even though the brandy had steadied it a little in compensation my empty stomach was also beginning to add its protest at being subjected to the brandy lefevre was eyeing me curiously you dont know what this is all about no his eyes narrowed as he considered the meaning of it then he shook his head no point trying to fathom the ways of the great and the good thats his decision and i suppose i must live with it it seems you are to be my apprentice so we might as well get started be at the gare de lest tomorrow morning at eight i will meet you in the buffet you will not recognise me or greet me in any way but when i move you follow me do you understand i understand but im not sure i agree i replied what do you mean your apprentice and whats this about getting started started on what learning how to stay alive of course i was managing quite well until i met you and what if i dont want to be your apprentice then you dont come you go back to your life in the bank and fill in ledgers for the rest of your life or whatever you do i dont care one way or the other wilkinson seems to have chosen you take it up with him but dont ask any more explanation of me because i cant give it he stood up make up your mind by tomorrow morning come or dont come just a minute i said a little tartly he looked back at me what about this wretched letter i pointed to the envelope on the table that had given me so much grief you can hardly criticise me for carelessness if you are so forgetful yourself he looked then shrugged its only an old newspaper he said its not important you dont think anyones going to trust you with something important do you and he walked out leaving me behind in that den of iniquity which now his protection was withdrawn suddenly began to seem very frightening as discreetly as possible which was not at all i left as well feeling dozens of eyes on me as i headed for the door and the hushing of the chatter as conversations paused so people could look at me i felt a hot flush spreading up the back of my neck and it was all i could do to avoid bolting out of that place as fast as my legs would carry me pride can be a useful thing i believe i completely hid my discomfort and my mounting fear although the experience of the evening made me feel violently sick and my legs were still wobbling from the assault the night air touched with sweet smell of sewage though it was refreshed me considerably and once i had leaned against a wall a while i began to feel much improved it was almost midnight now and eerily quiet for the centre of a major city i was some way from my hotel and with no alternative but to walk there my head ached i was starving from lack of food and felt thoroughly wretched i was also afraid that awful man would attack me once again so could not even concentrate on my sense of having been ill used as i made my way to the bridge to cross over back into civilisation chapter it goes without saying that i got no sleep that night even when i did manage to get back to my hotel it was already two by then and i realised i would have to be up again early if i was to make my appointment for eight oclock it still had not occurred to me to miss it my anxiety concentrated entirely on not being late on not making myself out to be a fool once more the turmoil of the evening and the fear of oversleeping did not drive away my weariness merely the possibility of doing anything about it and at six oclock i found myself tiptoeing down the stairs once more and out into what would eventually be the dawn of a new day i took an omnibus to my destination a sign on the front said it was going to the gare de lest and i believed it so at least i managed a short slumber in the twentyfive minutes it took to get there this happy chance however meant that i arrived an hour early and there was nothing to do except tramp the streets to try and keep warm and sit next to the brazier in the empty waiting room as i grew more and more aware of how empty my stomach was i was cold hungry bored and perplexed all at the same time and still i did not query what i was doing not once did i shake myself awake and consider heading straight for the bank and a normal days work i did not follow instructions completely though rather than waiting in the railway buffet i positioned myself in a discreet place outside as i somehow felt it would be subservient to be there first i wished lefevre to arrive and worry that i was not going to come that he had failed to sway me then i would go in and greet him alas he did not turn up either slowly more people were filling the station from trains arriving and for others leaving i watched every single person who went into the buffet and as there was only one entrance there was no chance of missing anyone i was feeling ill for the first time the full absurdity of the situation swept over me i was working in a bank for heavens sake what on earth was i doing here i would have some coffee and some bread then resume a normal life enough of this nonsense it was going to be hard enough already to explain myself i stood at the counter waiting next to a gentleman similarly consuming a rapid cup of coffee we ignored each other as total strangers do until he had finished and paid come along then he said abruptly or well miss the train do you have any luggage i turned to stare at him a welldressed man wearing an expensive cravat and shiny top hat immaculately brushed shoes and a heavy grey overcoat he bowed his head slightly in greeting as i looked handsome clean shaven about fifty years of age but with an air of strength about him and a thin scar on his cheek despite his years no one would ever consider him to be old a faint air of eaudecologne hung around him as it does those who spend time and money on their appearance do you mean to say you didnt recognise me it was lefevre now as elegant as he was scruffy before as well manicured as he had been unshaven as bourgeois as he had been plebeian only the eyes pale and questing and the scar seemed to remain from the person i had encountered the previous evening i shook my head oh my lord he said quietly this is going to be hard work and without any further comment he turned and walked out onto the station forecourt i followed as i supposed i was meant to getting angrier by the minute i walked up behind him and grabbed him by the arm he shook it off and murmured not here you idiot and continued walking onto platform three where a train stood hissing away twirling his cane in a nonchalant fashion he walked up to the firstclass carriages and got in i followed him into an empty compartment and waited while he went out to discuss his baggage with a porter then he came back in shut the door pulled down the blinds and sat opposite me dont be so angry he said reverting to english you look as though you are about to explode for two pins i would get straight off this train and go to work i said you are behaving in a most uncivil fashion and and i knew how childish i sounded even before i had got a few words out so have a good cry lefevre said equably but unsympathetically im no more happy about your presence than you are i assure you but it seems that we must work together doing what for heavens sake i cried just tell me what i am doing here and why do keep your voice down please he said wearily there was a sudden bustle on the station and whistles the train gave a shudder and in a cloud of steam and with an abominable squeaking it lurched forward a few inches then a few inches more we were under way although where to i did not know lefevre ignored me as the train drew out of the dingy smoky station and into the light of morning i love trains he said i always feel safe on them ive never understood people who find them frightening or dangerous he fell silent watching the streets of paris pass slowly by until we came to the outlying fortifications and into the countryside beyond then he gave a slight sigh and turned his attention to me you are feeling indignant and angry is that it i nodded wouldnt you be in my situation no at your age i had been fighting in a war for nearly two years however as you want all of these unpleasant emotions dissipated and i need you to be calm and able to concentrate for the next few weeks the next few weeks i interrupted in what i fear was a squeak of alarm do try and keep quiet for a while he said i will explain as best i can then you must decide on your course of action when we arrive at our destination you can choose either to get on the next train back to paris or you can stay with me mr wilkinson evidently desires that you choose the latter option from your performance so far i would prefer the former to begin at the beginning you have been chosen for special qualities which have not yet manifested themselves to me to become what used to be called an intelligencer and is now rather vulgarly called a spy britain is alone in the world much envied and resented for her wealth and the vastness of her empire many wish to tear her down she must be selfreliant and can count no one as her friend she must be aware of everything and able to sow discord among her enemies that in brief is to be your job i stared at him surely this was some sort of bad joke silence at last he continued you are learning if mr wilkinson decides the national interest is best served by continental peace you will endeavour in your small but allotted way to accomplish it if he suddenly changes his mind and decides a war is necessary you will try to set neighbour against neighbour and above all you will try to discover who is thinking what and when me good question a very good question you are obviously unsuited but perhaps you have some qualities that might make you useful and those are money i beg your pardon money he said wearily looking out of the window as though he was seeing a golden age going by all the world is now convertible to money power influence peace and war it used to be that the sole determinant was the number of men you could march out to meet your enemies now more depends on the convertibility of your currency its reputation among the bankers that is something i do not know and you do he smiled but it was not a happy smile the world changed in america some thirty years ago i suppose we should have seen it coming but we did not it was not won or lost by bravery or skill or numbers of men but by factories and gold it was a war of industry against farmers companies against cavaliers the losers had fewer resources less ability to produce the material of war and those we thought our friends abandoned us for the sake of trade with the richer side we he ignored the question and what was pioneered there will be even more strongly seen here next time you think there will be a war here i am sure of it there must be because you think that it will be as before and so will not care to prevent it it will not be armies fighting next time but economies vaults of gold in perpetual contest until all are exhausted the countries of europe will fight until they cannot afford to fight any more i think many in the city already worry about that but they will be outnumbered by those who will make money from the business the vickers the krupps and the schneiders men like john stone and his weaponry the bankers who provide the money for them the investors who get their per cent dividends war and peace will be decided by the movement of capital and how does this involve me you understand that world i do not i do not want to you say our and we and refer to two different countries he nodded i am a man without country not french not british not even american although once i was i work for hire and give good service i considered this i was not sure i liked this man who called himself lefevre and i certainly did not trust him but he had a presence which could not be lightly ignored he could command and it was comfortable to follow him but i was very far from certain it was wise and if someone offered more then i would consider the offer men without homes must look after themselves for they cannot surrender to the comforts of patriotism i did that once and will not repeat the mistake but i am no mercenary part of good service is loyalty and my masters your masters as well it now seems pay me i leaned back in my seat and like him watched the landscape outside the window pass by the train was going fast now and the city had long since been left behind we were in the open countryside heading east to metz so the sign in the the station had said but if lefevre saw worlds disappearing i perceived a different analogy as i headed unstoppingly into the unknown why had i so easily acquiesced in his instructions it was simple i was bored and wanted diversion i was even prepared to risk dismissal from a job which i found wearisome had i really been placed on this earth to arrange discounts for south american railway lines was my mark on humanity to be the per cent coupon on leeds water works debenture stock i had never dreamed of excitement as a young boy unlike my comrades my imagination was not full of dreams of marching at the head of utterly devoted men into a dangerous battle emerging victorious through my courage and skill but i had dreamed of something and it is the more difficult to put aside dreams which are unformed for they can never be exposed as mere childishness lefevre in his squalid accommodation with his ease among the rascals and rogues his metamorphosis into a gentleman seemingly at will touched a chord in me do not misunderstand i was not a reckless man and never have been no one i believe brought up in the particular circumstances of my family would ever be so foolish as to take risks unnecessarily i knew and from an early age how fragile is the net which prevents the respectable from falling into the abyss the onset of illness a misfortune in the markets an unfortunate accident a foolish mistake and all can unravel even though my employers paid me well enough i never spent money wildly and nurtured my pile with care and caution i could easily foresee a time when it might be needed i was accordingly all the more fascinated by a man like lefevre who whatever his natural desire to stay alive clearly approached life in a very different fashion not for him the caution of respectability the fear of poverty or the desire for comfort he was like a member of a different species although whether superior or inferior to mine i could not tell my sensible self told me that my way was the more responsible that i was fitted for the age and environment in which i lived but part of me was drawn to the irresponsibility the recklessness of lefevres way it was a contradiction in my being and it seemed one which henry wilkinson had both spotted and decided to exploit a man more comfortable with his choices would never have been on that train an odd thing memory i remember almost every moment of that interminable train ride the flat countryside the stops to pick up and set down passengers the fields of vines and crops passing by the smell of the carriage the lunch in the dining car the reluctant conversation what followed thereafter can only be recalled with an effort it is not that i have forgotten but that i think of it in abstract while my memory of the journey takes me back to that carriage as if i was still there and yet what passed after we left the train was far more interesting in the usual way of reckoning lefevre i will continue to call him so until a more appropriate moment began to teach me the business of selfpreservation in a far more real sense and if i never mastered all his skills it was because never in my wildest dreams and nightmares did i ever imagine i might need them he took me to nancy then a frontier town very much closer to the german border than it wished to be also as he said a good starting point for all that we had to do the frontier was not that closely guarded but the area on both sides of the border was stiff with soldiers as it was generally anticipated that the next round of the eternal conflict between france and germany would begin there but when how would it be a considered policy decided on high by one side or another or would it be an accident a few words spoken in haste a riposte fisticuffs a few shots and then whole armies on the march the generals and politicians trailing behind desperately trying to control a situation that had run on before them people make the mistake of assuming far too many things about armies lefevre told me one evening they assume for a start that generals know what they are doing and know what is going on they assume that orders pass down from top to bottom in a smooth and regulated fashion and above all they assume that wars start only when people decide to start them you are going to tell me that is not the case wars begin when they are ready when humanity needs a bloodletting kings and politicians and generals have little say in it you can feel it in the air when one is brewing there is a tension and nervousness on the face of the least soldier they can smell it coming in a way politicians cannot the desire to hurt and destroy spreads over a region and over the troops and then the generals can only hope to have the vaguest notion of what they are doing so what is the point of all this intelligencing to most people those who even admit a man like myself exists i am as you saw me the other night in paris little better than a crook a thief and maybe worse in fact very much worse you are invited to become scum the loathed of society only by disguising what you are will you maintain a respectable place in society but you will also probe your way into the soul of this terrible continent think of the doctor you do not go along to him and say i am going to die next tuesday and hope he can do something about it no you present yourself feeling a touch offcolour and he looks at you checks your heartbeat takes your blood pressure asks questions about your sleeping and your appetite do you have trouble climbing stairs are you eating having headaches and from these fragments of individually meaningless information he pieces together his conclusion you have a heart condition it may not stop you from dying next tuesday but it is some comfort to know and that is your our job do not think you will ever come across a memorandum saying we invade next week what you get is a sense of nerves in the barracks a feeling that something is happening for soldiers are the most sensitive people on earth to a change in atmosphere then perhaps you notice trains being cancelled perhaps more smugglers get caught slipping over borders you hear of more fights in bars in garrison towns of leave being cancelled and you put it all together and conclude that someone somewhere is about to throw the dice and this is your idea or can you demonstrate this to me oh i can demonstrate it in big wars and little ones although i imagine you would prefer to finish your drink and have a good nights sleep before you hear me on the origins of the last war between france and the germans but i was there i saw it all and the next time will be little different but in that case i believe the emperor decided to go to war and everyone backed him true but why did he decide why then especially as a limited amount of study would have demonstrated that the prussians would roll all over them because it was in the air it was necessary the gods had decreed it he drank down his brandy in one go and nodded ironically a marionette as are we all your job is to report the doings of puppets to other puppets a worthy and useful employment for which you need a good nights sleep i am going to make your life miserable tomorrow so dont stay up writing your diary you dont write a diary do you no thats a blessing chapter his loquacity and virtual good humour did not last long alas the next day began what i consider to be one of the most miserable and extraordinary six weeks of my life he woke me at dawn and announced that my task for the day was to get bread from a town some five miles into the occupied part of alsace however i was to accomplish this without any papers to give me free passage over the border without any money and without any maps then i was told to steal the bust of marianne from the town hall in the next city then to spend two nights in complete hiding counting the number of people who crossed the border then to leave a package on a bridge crossing the rhine high up in the girders of the ironwork then to retrieve a file of papers from a bank detailing the accounts of a man whose name he gave me and we did it again and again and again how to follow a man so he does not know you are there how to lose a man who is following you we chased each other around different towns for days until i became almost as good at it as he was then he would set me to trailing an army officer selected more or less at random then again with a german officer over the border then to burgling his house in between these bizarre activities he would take me into the forests with a gun and teach me how to shoot this was something i never became proficient at nor ever enjoyed i would rather be captured by an enemy than have that noise going off in my ears or we would spend an evening in a soldiers bar buying drinks and listening to their complaints and bravado or he would show me how to persuade someone to become an informer a traitor to their friends and country this last was in many ways the most terrible of all the skills he made me learn to my surprise i was surprisingly good at them although i had never before considered myself a natural criminal it appeared that i had an aptitude in that direction robbing a bank or town hall was not really that different from the oneboy raids i had launched at school and i had learned young that immense walks in the far more rugged terrain in wales or northern england a hundred miles or more spread over several days camping out at night where i could was an effective salve for the troubles of adolescence i discovered later that the allseeing mr wilkinson knew of these activities of mine he knew my old headmaster well and added them all into his calculations schoolboy criminality evidently was a better qualification for his esteem than the more normal virtues associated with the civil servant all bar shooting i could do and do well but the evening with virginie was different entirely it was where lefevre and i began to part company and i started thinking for myself about this task which others wanted me to perform she was a seamstress so lefevre told me of the sort that abound in the thousands throughout eastern france eking out a small living with their hands permanently in danger of hunger and willing to trade all they possess for a little security those who are lucky find a companion a bourgeois student perhaps and set up house the foolish dream of marriage the more practical realise the liaison will be of short duration and that eventually the respectable world will reclaim their protector most will then be left to fend for themselves once more unless their former lovers can be persuaded to pay for any children that might have been produced others are less fortunate and drift into a life of whoring and the huge numbers of soldiers along the border provide ample business their lives are brutal and often short it is remarkable how many remain human nonetheless the spark of humanity is not so easily extinguished even when there is often little to sustain it the woman lefevre took me to was one such she was probably an illegitimate child who would one day generate more such as she was she found herself in nancy and was inevitably turning to soldiers for protection but she was still young and new and fresh as the saying goes and had ambitions above mere survival life burned in her and would not be easily quenched the clarity of her vision was remarkable she had a sophistication of thought far beyond her sex or station or age listen do not think i do not understand what i am doing i could become a flower girl or a shop worker or labour in a factory i might find some drunken soldier who would beat me and leave me or be forced to live with a man far more stupid than i am and defer to his obtuseness in exchange for security what i do now may not prevail i might sink to the bottom and live out my days wheedling ever more disgusting men for a few sous hello dearie want a good time ive seen it all it is one future that may become mine but only one and it is not inevitable whatever the moralists tend to think and hope i might do better i am prepared to gamble and if it does not work then i will at least end my days in the gutter knowing that i have tried lefevre made her a proposition in exchange for any information she might provide he would offer payment gold for betrayal the most essential of human transactions but he attempted to disguise it by subtle words and careful phrasing she saw through them all immediately what sort of information do you have in mind we are in a border town full of troops i imagine that is the sort of information you require café gossip tales of troop movements training who is up and who is down in the army she pursed her lips very wellformed lips wide and curving touched up by only the faintest art that is all very well i imagine but hardly vital what country do you come from or work for i will not spy for the germans we do not work for the germans he replied probably the english then or the russians she considered i think i could manage that depending on the price of course but i think you set your sights too low how is that the whole of the general staff is here would it not be better to have information from that quarter rather than café chitchat lefevre did not reply you have made me a proposition monsieur i will make you one i do not want to spend my life in the company of soldiers but to present myself to better society i need clothes jewels somewhere better to live she stopped for what she had in mind was clear enough and how much would you suggest lefevre said dryly about a thousand francs he laughed then shook his head i think not my girl i do not have such sums at my disposal and if i gave it to you i doubt i would ever see it again youd be on the next train out with a different name do you take me for an idiot i abbreviate and my memory does not recall the exact words but that was the essence of the conversation it was illuminating i considered that lefevre had made a mistake and that i had seen one of his limitations he did not think broadly and was cautious in his judgement perhaps he was right experience had taught him that neither men nor women were to be trusted but i believed i had seen something he either had not glimpsed or wished to disregard the girl was clever i do not mean sly or cunning although life had taught her much of that when it was needed but intelligent she saw a chance for herself she did not i noted threaten did not say she would go to the authorities and report us which was just as well for her she judged the situation clearly and even in her situation which was poor and could easily have been squalid she somehow rose above circumstance she dressed well considering the quality of her clothes she sat and talked properly there was an animation in her eyes and expression which made one forget that she was neither particularly beautiful nor favoured in life even lefevre did not address her too roughly or rudely she had character in sum and i believed it was a pity to waste it you note i talk here entirely without reference to morality let me rephrase it we were talking to a whore about how to be better at her trade and i was considering seriously that we should act in some way as her pimps express it in such a way and it is shocking i was already a long way from home yet i did not see how her life could be made worse or her soul even more imperilled by the course she wished to pursue and there might be gain all round i put my argument to lefevre afterwards he dismissed it a thousand francs for a girl who charges two francs a night are you serious how long are we staying here until were finished i scowled tell me why because i would like to talk to that girl again he shook his head no i forbid it i found her again the following evening walking across the place stanislas even from a distance i could see the effect she had men walking towards her would slow down as they passed some nodded uncertain whether she was signalling to them poor as she was she was so far above the normal that there was doubt she was not brazen or vulgar she attracted through an appearance of vulnerability and delicacy i briefly considered the fate that lay before her how that delicacy would be trampled and ruined and shuddered slightly i had seen in her eyes the day before that she knew exactly how her future could develop a man began talking to her as i approached i bristled somewhat at the indignity and so hailed her in a louder voice than i might otherwise have used good evening madame i am so sorry to have kept you waiting the effect was delightful he froze with horror at the evident mistake he had just made gave me one brief look and ran as fast as he could virginie looked at me coldly you will have to pay for that she said i intend to have you eaten this evening it was nearly eight oclock by then and already dark and cold she hadnt so i took her to a restaurant a moderately expensive one deliberately chosen as i wished to see how she would conduct herself how much she knew about manners although by far the worstdressed woman in the place she did not allow herself to be abashed by her obvious poverty she behaved to the waiters with proper grace did not allow her voice to rise as the alcohol seeped into her blood chose her food cautiously but well ate with delicacy and the waiters responded she did not flirt with them but she made herself attractive in a distant untouchable fashion she got better service than i did by the end of the meal she was getting more attention from them than anyone else in the dining room we were halfway through the first course when i realised i had quite forgotten who and what she was and brusquely brought myself back to earth i must ask you for some information i said im afraid i do not understand you at all and that could be a grave impediment to any business arrangements between us she looked at me evenly not perplexed as she was already far beyond that stage at no point so far had she asked me any questions at all which was a good sign i have been thinking about what you said yesterday i continued my associate we had not given her any names is not interested in your proposal but i see some possibilities much later she told me how excited she had been by this remark so overwhelmed that she did not know how she had prevented herself from bursting into tears all i can say to that is that her selfcontrol was remarkable not a flicker of any emotion passed over her face had i known how well disciplined she was i would have engaged her on the spot but i need some answers from you what exactly i need to know whether you will be capable of filling the role you desire for yourself a gentle nature and pretty face will not be sufficient you need also to be i paused not knowing how to phrase it good in bed she asked quietly i almost spilled my drink no absolutely not well yes of course what i was going to say was possess a degree of breeding an ability to manage in different social situations to be someone who could be relied on not to make a fool of themselves who can elicit information discreetly without anyone suspecting them basically do the job without being exposed in any way she nodded so far you have behaved impeccably which i find extraordinary in a runaway mill girl or whatever you are were i a runaway mill girl then you would be right she said with a smile i understood that is what your friend assumed and i did not see why i should tell him my life story it was hardly his business so your story is not one that i wish to tell you i frowned there is no need to look like that just take it that i have good reasons for being what i am as for the rest you have seen how i stand and walk and converse and eat and drink do you have any fault absolutely none do you find me grotesque unlikely to attract the sort of men i would need to find no do you wish to discover for yourself how good i am i stared somewhat horrified at her come along sir we are talking business here i intend to go into trade selling something with you as an investor so to speak it is surely wise to ensure that the goods are of high quality i was covered in embarrassment at this at her calm as much as at her proposal i really dont think that is necessary i muttered you find me unattractive certainly not she smiled faintly i see you consider yourself a gentleman no i replied that is becoming ever more difficult to credit but i prefer to consider you a lady the smile vanished she looked down at the table and said nothing for a while then looked me straight in the eye i will remember that there was a long awkward pause between us then i coughed and tried to restart the conversation i realised only faintly that she was now in command the willingness to shock and surprise the delicate display of emotion the hint of secrecy had all so foxed me that i had allowed her to take control my ah investment how do you intend to spend it she was as relieved as i to return to more neutral territory all on clothes with a little left over for perfume jewellery i can rent once i have the clothes to pass as a lady the bourgeoisie are creditworthy i know little about womens clothes but i doubt they are less expensive in france than in london i doubt you will get much for a thousand francs i would hate to see the venture fail for lack of capital so give me more i think five thousand will be a more realistic sum i continued i will arrange the money tomorrow you have that much money to give away good lord no its not my money its the banks the banks a long story but i have discretion to make some payments which do not need to be directly accounted for straight away and i am not giving it away however i will need a strict schedule of payments otherwise questions will be asked you will be of service to many people but the connection must be kept discreet i should be able to lose you in the accounts and if i take the money and disappear you will not how do you know because it is your chance the only one you will ever get and you know it and because one day you might accidentally bump into my friend once more how long are you staying here i dont know another few days and where might i find you after that i gave her the address of a corresponding bank in paris you will send letters there and i will see to the rest then there is nothing else to discuss i will collect your money and spend it you will have to hope i am as honest as you believe she stood up and gathered her thin scarf i am you know when i can be i escorted her out into the cold of the night and she slipped off into the darkness lefevre was so furious with me on so many counts it is difficult to remember which loomed largest in his mind but all his objections stemmed from his anger that i had gone against his wishes i was there merely to learn from him not to act independently he raged at me for an hour and the extent of his fury taught me much he was a violent man full of anger at the world and he allowed it to cloud his judgement he also had no understanding of people i decided he considered no one trustworthy so did not try they were to be threatened or frightened into compliance with his wishes his methods had no greater subtlety to all of this i had one answer i was not aware i was his employee and i did not see why i should necessarily follow his orders in anything i had not risked his money or even government money but taken the risk upon myself this was not entirely true of course but it sounded better i would act as broker between the woman and the government if she came up with any useful information i would sell it on and use the money to pay off the debt if she were caught or proved less trustworthy than i anticipated then no one would be able to trace it to her majestys government better still i would arrange for all moneys to be paid out of the bank of bremens office in paris so that should suspicion fall on anyone it would be assumed the germans were her masters i was rather proud of that he was not mollified in fact the realisation that i had thought the matter through made him angrier still youre weak and stupid he screamed at me then his voice fell like father like son he hissed what does that mean your fathers a weakling always was couldnt look after himself couldnt look after you hes ill weak in the head i know all about your father picking flowers thats all hes ever been good for i hit him it was in better circumstances than the last time id tried and i didnt even have to think about it i just lashed out and my fist smashed into his face with most people that would have been enough but not with lefevre he was much tougher than most people i had hurt him but not enough to stop him he took a step back then came at me like a steam engine grappling with me and knocking me against the chestofdrawers in the hotel room but if he had strength and years of bitterness on his side i had agility and weeks of bubbling resentment on mine i twisted rammed his head against the wall and rolled across the floor he hurled himself on me and began pounding at my face with his fists while i instinctively kneed him in the stomach the mirror fell off the wall and smashed onto the floor when he hurled me bodily across the room the bed collapsed when we fell on it my arm tight around his throat he won he simply had more stamina could take more punishment than i could he left me barely conscious gasping for breath on the floor standing over me but also only just able to keep upright the blood pouring from his nose the he kneeled down and held a knife to my throat for a few seconds before stumbling out of the room if i ever set eyes on you again i will kill you do you understand i had no doubts that he meant it i did not see him again not that night nor the next day he simply vanished leaving no note behind him leaving me to pay the hotel bill and explain the destruction in the bedroom in retrospect i accept that i was wrong his life was more at risk than mine should anything go badly and he had spent much of the last quarter century exercising caution and surviving if he trusted no one it was not simply because of a fundamental illwill in his nature it was from bitter experience and he was getting old i reminded him of his failing powers and how different his life had been from his earlier more optimistic expectations had he been less closed less distrustful we might have established a useful cooperation based on mutual respect if not warmth but then i was less understanding we were now enemies on the same side and i was merely glad to see the back of him his treatment of me in the previous few weeks had been monstrous and contemptuous he had cruelly and unnecessarily exposed me to all manner of hardships and even danger had dismissed my successes and laughed at my failures had been insulting in every way he could imagine and i hated him more deeply than any man i had ever known before i refused to accept even to consider that he had been a very good teacher indeed chapter my investment was a success over the next few months virginie sent a steady stream of information some useful some not which demonstrated that i had judged rightly it reinforced my views of lefevre and of myself the system i had was this each missive was forwarded from the bank of bremen to barings and so on to me i read it then passed it to mr wilkinson who bought those he considered useful generally no more than a few hundred francs at a time but on one occasion mounting up to a thousand small sums for a government but large for a woman making her way on the borders of a foreign country this money i paid into the account i had opened at a third bank to work off the opening deficit and cover interest payments back to barings of such small details is the world of espionage truly composed i had no direct communications with her except when the debt was finally discharged but i did read her letters in all she showed great intelligence and skill she had an instinctive understanding of what was required and expressed herself with dispatch judging by the quality of the information i could guess that her plan to improve her standing in the world was going well after a month information began to come in that was supplied by a major in the cavalry talking about exercises and new formations that were being practised then came details of a new cannon supplied by a lieutenantcolonel in the artillery and finally she achieved her goal a whole stream of information supplied by an infatuated general of the army of the east who had little else to do as there was no intention of asking the army to do anything in meticulous detail she confirmed other evidence that france was currently determined to avoid war with germany because of its pressing rivalry with england and a fear that it was nowhere near strong enough yet to renew the fight this sort of stuff was the substance of her correspondence of far more interest in many ways was the human detail she added to her narrative she could have been the jane austen of france had her life developed differently she had an instinctive understanding of the human dramas she witnessed the rivalry of one officer with another the ambitions of a third the causes of anothers vulgar behaviour money worries thwarted desires for promotion political aspirations she saw and chronicled all and her little word sketches stayed with me perhaps too much when i later met many of the people who paraded through her letters general mercier though one of the highestranking men in the military and a national force in politics i could never see without remembering her description of him trying to get into his truss every morning dollfus the businessmans drive for wealth came she believed from the imperatives of a hypochondriac wife whose presence he abhorred some dreamed of an aristocratic wife others had vices so hideous that they were horribly and potentially profitably exposed to the threat of blackmail virginie saw it all and condemned none of it she sketched out an entire society and passed on such a vivid impression that i read her letters not only for the information they contained but also for pure enjoyment i later learned that mr wilkinson did the same and made sure they were preserved in their entirety where they are now is a mystery but the foreign office throws away nothing it gives me some comfort to think that somewhere in the bowels of that grim building they survive waiting to be discovered and read anew they came to an end after a little over nine months i was ordered to ensure that she continued in service but did not our arrangement had been honourable on both sides and i wished it to remain so accordingly i wrote to her on bank letter paper to the effect that her debt was now cancelled the full sum of the loan having been paid off with interest and enquiring as to her future intentions naturally the bank would welcome the continued patronage of such a reliable customer the reply thanked the bank for its consideration and said that after mature reflection she had decided to close her account her finances were now robust and she no longer needed a loan facility of such a nature nonetheless she remained grateful for its intervention and was pleased that the association had been so mutually profitable after that i never heard from virginie again that was the more cheerful side of my return to london the less positive aspect was that i was in high disfavour with my employers who were mightily annoyed at my disappearance lending me out for a few days was one thing having me vanish for the better part of six weeks was quite another and they saw no reason why they should pay for it my stock had fallen so far that i was put into internal accounts for nine months the purgatory of banking where you sit hour after hour day after day in a vast gloomy hall doing nothing but check columns of figures until they dance in your head and you feel like screaming out loud even worse wilkinson saw no reason why he should put in a good word for me either as he said he had not intended me to do anything other than go to paris and come straight back again it was all my own doing but at least no one audited the bank before i had paid off the debit created by my loan to virginie it occurred to me later that had they done so i would have been in quite serious trouble a brief vision flashed through my mind of standing in the dock trying to explain to a sceptical jury that i had paid without any authorisation five thousand francs of barings money to a french prostitute as a service to my country honestly your honour no alas i had no proof unfortunately my associate in france had disappeared and the foreign office claimed not to know me at all on the other hand it did drive home to me that removing sums of money from the most reputable bank in the world was a remarkably easy thing to accomplish and eventually my gaol sentence in the counting house came to an end and i was restored to favour although not to the point where i was allowed to go off to france again over the next year or so my knowledge of banking increased as did my level of boredom i even began to think fondly of cold nights sitting under a bridge over the rhine although the image of lefevre scowling and shouting some sarcastic remark soon brought me back to common sense i hoped that i would be summoned to see wilkinson again but no word came and i did not know where to find him the foreign office denied having any such person in the building and he seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth eventually i decided that that particular adventure was over i suspected lefevre had been so scathing about me that whatever the reason wilkinson had had for choosing me he had changed his mind i was unsuitable i had almost forgotten about the whole thing when it started all over again another summons another letter another meal i hope youre not going to ask me to be your delivery boy again i said after the preliminaries were dealt with im still paying for the last time they havent let me out of london for more than a year because of you oh dear i am sorry but it really wasnt my fault its not as if i asked you to go off gallivanting around france he said mixed messages im afraid maybe but before i met you i was a banker with a fine career in prospect and a few months later i was spending my life in miscellaneous disbursements a little bored are you very good why dont you come and work for me you must be joking i mean it your friend in paris spoke highly of your skills if not of your character i would rather starve in the gutter i said disgustedly besides i was not impressed by the playacting of m lefevre or whatever his name is mr drennan pardon mr arnsley drennan thats his name he doesnt use it much any more but there is no reason why you shouldnt know it he is an american he came to europe when his side lost in their war you were saying playacting i repeated crossly hanging around in bars listening to tittletattle a waste of time you could do better easily not that im going to i wont have anything to do with lefevre or drennan you wouldnt have to mr drennan ah found a more lucrative post elsewhere really isnt that difficult yes im afraid he was most awkward about it he knows so very much about things you see unfortunately we havent been able to find him to talk things over i cant imagine he ever found anything very useful for you anyway i thought his antics were quite ridiculous did you yes so what would you do differently and this was the moment that changed my life forever for with a few words i then took the first steps which made the imperial intelligence system a little more coherent i would say professional although that would be considered an insult i should have kept my mouth shut and walked out i should have decided that wilkinson was someone with whom i would not associate but i wanted to give in ever since i had seen lefevre or drennan deal with virginie i knew i could do better and i had found the whole business exhilarating besides i had realised that henry wilkinson did not preside like a spider in the middle of a vast web of intelligence officers spread out across the empire constantly alert for dangers and opportunities as i had assumed far from being allseeing and all competent he was virtually blind he had no department no budget no authority whatsoever the safety of the greatest empire the world had ever known depended on a bunch of friends and acquaintances crooks and misfits the flow of intelligence depended on favours and requests there was no policy little direction and no obvious aims it was amateurish and all but useless they needed me i decided with all the arrogance that a twentysevenyearold could muster far more than i needed them so i summarised my understanding of imperial intelligence wilkinson seemed quite pleased with the description yes yes he said cheerfully i think that sums up the current situation quite nicely and if i did not inform you of all this im sure you understand the reasons why perfectly well if i cannot have the substance of proper organisation then the appearance of one is the next best thing so how does all this work as best it can he replied the government does not believe such activities to be necessary and in any case couldnt persuade parliament to provide money for them some sort of body might be set up using funds voted to the army or navy but neither sees the need for the last fifteen years i have been operating without any legal basis or funding whatsoever we have people collecting information throughout the empire in india and africa and in europe but there is no coordination at all i have to ask to see anything they have i cannot order them to comply or even say what they should be looking for at the moment for example the indian army is not on speaking terms with us im still not certain why they wont answer my letters so you know as well as i do that all this running around in france collecting gossip in bars is useless not useless no he said judiciously we do the best we can but we work despite our masters not because of them there is nothing unusual about that many government departments feel the same i think it might be a common condition of the civil servant you find it all unsatisfactory i find it pathetic you could do better considering that government policy is unlikely to change listen i said i work for a bank it is a commercial operation which in effect buys and sells money it is all i know it has its weaknesses but it works if you want information real information not tittletattle i am convinced you have to buy it my arrangement with virginie was organised on a purely commercial basis for mutual profit that is why it worked information is a commodity it is traded like any other and there is a market for it how would you go about it i would set up as a broker find people who wish to sell and buy at a good price and sell it on at a price as well and that is all in essence the difference is that such an operation would need a substantial amount of money to get it going you get what you pay for you speak like a businessman and you im afraid need to think like one im not thinking about the cost of a battleship you know even small sums of money have to be accounted for you would be surprised how well the government likes to look after public funds still perhaps something could be done would you do me the great favour of writing down confidentially of course what your proposal is and how you would proceed i can then perhaps present it to some friends to ask their opinion and so i became a writer of memoranda for governments do i bother to draw a contrast with the flights of fancy which illuminate the pages of our novelists do these heroes stay up at night penning budget proposals laying out routes for transferring money from one bank to another describing methods of accounting for sums disbursed that is what i did i began by describing the problem which was to ascertain the intentions of france although any country could have been inserted at this point and then pointed out that we lived in an age of industry governments could not order armies into the field on a whim they have to be amassed and equipped this takes time i estimated that between deciding to go to war and actually doing so at least nine months was required and that this could be monitored by watching the order books of armaments companies the schedules of the train companies requisitions of horses and so on was the government putting in place new loan facilities with banks was it taking on increased powers to raise supplementary taxation which war was to be fought could also be estimated was money going disproportionately to naval yards or to the manufacturers of cannon technical details of how weapons worked should such information be required might also be better acquired by the commercial route rather than by trying to suborn officers in the armed forces and what were the stockpiles of the opposing military forces if they went to war how long could they stay in the field much of this information i argued could be bought at the right price in addition i realised that many politicians were susceptible to a certain amount of coercion through exposure of their finances i also proposed that money and time should be spent on obtaining detailed information about the bribes and other inducements politicians were known to accept this could then be used to constrain unfriendly action or to obtain any more specific information that was required finally i recommended that all the money involved be channelled through german banking houses to make it seem that it was they not we who were indulging in this activity it was if i may say so quite impressive all but revolutionary in fact however obvious all this might seem now the application of commercial logic to what had up until then been a military and diplomatic enterprise caused some consternation of those who saw my note some were outraged others appalled and a few were intrigued many considered my arguments vulgar and distasteful although most of those disapproved of any form of espionage at all chapter and some people were prepared to fund the operation i received instructions from mr wilkinson that friends would back me and that i was to go to paris and that i was now to be a journalist working for the times a somewhat steep social descent after barings i should see the editor to find out how to do this once the man had been informed that he was to employ me then i was summoned to another lunch i was expecting mr wilkinson instead i encountered john stone for the first time your chief investor wilkinson said waving at him potentially he felt that before he put money into you he should see if you are worth the effort i studied him carefully as wilkinson slid out of the room to leave us alone he was about fifty and quite unremarkable to look at cleanshaven with thinning hair that was touched with grey and dressed in a fashion that was proper and yet entirely anonymous the cufflinks i noticed were of simple design and inexpensive he wore no ring he had none of the sleek prosperity about him that men like lord revelstoke the chairman of barings managed to exude no whiff of cologne no sign of hair oil expensive or otherwise he could have passed as anything he wished certainly he drew no attention to himself physically also he was unremarkable not handsome especially nor ugly his eyes were attentive and held their subject with great fixity his movements were slow and measured nothing hurried him if he did not want to be hurried his calm was one of confidence and i would have said if the description wasnt ridiculous contentment i had heard the name but it had scarcely registered with me stone was not yet the force he has since become in british industry his reputation as a sophisticated manipulator of money was growing but not to the point where he could no longer hide his achievements he was known as the man who had combined gleesons steel and beswick shipyard but there was still no reason to think he was anything other than an ambitious and competent man of industry accordingly although i was polite i was not overawed by the encounter he surprised me though for the most part these industrialists are difficult people to converse with selfmade men for whom industry is everything and who judge conversation to be the stuff of the weak they despise bankers on the whole for contributing nothing to society and for acting as parasites on their endeavours they are either overwhelmed by the likes of wilkinson or aggressive in showing their disdain stone was none of these things he was mildmannered almost as though i was doing him the favour for a long time the conversation steered around anything other than the reason for the luncheon so you plan to go to paris he asked eventually as though i had let slip my desire to see the sights in a week or so if all goes well and barings they are not upset to let a man of such promise leave they seem more than ready to bear their loss with fortitude i replied with a touch of slight bitterness when i told barings of my decision they had merely nodded and accepted the letter of resignation hadnt even asked for an explanation let alone tried to dissuade me i see you cannot blame them really defending the empire is very admirable but doing it on barings time is quite another dont judge them too harshly banking is not a business which has much use for individuality even revelstoke thinks that initiative and daring should be his sole preserve it is a great error on his part mind you i believe he has an equally low opinion of me might i ask why oh he regards me as an upstart stone said with a faint smile but he did not seek to convey the idea that revelstoke was beneath contempt as a result rather he reported it in a manner which was entirely neutral even as though the chairman of barings might have a point it is nothing personal you understand but he thinks i dont understand money and you think you do i think i understand people and revelstoke takes too many risks he has made a great deal of money out of it and so is emboldened to take even more he believes he is infallible and that will spell ruin sooner or later hubris you know can destroy a banker as well as a greek hero now someone criticising lord revelstoke acknowledged throughout the world as one of the greatest bankers in history made me feel a little uncomfortable he is surely the greatest innovator in banking of the age i said he is the greatest gambler stone said sourly and so far he has had the greatest luck i tried to change the subject ah loyalty observed stone not a bad quality but it is possible to be loyal and critical at the same time they are two qualities i insist on in fact the sycophant is the greatest of all dangers in an organisation i have never fired a man for disagreeing with me i have dismissed several for agreeing when they knew better on that subject what exactly would my position be i asked a little crossly do i run the risk of being summoned back to england because i agree with you about something i will have no say in the matter at all he replied evenly you are to work for mr wilkinson not me i merely provide the means for you to do so as an experiment obviously if mr wilkinson decides the experiment is not working or that it costs more than it is worth then we will have to think again why are you providing the means it is a very great deal of money not so very much he said and it is money i can easily spare i thought your approach was interesting and amateurism annoys me wherever it occurs i almost consider it my duty to eradicate it and if not my duty then my hobby an expensive hobby he shrugged so expensive i do not quite believe you call me a patriot then i know little of your companies mr stone such things are not my area of expertise but i remember reading that you have supplied weapons to every single enemy our army and navy might face are those the actions of a patriot it was an insulting remark but deliberately made i needed to find out what i was getting myself into it is not the task of my companies to make britain more secure it is the duty of britain to make my companies more secure you have the relationship the wrong way round he said quietly it is the task of a company to generate capital that is its beginning and its end and it is foolish and sentimental to apply morality to it let alone patriotism morality must apply to everything even the making of money a strange statement for a banker if i may say so and it is not so morality applies only to people not to animals and still less to machines but you are a man i pointed out you manufacture weapons of war which you sell to all who want to buy them not quite he said with a smile they must be able to afford them as well but you are right i do but consider if one of my torpedoes is fired and hits its target many people will die a terrible thing but is the torpedo to blame it is but a machine designed to travel from point a to point b and then detonate if it does so it is a good machine which fulfils its purpose if not it is a failure where is there any space for morality in that and a company is also merely a machine supplying the wants of others why not blame the governments who buy those torpedoes and order them to be used or the people who vote for those governments should i stop building these weapons and deny governments the chance to murder their citizens more cheaply and efficiently certainly not i am obliged to make them the laws of economics dictate that if i do not then a demand will go unsatisfied or it may be that the money is spent on a less worthy machine which would be an inefficient use of capital if men do not have torpedoes they will use cannon if there are no cannon they will use bows and arrows if there are no arrows they will use stones and if there are no stones they will bite each other to death i merely convert desire into its most efficient form and extract capital from the process that is what companies are for they are designed to multiply capital what they make is irrelevant torpedoes food clothes furniture it is all the same to that end they will do anything to survive and prosper can they make more money employing slave labour if so they must do so can they increase profits by selling things which kill others they must do so again what if they lay waste the landscape ruin forests uproot communities and poison the rivers they are obliged to do all these things if they can increase their profits a company is a moral imbecile it has no sense of right or wrong any restraints have to come from the outside from laws and customs which forbid it from doing certain things of which we disapprove but it is a restraint which reduces profits which is why all companies will strain forever to break the bounds of the law to act unfettered in their pursuit of advantage that is the only way they can survive because the more powerful will devour the weak and because it is in the nature of capital which is wild longs to be free and chafes at each and every restriction imposed on it you justify selling weapons to your countrys enemies to the french you mean yes and the germans and the italians and the austrians he added yes you justify that but they are not my countrys enemies he said with a faint smile we are not at war we may well be soon true enough but with which country do you think does it matter no he admitted i would sell them the weapons even if i knew that we would be at war with them in six months time it is not my job to conduct foreign policy such sales are not illegal and anything which is not forbidden is permissible if the government decided to ban sales to france then i would comply with the law at the moment for example i can see a great deal of money to be made in building shipyards for the russian empire but the government does not wish russia to have a shipbuilding industry i would like to supply the tsar with our new submarines as the russian government would pay handsomely for them again i do not there is a law against that oh dear no the laws of the land are not only those on the statute book as approved by parliament but i am told that my business here would suffer and naturally i listen to such warnings in my opinion it is a mistake russia will surely learn how to make battleships and submarines all we are doing is delaying this by a few years while also making enemies of them and denying ourselves considerable profit you are very honest not at all only when there is no reason not to be i considered all this a passionate speech delivered in an utterly dispassionate dry manner and tried to make sense of it when talking of capital stone spoke more like a romantic poet than a businessman and where do i fit into this you you will make the government better able to take correct decisions if you do your job well at the same time you will provide a better view of the future so that i can plan more accurately presumably you want there to be conflict oh no it is a matter of complete indifference to me i merely wish to be ready for whatever occurs and the safety of the country the empire he shrugged if i had to judge i would say that the empire is inefficient and wasteful it has no purpose and little justification undoubtedly the country would be better off without it but i do not expect many people will ever agree with me its only justification is that india deposits its gold in the bank of england and that has allowed the gigantic increase in our trade with the world by strengthening the pound sterling i found mr stone an alarming man i had anticipated working for the government a patriot labouring for the public good not for a man like john stone only towards the end of our interview did i see something else in him puzzling and unexpected tell me he said as we stood to leave how is your father as usual i think i said i felt as guilty as i was surprised i had not made the journey to dorset to see my father for some while and as i have mentioned every time i went there seemed less point in doing so i see you know him we were acquainted once before he became ill i liked him you look very much like him but you do not have his personality he was gentler than you you should be careful of what oh i dont know of getting too far away from your fathers nature perhaps and he nodded at me wished me well in a formal impersonal fashion and left chapter having damned all others for their ineptitude and promised an entirely new way of collecting information i found that i was left entirely without any assistance or instructions as a result so show us seemed to be the general opinion and i discovered later that there were many of the few who knew anything of this experiment who wanted me to fail dismally saying what you will do on paper is one thing doing it is another and i had not the slightest idea how to proceed getting myself to paris was the first step fairly obviously after that i would have to make it up as i went along my official employers were somewhat more useful to me george buckle the editor of the times accepted my sudden irruption into his life with remarkable calm and handed me over to a junior reporter called mcewen for instruction about how to write for a newspaper as well as practical guidance on the uses of telegraph machines for transmitting any stories i might feel like writing the fact that the times wasnt required to pay me no doubt made buckle more easygoing about my existence then i left arriving in paris one wednesday morning my luggage had already gone on ahead and i was little encumbered by baggage so i went straight to the offices of the times offices being a misnomer as they were in truth little more than a single room which contained nothing that might indicate its purpose except for bundles of old french newspapers on the floor the door was unlocked and the room was empty but on the desk was a little note addressed to me would i be so kind as to join the writer thomas barclay in the nearby restaurant for lunch i was so kind a waiter led me over to the right table and i joined the man who was theoretically my new colleague thomas barclay was in his late forties at that stage with a fine flowing beard that was russet coloured he had enormous ears an oddly pointed nose and an intellectual forehead he frowned a lot to show high seriousness a tendency he had acquired i suspect through spending too much time studying german philosophy in jena although the effect was to make him look more confused than thoughtful he was fortunately about as serious a journalist as i was but had been in paris for nearly twenty years by this stage he had written a book review in the spectator in the early seventies and as he had shown a willingness to live abroad had been offered the job as paris correspondent of the times on this basis alone his reports were few and far between and always couched in such vague language that it was often impossible to ascertain what exactly was the subject for barclay the importance of an event varied in direct proportion to the importance of the person who had given him the information for he was a most fearful snob and could work himself into a lather of excitement over an invitation to a prestigious salon or dinner at a senators private house their words he treated like finest gold dust but he was so discreet he could rarely bring himself to report them without wrapping his information up in so many circumlocutions that their significance was totally lost besides he had of late become the president of the british chamber of commerce in paris which post he took most seriously thinking rather oddly that it was a position of the highest political and diplomatic importance rather than a mere dining club for foreign traders he was delighted to see me and not in the slightest perturbed either that no one had asked his opinion about my coming or by my utter lack of experience very few people in england have any interest in what goes on outside the empire he said cheerfully as long as it does not affect them for the most part you can write anything you wish and for all important events a straight translation from a reputable paris paper will do excellently well i wouldnt bother running around trying to get interesting stories if i were you no one will read them and they probably wont even get published the only subject worth extending yourself over is a society scandal they always go down well as they confirm the readers opinions about the low morals of the french book reviews if you dont mind i will keep for myself theatre only if bernhardt is involved i told him that he was welcome to keep all the book reviews i thought i said tentatively i might write some stories about the bourse he frowned if you wish go ahead i wouldnt find it very interesting myself but it takes all sorts of course i was given a few names i added it would be rude not to call on them good heavens yes go ahead please dont think i intend to direct you in any way as long as you write one story every fortnight more or less everyone will be delighted with you ill do my best i said i did one yesterday in fact he said so were in the clear for a while if you do the next one i said i thought i could manage to write something in a fortnight and he leaned back in his chair beaming at me splendid thats that taken care of now where are you living in fact i was in a hotel and ending up staying there for the next year it was the cheapest option as i did not want the expense of a household and it was perfectly adequate domesticity has never been one of my great desires in life and certainly was not then a comfortable bed and decent food are my sole requirements and the hôtel des phares in reality a few rooms above a bar with an obliging landlord whose wife was happy to do my laundry and cook some food provided both i will pass over my daily life as much of it was of little interest and consisted mainly in laying down those webs of information and making those acquaintances which journalists and other seekers of information require how this is done is fairly obvious and consists primarily in making oneself as personable and harmless as possible in creating a void which others seek to fill through conversation from such gossip come hints and clues which lead sometimes to other things i made my acquaintance widely for i found the french both charming and welcoming quite unlike their reputation i cultivated the traders of the bourse the playwrights of the latin quarter and the politicians and diplomats and soldiers who scattered themselves at random across the city they all i believe considered me somewhat dull and without any opinions of my own it was not my role to have any and in august i went to biarritz where the new rich of the republic went to mingle with old names and titles and keep themselves properly distant from the people a group they admired in principle but did not actually want to have anything to do with on a social level it was a glorious sight to watch for a brief while a testament both to the wealth of the rich and the capacity of the french to amuse themselves all of french society that mattered squeezed itself into a stretch of coastline bordered by the hôtel du palais to the north and the hôtel métropole to the south these two separated by a mile or so of glorious beach and many dozen villas of exuberant and fanciful design the town was at the peak of its prosperity then queen victoria herself had come to visit the year before the prince of wales showed up every year princess natalie of romania lived in exile in a handsome villa up the road the first russian grand dukes were putting in an appearance the english had colonised the entire region from pau to the pyrenees to the coast apparently forgetting that aquitaine was no longer theirs for weeks on end all day and all night there was an endless round of entertainment for the well connected and even for those who like me could be suspected of being wellconnected my introduction to society came through the good offices of mr wilkinson who arranged for princess natalie to invite me to one of her soirées from that point word went round swiftly that i was someone who should be known although no one knew why they were prepared to invite me so they could try and discover my secret i was variously reputed to be an immensely rich banker a bastard child of the duke of devonshire a breeder of champion racehorses and a man with vast landholdings in australia all indicated that i was someone who should be invited to parties and so i went carefully ambiguous in my replies to all probing questions and always insisting that i was really just a journalist on the times no one believed me the poor princess was a drab and dreary woman alas a perfectly sweet temper and a kindly soul but she had only her tragic situation and title to recommend her to the very demanding french who expect their women to be beautiful intelligent elegant charming and fascinating at all times and in all circumstances the princess was thoughtful plain serious and not given to smiling for fear of showing her bad teeth but she was a princess so was bound to command the respect of these devoted egalitarians her reign as the most important woman in biarritz was as insecure as her claim to the throne of romania had been pretenders constantly appeared to challenge her none was more dangerous than the countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szala a woman of exceptional allure who was making her first trip to biarritz that year and who had made the town collectively lose its head in excitement french society far more than english was remarkably good at producing such people or at adopting them they formed a focus for men let other women know what they should be wearing created gossip to fill up dinnertime conversations and were quite simply admired some were entirely artificial creations very little more than courtesans with terrible manners and no breeding who burned brightly then fell to earth when boredom set in others such as the countess according to popular report had more substance to be the object of fascination is a very considerable accomplishment it requires impeccable manners intelligent conversation grace and beauty it also requires that magical quality which cannot be defined but which is easily recognised when it is met with presence in a word an inability to be in a room without everyone knowing you are there however quiet your entrance and discreet your behaviour an ability to spend lavishly but without ostentation the best of everything whatever its price low or high a knowledge of how to be simple when that is better and extravagant when that is required and never ever take a false step such in sum was this countess with the impressively long name and beside her the poor princess from romania wilted like a flower in a drought not that this concerned me of course i was there for an entirely different reason the social whirl was a backdrop for my activities and i paid only very little attention to it i heard about the leading figures of the town but conversed with only a few of them my main reason for being there was very specific i needed to discover something about coal equally it was an opportunity to meet mr wilkinson who went walking every summer in the pyrenees he was a great expert on the flora and fauna of the region and published a book just before he died on wild flowers which is now a standard text on the subject for those who are interested in such things which i must confess i am not but the coal was the main reason and the justification for spending a week in the hôtel du palais at john stones expense britain was going through one of its periods of anxiety about the mediterranean it was always going through these of course but currently anxieties were higher than usual the fear was that there was going to be yet another assault on britains position in the near east with the russian empire and the french combining to pressure our interests in the black sea and egypt and hence our communications with india through the suez canal although the royal navy could cope quite easily with an assault by either fleet the fear was that the french and russians were going to combine their efforts and dealing with both simultaneously would be a problem that was why more than anything the government was keen to prevent russia building a shipyard on the black sea and so be in a position to service a major fleet in the region that was also why the russians were keen to do precisely that so were the french thinking of sending out their fleet from toulon that was what i was supposed to discover all the usual sources of information had failed if anything was planned word had not yet filtered down to the ranks but it probably would not have done i doubted anything would materialise before the following spring at the earliest in about seven months time the problem was that if britain needed to reinforce its mediterranean fleet it needed to know soon so that ships could be recalled from the west indies reequipped and sent out again this also would take several months hence my interest in coal battleships consume prodigious quantities of fuel and keeping them at sea ready for action is a major logistical operation tens of thousands of tons of coal are required and supplies have to be in place at coaling stations when they are needed you cannot just send out some ships any more you need a lot of work in advance for a battleship lying dead in the water unable to move is no use to anyone while all navies kept reasonable quantities of coal scattered around the world not even the royal navy kept that amount in place everywhere it might be needed had the french navy been ordering coal in large quantities had they commissioned tenders from the mediterranean merchant fleet to distribute it were supplies being diverted from the atlantic ports to the mediterranean if i knew the answers to these questions now i would be able to tell the government in london not only what the french navy would be doing next year i could hazard a guess about french foreign policy in the near future as well to discover all this i ended up dining one night in august with a french naval captain and his mistress he was a sweet man who should never have been in the military he had not a shred of the martial about him and preferred collecting japanese woodcuts to charging over the high seas ready to board an enemy family tradition and an overbearing admiral for a father had determined otherwise however ordinarily i would have spent time trying to come alongside the father so to speak but captain lucien de koletern was quite interesting enough for me at that moment for he was a terrible failure poor man his lack of ability in the business of commanding others had meant that the navy with some acuity had refused to allow him anywhere near anything that actually floated instead he had been given a job in paris in which place he spent his time trying to avoid the disappointed frowns of his father and more importantly organising logistical supplies in particular coal for this he had some considerable talent what he lacked in dash and flair he made up for in meticulous attention to detail and an obsessive concern with filing cards he was an interesting conversationalist as well he knew he was a bitter disappointment to his family but was quite philosophical about it i know it sounds absurd but i really do believe that what i do is where the future of the navy really lies not with ships at all he said and what do you do i asked innocently supplies coal mainly but doesnt a navy need ships not really if you think about it the french navy has not actually been used for anything since the crimean war and there is little prospect of it being used again if the ships never left harbour it would make no difference but if that happened you wouldnt have all that much to do i pointed out ah he said waving a finger but ships keep their boilers going even when they are tied up that is enough to keep me busy then what happens if the fleet ever put to sea they would suddenly decide they wanted more do you have any idea how much coal a fleet needs when it sets off somewhere no not the slightest i said about tons per month per battleship a fleet of say ten battleships fifteen destroyers and thirty or so other ships would need about tons a month all of which has to be found at fairly short notice thats why its a nuisance difficult i said sympathetically is this making your life complicated at the moment fortunately not he said and i relaxed i was home there was talk that something was going to happen in the mediterranean exercises or some such so i went to the admiral and asked what was required of me nothing he said all just rumours no more than that in fact he said i could run the stocks down a bit just to punish the suppliers for hiking the price for goodquality coal last time they thought the fleet might put to sea who is your admiral i asked he sounded a wellinformed fellow it might be a good idea to meet him one day besides i had to check that he really knew what he was talking about lucien told me bless him and i knew my quest had ended the admiral was in command of the toulon fleet a man with good connections to the french foreign office a man with a future who knew what he was talking about and did not make mistakes like saying something that meant the fleet would not be ready for action when required all that was needed now was to doublecheck with the price movements of wholesale anthracite on the coal exchange in paris and i would be able to report back to london i changed the subject and began to try and win over his mistress who was now looking quite despairing at the tedium of the conversation she became sulky and illhumoured and caused several frosty moments of silence to descend on our little table during one of these i saw lucien gazing over at another table with a faint smile of interest maurice rouvier with a friend he said with delight the slightest emphasis on the last word made me turn to look as well shes a bit old for him i gather he likes them somewhat younger rouvier was the finance minister i knew him by sight although i had not yet met him he was not widely liked apart from the whiff of indecency that lucien referred to he was also rumoured to be less than straightforward in his dealings with his fellow men to put it another way he was devious even by the standards of politicians a long and successful career awaited him his presence there was in itself testament to the importance of holidaying in the right places rouvier was a man of the south mediterranean in origin and thus was also associated with the disregard for proprieties generally considered to be a characteristic of such people still he was it was grudgingly admitted a man of ability a finance minister who actually knew something of finance which was unusual and with a background in banking and he had done well on the merrygoround of french politics he had had a turn as prime minister once already and he has popped up in ministries with great regularity ever since he had no known political opinions indeed his only firm conviction lay in an undying opposition to income tax apart from that he would support anything and anyone who would further his career luciens attention however was not fixed on the man who temporarily held the finances of the nation in his hands but rather on the companion opposite at a table of about six people a willowy tall woman with dark hair and lowcut dress which revealed exceptionally fine shoulders and a long neck set off by a single strand of some of the most gigantic diamonds i had ever seen in my life she was young in her early twenties and even from a distance made the rest of the table seem drab in comparison all those around her were men mainly in middle age and it was clear that all conversation was dominated by the desire to catch her attention i looked at her briefly turned away then turned to look again rude to stare lucien said in my ear with an amused chuckle quite a picture is she not his mistress whose name i never knew scowled and sank lower into depressed silence poor thing the contrast between the two was too great to be ignored who is she ah what a question who indeed that is the famous countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szala oh i said thats the one is it ive been hearing about her the sensation of the season conquered paris with a speed and aplomb which the prussian army never managed to put it another way she has cut a swathe through polite society broken the heart of every man who has come within a hundred metres of her and left her rivals looking old coarse and thoroughly shopsoiled every woman in the city hates her of course im fascinated so is everyone else so tell me more there is a great deal of gossip and nothing of substance she is a widow it seems tragic story newly married and husband falls off a horse and breaks his neck wealthy beyond a doubt and came to paris because no one knows why she moves in the very best society and will no doubt shortly marry a duke or a politician or a banker depending on her tastes does she have a lover no one knows she is as enveloped in mystery as well as you are but if you will forgive me for saying so she is very much more beautiful i would like to meet this woman lucien snorted i would like to take tea with queen victoria he said and that wont happen either everyone knows of her some have been in the same room with her few have met her so whats the secret he shrugged who knows she is no more beautiful than many a woman she is said to be charming and witty but so are many people i do not know she is one of those people whom others wish to be with in that case i said with a grin i will ask her and i got up from the table and walked straight across to her table i coughed to get her attention as i bowed to the minister and smiled as she looked at me good evening principessa i said in a discreet voice loud enough to heard by those sitting nearby may i pay my compliments to the most beautiful woman in france when you discover her you may she said with a flash of the eye there i bowed and retired pleased with my success and walked back to my table i cant believe you did that lucien said with something between shock and reproof shes a woman not pallas athene i replied and returned to my meal which now tasted very much better than it had before and spent the rest of the evening being pleasant to his mistress who seemed grateful for my attention i got back to my hotel some three hours later and there waiting for me at the desk was an envelope inside was a single piece of paper on which was written tomorrow two pm villa fleurie chapter i liked the principessa part she said when we met it adds to the mystery it is all round biarritz already that being hungarian is merely a subterfuge and that i am in reality a neapolitan princess living incognito for fear of my husband i shook my head you dont look in the slightest bit neapolitan i dont speak hungarian either she replied what do you want her brusqueness was understandable i must have been one of the very last people in the world she wanted to meet her circumstances had changed as much as her appearance which is to say the alteration was total she was living in an elegant new villa a few hundred yards from the hôtel du palais in the midst of the most fashionable part of the town this had been built some five years previously by a banker who rarely used it and rented it out for a prodigious sum when he was not there it was furnished tastefully and discreetly and virginie or rather elizabeth as i must now call her fitted into it as perfectly as did the handmade furniture and handblown glass in the artnouveau style then coming into fashion neither the house nor she had any connection to the overblown gaudiness normally associated with the grandes horizontales for whom vulgarity was part of the allure the same went for her behaviour which i had briefly witnessed the previous evening some of her sort would try to win attention by throwing diamonds across a restaurant for the pleasure of seeing the men scrabble to find them or to see the disdain and fury on the faces of their women at the demonstration of how easily such men could be commanded others talked in loud voices or stood up to dance on their own making a spectacle of themselves through their display they promised gratification but for one night only this woman implicitly offered far more than that even the way she sat was impressive undoubtedly she was on edge nervous a little frightened how could she not be yet there was not a sign of it on her face or in her posture her selfcontrol was extraordinary superhuman almost i dont want anything i said simply i recognised you and could not deny myself the pleasure that is all all i thought i suppose not i was curious and i may say deeply impressed by your achievement i wished to congratulate you in a way as well as renew an acquaintance she allowed herself a small smile and what are you doing here i am a journalist of sorts she raised a finely plucked eyebrow of sorts that sounds as though you are really nothing of the sort no truly i work for the times in a few days i will be able to show you a story about the anthracite market to prove it i dont believe you i dont believe you are a hungarian countess either we both have our secret past which is in the past and should remain there although i am curious to know where you got your name elizabeth hadik barkoczy von futak uns szala she completed for me quite a mouthful you dont think something more straightforward might have been better oh no she said the longer the name the better it is besides such a person existed i met her mother once she told me she had once had a daughter who would have been about my age had she lived so i decided to bring her back to life i see i will do no more for you she said suddenly i havent asked you to nor was i going to tempting though the prospect is i have no doubt that my masters if i had any of course would disapprove thoroughly of my weakness but i have never had a taste for forcing people to do things i believe my treatment of you in the past was perfectly straightforward and honourable she nodded let it remain so but i would like to know how you managed your rise to fortune since we last met your circumstances were somewhat different then she laughed and even though there was absolutely not one jot of difference on her face i could sense that she was relaxing she believed me and up to a very limited point trusted me which was justifiable as i spoke the words i meant them but in the back of my mind i knew that one day i might have to betray that trust i did not like blackmail but i knew enough of the world to know how well it worked i say in my defence only that i hoped it would never be necessary would you care for some tea mr cort thank you countess thats my real name by the way i see no point in playing games with false ones there i think we differ she rang a little bell on the side table and gave the order to a servant who appeared with great speed i very much hoped he was not the sort of servant who listened at doors dont worry she said reading my face well it is very thick wood and neither of us have voices that carry besides although simon has waggling ears he is both well paid and has secrets of his own that are better not exposed to public view as for my little subterfuge my own name would open no doors a title of nobility however spurious does so in this republican country one does what is necessary the tea arrived with delicate china cups and a silver teapot very pretty although not for the serious teadrinker one has to make allowances do you wish to sit outside she asked it is a fine day and i have an excellent view of the sea then i will tell you something of my story if you wish she nodded to the servant who took the tray outside and when all was prepared we followed it was delightful the villa was halfway up a small hill which rose up from the beach with a large and wellstocked garden a mixture of grass and plants more used to warmer climates there was a tall tree to provide shade and under this we sat at a graceful metal table looking out over the sea which entertained with the roughness of the waves even though it was warm and still where we were here you see we can be quite certain that we will not be overheard she said as she nodded that i might pour her tea for her curiously there is not so much to tell once you leave out details that you would find sordid and unbecoming i will put it in your own language just as i took your approach i reinvested my profits and accumulated capital and then decided to diversify into a new area of operation how does that sound it sounds highly commendable even though it tells me nothing at all you know the early part i worked my way up the ladder of seniority amongst the officers in nancy where i made a great discovery which was that it was more profitable to be a mans mistress than a whore forgive my language men reward their mistresses and married men will go to considerable lengths to keep them quiet as they have only a limited amount of time to consort with people like me there is much time left over consequently i realised that i could be the exclusive mistress of one man on monday of another on tuesday a third on wednesday and so on as long as none knew of the others all would be well all of my shareholders as i call them agreed to keep me entirely and so i gained five times as much the majority of my earnings being pure profit as two were exceptionally generous i very soon accumulated enough to consider an independent existence enough for this no i have very little money at the moment all my earnings i have invested once more the jewels the clothes this villa the house in paris i survive on a diet of debt and donations but i no longer fear the gutter i am glad for you she nodded so you are still yes how to put this juggling clients how many four it is all that can be managed safely and i do find i like time to myself i reserve two or three days a week for relaxation and proper sociability and at present i am on holiday of a sort of a sort my other great discovery is that men are much more generous to women who do not need their generosity to put it another way generosity is relative to a womans social situation you for example lent me five thousand francs more than i asked for certainly and enough to transform my life but would you have thought you could have bought the countess elizabeth hadik barkoczy von futak uns szala for such a sum she who is known to be worth at least a million are you really i said known to be not that i am reputation is more important than reality mr cort i see and the answer to your question is no but then i very much doubt the idea of buying a countess would ever cross my mind then you are unlike many men for whom the more unattainable the prize the more they must have it m rouvier she held up a finger reprovingly i am happy to discuss things in general mr cort but the particular must remain my secret my apologies if my acquaintance of last night is correct then you are fast becoming the most unattainable woman in paris and hence the most expensive she said with a smile and that takes money staying in this house for a month entertaining lavishly costs a fortune but it also makes men more generous i find it difficult to believe that each interested party is unaware of the others of course they know of each other but each thinks he is in unique possession while the others are merely jealous i do not see how such an arrangement can endure without some mishap probably it cannot but i believe that in another year it will not matter i will have accumulated enough money to keep myself in comfort and so will have no more need of such arrangements i do not think that such a life can continue forever and there are few things worse than a middleaged trollop the words made her thoughtful and i sensed that they had also made her uncomfortable i hope you will not find me rude if i say you must leave now mr cort i have work to do this afternoon i rose to my feet and stammered slightly that naturally i quite understood she smiled no you misunderstand i told you i am on holiday i must attend the princess natalie a boring and remarkably stupid woman but i need her approval so she said brightly i must go and charm her or at least disguise my disdain please come and visit again she said as i prepared to leave i am giving a soirée tomorrow evening here at nine oclock you would be a welcome guest i am flattered but i would have thought i would want to keep you as far away as possible certainly not it is agreeable to find someone whose way of life is even more immoral than my own besides i think it would be best to keep an eye on you here and i like you it is strange how such a simple statement can cause an effect from her lips the sentence made a huge impact on me she did not like many people i suspected life had taught her few were likeable and fewer still were trustworthy yet she offered me both she managed to make the offer seem both generous and a privilege was that calculation if so part of the art lay in making it not seem so but to be rather something that came from the heart you think me foolish reading these words that i could be so bemused by the wiles of a former streetwalker well you are wrong and would accept that if you had met her when she was at the peak of her powers not that she was gentle or vulnerable herself however much she could appear to be so she had learned to survive to fight and never to give ground against a hostile world however soft and feminine she appeared she had a core that was as tough as steel no one knew her and certainly no one took advantage of her not twice anyway she came closer to trusting me than anyone in her acquaintance i hope i do not flatter myself by saying that i deserved it that it was not simply because she knew my secret as well as i knew hers although that was no doubt part of the reason i had had the opportunity of mistreating her and had declined it i had dealt with her fairly and had not abused my power over her i had treated her as her character deserved not as her condition allowed she was a woman of few loyalties but when they were conferred they were boundless chapter the soirée was a great event i could with only a touch of hyperbole say that it transformed my own position in france and at the same time added an important footnote to the history of the french courtesan for much of the day i took my ease reading the newspapers over my morning coffee going for a walk along the beach passing a few moments in conversation with recent acquaintances briefly encountered and then at lunch i had my meeting with wilkinson we ate together at a restaurant in the town and had a perfectly pleasant though entirely useless conversation he went on at great length about some rare bird he had spotted in the mountains and was so excited apparently it had not been seen since some legendary spanish ornithologist had recorded it in the s and wilkinson believed that he had won undying fame in the world of birdlovers as a result that he could talk of little else i told him about the coal which pleased him but he quickly went back to his birds once he had absorbed the information all he said was good good very pleasing he had no requests about anything else the government needed to know apparently i was beginning to be trusted to work that out for myself but it was pleasant enough and it saved me a good deal of weary memorandum writing later on so i was satisfied i also mentioned my remarkable meeting of the previous day for i was aching to tell someone and knew that wilkinson was about the only person in the world it was fair to confide in he after all had been partly responsible for virginie paying off her debts and launching herself on such a meteoric career besides i was proud of her and vain about my sagacity in spotting something that lefevre had entirely overlooked in that case i must meet her he said gaily and my heart sank a soirée you say excellent i will come with you i really dont i have long desired to meet her i feel as though i know her so very well i very much doubt she would want to meet you she does not know of our association i hope of course not in that case what possible objection could she have i would like to thank her and i think i know the best way to do it dont worry cort im not going to ruin your mascot quite the contrary she might at some stage prove very useful he would not be dissuaded and i heartily repented of my sudden garrulousness i should have kept absolutely silent but the levels of discretion i was forced to maintain were quite unnatural i am not by nature a gossip but all men need someone to talk to i had no one in france and the sudden appearance of wilkinson made me treat him with more trust than he should have received no harm came of it but i had nonetheless made a mistake which stemmed from youth and naïveté i never repeated it at nine in the evening i picked him up from his boarding house one which cost less per week than mine cost per night as he pointed out and was at least consoled to find him properly dressed i had feared he would arrive in tweed jacket and hiking boots but from somewhere or other he had acquired the necessary garb and although he was not a man who could ever look elegant he was at least perfectly presentable much to my surprise he was a brilliant performer for these sorts of occasions are little more than theatre whereas my style was to remain silent and listen wilkinson revealed an unsuspectedly ostentatious side to his character he spoke french loudly and badly with many gesticulations to make up for his grammatical eccentricities he told anecdotes of doubtful taste to old dowagers which had them gurgling with pleasure he leaped from topic to topic with gusto recounted tales of horses to horsemen birds to hunters and politics to politicians he was in fact a great success even more so when he left the party for half an hour and returned with the prince of wales i realised later that this was the whole point this was his thanks i should have realised that he would have known the prince who had arrived only the previous day and wilkinson was i am glad to say very much more dishonest than i had been his highness had not been told anything about who this countess really was he would never have been seen in public with such a person had the faintest whiff of scandal been attached to her name although whom he tolerated in private was as all the world knows a very different matter but he came and his arrival signalled to the whole of french society that elizabeth was utterly totally and completely respectable far more than that she could invite the most famous man in the world to her parties and he would come wilkinsons coup de théâtre propelled her into the stratospheres of european society whereas before she had managed much by her own efforts there were some who doubted her credentials if anyone doubted her after that it no longer mattered it was a generous gift as long as that was what it was even in those days and even on holiday the arrival of a figure such as the prince was a matter of some pomp and ceremony ordinarily the fact that he was coming would be talked about for days the hostess would make sure everyone knew about it however discreetly the news was put abroad guests would wait to see whether the great man would be delivered coaches and courtiers would drift in first to build up the excitement before he made his entrance would the prince come would he be in a good mood what would he wear such was the stuff of conversation as the clocks ticked away and there was also the equally exciting possibility that he wouldnt show up at all in which case the standing of the hostess would collapse the kindly would commiserate the less kindly would scent blood and all would depend on how she dealt with such a bitter public disappointment would it show or would she put on a brave face all these details were noticed and their sum total shifted the balance of power in the small but intense world of society so the princes entry to elizabeths soirée was absolutely sensational there was no warning no prior gossip or announcements he just strolled in greeted her like an old friend kissed her hand and then talked to her in a friendly respectful manner for a full fifteen minutes before circulating around the room as everyone else there slowly but with deliberation jockeyed for position to be next in line for a royal word elizabeth later told me she reckoned it had increased her value by some threequarters of a million francs and she probably underestimated it also worked wonders for my social standing as well for after her i received the most attention not much but i became instantly a person to know and a person who was known cort eh times yes your highness keep it up i will sir splendid and he gave me a huge wink to indicate that he knew exactly who i was but which was interpreted by all who saw it as communicating some personal intimacy charming woman he went on indicating elizabeth who was discreetly now leaving him to his business very charming hungarian isnt she yes i believe so hmm he looked momentarily confused as though he was mentally riffling through the almanach de gotha but was unable to find the page he sought lots of people in hungary i believe so sir well well its been a pleasure and he strode off to take his leave kissing elizabeths hand with all the fervent attention of the true connoisseur she was i must say quite brilliant and handled the situation with perfect balance there was no shock on her face at all though it must have been considerable she did not react with an unwarranted air of familiarity nor of surprise and delight she received him with charm leaving it to others to make of it what they would did she know him or not what was the cause of his arrival was she so intimate in his circle that she could regard his arrival as that of just another guest the shockwaves spread out across biarritz the next day princess natalie who had declined the invitation in order to keep elizabeth in her place was hard put to keep her grief to herself then across france and europe over the coming weeks as the season drew to an end and the temporary inhabitants of the town dispersed to their usual countries taking with them news of the new star that was an unusual thing to do i said to wilkinson as we travelled back to paris the next day he smiled the prince does love the demimonde and he does love beauty he said he knows oh good heavens no and if he ever discovered i would have a great deal of explaining to do if he ever realised i had knowingly then who does he think she is lesser aristocrat too low for inclusion in the almanach lack of birth made up for by her radiant beauty you told me she wasnt beautiful well she wasnt not when i first met her anyway it wasnt really my doing he invited me to dinner i said i was going to this soirée and he said he wanted to meet this woman hed heard of her you see and you know what hes like tell her by the way not to get any ideas if she goes anywhere near him ill put a stop to it i became quite indignant on her behalf you know quite well what i mean he said severely i know perfectly well how she makes her money it doesnt concern me as long as she confines herself to continentals the prince is a man with a weakness and he likes to visit paris is that why it struck me that it might be a useful insurance policy she is in our debt now and part of the price is no scandal sooner or later they would have met in paris and he is like a child in a sweetshop when it comes to women he really cannot resist certainly he would not have been able to resist her you have no idea how much time the embassy spends clearing up the mess from these affairs i want to stop this one in advance tell her that if you please very well besides he is notoriously stingy she will earn more from knowing him than from sleeping with him ill pass the message on chapter if i am spending a great deal of time digressing on the subject of this woman rather than recounting the excitement of life as a gatherer of intelligence for the british empire it is for two reasons the first is that she is relevant to my story the second is that she was very much more interesting than my daily routine for example on my return to paris i spent some considerable time putting the finishing touches to my investigation of french naval policy and that involved a good deal of time interviewing people in my capacity as journalist at the coal exchange and poring over daily lists of bulk coal trades fascinating exciting do you wish to hear more i thought not in fact i would even say that coal itself is a more interesting subject than the people who trade it each commodity and financial instrument attracts different sorts of people dealers in bonds are different from dealers in shares those who trade in commodities are different again and each commodity and each exchange rubber cotton wool coal iron ore has its own character coal is dull the people who buy and sell it duller still their world is black colourless and without pleasure the brash young men who are beginning to sell oil and create a whole new market out of nothing are much more interesting they have a touch of the desert about them while the coal dealers have infused the gloom of the picardy coal mines or the methodism of south wales and two days a week i traded on my own account perhaps i should describe this as it illustrates the true nature of espionage better than anything else can i rented a dingy little office in the rue rameau as soon as i arrived chosen carefully so that there were several possible exits and a clear view of the street below in both directions i had learned from arnsley drennan better than ever he realised it was bleak uncomfortable and cheap perfect for my needs then i registered myself as julius de bruyker importexport broker and under the name of that fictitious gentleman of uncertain low country origins i wrote to a young man at the german embassy who dabbled in intelligence matters a pleasant but not particularly bright fellow he came to see me and i offered him information about the forthcoming british naval exercises it was interesting although entirely safe information but he was delighted to get it more information followed the next week and the week after that until the point came when he began to wonder what i wanted nothing i said but any information he had acquired about french troop dispositions in north africa i would consider a reasonable payment such information was of no strategic interest to the germans so after a short period considering the matter they obliged next i contacted an officer at the russian embassy the austrian embassy and in the french intelligence services and offered all of them the same information all were keen enough and in return from the russians in due course i acquired information about a new french cannon from the austrians information about french and german diplomatic correspondence and the french gave me details of german armour plating when complete this information was passed on to john stones companies and helped make up for some of the inadequacies of british steel manufacturing and so it went on i really was a broker taking in information and selling it on the good thing about information is that unlike gold it can be duplicated one piece of information about shipbuilding in britain for example could be traded for information from half a dozen different sources and each of these could in turn multiply themselves many times over so i supplied information about the new vickers twelveinch gun and got in return detailed information about the german armys new howitzer the austrian armys requirement for horses the italian governments negotiating stance on north africa and the french governments real policy towards british domination of the upper nile details of the german howitzer were then traded for more information the beauty of the system was that no individual was ever asked to provide information which would damage their own country they were asked for material which on its own was harmless until blended with information from different sources or which affected the security of a foreign rival spies are bureaucrats by and large they have masters to satisfy and must take that into account as they go about their lives by supplying information i made their lives easier and so they regarded me as a useful person to do business with of course the utility of the system could only last as long as i had a monopoly of the method otherwise the same information would have started reappearing time and again for a very small amount of startup capital so to speak i began reaping handsome returns and do not think that the similarities between what i was doing and what elizabeth was doing escaped me we were both trading in specialised goods exploiting weaknesses in the market to sell the same thing to many different customers simultaneously success depended on each customer being unaware of the existence of the others that was the danger which faced both of us so in that period when i was trying to be fascinated by the coal exchange my only real entertainment was provided by elizabeth i was curious about her shareholders not for any prurient reason i hope but for the sake of information only accordingly when i returned to paris i had jules my friendly trained foot soldier station himself nearby to watch comings and goings a useful lad this jules he was the son of roger marchant an exsoldier with an incurable hostility to the discipline associated with either the army or any more normal paid work who was employed on a parttime basis by thomas barclay as you are going to do all the energetic work you must have roger to help you barclay begged although one look at the man who was swaying slightly when we were introduced forced me to say that i could not possibly deprive him of such a useful man it was not roger who was the main problem although absolute reliability was not his watchword but his wife and several children whose demands for sustenance far outstripped the poor mans ability to provide for them the pettycash box of the times was constantly being raided first by barclay and later by myself in a desperate attempt to get the wretched woman out of the office to which she resorted when she felt that death and starvation were only hours away roger was remarkably insouciant about it all the duties of family life did not as far as he could see necessarily involve feeding it it was a flash of genius on my part to solve the problem by employing their son to be my assistant thus guaranteeing a flow of income into the hands of the mother that could not be diverted into slaking the fathers thirst and securing for myself the services of one of the most useful people i have ever known i do not usually spend time discoursing on the character of sixteenyear olds but as young jules is now a grand man of influence throughout france and as i can claim some proud responsibility for this i feel i should divert my story a while to give a proper account of him he was as i have said the son the eldest son of a poor family the father a lazy drunkard of amiable disposition the mother a worrying fusspot living permanently in a haze of crisis and despair in one small room lived parents and five children some of whom were among the worstbehaved and most revolting infants i have ever encountered that they did not all end up in gaol or worse was largely due to the efforts of jules who took on the burdens of parenthood which properly belonged to others he was in fact an accomplished criminal by the age of twelve expert at filching fruit or vegetables from market stalls milk from dairies sausages and meat from delivery vans clothes from department stores he was also perfecting a good line in picking pockets until i persuaded him that this was an unwise career development very risky and for only uncertain gains i told him severely waving my wallet in his face and i understand that the penalties in france are exceptionally high for this sort of activity you are too young to spend the next few years in prison and on the whole it is better to avoid spending time there at all he was not entirely certain how to take my remarks i had after all just caught him with his hand in my pocket and had grabbed his wrist hard to make sure he did not escape he squealed in pain as he tried to wriggle free attracting the glances of passersby in the rue de richelieu along which i was walking after my luncheon i waited until he might realise that he was not going to get free of me and calmed down good i said when the noise subsided as far as i understand these things you should never ever work alone but need someone operating with you to distract the attention of the person whose wallet you admire secondly it is unwise to try and steal from a gentleman they are far more violent and unpleasant than ordinary working folk and do not hesitate to call the police you are only a man of property if you are good at keeping hold of that property thirdly like most welldressed men i keep very little cash in my wallet and much more in the bank if you want serious wealth i suggest you address your attentions over there i waved behind him at the façade of the crédit lyonnais just visible on the boulevard beyond he continued to eye me with ever more doubt and began to shuffle uneasily from foot to foot are you hungry you have a sort of pinched look about you perhaps you were stealing to buy yourself a good meal no he said scornfully i mean i am hungry but in that case young man you must allow me to offer you a good bowl of soup and bread the contents of this wallet were so nearly yours i feel such proximity to triumph should not go without recompense he looked at me with narrowed eyes once more but did not object when i led him still holding on to his wrist quite firmly up the stairs to a bouillon on the other side of the road it was still quite busy but there was no difficulty getting a table in the corner and i sat the boy against the wall so he could not make a run for it with any chance of getting away i ordered him a large bowl of onion soup and bread and water and watched with satisfaction as he ate i hope all this makes you realise that i am not inclined to call the police nor even to inform your father of your activities do you wish to be like him when you grow up i asked gently he looked at me with a wisdom and sadness beyond his years no he replied with a touch of steel in his voice and i wont be i pondered this as he ate his soup he was very hungry and ate with both noise and relish the offer of a second bowl was accepted with enthusiasm it is remarkable how much you can find out about someone in a short time and a few words the boy was courageous and defiant he knew loyalty even though its object was undeserving he was prepared to take responsibility to act where others might have sat and merely accepted their fate now listen to me i said seriously i have not paid to pour litres of soup into you for no reason i have been thinking and i have a proposal for you do you want to hear it he nodded cautiously can you write and count adequately i know you can read he nodded course i can good in which case you are well to leave school it has nothing else to offer you you need a proper job which i am offering you he gazed at me in that same steady fashion not reacting at all really just patient as you may know i am a journalist i dont like the english he remarked although without any personal animosity nor do you have to in my work i need messages sent letters delivered i will occasionally need other tasks done following people watching people without being seen perhaps even going into their houses and taking things he frowned you do that its an odd job journalism and no i do not you do do you have any objection he shook his head the pay will be adequate even generous that is to say about a hundred francs a month does that suit you he stared at me i knew it was almost as much as his father earned you will be punctual at all times start work when i say and finish when i say there will be no days off unless i say so he nodded you agree he nodded again i held out my hand then we must shake on it present yourself at my hotel tomorrow morning at eight he gripped my hand over the range of soup bowls and for the first time his face creased in a broad happy grin chapter jules did turn up the next morning and more or less from the moment he walked through the door he transformed my life i only ever had to tell him once about how to do any task or where something was to be put anything i requested he did speedily and well he was never late and was as tidy as i was messy on his own account he began teaching himself english by borrowing a copy of david copperfield and a dictionary and showed a considerable flair for the language when there was nothing for him to do he retired to a corner and read quietly when there was something to do he did it without questioning and so when the question of the countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szalas shareholders began to pique me i naturally dispatched jules to discover who they were as a test of his ingenuity i did not tell him how to go about it but rather let him discover for himself the best way of accomplishing the task it took him two weeks which on the whole was not bad going and at the end of that time he produced a list of four names i was impressed professionalism in any field is something to be admired and in a relatively short space of time elizabeth had captured a russian count attached to the embassy and a banker both married and of stupendous wealth in addition there was a composer of a progressive hue who made up for his limited financial success by the possession of a very wealthy wife while the last one was an heir that is to say the likely inheritor of a grand fortune with no personal merit of his own by the time elizabeth had finished with him the fortune was considerably smaller and that was before she had a reputation for knowing the prince of wales shortly after she got back to paris the composer was replaced she was quite ruthless in these matters with the finance minister in whose company i had met her at biarritz and a few months after that the heir his fortune now depleted was also cast aside each one of these made her wealthy all combined rapidly made her prodigiously so each one for example took on the entirety of the rent on her house paid for her servants and gave her generous gifts of jewellery which she kept in a safebox each piece labelled with the name of the giver so she would not wear the wrong piece when being visited fourfifths of her income after a portion of her debts were paid off was carefully banked by the time i received juless report i had met three of these characters at various evenings to which she had invited me and i must say that all of them behaved with such discretion that i would never have guessed the reasons for their presence each treated elizabeth with the utmost courtesy and respect and never gave the slightest hint of any untoward familiarity if any suspected the role of the others they again let no hint of it escape them but conversed in an easy and polite manner as to any other acquaintance in return she was absolutely discreet and never once caused them any embarrassment or awkwardness although some at least would have been happy had they been known to have conquered her each individual was of high personal worth i do not mean in financial terms although they obviously were that but in terms of character except for rouvier whose position struck me as a strange lapse of taste on her part wherever she had learned it elizabeth had the art of choosing well she gave them a sort of loyalty in addition to the other services she provided and they responded she invited about a dozen people every week all were men if elizabeth had a blind spot it was to have an almost total disregard for other women men excited in her no rivalry or jealousy women did so often and in violent terms i would not go so far as to say that she detested members of her own sex but she had no high opinion of them it must be said that many women returned this emotion in full force instinctively disliking suspecting or fearing her many would have been glad to bring her low it was her vulnerable spot all the more so because she was unaware of it a surprising weakness of perception in one who in all other matters saw so clearly after a month or so i was promoted to the inner circle of admirers who spent every thursday evening in her company i was never offered nor would i have accepted a role as one of her shareholders i didnt have enough money for one thing and besides i rather liked things the way they were she ordered her evenings well no subject was banned from discussion all she insisted on was that conversation was conducted in the most civilised of terms argument she allowed as the essence of conversation but any heat or emotion was utterly forbidden i have seen many a man conduct a business meeting with less skill than she ran her evenings she managed to persuade everyone who was invited that they were members of a special group unusually insightful witty and sagacious and that these qualities came in some mysterious fashion from being in her presence certainly i thought my own conversation far more sparkling on those evenings than at other times my jokes better my understanding of the world stage more profound and i was far more cautious than most of the other people there it was also genuinely interesting and enjoyable the routine was unvarying a supper of excellent food accompanied by the best wine which she spent much of the previous day choosing so that her chef could have all ready followed by conversation which lasted until eleventhirty at which point our hostess would rise and tell us quite simply that it was time to leave the evening would seem to be formless sometimes we would break up into small groups and discuss different subjects sometimes the conversation would involve all present elizabeth herself rarely gave her own opinion rather she questioned sometimes respectfully sometimes in fun making her views plain by her responses to the opinions of others only on the subject of literature did she give her own views and in these she demonstrated that in french russian and german she was remarkably well read this was you remember when russian soul and spirituality were all the rage in fashionable europe and everyone had to be able to quote huge chunks of anna karenina by heart of english elizabeth knew all but nothing at that time it has been said many times both that the french are the worlds most accomplished conversationalists and that the art of conversation is dying the former is true and if it is also the case that it has declined since the revolution then the conversation of the ancien régime must have been truly splendid i came to look forward to those evenings as the summit of my week my evening of pleasure after a week of often unprofitable labour in winter they would be held in the drawing room of the house she had taken in the rue montesquieu with dozens of candles and a fire adding a feeling of comfort to the conversation it was a large highceilinged room some fifty feet long and thirty wide on one side was a range of windows that gave on to a glassenclosed veranda filled with palm trees and birds on another a wide door opened into a smaller more intimate sitting room all around were china cameos and silver the walls hung with gobelins tapestries and paintings mainly italian and french much of this had come with the house which she rented from that marquis dalençon who was then living in mexico to escape the police but she had added her own touches and these had been chosen with care again where she learned discernment in such matters and how she avoided the vulgarity of her fellows i could not understand it sounds very artificial and in a way it was so artificial in the way that an opera or symphony is different from the cacophonous blaring of a music hall band some sneer at such meetings denouncing the formality and the lack of spontaneity they maintain that conviction is displayed best through loud voices and violent verbal assault that politeness ensures the triumph of the commonplace not so politeness i learned at her salon is a demanding discipline to convince others without recourse to the tricks of the demagogue or bully requires a high level of intelligence especially when the audience is learned and intelligent courtesy elevates thought to the highest level especially when the subject is contentious and the salons which were then the principal debating chambers of the french political financial and intellectual elites far more important than the chambre des deputés always insisted on courtesy above all other qualities that did not mean that the conversations were bland far from it frequently they were highly charged especially where i was concerned this was the period one of the many periods in which antienglish sentiment was running high in france and many would have been more than glad to see some sort of armed conflict to vent their frustrations at englands habitual superiority to convince me that my country was the main source of disorder in the world was a frequent aim and i was required on many occasions to justify my country to my friends for friends they became despite the differences between us take for example the opinions of jules lepautre deputy for caen for whom england and the english present company excepted cher monsieur were the embodiment of all evil we had not come to frances aid in and had positively encouraged germany to dismember the country had lured france into a disastrous commercial treaty with the sole purpose of wrecking its industries had bought the suez canal in order to strangle frances empire before it was even properly established were meddling in eastern europe and manoeuvring to exclude france from egypt i conceded many of these points but responded by asking what is to be done about it britain and france couldnt fight a war even if they wanted to why not because you can only have a war if both sides are fundamentally similar where are the two countries to fight and with what france i hope would never be foolish enough to have a naval war a small portion of the royal navy would suffice to eliminate all of the french navy in a few hours and why would britain wish to pit its army against frances that would be as unequal a struggle and even if we could invade i cannot see any advantage to it nor can i see any likelihood of france invading britain it has not succeeded in the past nine hundred years and i see little prospect of its fortunes changing in the near future so how is there to be a war much better to recognise the impossibility of it and then become friends ally frances army with britains navy and who could possibly stand against us i mention this conversation which began on a cold evening in late september not because of the wisdom of my remarks as there was little in them nor because they accurately reflected my views as they did not rather it was because of the intervention by abraham netscher then head of the banque de paris et des pays bas and an infrequent visitor to elizabeths house i think my two friends here are shadow boxing he said comfortably sipping from his glass of brandy he was a fine man tall and impressive in his stance with a highdomed forehead and a piercing stare in fact this was because he was shortsighted and was too vain to wear his glasses in company accordingly he had a tendency to peer at people and sometimes to stare a little above the right or left shoulder of the person he was addressing a habit which was remarkably disconcerting as it gave the impression always that he was talking to someone else in many people such vanity would be undignified but no one would ever have thought this of m netscher once they knew him a little he was a man of exceptional intelligence and allied this capacity to great wisdom and immense experience having lived through and prospered through several regimes and generations of politicians you are both defining the notion of war far too narrowly he remarked and in a fashion which if you will forgive me for saying so is remarkably oldfashioned for people who are so young netscher was somewhere near his seventieth year at this point but still had a good decade left before his failing powers obliged him to rest the marching of soldiers is usually to steal territory or money from the opponent but in this case as you say neither france nor england have any such designs on the other this is not because nations are any less greedy i fear but because wealth no longer lies in land or treasure france could perhaps invade and annexe all of cornwall or scotland and ireland and it would scarcely damage england in any way except in its pride its power lies in its accumulated wealth and that cannot be stolen by armies london is the centre of the world of money it is an empire on its own in fact the real empire only exists to serve the needs of london from the incessant movement of capital comes all of englands power but it is fragile this strength never in the whole of humanity has so much power been generated by such a feeble instrument the flow of capital and the generation of profit depend on confidence the belief that the word of a london banker is his bond on that evanescent assurance depends all industry all trade and the very empire itself a determined and sensible enemy would not waste his time and gold striking at the navy or invading the colonies he would aim to destroy the reputation of a handful of bankers in london then the power of england would dissolve like mist on a warm morning i think such an enemy would discover that it is more resilient than you say sir i suggested just because it is a power that cannot be touched or held does not mean that it is not real or strong the most enduring institution in the world is the church which depends on faith alone to survive and it has survived empire after empire for nearly two thousand years i would be quite content if the influence of the city of london lasted half as long that is true he conceded though with the pope locked in the vatican by italian troops and priests being expelled from schools across europe and the teaching of the church being challenged by historians and linguists and scientists across the world i do not find that you greatly strengthen your argument i doubt i will live long enough to see the last church close its doors forever but you may the old man piqued my interest i wondered for a moment whether he had even come that evening specifically to have that conversation with me but eventually dismissed the notion my secret life was unassailable i was sure no one connected me the associate of aristocrats and princes the dilettante journalist for the times with the occupant of the little office in the rue rameau who bought and sold information from diplomats soldiers and other spies nonetheless i dwelt on his words for several days and the more i considered them the more i believed that his words had reflected something he had heard or half heard could such an attempt succeed not in the way that m netscher said of course he was exaggerating there but it was certainly true that inflicting severe damage on the city of london would be more harmful than defeating englands army were it ever so foolish as to join battle with any other than halfarmed natives every week hundreds of millions of pounds flowed through london its banks and discount houses clearing houses and depositories the whole world raised its loans through the city the decision of a banker could determine the outcome of a war or whether that war would take place wars were fought on credit cut off the credit and the army must stop dead in its tracks as surely as if it had run out of food or ammunition attacking the reputation of the city could be relatively inexpensive and have no consequences if it failed but how could it be done i could not see it if it can be imagined it can be achieved was anyone doing the imagining i thought about it for several days then realised that mere thinking would accomplish nothing i had to do some work discovering anything by examining the career of m netscher was fruitless it turned out he had been around for such a long time that he knew absolutely everyone and heard everything there was no simple solution there so i had to go back over the last few years and discover who his enemies and rivals were this also produced nothing of any great interest such musings came over the following days however and that particular evening ended without anything else of interest i did however write a short report on the conversation and send it to wilkinson i was a good bureaucrat already and realised the importance passing on responsibility for things i could do nothing about thursday evening became part of my life something i looked forward to and enjoyed partly for the conversation but more for elizabeth whose presence i came to find oddly comforting i took pleasure in watching her in what was now her natural habitat so to speak the way she could conduct a gathering like a maestro discreetly and without ever imposing herself i watched with something close to affection as she relaxed ever more into her role became more sure of herself more adept at her profession in general i quite forgot what exactly that profession was it was impossible to think of her as anything other than that which she wished to be one evening though the salon ended differently she had been quiet unusually reserved all evening her admirers appeared to feel they had been given short weight ordinarily she would have risen to the challenge drawn them out calmed them down flattered and reassured this evening she seemed strained and almost ill at ease almost as though she wished they would go away and eventually they all did except for me she signalled quietly that she wished me to remain so i held back until we were alone the door shut to the world outside i wondered for a moment whether the evening was going to turn into a night of excitement but it rapidly became clear that she had for her a greater intimacy in mind i am afraid i feel ashamed of myself she said once we moved into the little salon which she kept for herself alone when i said i would not help you in your work i did not dream that i might need help and now i do i in contrast am delighted how can i be of service my diaries have disappeared and so has simon you keep a diary the face of arnsley drennan swam back into my mind at that moment his sneering mocking face as he congratulated me at least on not being stupid enough to keep a diary its your fault she continued reproachfully i began with those letters i wrote to you from nancy i enjoyed writing them and even after our association came to an end i kept on writing them but this time to myself only i dare have no intimates no real friends no family only myself and so it is to myself that i write you must be very lonely no she said of course not why should i be do you never wish for more i have never had a friend who has not betrayed me or whom i have not betrayed so i do not permit it i am your friend i think that merely poses the question will you betray me or shall i betray you first it will happen you know sooner or later it always does it is a cold world you live in which is why i must look after myself above all i honour my promises but must care for no one i dont believe you she shrugged it is not important at the moment i thought it was the most important thing of all but let it pass these letters to yourself then they contain details of all you have done everyone you have associated with what are we dealing with here how big are they large two volumes with about three hundred pages each in them and they are honest a true account of my life she smiled they deal with everything and everyone in very considerable detail it would cause severe embarrassment to many people frankly i do not care about that it is no more than they deserve but my life would be ruined as well and i presume it also says a great deal about my activities in france not that much i didnt begin them until after our arrangement came to an end but i think there is enough to get you into trouble if its any consolation i was very warm about you it isnt what should i do she asked you said simon has disappeared who is he my servant you remember he had many troubles with the law i employed him because well i thought that one day i might need such a person he was always loyal to me you found him in nancy no i have no contact with anyone from there he is a parisian his loyalty to you seems to have run out he knew about these diaries i thought not but i suppose he did i tried to digest all this unwelcome news well i said eventually the obvious thing to do and the easiest is nothing if these diaries are ever published you would be very much more famous notorious i should say than you are now i imagine they would become a great literary success she smiled but only weakly it is not a reputation i want besides far too much would not pass the censors if that is all there was i might see your point it is an age where any sort of debauchery is tolerated as long as it brings fame with it but i find i like being what i am now even if it is only an illusion i do not want to go back i have rarely felt as comfortable and contented as i did sitting in that room that may seem strange perhaps heartless but i must be honest on this point it was warm the lighting was soft the chair i was sitting on comfortable elizabeth dressed that evening in a simple costume of blue silk was as beautiful as ever i had seen her and her worry created a degree of intimacy between us that made even me regret my refusal of the offer she had once made and which i knew would never be repeated i could easily have spent the rest of the evening the whole night just talking of nothing and watching the fire flicker in the grate in my life i think only freddie campbell could induce such a feeling of comfort and safety in me of family almost or so i imagined although as i never had much of a family i cannot speak with authority on the subject assuming you are correct and that this simon stole your diaries it will be almost impossible to find him we will have to wait until he surfaces until then it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack it is easy to disappear in paris there are few things more simple in fact he has already surfaced she handed over an envelope this arrived today it is the only reason i went to my bureau and checked otherwise i might not have noticed anything amiss until sunday which is when i usually write up my week i studied the contents carefully it was an extract from a newspaper a funeral notice of a dr stauffer from the journal de lausanne no date nothing else at all no message no demand for money what does this mean she shook her head treating the question like a fly buzzing around her something she wanted to go away it clearly means something to you he was someone i knew who was kind to me once it is of no significance except to prove that simon has the diaries this was stuck into them he is trying to frighten me starting with harmless information making me nervous about what will come next will you help me i nodded if i can but you may have to pay heavily i will not recommend you pay blackmail that will merely encourage more demands a oneoff purchase is another thing though are you ready to pay high she nodded then i will try the first thing will be to make contact i will post someone outside your door just in case and you must let me know immediately you hear anything else thank you my friend it was a word which did not often pass her lips it sounded strange coming from her as though she did not really know what it meant chapter the next day i put jules onto the task time to earn your pay my boy you know the countess von futaks house jules nodded he should he had already spent more time than he wanted camped outside it back there again im afraid i want you to watch the gate someone may deliver a letter by hand i want to know who it is everyone who puts anything in the letterbox i want a full description times everything and no i said as i could see he was about to speak i will not tell you why if you are lucky it will only be for a day or so jules was lucky it took a few hours at lunchtime another letter was delivered and jules followed the man who dropped it quickly in the letterbox and hurried on the description was that of simon and jules tracked him all the way up to belleville where he was renting a room in a hotel for itinerants the letter i later learned was a demand for francs which was encouraging he was getting down to business and it seemed he was only after small change perhaps he did not appreciate exactly how valuable the diaries were or perhaps this was just the start jules and i had lunch in my room which he brought up from the kitchen the hotel did have running water in the rooms but not hot the manager had kindly fitted a gas pipe and a little heater for me because i had taken the rooms for a year on this i could brew my tea and heat up sufficient water for washing and shaving as the sanitary arrangements were somewhat limited that did not matter so much lavish use of eaudecologne covered a multitude of sins listen i said as jules set out the little table by the window i have another job for you how do you feel like travelling jules brightened how often have you been outside paris he thought never he said eventually never well i went to versailles once to find my father and did that experience of foreign climes create a desire for more not really a pity because i want you to go to lausanne in switzerland jules gaped i might as well have said i wanted him to go to the moon its time you saw the world a little i said you cant spend your entire life in paris it will take you a day to get there the same to get back and however long it takes to complete the job i want done i will give you money for the train ticket and board and lodging when you are there jules was looking decidedly uncomfortable he was a street urchin even if he was one with dreams the prospect of leaving his stamping ground the streets and passages he knew so well struck terror into his heart but brave lad that he was he recovered swiftly this i could see him saying to himself was necessary this he had to do i sympathised with his terror and pretended not to notice when in lausanne i want you to find out about a man called stauffer i know nothing about him except that he is dead start at the local paper ask for obituaries that sort of thing find out who he was about his wife children and relations especially children any unusual stories scandals or incidents anything at all really jules nodded hesitantly can i ask why no it doesnt matter why think of it simply as good practice for your life as a journalist in years to come what life dear boy you are made for it when you leave me as one day you no doubt will you will have to get a proper job you will be an excellent journalist and i will recommend you to an editor when you are ready you will have to start at the bottom after that it will be up to you whats the matter is there something else you want to do jules had sat down on the bed his face white with shock i dont know what to say he muttered eventually well if you dont want to do it of course i do he said looking up urgently of course i do excellent i replied thats settled then i suggest you spend your time on the train beginning to prepare yourself buy every single newspaper and read them all carefully the look of pleasure on his face as he bustled about helping himself to money from the drawer to fund his journey was worth the generosity in fact the idea had only just occurred to me and i had suggested it somewhat too hastily but it was a good one jules was a natural hence his current success and it invigorated him and made him even more diligent in my service i was his ticket to a new life and he was absolutely determined that it should not slip from his grasp he went off half an hour later to find his best clothes and set off for lausanne and then i put the whole matter out of my mind to concentrate on work recent developments in the french banking sector one of those wordy ponderous articles the times likes so much i have never understood who it thinks might read them i was following my hunch about the comments netscher had made and had briefly all but abandoned my other business branching out into banking was difficult as i had nothing to sell i wrote to wilkinson but did not expect a reply he never did if he could avoid it it was somewhat dispiriting i had a high opinion of my progress but i had not the slightest idea whether anyone had noticed so i contacted john stone the only other person in whom i could confide i dont know why i did this it was not my habit to go running to figures of authority when in difficulty but i felt the need to talk the question over with someone get an outside opinion so to speak he was staying at the hôtel du louvre he had a suite there more or less permanently reserved for him when he came to paris for business so i went to lunch with him although not in the public dining area i did not want it advertised that i associated with such people for their sake as well as my own it was a pleasant meeting much to my surprise as i had not greatly taken to him on our first encounter he told me how impressed he was by my progress how mr wilkinson was delighted and telling everyone in whitehall about his young prodigy for whom of course he modestly takes full credit stone added drily its very kind of you i said i didnt know anyone paid the slightest bit of attention to what i was doing goodness yes you are considered quite an oracle already of course there is still considerable opposition to the way you go about things but no one argues with success overmuch so tell me what can i do for you im not sure i dont know whether its anything at all it may be just a will o the wisp it was a passing comment i picked up at a dinner party at the countess von futaks salon you go to her salon ah yes well not often sometimes why oh no matter go on your comment so i told him about old abraham netscher and his musings on the vulnerability of the city of london it sounded very lame i see stone said when i had finished and you think that not really not seriously at least it occurred to me that it would be a remarkable coup to pull off if anyone dared try but i have no more than that to go on i know many people in banking stone said thoughtfully including netscher who is a fine man but i do not suppose anyone would tell me of such a scheme even if it existed i will listen with more care than usual and if you desire i will happily provide you with some introductions that is kind of you he waved it aside now tell me of this countess he said why she is the talk of paris i would like to know why i described her as best i could the official version that is and described her coup i attributed it to her rather than to wilkinson in biarritz with the prince of wales i noticed i was jealous of her reputation and wanted to keep my knowledge of her entirely to myself you know no more than that stone said curious for the first time in our acquaintance do you she is a hungarian countess who decided to travel when her husband died i think her family disapproved of her marriage and she was disinclined to forgive them when he died i met her some months ago and like you found her quite charming he nodded thoughtfully i am giving a small dinner for friends in four days time he said abruptly would you care to join me there will be a couple of people whom you might wish to know that is kind and would you do me the great service of escorting the countess to the restaurant for me i am afraid i have meetings all day and cannot be sure when they will end although she likes to be late she very much disapproves of other people keeping her waiting with pleasure i said without the slightest hesitation to betray my surprise it was not that he had invited her nor that she had apparently accepted it was the uncomfortable almost schoolboyish bashfulness on his face which astonished me chapter escorting a woman like elizabeth to a dinner is something everyone really should do at least once in their lives i had only once glimpsed her properly in her public role in biarritz this was very different i arrived with a carriage at eight as required having spent the afternoon preparing myself in a way which was quite unaccustomed i was i believe perfectly elegant or as elegant as i can be dressing up formally has never been my favourite occupation and i am quite prepared to admit that i have no sense of style whatsoever but i looked decent enough by the end or so i thought i seemed to have spent hours brushing my clothes and wrestling with collar studs and cravat i even had to get the bar owners wife to come up and help me eventually i could take no more if my cravat was squint my coat still a little dusty so be it however proud i was of my appearance my sense of personal presence dimmed to nothing when elizabeth descended the stairs as i waited to collect her she was breathtaking her hair up to reveal her long white neck wearing a dress of such beauty that i could not understand how it might have been imagined let alone made i should explain here that she was something of a revolutionary in the matter of dress fashion she studied as assiduously as a stockbroker studies share prices or a gambler the form of horses she was not simply at the height of fashion dear me no she defined it and in so doing created for herself an evanescent power which propelled her to a central role in the workings of society she was one of those few and remarkable people whose choices told other people what they should wear and in a particular way determined what beauty and elegance were she was in other words entirely professional and serious about her business and made it seem natural easy and thoughtless she always went for grey when she really wanted to impress and that evening wore silvergrey silk edged with pearls hundreds of them cut almost obscenely low sleeveless with long gloves in a slightly darker shade the dress itself clung close to her body outrageously so considering the fashion of a mere nine months earlier and it was darted with extraordinarily intricate embroidery the whole was completed with a tight necklace of alternating pearls and diamonds five strands thick a delicate matching tiara and a painted louis xv fan madame you are exquisite i said and meant every word i do believe i am she said with a smile shall we go and so we did to lapérouse on the left bank a restaurant which was fashionable enough but not the sort of place that the great courtesans of paris normally attended maxims was and still is the favourite haunt of such people lapérouse was for politicians and literati with a high seriousness quite at odds with the gaudy frivolity which characterised the demimonde i didnt realise you knew john stone i said as the carriage trundled along the champs elysées it was already long since dark and i could only dimly see her face even though i was sitting only a foot away and opposite her you must realise by now that i know a great many people she said i met mr stone on a train journey i had taken a trip to vienna to your family no doubt just so in fact i was taken there by a shareholder who then went on to the far east so i was alone and mr stone was coming back from somewhere in the balkans it is a long and dull voyage unless you are enamoured of trains so we entertained each other i found him very civil and gentlemanly i was desperate to ask but restrained myself no she said pardon the answer to the question you are trying not to ask oh i like his company as i do yours of my life he knows only what i have told him which is little i very much hope it will stay that way if it does not it will not be my doing i know that have you made any i know where simon is living and plan to visit him shortly i said if he is reasonable that is if he is conventionally venal the matter should be wrapped up soon enough thank you she said it simply almost proudly but it meant much to me then the coach slowed and we arrived at the restaurant elizabeths whole bearing changed she transformed herself transfigured i might say before my eyes she was about to step onto her stage if there were any lingering insecurities still within her she did not show them in the slightest nor did she let slip even a hint of the immense strain she was under because of her diaries she was magnificent carefree delightful every single man in the room stone had rented one of the private dining suites fell under her power within seconds without her having to do anything at all except breathe she was charming intelligent witty serious as required never coquettish that would have been inappropriate but always warm and thoughtful in manner she even managed to restrain her distaste for the other women there to them she was polite and it only came through once that she regarded their presence as a waste of space why would anyone need more than one woman in the room when she was that woman she made the dinner party which was vibrant glittering as a result instead of the rather dull dinner of businessmen it would otherwise have been stone was not a natural host and i could not see what the point of the occasion was as far as he was concerned he provided a setting in which elizabeth could shine and she took the opportunity to do so performing the role without a fault or false step i found myself sitting at the end of the table between the wife of a banker and a senior stockbroker from petiet kramstein then one of the betterbottomed undertakings at the bourse the one was amusing the other useful madame kollwitz was immunised from any possibility of jealousy or envy by the fact that she was stout about fiftyfive years old and had never been beautiful this allowed her abundant good humour and perception to come to the fore and you have to talk to me when you would rather be in orbit around the sun she said with a twinkle in her eye once we had disposed of the usual preliminaries certainly not i began robustly oh of course you do who would not she is very lovely and by all accounts quite sweet is that not the case i believe she is very pleasant a woman whom all men love a terrible fate for any young girl i think still im sure she can look after herself tell me how truly besotted is mr stone with her do you know i didnt realise you are most unobservant for a journalist she commented she has been with him to the opera twice in the past fortnight and it is reliably reported that both of them detest the opera each goes to please the other do you think someone should tell them that they are inflicting mutual torture for no good reason i do not intend to no still it would be a prize would it not another insult to france from our enemy to have our most glittering jewel carried off i dont think oh look at him she said scornfully brushing my doubts aside if you make allowances for the fact that he has not the slightest idea how to woo or seduce a woman look at the way he is talking to her admittedly he may be telling her all about profit ratios on machinegun manufacture but look at the way his head turns towards her look at his eyes and look how easily she deals with it as well not rejecting but not encouraging either poor man it could cost him a pretty penny before all is over i beg your pardon have you never wondered where all these diamonds come from dear boy no i said with i hope a credible tone of surprise in my voice i assumed she was rich she looked at me pityingly well um fortunately my attention was taken over by the stockbroker on my right whose conversation was less fascinating but more useful we established our mutual credentials with me stressing my current labours writing on developments in french banking the evolution of the capital markets the poor state of the french bourse in comparison to vibrancy of the london stock market he was surprised that a journalist should be so interested in such things for example i said french banks have never taken up the opportunities of empire i would have thought the possibility of loans to your colonies would have stimulated immense activity in the capital markets yet i see very little monsieur steinberg nodded we are risk averse here he said there have been too many disasters for people to trust the credit markets and it is all a question of trust not at the moment something our colleagues in london have to worry about the banks in london succeed in the most outrageous operations because people think they will succeed they have a centurys worth of trust to call on but they do abuse that trust sometimes it will rebound on them and maybe sooner than they think really why is that well he said leaning forward just a little there are strange stories going around you know about barings dear me what are they up to now a good question i hear barings may be having surprising difficulty getting takers for an argentinian loan it is floating thats not so unusual its part of the negotiating process is it not besides with argentina in the state its in this is a bit more serious i think credit international so i heard is about to refuse outright to take any of the issue at all which is illmannered of them what loan is this buenos aires water supply per cent and the reasoning argentine government is falling to bits finance minister out on his ear too much debt fiscal policy in ruins the usual sort of thing but that has been known for some time and it has never deterred anyone before the question is whether anyone will follow credit international or whether the magic of barings will sweep all doubts away once more but i have never heard of anyone even hesitating before nor had i nor had i heard of a bank making public even if discreetly its doubts about taking part in a barings operation as m steinberg said it was illmannered and generally when dealing with barings a refusal was generally taken to indicate a weakness of the bank which refused i find this fascinating i said just the sort of thing that would interest times readers very much do you think the chairman of credit international would talk to me m steinberg looked shocked at the very idea there must be some way of finding out more i said will you help me i would be greatly in your debt i had realised that as a practitioner of espionage asking for assistance is often the most effective way of going about your job again tales of adventure tend to give a false picture of deceit and subterfuge of clever stratagems and cunning manipulations i hope it is clear from my account so far that in contrast the most effective weapons in the arsenal of intelligence are money and goodwill if you cannot buy what you want ask for it if you ask the right person it produces the right response in nearly all cases of importance m steinberg for example was delighted to help why should he not be he wanted to know what was going on as much as i did and as long as i promised to share with him any discoveries i might make he was more than willing to guide me in the right direction within a few minutes i had the name of a senior figure at credit international the information that he had a great weakness for horseracing and so could be found at longchamp whenever there was a race on as well as names in other banks which in the past had taken part in barings issues i had a day at the races to look forward to and a feeling that i was at last beginning to make headway i relaxed and began to enjoy the dinner for its own sake rather than for professional reasons it was in fact an excellent occasion largely because of the way elizabeth conducted the proceedings there was no doubt whatsoever that although stone was paying it was no longer his dinner party he was her guest as much as i was not that he seemed to mind this he was a perfectly agreeable conversationalist if a little serious when alone but he shrank in company giving short and gruff replies incapable of addressing the whole table but rather fixing his attention on one person at a time i could see the effort involved in not giving his entire attention to the woman next to him every time the conversation flagged a little he naturally tended to look back towards her waiting for her lead madame kollwitz was right he was more than a little taken i did not know whether she had any vacancies but if there was one stone looked as though he would pay a great deal to get on the list but did she like him enough she was gay amusing friendly warm but she could be so even to people she detested when required when the dinner finally came to its end and the party prepared to disperse one of the guests a doctor i had not talked to mentioned he had been invited to an entertainment and asked if anyone wished to come along a séance he said with a laugh tableturning spirits madame boninska she is said to be very good i will come said elizabeth why not would you like to take me mr stone she asked playfully so we can find out all your secrets the reaction from stone was remarkable no he snapped and you will not go either elizabeth just managed to control a look of fury that passed over her face like a stormcloud before it burst i beg your pardon there was ice in her voice i had known her for long enough to want to signal to stone that he would be well advised to drop the matter and quickly he however was entirely impervious to tonal subtleties and equally incapable of reading the expression on her face maybe he just didnt know her well enough it is charlatanry rubbish for fools only any sensible person i have seen what these people do to those of a weak or susceptible nature and which am i a fool or weak elizabeth asked haughtily if you believe in such things both really yes dont expect me to pander to your desire for fashionable amusements and what does it have to do with you you invited me i believe mr cort said the wife of the banker who had talked to me earlier taking me by the arm and leading me away would you do me the great honour of accompanying me home my husband has decided to abandon me and go back to his office so i am quite alone and in need of an escort i would be honoured i said relieved was the more appropriate word i think i did not want to witness a fight between stone and elizabeth well i did of course it was fascinating but i realised it would be safer to be out of range neither i suspected would give way easily and both could be unpleasant when their authority was questioned they were behaving in a way which was unseemly embarrassing and elizabeth was neither of these stone had penetrated to a part of her which was never ever on public view and forced it into the open he had exposed her and therefore weakened her he would not be easily forgiven i left them as swiftly as possible not that either was minded to notice facing each other and in the most polite way possible preparing for a battle to the death i thought i would extricate you madame kollwitz said after we had got into her carriage and lumbered off along the seine i am in fact quite capable of finding my own way home i have done so on many occasions but you were staring in a way which was quite impolite you know i suppose i was i said i think that will be the end of it though she sighed pityingly what have i said now do you think a woman like that would ever fight with someone she cared nothing for but hes well hes a lot older than she is besides shes not well not the type to we shall see who knows she may have met her match this time mr stone does not behave like a lapdog when he is around her unlike m rouvier for example i almost think it is her duty to skin him alive although i never thought he would be quite so foolish what do you mean the finance minister of course isnt he married she laughed again of course hes married what i mean is that he is not rich and rumour has it he gives her fifty thousand a month what are you really this naïve i think i must be i said very convincingly i believe for the pitying scornful look came back to her face im sure none of it can be true well she said patting me on the hand thats very sweet of you but if it was i mean where does he get it from rouvier that is she shrugged ive no idea where might the minister of finance get money from difficult one to answer isnt it is there anything you dont know i know nothing about you young man but then maybe youre not very interesting perhaps there is nothing to know i dont think there is everyone in paris has a secret and thinks it is theirs alone even my husband thinks i believe him when he says he is going back to the office for an hour she said it lightly but turned her head to look out of the window as she spoke stick to journalism mr cort where you never have to understand anything or you will find that paris is a cruel and pitiless place and tell that to our mysterious countess as well her novelty is wearing off and many people will take too much pleasure in seeing her fall i left her at the door to her apartment block her words echoing in my ears it was late and i had work to do the next morning i wanted a good nights sleep chapter i took a gun with me when i went to visit simon in belleville i have mentioned that i did not like them i still do not but at that stage i could not call on anyone to assist me in such matters and simon was i recalled a very big man i was much more nimble and i thought probably more skilled but if i do have to fight i prefer the outcome to be beyond all doubt on such occasions there is little virtue in only just winning the meeting in fact was quite simple simon was totally unskilled in subterfuge all he had done was rent the room under an assumed name that was the extent of his precautions it was a simple matter to wait until i was sure he was at home then go up the stairs and walk in it was a dingy boarding house unlit and rundown which let out rooms to day labourers and itinerants with few questions asked a place of hopelessness and despair cold and depressing because of the time of day it was all but deserted only the concierge was there on the ground floor and simons room was at the very top of the building well out of earshot i would not be disturbed good morning simon i trust you are well the countess has been worrying about you you really shouldnt have run off like that you know not without giving her proper notice he stared at me in shock too dimwitted to understand how easy it had been to find him my sudden appearance at his door in itself was almost enough to win the battle he was unnerved from the start and wisely or not decided the best response was to say nothing at all all he could manage however was a look of bovine incomprehension that made him look so stupid it was hard not to burst out laughing may i sit down i did not wait for an answer but occupied the only chair in the room a rickety thing which felt very insecure to make a small point i took out the gun and placed it on the table not touching it but making sure it was pointing in his direction the countess is concerned you were not paid your last weeks wages i said so she asked me to pay a visit and make sure you are well he briefly seemed to think that he might be off the hook despite the gun then even he realised that there was more to come and she was concerned that you may have inadvertently taken some of her possessions she wants them back i didnt take anything he had a low oddly wellspoken voice it almost sounded as though it came from a different person entirely now simon we both know that is not so i have come to take these things back in return i will pay you the wages you are owed he shrugged his confidence returning i have nothing what are you going to do call the police i considered no i think not you know as well as i do that would be a bad idea youre out of luck then no i will shoot you i picked up the gun and made a show of checking it was loaded knees first elbows second where do you want to start i editorialise i was not calm as i said all this i was sweating profusely and i only just kept my voice from shaking that may have helped it did much i believe to convince him that i was serious a nervous man with a gun is much more dangerous than a calm reasonable one simon was not overly intelligent but he was good at calculating his position he had nothing to gain from resisting only stubborn pride might have stopped him from falling in with my wishes where are those diaries i said i dont have them but you stole them shes no countess of course she isnt i replied evenly shes just a whore you dont really think that anyone will pay for that do you where are they oh theres more theres much more than that he jeered at me theres a lot about her you dont know no doubt but i cant say it bothers me where are they he grinned i told you i dont have them who does a man friend of mine a good friend hes looking after them for me oh really it was late i was tired i sighed with exasperation and picked up the gun who is he i repeated ten thousand he said defiantly just to tell me where they are you must think im a fool its worth that to you mr cort he said ive been reading about you as well that was a mistake i picked up the gun thought for a moment then shot him in the leg the way i had been taught simon collapsed onto the floor gripping his thigh and screaming i stuffed a piece of cloth into his mouth and held him down until he stopped avoiding the spreading pool of blood flowing across the floor as much as possible i was now entirely calm who is he i said once more it took a long time to get it out of him but what he eventually said made my heart sink arnsley drennan was back in my life a man calling himself lefevre he said fifties fair hair thin scar on his face he had met him in a bar theyd talked hed offered to help hed been very persuasive i sat down on the chair again oblivious to his moaning this was bad news an opportunist thief turned blackmailer like simon was a simple problem arnsley drennan was another thing entirely a much more formidable challenge where is he again it took a long time to get a coherent answer i dont know i really dont he moaned as i raised the gun in warning i told you i met him in a bar it was the bar where drennan had taken me once it was too much to hope he still occupied the same room but it would be worth trying i looked at simon doubt in my mind he might tell drennan of my visit he knew a very great deal about elizabeth and about me the building was quiet as i walked down the stairs and into the street a few minutes later no one paid any attention to the second shot either i spent the rest of the day looking for drennan but without success he had long since quitted the rooms where i had first met him this was the only other thing i learned but i was not by then at my most effective i was in a state of shock i think i have made it clear that i am not a man of action i do not like violence it offends me what i had done terrified me once it all sank in even though i tried hard not to think of the scene in that dingy room the last look on simons face my lack of emotion was the most frightening of all i had not hesitated had not tried to find a way around the problem had not considered other possibilities simon had been in the way a problem a threat he was no longer i felt no remorse and i should have done i was not the person i had thought myself to be i slept that night as well as if i had spent the evening dining in company with not a care in the world chapter the next morning as i went downstairs to the bar for a coffee and some bread the bar keeper who was also my landlord handed me an envelope i ignored it for a while until enough coffee had been absorbed into my system to make me human once again and only opened it when i felt sure that i would be able to read it through without my attention wandering it was from jules dear mr cort as you will see i am writing this to you from lyon and i apologise for taking so long about the task you have given me and for spending so much of your money i wished to see the job properly to an end i hope you do not mind as you instructed i went to lausanne which took a very long time but then had difficulty finding out about dr stauffer he was in none of the directories to be found in the town library even though these were completely up to date i did eventually come across the name in a listing that was some four years old i send it enclosed and hope you do not mind that i tore it out of the library book i know i am not meant to do that sort of thing i then went to the house which is occupied by someone completely different dr stauffer died some three years ago it seems it took some time before i could find out what he died of and it appears that he hanged himself and was buried in the municipal cemetery outside the town a woman in a flower shop told me the story dr stauffer had never recovered from the murder of his wife she said and eventually found life too much the newspapers told me a little more when i read them in the library he died in and madame stauffer was murdered in according to the newspapers she was killed by a servant called elizabeth lemercier she had been taken in by the family and had been showered with every kindness but it seems she had a naturally criminal temper and turned on her mistress stabbing her to death with a knife from the kitchen she then fled and was never seen again but i came across a report that she had been sighted in lyon which is why i am now here trying to discover the truth i hope you do not consider i am going beyond your instructions i found a woman who had worked in the stauffer family it took some time and a lot of your money but eventually she talked to me i had to tell her that i was an assistant reporter on the times i added that i would be dismissed from my job if i did not produce the information you needed as you were a horrid man and this made her more helpful i apologise for this she told me the newspapers had left out quite a lot of the story to spare what little remained of dr stauffers reputation she said the servant lemercier had seduced the doctor that he had given her expensive presents and that the wife had eventually found out when madame stauffer confronted them and threatened to report the girl apparently you can be sent to gaol or an asylum for such behaviour here she lashed out with the knife and fled the town collectively concluded that dr stauffer was in the wrong to conduct such an affair in the family home although i think what they meant was that he was wrong to have it discovered and so concluded that he could not be invited for dinner any more it was this neglect which caused him eventually to hang himself the report that lemercier had fled to lyon was not as far as i can tell based on anything solid the idea came from the fact that a citizen of lausanne was found dead in an inexpensive hotel in the city and because he had been a friend of the stauffer family i believe that the journalist who wrote the story may have exaggerated in order to make his report more interesting however now i am here i can tell you that the hotel in which the man a mr franz wichmann who died aged fortysix was found does seem to be a house of illrepute this was not part of the newspaper report here i must apologise for the way in which i was forced to spend some of your money sir i do hope you will forgive me but i went to this hotel all unknowing and it was not until i was inside that i began to realise what sort of place it was by then the woman who runs it had demanded money of me and i had paid her thinking that i was renting a room it was only when i was asked to choose a girl that i realised my mistake i looked up and grinned truly jules was a very poor liar but i had a sneaking admiration for his cheek naturally i was horrified but i decided to disguise my shock in order to be able to ask questions so i told the old woman that i wished to wait and asked to talk a bit she took this to be a sign of nervousness and i was really not very comfortable and got one of the girls to join me i will not go into the details if you do not mind but we talked for some time she was really very nice and she remembered the death of mr wichmann very well not surprisingly perhaps as the house was closed down by the police for a while and all the people who worked there had to find their work on the streets which they do not like very much the girl involved was called virginie none of them have second names but she knew little else about her they do not talk very much about their lives it seems mr wichmann was not a regular visitor he came once and went with one of the girls and apparently glimpsed virginie as he left he was found the next morning in his room dead with a knife wound through his heart virginie had vanished at least this is what that girl said the girl virginie was never seen again and i do not think the police looked very hard for her she was by all accounts quiet and very well behaved she associated little with her colleagues but preferred to sit and read while waiting for a client she was not very popular with them as they gained the impression she considered herself better than they were i hope mr cort that you do not consider that i have wasted my time and your money in finding all this out and that you approve of my efforts i will take the train back tomorrow morning i burned the letter once i had read it carefully i do not keep stray pieces of paper around if they are not needed then i sat and thought the connection from elizabeth lemercier to virginie to countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szala was easy for me to see and if all of this or enough of this was in the diary elizabeth was correct to be worried if jules had got the story right then she could face the guillotine but there was no time to do anything today nor anything to do i had to wait for drennan to resurface i was dependent on him still i thought about the problem carefully as i made my way to longchamp after lunch i was not looking forward to it i hate horseracing i have never seen the point of it horses i like i used to go riding quite often when i stayed with the campbells in scotland in my youth and there are few finer experiences than getting up on a good horse at dawn and riding off over the moors the beasts have their own personalities they really can become your friend if you know how to deal with them but racing around a course with thousands of overdressed pampered spectators shouting them on the animals are so much more worthy than the people who generally have little interest in the horses at all they are there to be there to be seen and to waste money my day at longchamp was not for pleasure i had a frantic morning gathering more information on françois hubert than m steinberg had been able to give me and i was still in a state of shock over my encounter with simon it had deeply disturbed me i did not see what else i could have done but the ease with which i came to that conclusion and acted on it i found unsettling in the extreme so with françois hubert i was sloppy i allowed myself to pay far too much for trivial information gave away too much because i was in a hurry and overtired my efforts at least produced enough to make me confident of success m hubert was the head of the bonds department at credit international it was he who oversaw the banks participation in loan issues who determined what stake they would take all very well most large banks now have such people and they are growing in importance that in itself was not a great deal of use more important was the information that m hubert liked gambling far too much for a man in his position and that he liked a whole succession of women more than a married man should put those together and you had a picture of someone deeply in debt and naturally you begin to wonder where the money was coming from such a person can be persuaded to answer questions with no great difficulty there was of course the problem of finding him i had read my zola and remembered well the scene in nana the description of the vast crowds the innumerable carriages from fiacres to hay wagons the masses the bourgeoisie the gratin all in their different costumes with their different manners milling about and brought together by the desire to gamble i anticipated difficulties saw myself pushing through the throngs and never even glimpsing my quarry i had considered asking elizabeth to come with me so i could tell her about simon at the same time as i looked not that she would have accepted the idea had a certain charm she was the nana of her age but very much more sophisticated and selfassured not for her the fate of zolas whore who was created solely so that her fall could be charted to prove the cruelty of human life elizabeth had dedicated herself to proving the opposite that the individual could triumph that fate is not determined i wished her well and i worried about the warning given to me by madame kollwitz and about those diaries and about drennan but elizabeth hated horses she had told me once and disliked gambling she did not take chances that was her main characteristic she was no nana consuming men for the sake of it reducing them to poverty or suicide because she could she belonged to a different generation the age of business she bought and sold and built up her capital cleareyed and certainly more intelligent than zolas creation and certainly less likely to die alone in a hotel room elizabeth did not intend to burn brightly and die young in fact the problem of finding m hubert was very much smaller than i had anticipated zola who can never resist the gaudy and vulgar described one of the great events of the racing year which attracted the multitudes for the most part though longchamp was very much more homespun the daily events attracted only the truly dedicated or the truly possessed some of the horses looked as though they would rather be living out their old age in a pleasant meadow somewhere and at least three of the jockeys might have done better by their employers had they eaten a good deal less all in all the atmosphere was more like a village fête than a great racecourse the crowd numbered a few hundred and the bookies had turned up out of duty rather than because of any prospect of making serious money the great refreshment areas were all closed the stands were empty there was no buzz of anticipation indeed the air was rather a melancholy one the spectators knowing they were not going to be greatly excited and realising all too well that they were there simply because they could not stay away nor was it even an agreeable day with a warm sun to provide some compensation for the lack of other pleasures instead the sky was low and grey and threatened rain at any moment the wind had a chill in it which made me regret not having brought my thicker winter coat for the most part the crowd was of the shopkeeper class with an air of desperation to their neatness faces which were never quite right too pinched too ruddy their voices too loud or too quiet i observed them all swiftly and dismissed them just as fast only one man could possibly have been a senior employee of credit international and he stood alone studying his racing card with the calm of the professional showing no emotion or interest in what he was doing he was utterly unremarkable had there been a greater crowd i would have stood no chance whatsoever of finding him i watched as he approached a bookie paid over some money heaved a great sigh and then retreated though not to watch the race his interest was abstract it seemed as though he could spend the entire afternoon there without bothering to look at a single horse he was obsessed with numbers not with the sport i followed him as he walked away from the track hands behind his back with a slow purposeless gait then walked up behind him and coughed monsieur hubert he turned round to look at me but did not smile or give any reaction he didnt even seem curious forgive me for interrupting you i said my name is cort from the times in london i would like to ask you some questions if i may hubert looked puzzled i am sure you may not he replied although i cannot think what you might want to ask it is about argentinian water hubert looked very cautious at my question i have nothing to tell you whatsoever it would be utterly inappropriate i assure you that your name will never be mentioned that is of no significance please leave me in peace however if i am unable to write this story i might have to write another one about amelie feltmann your debts things like that he stared at me in total shock this i thought was simply too easy the man was pathetic he could at least put up more of a struggle i wasnt even going to have to pay him oh dear god he said with a tremble in his voice who are you as i say i work for the times i am writing an article on french banking and i want to know everything i mean everything about the argentinian bond issue you are going to tell me i had expected a few moments of bargaining at least but instead he just crumpled up hands shaking i knew something like this would happen sooner or later he said i just knew it well you were right i replied brutally it has so just count yourself lucky that all i want is harmless information nothing else he glanced around him somewhat in the way you might if you felt your employer could be hovering nearby watching and listening come and take a little stroll i said i do not think there is anyone who will see you talking to me and i will never reveal anything at all word of a journalist if you doubt my honour he sighed heavily and gave in the surrender was complete and i could see that he would now tell me anything i asked him my opinion of him was not high i would have thought better of him had he tried to run or hit me first so lets begin the argentinian loan why is your bank not participating was that your decision oh no not me i am not sufficiently senior to decide a thing like that i would never dare defy barings on my own authority i arrange the practicalities of taking up a subscription i do not decide what we subscribe to so who does decide normally there is a committee which evaluates each issue in this case it was a decision taken by the chairman alone and that is unusual that is unheard of how did it happen he looked around nervously once more i was told to write a letter refusing to take part and also instructed to give no reasons why this decision had been taken again this is unusual it is normally a matter of courtesy to give an explanation even if it is informal and again it was the chairman who gave you these instructions yes he summoned me personally i asked why as in the past barings business has been very profitable all he said was that this time no one was going to take part not a single institution in france was going to touch it why not exactly what i asked was there something wrong with it i asked but no he said there was nothing particularly wrong with it that was why barings was going to get such a shock and more than barings he said and what did he mean by that he said no more but it puzzled me as i can see it puzzles you so i listened you see and asked questions of my colleagues at other banks and do you know what i discovered he was positively voluble now willing to tell me things i hadnt even asked ive no idea it was true all the big banks in france will refuse to take any barings paper not only that i know of two banks in belgium and one in russia which will also turn it down how much is this issue in all about five million pounds a very great deal of money but no more than many south american issues and with better prospects than many of course you can argue that too much money has been put into argentina and i would sympathise with that view sooner or later the markets will have had enough but if you want to reduce your liability then this is a foolish way of going about it why so i knew the answer to that already but also knew that the more he told me the more he would tell me he hadnt even noticed i wasnt taking any notes because we hold a substantial amount of south american bonds and our customers have bought more off us a failure could panic the whole sector and drive down prices across the board we could lose a great deal of money it would be much more sensible to sell off stock first and that has not been done there has been some selling but not enough if south american bonds collapsed then french institutions would lose money that was true but nowhere near as much as english ones would lose of all the bonds sold in the past decade since barings discovered south america at least half the value had been sold in england the rest had to be spread across europe and north america i could not call the figures to mind although it was obvious that it would send a shockwave through the markets but nothing that the city could not cope with the american railroad collapse had been just as severe but had been surmounted without much difficulty and the effect would run right the way across the continent why would banks connive at conjuring up losses unnecessarily as m hubert said there were much more sensible ways of getting out of markets you feared might be nearing their peak bringing them down while you were still fully exposed was foolish to say the least but he could tell me no more he confined his interests to bond issues horses and his lover he could give no reasons nor offer any guesses his was not a speculative mind i ended up quite admiring him for his little peccadilloes it showed that he was not entirely an automaton somewhere in him there was a little imp urging him to transgress and after many years he had given in i hoped very much he was enjoying himself because he was not very good at it sooner or later he would be discovered and his world would crash in ruins thank you i said when it was clear i had exhausted his knowledge you see you have told me nothing that was so very dangerous it is a small sin in comparison to your others and will remain very much more secret than they will what do you mean he asked apprehensively simply that what i could find out fairly easily then so others can and will i bowed to him and left leaving him standing watching me i am glad to say what a strange world of amorality i had come to inhabit that m hubert acted on my warning i never got the full details but it appears that he set about using his very considerable talents to embezzle a good deal more money over the next year when the bank finally discovered that the accounts were not quite what they should be m hubert went to buenos aires and vanished for ever i had a great deal of puzzling to do and i think best when i am walking so i walked back across the bois de boulogne to paris and walked still further through the rough houses and evershrinking fields which were still a part of the far west of the city then before resting in a café there i sat surrounded by laughter and smoke as i pondered what m hubert had told me clearly i would have to inform barings from what he had said the bank might know that this issue was going to be tricky but would not yet know the full extent of the difficulties that were coming their way but i still could not make sense of it these banks seemed to be acting in concert but they were behaving like rank amateurs almost as if they wanted to throw their money away if for a moment you conceded they were not total fools which is occasionally tempting with bankers but rarely with the most senior ones then there must be a reason but what might it be barings issues a bond half of which is taken up in england leaving them with two and a half million sterling to place on foreign markets some of it would go no doubt so assume that there is a shortfall of two million a vast sum of money and it would cause difficulties as barings obviously could not cover that from its own resources but such things had happened before even if not quite on that scale at the last resort there was the bank of england which would advance barings the bullion from its reserves barings would have to pay through the nose no doubt but it would survive its reputation for canny manoeuvres would be dented but its titanic strength would be demonstrated for all the world to see the only result would be that everyone would have lost a great deal of money what was the point of that two large glasses of beer brought me no closer to an answer so i resumed my walk i enjoyed it that part of paris which has the avenue de la grande armée running through it has become much drearier in the past decade or so then it was a very peculiar quarter with great apartment blocks rising up out of nothing with perhaps a field full of cows to provide the city with milk on one side and a masons yard or some other small workshop on the other tall buildings six floors high snuggled up to onestorey workers hovels which had not yet been swept away by property developers one patch of barren land was occupied by a gypsy encampment another by an openair music hall in between a fashionable and spectacularly ugly church which looked forlorn and abandoned even though it was brand new it was nearly six oclock so i had just time if i found a cab to get to barings office near the bourse it was a nuisance as i didnt yet see the urgency but i thought i might as well get it done with otherwise my day tomorrow would be disrupted then i planned a trip to the public bath for a long soak and an early night i was exhausted i should say that i was still in two minds about helping barings at all i had not quite forgiven them for their readiness to let me go but old obligations are hard to get rid of i thought of many of my colleagues with affection and somewhat childishly i thought it would be pleasant to demonstrate what they had lost i rattled my way to the place de la bourse and walked up the stairs to the little office that barings occupied again you must remember that this was some years back even the most powerful bank in the world felt no need to make a splash with gaudy offices and had no need whatsoever for legions of employees to oversee their foreign business barings then employed ten people in paris of whom four were mere clerks two were family members learning the trade with the remaining four doing all the work these were as was barings tradition overworked and underpaid the most underpaid and overworked alas hated me i can honestly say that no thought of roger felstead had passed through my mind for several years he was a man of such diligence stolidity and utter tedium that it was possible to forget him even when you were talking to him he believed in order he believed in rules he believed in procedures he believed in loyalty and was sure it would be rewarded alas every time he felt a reward was his due his rightful prize had been given to me he had wanted to go to germany i was sent he had greatly desired to spend some time in new york but it was i who got on the boat not him he had stayed in london methodically learning his business doing his duty and showing total loyalty while i rushed around accumulating unjustified rewards i did not like felstead felstead loathed me on such trivial things can the fate of empires depend a journalist now arent you he said not even trying to hide the tone of superior commiseration in his voice thats right i said brightly book reviews interviews with actresses and society gossip great stuff i was sorry to hear about you leaving he went on meaning the exact opposite there was quite a lot of talk about it im glad to hear it it would have been a great pity if no one had noticed were you really fired thats what i heard that you messed up with a contract certainly not i said no it was because i used the banks money to set up as a pimp he blinked not knowing how to take that then the idiot decided i was joking well come to see what youre missing everything seems to be running smoothly without you good i gather you are floating a big bond issue for the argentinians water company he nodded the most ambitious ever and i am in charge of syndicating the french participants its a big responsibility i can tell you hows it going oh pretty well pretty well itll take time to line everybody up of course you know the french no discipline no ability to take decisions they like their pound of flesh make us suffer before they do what theyre told pour lhonneur du pavillon you know he had an odd irritating honking laugh a bit like that of a goose in flight so if i said that i had heard through my contacts that credit international has decided not to have anything to do with the loan that in fact no bank in france is going to touch any more barings paper that russian and belgian banks are also beginning to wobble then you will tell me that this is silly market speculation and that everything is really running smoothly he blanched and i could see from his reaction that he knew none of this none of the banks had officially refused to participate as yet they were saving it up as a big surprise i wondered when that surprise was going to come i certainly would he said although the certainty in his voice was noticeable by its absence who told you this contacts i said its what comes of spending time in society you should try it you think its nonsense absolutely it is completely absurd when has a barings issue ever been snubbed occasionally you might get one bank scaling back on its participation thats normal you know that but large numbers they know our reputation when has lord revelstoke ever put a foot wrong why the man is a genius you know all of this and yet you give credence to a bunch of jealous gossipmongers its clear you were not cut out for banking my boy if youre given to this sort of panic i felt like replying that it was clear that neither was he if he was given to that sort of imbecility he reminded me of what i disliked about barings in fact the smugness and conviction of invincibility barings were the rulers of the fin de siècle but then the rothschilds had ruled at the beginning of the century and were now a conservative shadow of their former selves did barings think they would dominate the world forever im glad to hear it i replied so you think that i should ignore all these stories i was thinking of writing something for the times oh you mustnt do that he said swiftly that would be the grossest disloyalty if people hear there are problems then they will so there are problems i said its going slowly but its a complicated issue a lot of money there are bound to be difficulties has credit international refused certainly not has it accepted not yet they say they are having administrative difficulties but they assured me i was not to worry they will give a definite answer next thursday morning next thursday in six days time that would give two uninterrupted trading days for panic to sweep across the markets if things worked out as i thought they might listen i said i am not joking i think a storm is brewing you must send a telegram to london so they can prepare he stared with a particularly unappealing smile of incredulity on his face warn them of what of a story heard by a journalist you expect lord revelstoke to give up his weekend because of something you heard at some dowagers party its somewhat more than that it doesnt matter no one can touch barings you should know that and as for sending a telegram ive never heard anything so absurd in my life you stick to your actresses cort leave the serious stuff to people who know what theyre about i shrugged very well i will do as you say i heard this and i reported it to you you can do as you wish with it you are no doubt correct in your assessment as you say you are more experienced than i am precisely he said with satisfaction and dont think that i am ungrateful for your concern it was good of you to come in and if you hear any other titbits in future dont feel afraid to come and tell me however ridiculous they are and you must let me buy you a drink sometime in payment for your efforts at that moment the delightful image of barings sinking with all hands and felstead being the first to drown swam before my eyes i wished the french well excellent idea i said but not today at the moment you would do me a greater service by letting me have a look at the stock exchange notices i am trying to get something together on frances attitude to dual convertibility so i need some basic information the times publishes it but it would help to have it all in one place now he had established his superiority felstead was all grace fortunately he did not clap me on the back as he led me to a desk before getting out the bank bulletins had he done so i might have spoiled it all by hitting him the stock exchange daily bulletins are the dreariest of all newspapers the prices for dozens of government stocks the prices of innumerable foreign stocks and utilities the discount rates and interest rates applicable to hundreds of different instruments in dozens of countries news of new issues and dividend payments by carefully considering all of these a man of sense can make his fortune so it is said it was my great weakness as a banker that i never had the slightest interest in any of it i had forced myself to understand it but it never brought me the pleasure or satisfaction that it gave to many of my colleagues i tortured myself reading columns of numbers and prices and rates hoping to find some hint of how the second stage of this adventure was going to play out for there must be a second stage m hubert was right why do something which could scarcely hurt barings and could cost you a lot of money but if banks across the continent were indeed coordinating a response something serious was taking place and it could be assumed that it was being organised by people of intelligence it took the better part of two hours but then i had it and even i was shocked i had assumed i would find some sort of evidence of a secondary assault on barings but in fact it was much more serious than that so much so that i didnt even look at the relevant figures until late it never occurred to me it would be important barings wasnt the target they were aiming at the bank of england itself the figures were clear once i had noticed them for the past two months bullion had been draining out of the bank money was withdrawn new deposits were not made or were delayed the bank of france citing the need for gold to pay for a tax shortfall due to a poor harvest had postponed depositing ten million sterling the bank of russia had withdrawn fifteen million commercial banks which ordinarily would keep smaller but substantial quantities of gold on deposit in london had been pulling it out here there in all i settled down with pencil and paper and added it up going back six weeks another seven million had been withdrawn in this way according to my calculations the bank had probably less than four million in bullion in its vaults and next week the most powerful bank in the world was going to get a shock which would send it reeling causing panic throughout the london markets when people panic they want their money back they want gold and barings would be wanting to borrow the same gold to cover the holes in its positions it had promised the argentinian water company five million it had to pay and it wasnt going to have enough money every stock listed on the exchange would plummet in value banks and their customers would panic a queue of bankers would form at the bank of england and it wouldnt have enough gold to satisfy demand it would have to suspend convertibility say it would no longer give gold for paper and the reputation of the entire city of london would be in ruins with barings the first to fold i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of one pound on demand in gold except that it would be revealed as a lie not worth the paper it was printed on so that paper would rapidly become worthless it was breathtakingly audacious and simple and it was going to work a determined enemy would not waste his time and gold striking at the navy or invading the colonies he would aim to destroy belief in the word of a handful of bankers in london that was what netscher had said and he was right it was going to happen and that idiot felstead wouldnt believe me the beauty of the scheme was that even telling someone would merely start the panic earlier rather calm it down there was not enough gold in london and nothing could change that i came to the conclusion that even though it might already be too late i must at least alert mr wilkinson and for that i needed the assistance of john stone the times could not help me as we ordinarily sent our stories by the public telegraph going down to the local post office and sending them off word by word this was not very private and it was well known that the operators of the machines received a small stipend from the police to report anything of interest felstead would not help but stone certainly would i thought and i knew that his companies maintained their own private telegraph links which might perhaps be intercepted but which were more likely to pass undetected finding stone however was not so simple i knew that he had offices close to the palais royal but these were closed it was already so late that i went there just to be thorough rather than with any real hope of success i knew also that he stayed usually at the hôtel du louvre but again he was out it took a hefty inducement before i was allowed to go up and talk to his manservant im afraid i do not know where mr stone is sir said this character his face immobile as he looked me straight in the eye yes you do i replied tartly and however commendable your lying may be under normal circumstances it is not now i have to see him and as swiftly as possible it is a matter of the highest urgency and he will not thank you if you do not tell me where to find him the servant hesitated for a few seconds then said with the greatest reluctance i believe he had an appointment for tea with the countess von futak but i do not know where that might be i grinned broadly at him but i do excellent man thank you i will make sure he is aware of your impeccable judgement i didnt quite run down the stairs but i hurried and i certainly pushed aside an old gentleman waiting to be handed into a cab outside the main door he scowled i made an apologetic gesture as i leaped in and gave directions it took fifteen minutes to get to elizabeths house and i battered on the door until i was let in and demanded to see both her and stone it then occurred to me that i might well be placing both of them in a position of considerable embarrassment elizabeth had told me that she was open to visitors only on certain days and at certain hours for the rest she had her business to attend to this was not an evening when she received anyone other than her shareholders did that mean that stone had acquired a stake oddly as i waited i hoped very much not but i did not have time to wonder why it mattered to me there was no embarrassment fortunately i was shown into the little salon the one she kept for herself rather than visitors a charming room furnished to her tastes not to the requirements of show and there they were sitting in two little chairs side by side just like couple spending a few intimate moments together talking about their day and enjoying each others company the difference in her struck me immediately she was relaxed unguarded and completely at ease i didnt think i had ever seen her quite like that before certainly she was never so when with me always i sensed a tension as though she expected to have to defend herself i felt jealous although it did not hit me at the time but the moment i entered that watchfulness came back and stone rose to greet me and break up all impression of intimacy forgive me both i said i would not be here uninvited if it was not a matter of importance mr stone may i have a word in private please elizabeth rose stay here i have matters to attend to upstairs i will not disturb you she left the room swiftly and stone eyed me with a mixture of curiosity and i could tell no small amount of annoyance as i say i apologise however i need to send a telegram to wilkinson which will not be read by anyone else i would like to use your telegraph system well certainly i am happy to oblige he said do i take it you want to send it now this very minute this very minute i replied or at least as soon as possible i do not think it can wait until tomorrow and are you able to tell me what this is about i will of course assist you in any case but you will understand that you have excited my curiosity i believe i can in fact i think it might be a good idea to make sure that i am not making a fool of myself it is about barings and so i settled down and told him about the statement by steinberg at his dinner my meeting with hubert at the racecourse and the conclusions i had drawn from studying the movements of bullion out of the bank of england so you believe this is a concerted attempt against london i believe it is although of that i have no proof certainly it would be a remarkable coincidence if it is not at the moment it doesnt matter what does matter is that on thursday it will become clear that the barings bond issue has failed people will wonder if it has enough money to cover its liabilities correctly as it certainly does not there will be a run to gold at barings and at every other institution in the city the bank of england will be unable to supply the gold requested barings will collapse and the bank will have to suspend convertibility i leave it to you to figure out the consequences stone stroked his chin and considered thats easy enough bank rates will rocket institutions will founder savers will be ruined companies starved of funds trade will be crippled the possible effects could go on and on impressive i beg your pardon i was talking abstractly one cannot help but admire a fine piece of work well executed but as you say it does not matter whether this is planned or not the question is whether anything can be done to stop it for example what difference will it make if wilkinson and through him i presume the bank of england the government and barings knows what is about to take place if they are prepared they can at least call in all the gold they can find from the other banks that might be enough to stop the panic growing stone shook his head i very much doubt that if you are correct many foreign institutions in london will have their requests to withdraw bullion already written waiting to be delivered to start the panic off with a vengeance i mean it is certainly worth a try should the authorities so decide but i doubt it will work hmm what im sorry he said with a faint smile i was just calculating my own exposure what a pity you did not find this out yesterday then i could have exited the markets in time now it seems i will have to go down with everyone else my fate tied to the demise of that fool revelstoke what a very great nuisance still i suppose if i order my people to sell first thing on monday morning but that will merely add to the panic i said incredulously stone looked at me in surprise maybe so he said but i do not see why i should be ruined because of lord revelstokes overweening ambition and lack of judgement i stared at him i knew full well that stones gentle manner merely disguised the activities of one of the more ruthless of operators but i never expected him to be quite so unpatriotic do not concern yourself he said as though he read my thoughts selfpreservation and patriotism are not entirely incompatible i will not be ruined by this on the other hand i will render whatever assistance i can i am more than aware more than you probably how damaging all this might prove to be it is not in my interest for the financial machinery of the empire to be ruined quite the contrary i depend on the markets for money on shippers for orders on the government having healthy tax receipts for military commissions and i depend on britains reputation to give my companies the advantage in foreign markets for these reasons i will help if i can he stood up and we can begin by going to the offices and sending your telegram i will have to come with you can you work a telegraph machine i nodded i think so good it will go to my office in london and will then have to be delivered by hand do not worry yourself bartoli my man there is entirely loyal and discreet and i will instruct him that he is to deliver it himself and speak of it to no one he will do as he is told it would have to do we walked out and called for our coats as we were getting ready elizabeth came down the stairs you are going she asked with evident disappointment i am afraid so countess stone replied mr cort is a persuasive man and i can deny him nothing even at the cost of losing your company but you will come back i would be delighted she didnt invite me i noticed a little annoyed at being so obviously left out i pulled on my coat and stone walked out of the door then she took hold of my arm any news she said quietly i need to talk to you come back as soon as you can stone naturally had his own carriage no hire cab for him very comfortable well insulated from the sounds and draughts of the outside world charming woman the countess i said for no other reason than to see how he reacted she is he replied delightful company i added she is and remarkably well read stone peered at me do not be nosy mr cort im sorry i said smiling at him but i consider her a friend i think i might try one of these new automobiles he said as we clopped along have you ever been in one i gave up and shook my head they smell they are slow and they are unreliable he went on i believe they may have a great future it is shameful that our government has thrown away any possibility of britain being a leading manufacturer of them we considered starting production on a small scale of course but abandoned the idea why no market nor will there be until the government allows them to go at more than four miles an hour in france in italy they already travel at twenty miles an hour they are making huge progress and we have to sit and watch who wants to travel at four miles an hour when a horse will take you faster we cannot make things that people will not buy get the law changed he snorted not so simple people seem to think that businesses snap their fingers and the government does as it is told unfortunately it is not like that and the more governments have to win votes from people who do not think or understand anything at all the worse it becomes maybe they are afraid that people will get killed they are afraid voters will get killed and so they will but hundreds are trampled by horses every year as well and they dont limit their speed he fell silent for some while as the carriage made its way along the streets of paris you may be interested to know he said quietly after a while that i have asked the countess von futak to marry me good i mean congratulations sir i said with total astonishment has she she has asked for a week to consider her reply it is a womans privilege i believe and i am sure she must consider the fact that for her it would be something of a social descent anyway here we are i imagined elizabeths dinner being cooked by her chef and wondered what i was going to eat that evening nothing as grand i thought i still hadnt had the opportunity to tell her that simon was no longer a problem for her nor that in fact her problems were now very much greater stone had just astonished me but he clearly was already regretting his confidence and did not want to return to the subject poor man i thought i was certain i knew what her answer would be at least she was being kind in pretending to consider the offer rather than burst out laughing but she had little to laugh about at the moment john stones offer would not last long if he knew what was in those diaries and unless i could find drennan he soon would stone opened the door and led the way in and switched on the lights of course he had offices with electricity he liked everything modern even the desks the clerks worked at were sleek and new and designed with efficiency in mind through here he said and led the way through one room then through another and finally into a little cubicle containing the telegraph machine dont ask me how it works ive never used it its the latest machine though and i believe you tap on that he pointed to a key and then press all sorts of buttons there he pointed to a bank of switches and cables rising up in a vast technological cliff above the desk to make it go oh god i said i dont think this is going to work very well i had never seen a machine like it before i had not a clue how to operate it i pressed a button tentatively nothing happened who normally sits here stone shrugged ive no idea he said arent you meant to be able to do this sort of thing lets abandon that idea i said finally but i had no other to replace it stone pursed his lips the only option is to write a letter and get someone to take it there i can help that is i can provide pen paper envelope and a trustworthy man he looked at his watch might just get the eleven oclock train i think with luck you should have your letter delivered by saturday lunchtime if you can find someone to deliver it to he looked at my despondent air marvels of modern technology he said when i was young it still took nearly twentyfour hours to get from paris to london i sighed no alternative is there very well then i will write a letter stone nodded come back to my hotel and do it there xanthos will take it you can hand it to him when you are finished so that is what i did i spent the next hour in stones apartment at the hôtel du louvre carefully crafting a letter to wilkinson explaining exactly what i had discovered what i suspected and what i thought should be done about it i was a bit hazy about the final part as in truth i could not see what might be done even if xanthos was as efficient as stone said the timing would still be tight finding the owners of barings the directors of the bank of england would take time getting them all together deciding on some course of action stone evidently had the same thought he i suspected was writing letters as well and i thought i knew what was in them he wanted to hit the market with sales orders first thing monday morning to unload as many of his stocks as possible before anyone else suspected what might be about to happen i couldnt blame him of course and do not lose them xanthos stone said as he handed over the letters to his secretary it is vital that these reach wilkinson and bartoli as soon as possible the secretary put the envelopes carefully in the inside pocket of his jacket a promising young man stone said you need have no concerns he is so eager to get on he would swim the channel if it was necessary to do his job a drink mr cort i was quite exhausted it had been a busy day but i accepted nonetheless an interesting business he said once the servant had served the drinks and withdrawn it gives a whole new meaning to the idea of modern warfare it is fascinating to think what might be the motives of the people involved they want to destroy london and the empire oh yes of course but why from what you tell me it seems to be the french and the russians acting together after a fashion which is curious is it not the only republic in europe and the great despot of the east an unlikely pair i think i shrugged the french hate us because of the empire the germans because of the war and the russians because of their politics not that it matters my interests are more shortterm how to stop it maybe it cannot be stopped he replied mildly while you were writing your letter i was checking your figures you are quite right there is not enough gold at the moment to contain a run on the banks even if all the bankers were pulled together in one room and all agreed to pool their reserves there still would not be enough we sat in silence for a while considering the dreadful possibilities that lay ahead for next week my feeling of failure was quite overwhelming if i had only found out about this a few days earlier even two days would have made all the difference then the situation would have been entirely different but i was wasting my time with minor nonsense trying to find out the specifications and the purpose of a new french cruiser then being laid down at brest and more particularly being diverted by the problem of elizabeths diaries and failed to see what was going on i had thought it was an abstract problem not something real and imminent i wonder though i began what do you wonder well i told you of my conversation with netscher did i not the conversation that started all this off stone nodded he sounded scornful of the idea and he is an influential man a very fine one as well stone added i have a great deal of time for him as bankers go he is one of the best although as you realise i do not have much time for them on the whole so what if there are others like him who think that this is disruptive of the smooth ordering of world trade an unwarranted intrusion of politics into the pure and pristine world of money go on who has the more influence people like netscher or the people organising this as we dont know who is behind it what i mean is are we seeing a faction fight here money against politics is this in fact a coherent policy or a private venture to put it another way could this be reversed if we got to the right people stone considered it would depend on the price would it not what would the french the russians want besides is this your job should you not go to the embassy and let them deal with it i had never even considered that but it was easy enough to dismiss it you know the ambassador stone nodded do i need to say more then he smiled not the most effective of men i agree nonetheless i think you should keep him informed i think i will go and see netscher i said its not as if i will be divulging anything which isnt going to be common knowledge in a day or so besides he might well know all about it if he can be persuaded to help in some way stone stood it is worth a try i suppose as you say it cant do much harm now now if you will excuse me i have a dinner appointment oh i do beg your pardon i said i have taken up too much of your time on the contrary it has been most interesting ah yes well you may need to contact me in the next few days should i not be here then you might call at the countesss house he said it quite calmly but i could quite plainly sense the awkwardness underlying his words stone was not a sophisticated man of the world he was perfectly incapable of passing off such a statement in a matteroffact manner however hard he tried chapter why do french bankers insist on living so far away the richest had migrated out of paris entirely and congregated upriver in stgermainenlaye miles away there they had their pocket châteaux the huge grounds the children and the servants all the space they needed apart from the further estates they kept in the country the vineyards in bordeaux or in burgundy so much easier if they had congregated in the french equivalent of mayfair or belgravia as english bankers did when i got up the next morning after only a couple of hours sleep and took the tram to stgermain i had neither appointment nor guarantee of finding netscher at home i wasnt even certain id be able to get through the main gate to the house but i managed although i had to climb over a fence and wade through brambles to overcome the gate problem then brave barking dogs a virtual schoolroom of screaming children three maids and a nanny all belonging to netscher fils before i penetrated the main house knocked and sat looking very grumpy and feeling not unlike a travelling salesman in the main hallway netscher however was a gentleman my unorthodox arrival and slightly weary appearance did not upset him one jot even though it was saturday instead he had me shown into his office disappeared to make his apologies to his family then he returned announcing that he had asked for breakfast to be brought you do not look like someone who is capable of surviving an encounter with my grandchildren he said with a smile that is kind and i apologise for my arrival but i believe it is important do you remember the conversation we had a while back at the countess von futaks salon about about the vulnerability of the city of london ah yes i remember it well you seemed quite sceptical i recall are you aware of what is happening about to happen i should say i have heard that barings may experience difficulties in finding subscribers to an argentinian loan it has been proposing is that what you mean yes and you realise the consequences he nodded is that what you were referring to at the salon he looked at me carefully clearly weighing what to say next that was enough of course but not enough to continue the conversation it certainly fits the picture i laid out i am hardly divulging a great secret if i say that the bank of england will be hard put to meet the demands that are likely to be placed on it in the coming week or so and that the refusals and the withdrawing of bullion are too neatly bound together to be anything other than a concerted operation that had occurred to me also the bank will need assistance for its friends to rally around in time of need ah he said but however well considered the bank may be by its peers i think you can say that england is not well looked upon in general that is a constant in french thinking whatever the government as i have no doubt you are aware it has friends of course but alas those friends have few friends themselves meaning what exactly well you see my dear sir france is stricken it wants revenge but as yet has no clear notion of how to take that it was defeated in and not just defeated but humiliated it lost some of its most valuable provinces to germany it had to pay to make the invader go away five billion francs to pay for the cost of the germans invading our country and stealing our land is it surprising that there is one thought only in the mind of the people have you been to the place de la concorde seen the statues of the great cities of france the statue of strasbourg is permanently wreathed in black flowers are put there daily as on a grave revenge my dear sir we want revenge he stopped to make sure that i had enough to eat then fussed and apologised for not having offered me anything to drink the children were still playing in the garden all bundled up against the cold catching the weak morning sunshine their squeals of excitement came drifting through the closed windows but how to go about it he went on eventually if we fight the german empire alone we will be defeated again we have no friends except countries like italy or spain which are of no use to us the habsburg empire is tied to germany the russians repel us the english oppose us at every turn throughout the world so some people begin to mutter that this is insoluble that there is a better way than war to regain what we have lost forget germany for a while and make common cause against england befriend russia cripple england then turn back to the problem of germany and a second group believes that this is all fantasy the posturings of people who do not understand the slightest thing about the way the world works who think that the clash of nations has not changed since the days of napoleon such people say that france will not be strong when it triumphs but that it will triumph when it is strong and a nation grows strong in peace when it can devote itself with one mind to accumulating capital and growing industries as england has done bankers you mean the most despised of all it was people like the rothschilds who conjured the five billion francs out of thin air to pay off the kaiser in the s and yet they are reviled as manipulative jews fattening themselves on the labours of others the socialists ran around paris shouting slogans the politicians cowered in bordeaux the generals made excuses and bankers went to work evicting the enemy with an efficiency the army could never imagine yet who is admired who hated it is not money that corrupts politics but politics that corrupt money all politicians have their price and sooner or later they come with their hand out do you think that a rothschild or a reinach or a baring can be corrupted in terms of morality a banker and a beggar are similar money matters little to them one has it the other does not want it only those who want but do not have are liable to be corrupted that is the vast majority of mankind and nearly all the politicians i have ever met and your point my point is that englands natural allies in france are unfortunately the most hated obviously the collapse of the london credit market would be disastrous for trade for investment for industry all countries would be weakened generations of capital accumulation would go for nought alas there are many who do not see that a shortterm triumph bought at the cost of longterm misery is no bargain and any house in france which comes to the aid of its brothers in london would swiftly be condemned as an enemy particularly if it is jewish so you will not help i must barings is foolish and arrogant yet it must not fall however much it deserves to do so but assistance will only be possible if the government puts itself behind this it cannot be through the actions of banks alone this was a long way out of my area of competence and i had to work hard to keep a calm head about it what would the price be netscher smiled a high one but who are they are we dealing with government policy or not you assume governments are coherent it is better to assume there are factions and factions break up and recombine in different shapes it is more a question of how to fragment the pieces and put them back together in a way better suited to your requirements for example if the financial interests in paris were to approach the bank of france and speak with one voice say that it must come to the aid of the bank of england then our opinion would undoubtedly be heard however there are others who will argue for a more dramatic policy we are talking about m rouvier here he is ambitious vainglorious he sees a great opportunity to destroy an enemy and vaunt himself he may be persuadable but it would be foolish to pretend it will not be difficult and what is in it for the russians they want to raise huge amounts of money to fund their army and their economy how will they get it if they destroy the markets that provide it im afraid you will have to ask them that chapter i left him sitting down at his desk to write to colleagues and associates to begin sounding out opinion i did not even pause to wonder how it was that he was not surprised that a mere journalist should know or care so much i was in a hurry now i had plenty enough to do first stop was the british embassy but as i had anticipated it was closed and because it was the british embassy no one was prepared to tell me where i might find the ambassador he was a man who valued his leisure and would under no circumstances have it disturbed i would have to wait next came the russian embassy which was also closed not completely such places never were i walked in and wandered around until i found someone to ask where i might find the military attaché the answer was forthcoming soon enough boulevard haussmann i was told the second floor it was a good half hour by foot quicker by cab but there was none to be found so at three oclock in the afternoon i knocked on the door of count gurunjiev and was let in by a servant who looked as though he had just got off a horse after a long ride across the steppe the apartment was lavishly furnished and had a strange almost spicy aroma quite unlike any smell you find in a house inhabited by french people i never found out what it was but it gave the subsequent meeting an undeniable air of foreign adventure it was not at all unpleasant but not the sort of smell that fades from your mind once your nose gets used to it i dearly wanted to know what it was but could not find any assuredly polite way of asking i had never met gurunjiev before he did not come to elizabeths salon but rather visited her separately normally on a tuesday afternoon i learned later by means which i do not wish to elaborate on that he had always been one of her more generous supporters although not at all the most extravagant i had expected a strapping man of the officer class a cross between a hero in a tolstoy novel and an image of alexander ii on horseback but got neither of these gurunjiev was goodlooking enough i suppose but not especially tall not particularly well built and with no military air to him at all not the cossack type in fact rather he was distinguished by a face of such abundant good nature that it was impossible to dislike him for a second a clear forehead surrounded by dark hair deepset brown eyes a straight nose and delicate almost feminine mouth the thought of him being intimate with elizabeth crossed my mind for a fraction of a second but that fragment was damaging to my purpose so i did my best to suppress it it was unfortunate because he was a delightful man in every way i could see exactly why elizabeth considered him to be well qualified for his role the only surprise was that she had managed not to fall properly in love with him this is a most unusual visit the count began with a warm smile he did not seem in the slightest bit annoyed even though i had interrupted him at some meal his voice was rich and civilised his french excellent and he gestured me to sit in the most natural way possible who are you well i said i came to you because i have heard of you from the countess von futak any friend of the countess is naturally someone who is welcome in my house he said coolly although i did not realise that our friendship was so well known it is not sir i was speaking to her on a matter which has given me some concern and she then revealed that she had made your acquaintance considered you a friend and told me i had to inform you of what i knew as a matter of urgency i see and one must always follow her advice when you are done i hope you will join me at our table my family is always ready to welcome a new acquaintance you see i am prepared to trust in your absolute discretion because i have complete trust in hers is what he meant you will no doubt find it easy to respond with equal understanding im afraid i have previous engagements otherwise i would accept with great pleasure but thank you for your kindness then begin very well you must understand that what i am about to tell you is in the strictest confidence i do not need to say that to a man like yourself of course but my superiors would consider my behaviour to be questionable at the least should they come to hear of it you will have to find your own means of explaining your knowledge of what i am about to tell you he gestured that such a thing was entirely understandable good i am a journalist working for the times in addition i also do a little work for the foreign office of great britain a spy i have undertaken to acquire any sort of information which might assist the wellbeing of britain and its possessions please do not misunderstand me if i say that i am very good at it and that in this job i also inevitably learn of things which concern other nations as well such as russia when i began this job i took over from a man called arnsley drennan who subsequently found employment selling his services to the highest bidder he is a man of the greatest violence and the smallest morals his history has been one of war and deceit and killing he is an american go on i know relatively little about him no one does he is in his fifties and was once a soldier in the civil war it was there i believe that he began to acquire his skills as a murderer certainly he is an expert in his profession he is able to slip unnoticed behind a man and slit his throat as quickly and as quietly as a mouse his virtue for many people is that he has no allegiance and so is difficult to find or follow and what was her majestys government doing by employing such a man they no longer do so but it may well be that they employ someone similar in his place as do the government of france and the government of russia he bridled noticeably at this statement and began to deny it you know quite well it is so six months ago a pair of estonian nationalists drowned in the danube do you really think they just fell in when they were drunk a revolutionist was found with his throat cut last month in rotterdam again do you really think this deed was committed by an argumentative comrade that such people are dealt with through the courts alone he looked decidedly uncomfortable at this but also i could see the glimmerings of a thrill in the way he sat all people all men i should say as i have discovered that women are by and large impervious to the charms of the occult can be easily fascinated by such tales they like the idea of possessing hidden knowledge only the very sensible truly prefer not to know only the saintly are truly appalled with luck i could exploit this weakness and go some way to solving two pressing problems at one and the same time if i was careful and if i was lucky go on his current employers are people who have no love of russia you are aware i am sure that the various revolutionist groupings have had very little success in fomenting any trouble inside russia itself they make a great deal of noise but accomplish little there are so many informers inside their ranks that they manage little before they are discovered anarchists of various sorts manage to blow up a restaurant or a bar every now and then but there is little real point to what they do yes i know all this good let me be blunt then a group of russian exiles have engaged the services of mr drennan to effect an atrocity against russia in france this statement was greeted with silence as the count stared at me the atmosphere suddenly dark and serious and you know this how might i ask a difficult question to answer as i didnt know in fact it was a tissue of lies from beginning to end russia is not the only country which keeps an eye on these people i said airily and i have been keeping an eye on mr drennan that was for my own protection as he resents my existence considerably and i did not wish to become his next victim myself and this atrocity i am afraid sir that i must interrupt here and rather ruin my reputation i must exchange this information not give it his handsome countenance darkened dont concern yourself i said gently even if you are not able to oblige me i will still tell you all you need to know to prevent a catastrophe but i would like your word that you will assist me if you can do so i desire no more than that his eyes narrowed as he considered this offer and i could see that he was calculating possibilities he was not i thought quite so direct and straightforward as his manner suggested very well he said why dont you tell me what you want then we will see if we can do business please bear in mind that i have noticed you have given me no proof whatsoever of what you say that will come i hardly expect you to act on the unsubstantiated word of a total stranger very well then you have heard i imagine of barings bank he looked totally astonished at the sudden change of direction but nodded in a few days time barings is going to get into considerable difficulties it has to make a payment and does not have the funds to do so it will as happens in these circumstances apply to the bank of england for assistance news of the problems will seep out and many people will wish to convert their funds into something more substantial than paper other houses will also want gold from the bank of englands vaults he nodded but cautiously it was clear he only just understood what i was talking about the bank does not have enough one does not have to be an expert to understand the difficulties that arise when a bank does not have enough money to meet its obligations i do not see in the past month the russian state bank has withdrawn substantial amounts of the gold it habitually holds in london for safekeeping it has withdrawn money from the bank of england and also from barings itself all for perfectly good reasons i am sure but if it were able to announce it was reversing this policy then the problem would be significantly lessened that is all i require i had lost him i could see he was a man of diplomatic balls and negotiations between grand men he understood not one thing about how empires are really made or how countries satisfy the needs and desires of their people it had never occurred to him to wonder how the food on his plate got there how it was grown harvested moved from place to place and merchant to merchant along the great paths of invisible money that encircle the globe tying every man and every town to each other so efficiently that most people did not even suspect they were there he took it for granted and we never value what we never think about you want russia to move gold i suppressed a groan no excellency there is no need to move it simply saying that you will not move it will be more than sufficient belief is as good as reality where money is concerned he frowned as you see mr cort i know little of these things nor do i care about them much an oversight on my part no doubt but it means that i have no idea whatsoever whether you are asking me a small favour or a gigantic one we wish to make an exchange but that depends on a fair price for each side i do not know the value of what you are asking then i suggest you consult one of your people in the embassy who does know excellency i said but i would request that you do so swiftly time is of the greatest importance here he surprised me then he was not at all the sort of person i had imagined he stood immediately and called for a servant prepare my clothes i must go to the embassy immediately and send messengers to here he reeled off a list of russian names and tell them to meet me there within the hour he turned back to me and smiled i will meet my people and attempt to understand what this is about he said i may need to get hold of you so if you would leave your address i nodded and i will hold you to your word mr cort i must have that information whether i can assist you or no you will have that and willingly i said all i know at the moment is that drennan is probably living on the ile saintlouis and that the plot involves an attack against the russian cathedral some time next week please place guards around it twentyfour hours a day i gave drennans description he is not a member of the orthodox church cares nothing for eastern music and has no opinion whatsoever of modern ecclesiastical architecture if he goes there at all it will not be for the state of his soul then you have given me a great deal to do he said diplomats must dress properly and that takes an extraordinary amount of time it was a dismissal so i thanked him left the room and headed back home i had made progress or so i thought that is i had contacted two powerful people in the russian and the french camps and opened communication the next stage was to discover their price if indeed they were prepared to sell i realised however that i had little enough to offer in exchange and if the price was too high what would happen then i paused at a café in the rue du faubourg sthonoré and ordered an omelette and a glass of red wine i had not eaten since morning and i was desperately hungry i might as well eat and think at the same time britain would be desperately weakened of course trade all over the world would shrink factories would close ships be laid up people would lose their jobs the governments revenue and its ability to pay for the royal navy would fall the colonies would then be exposed and vulnerable india south africa the far east and the french and russians would move to drive home their advantage what could we do except go cap in hand to the germans asking them to name their price they would no doubt want a free hand in eastern africa for a start maybe much more than that and would they even want to assist sandwiched as they were between russia to the east and france to the west all this for a few tons of metal and i had made things even more complicated by introducing the business of an attempted atrocity which i would now have to plan what on earth was i thinking of it was going to make my life very much more difficult still i could worry about that when it was all over waiting and watching not doing anything unless it is necessary these have always been my main characteristics in the business of intelligence it was what distinguished me from others like drennan who no doubt would have blown something up first of all as a way of catching peoples attention and then i smiled and ordered another glass of red wine and called for paper and an envelope dear drennan i wrote i have been engaged by a mutual friend to act in the matter of a work of fiction which you may know about i think we must talk over the issue and swiftly a neutral place of meeting would be suitable i will be at the entrance to the orthodox cathedral in the rue daru on thursday at sixthirty in the evening yours cort i put it in an envelope then travelled down to the ile saintlouis and left it addressed to m lefevre at the bar he would get it soon enough from there i went back to elizabeth it was past nine when i arrived but it felt like three in the morning there had been so much going on i was giddy with tiredness and i think that my judgement was not what it should have been i ought to have gone to bed for some rest but i remembered that stricken look on her face as she held my arm so lightly and asked me to come back nothing would have kept me away i even wondered what stone would have thought had he known elizabeth roused her cook to get me some food and was restrained about talking before i had eaten something i was grateful for that and made her wait as i ate quails eggs a little pâté and drank a glass of wine with great speed and little ceremony who do you go to for comfort she asked as i finished do you have brothers parents my father is alive but we are not close i have a sort of halfbrother i can tell him most things and he relies on me similarly then you are lucky what is he like is he like you no he is hardworking and serious and much attached to warm fires and armchairs and you no one just you at the moment im sorry why that im the best you have listen i dont have good news she composed herself face set a little pale simon is dead i said it doesnt matter how but he didnt have the diaries he sold them he told me as much who to a man called arnsley drennan otherwise known as jules lefevre you met him with me in nancy she nodded faintly a much more dangerous character much smarter and not interested in money the trouble is i dont know where he is i have begun to tackle the problem and that might work but for the next few days at least i cannot say what will happen i very much doubt he is involved for gain this will not end simply by you handing over some cash she cupped her hands against her face and closed her eyes and i felt bad sorry to disappoint her i see what might he want me thats my main concern he may see your diaries as a way of getting to me they would destroy your reputation but they would also expose me and wreck everything ive been doing here it would cause severe embarrassment to the british government and at a time when britain can least afford it the french no doubt know that there are spies here having it plastered all over the newspapers at the moment could be very difficult im sorry its not your fault but it would help if i knew how powerful a weapon these diaries are i said tell me about dr stauffer is it important i think it is why i need to know everything in advance i dont want unpleasant surprises when i pick up the newspaper one morning come and sit down she said and led me back into the little sitting room lit now only by a couple of candles and the fire in the grate it was warm and i was worried i might fall asleep at least i was until she started talking which she did in a soft voice face turned to the fireplace as if i wasnt there listen she said i was put into an orphanage shortly after my mother died there was a long long silence which i did not break into she was thinking and she looked inexpressibly lovely as though no cares could possibly touch her so how did you become you she looked puzzled by the question and thought because somebody once was kind to me she said simply so i know it is possible however cruel the world can be i didnt feel able to respond to this so i stayed silent it was a terrible place if god punishes me as i no doubt deserve he will send me back there it was cold and mean and those in charge were harsh they encouraged the children to be cruel to each other as well i wont dwell on it because there is nothing good to say except that there was one woman one of the visitors appointed by the town council to oversee it who was not like that she talked to me once and i was so greatly in need that i worshipped her just for those few words every time she came i watched her how she dressed and moved the way she bowed her head slightly when talking to others on days when the trustees held meetings i would get up and dress my hair carefully and be at the gate onto the street so that she would see me when she arrived i hoped she would notice me smile at me even speak to me again and one day she did she asked me my name i was so overcome i couldnt answer and just stared at her so she asked very patiently if i was a good girl and did everything the guardians asked me whether i worked hard and was quiet and obedient i said that i tried and what did i want to do when i grew up i had no idea i had never thought about it so i blurted out the only thing that came to my mind to get out of here maam i said and i could see from the look on the custodians face that i was going to be punished for that when the time came she saw it too and understood exactly what had happened and bent down close to my ear lets see what we can do shall we she whispered and she left me to my fate which was terrible enough i was nearly eleven by then and i do not think you can imagine how cruel another woman can be to the weak and the young it was not the bruises or the cuts the cold water the starvation there are many things worse than that she stopped and paused then smiled at me still they do say that the worse the misery the shorter it lasts i do not know why they say it because it is not true but it did come to an end eventually after a week or so my saviour came back for me she needed a maid and had in effect bought me in exchange for a donation i was allowed out on licence to work in her home doing what was needed it was hard work but like going to heaven in comparison i was fed clothed the cook was kind and not too demanding the other girls were as you might expect but not too mean to me as by that stage i had learned how to deflect trouble and ignore all wounding comments and madame stauffer was kind although distant and formal it was a frenchspeaking house until then i had spoken only swissgerman and had to learn a new language but did so quickly she was french herself and had imposed the language on the household although her husband was german proper german he was a lawyer they lived in a big house with everything you might need fine furniture gardens servants everything except children for the story was that madame stauffer was barren and made desolate by her failure to give her husband the children both wanted perhaps that was why she found a place for me i do not know i need say little more about her except that she was kind to me her husband was different i found him very frightening he was older than she about fortyfive years old and very quiet he was never around very much only in the evenings and said little when he came home they would eat together and then he would go to his library and spend the rest of the evening there reading until bedtime they talked little and slept in separate rooms but seemed to be fond enough of each other he was always respectful and polite considerate of her presence more than that i did not know or care he spoke to the servants only rarely and was neither a good nor bad presence in the house for he knew nothing of its running at all one day i was in his library dusting as i had to do every week and found a book lying on the floor which i picked up to put back on the table i opened it to see what it was in case it was some law book which should go on his desk and saw it was a novel balzac it was père goriot have you read it i nodded it changed my life forever she said simply such things do happen although it was very unexpected i had never read much it had been forbidden apart from prayer books they did not see why we should have to read as our task in life was to work and obey they only taught us with reluctance so i hardly had any idea what stories were until that moment when i read that first sentence madame vauquer née de conflans est une vieille femme i was transfixed by it could not stop myself reading i read as quickly as i could skipping over the words i did not understand i had fallen into another world and did not want to leave it you must have felt that in your life everything else vanished there was just this story which i could not leave i had to of course eventually the most senior maid came in and saw me and clucked around me and scolded me terribly for my impertinence she didnt hit me that did not happen in that house but i got a good talking to i couldnt care less if that was sin then i was ready for hell all i could think about all day was how to get back into the masters library to find it again i couldnt sleep that night we all went to bed in the attic all four women in one tiny room and normally the snoring didnt bother me that night it drove me mad and when i was sure that everyone in the house was asleep i got out of bed and tiptoed down the servants staircase it was icy cold i remember and i had bare feet which were numb by the time i got down to the family quarters it didnt matter i found the book sat in the armchair by the fire and read you have been educated i know books to you are commonplace something you take for granted but for me such books were like a weary traveller in the desert finding an oasis i was fascinated excited thrilled i had stepped into another world full of extraordinary things and people i fell in love with rastignac and saw in him the first glimmerings of my own ambition he had nothing and wished to conquer paris he taught me that sweetness and kindness would serve me little yet he kept a goodness that could not be corroded by the world books taught me of friendship and loyalty of betrayal and how to suspect others and it taught me to dream of worlds and people and lives that i had never thought existed she stopped as she recaptured very briefly the joy of that discovery one of the moments in her life which would be an unalloyed treasure for the rest of her life whatever else had happened to her would happen to her in the future she had that moment of enchantment in a chair with cold feet and a spluttering candle i read almost until dawn then made myself go back up the stairs to get some sleep i should have been exhausted the next day so tired i could hardly move but i wasnt i was exhilarated beyond imagining it was like a first love it was a first love with rastignac and the way we had met but i now embarked on a life of crime i could not do it every night as even my young body could not manage to go without sleep forever but every night i could manage i slipped down those stairs to read i read more balzac everything i could discover in the library tried victor hugo flaubert i was so moved by the fate of poor madame bovary i wept for days afterwards and felt myself in mourning after a week though a very strange thing happened i came down and discovered a new book on the table stendhal and a thick blanket on the chair i was frightened a little but the temptation was too great so i wrapped myself up warmly and settled down i devoured the book as i had all the others and wished i knew people as interesting as the duchess of sanseverina or as dashing as fabrizio a few nights later when i had nearly finished it i found another one on the side table and a glass of milk and so it went on until one night as i stretched over to wrap myself up more comfortably i knocked the glass over milk spilled over the rug and there was a terrible noise as the glass broke on the floor it was still early i had begun to take more chances and was coming down earlier and earlier there were still people awake i panicked as i knew i would be thrown out of the door if i was discovered there were footsteps coming down the corridor and then i heard footsteps in the room itself it was one of those rooms where there were so many books that the shelves went up to the ceiling and a ledge had been built halfway up the wall with a little iron staircase leading up to it it was down this that dr stauffer was now coming quickly he said in a quiet voice up the stairs and hide behind the desk keep quiet in one little corner was a small desk which i had never seen used it was always covered in piles of paper which were never moved i stared at him and he gestured at me urgently to do as i was told with seconds to spare i fled up the steps and crouched down behind the papers the evening maid whose duty it was to close up the house for the night knocked and came in its quite all right he said im afraid i knocked over a glass please dont worry about it its late and i am working the maid nodded and withdrew the door shut and i heard it being locked you can come back down now its quite safe he had a gentle voice not the voice of someone who was going to throw me out into the night but nonetheless i was petrified shivering from fright and cold stand by the fire and warm yourself he said and dont be frightened im not going to eat you i began to stammer out an apology which he brushed away i have been keeping an eye on you for several days he said with a faint smile i wondered who was moving my books but as nothing went missing i didnt mind then two evenings ago i was up there working and i saw you come and curl up on my chair i thought it was so charming i couldnt bring myself to disturb you and very curious too why do you spend so much time reading i did not really trust myself to answer i cant stop myself i said eventually the answer seemed to please him and which of those books did you like the most i felt like saying all of them the ones with rastignac in really you dont find stories of young girls finding true love more appealing why do you like rastignac because he is trying to make something of himself he seemed to find this reply quite fascinating and he came across the room sat opposite me and stared hard at me how extraordinary he said how remarkable well well im truly sorry sir what for for my impertinence no you are not at least i very much hope you are not are you no you notice that this room of mine is terribly untidy and messy not to say dusty i looked around and could not see a book or ornament out of place and as for dust i dont think there was a single speck anywhere i think that what i need is someone to tidy it up more often once the job is done there would be no reason why that person could not fill up the remaining hours reading a book as long as they put it back in its proper place again once they were finished can you think of anyone that might suit i could hardly believe what he was saying oh sir would you be so kind as to assist me do you think i never knew that anyone could feel such happiness as i felt just then the idea that i could spend hours a day in that room just reading and tidying made me want to skip and sing as i went back up the stairs it was beyond my wildest dreams and it was not a dream i was given my instructions the next day by the head maid and told to watch myself be quiet be obedient for once i intended to do just that nearly all day every day i spent in that library dr stauffer said he had given me the task of reorganising all the books and dusting all the shelves and making a catalogue of them he reckoned it would take up to a year so it would have done had he really wanted me to do it i was occasionally instructed to put papers in files or find things for him but apart from that i simply read and talked the other servants were scandalised that i should have to work so hard and i did not enlighten them every day i went to the library at eight in the morning and stayed there reading part of the time i read what i wished but i also had to read what he gave me and he evidently decided to give me an education my knowledge of the world came entirely from books and bit by bit it deepened he gave me voltaire and montaigne then shakespeare in translation victor hugo dumas chateaubriand in german goethe schiller then other books as well history philosophy he suggested homer cicero plato some i understood others not but all fascinated me and often in the evenings he would summon me to talk about them what did i think of this passage or that was this author correct why did he say such a thing im sure my ideas and responses were foolish and naïve but he didnt seem to mind and never corrected me or told me the right answer this went on for months and months it was the happiest time of my life for the first time i felt as though i was loved that someone cared for me i had never imagined that it was possible to be so happy need i say that i fell in love with him a man in his late forties and me a girl of fifteen as i was by then he was everything i needed and didnt even know existed he was even lonelier than i was and knew little about how to inspire warmth or friendship in his equals so he turned to me and sought intimacy through books and ideas he liked having me around him there is a joy in that i can see watching someone else discover the pleasures that you first learned yourself in your youth to see someone growing and flourishing in front of you i will have children one day i know i will and i will watch them grow i was thoroughly confused now for she was telling me a story of being saved something out of those books she had devoured so avidly a pretty little orphan adopted by a kindly old man and given an education and love i knew the story she grew up with her devoted guardian and looked after him in his old age or married some respectable upright youth exactly like him it was a tale of safety and contentment of warm emotion and fulfilment it did not end on the streets of a small border town in winter she was in her own world now and i could not interrupt i did not want to and i was too tired i didnt really hear her words they just seeped into my mind as i sat next to her on the sofa i do not think she meant to tell me this story when she started she was asking for help not giving a confidence but once she started talking she could not stop i think i was the only person who ever heard the tale he taught me other things as well she went on all about prints and paintings statues and cathedrals porcelain jewellery he was immensely cultivated and had a small collection of art he would sit beside me with a folder of prints and get me to look at them describing what i saw giving my opinions i was never very good at it i think he thought me rather weak in that area but he persisted and seemed to like being beside me but bit by bit the sort of pictures he showed me changed he began to show me prints by boucher of nudes and scenes of seduction and asked me to describe them in the greatest detail i could hear him breathing more irregularly as i spoke and i didnt know why nothing had ever been said in the orphanage and the maids were all highly respectable and prim my ignorance was total all i knew was that a sort of playfulness came on me and i realised that i could make him sound even more uncomfortable the more i described his hands on her breasts the whiteness of the skin the hair falling down the nape of the neck and what do you think it is about i dont know sir but i imagine she is very cold sitting there in an open field with no clothes on like that i hope it was painted on a warm summers day but do you think she is enjoying it i dont know sir but does this please you and he put his hand on my breast and began to stroke it he was now breathing really hard and i was frozen in confusion i did not dislike it but i knew enough to think i should so i said nothing at all but began trembling as his hands moved down my body i gave him no encouragement i did nothing i didnt know what to do i just sat rigidly still as he took my immobility for consent then there was a rattle on the doorknob as one of the maids opened the door to bring in his morning coffee he pulled his hand away quickly and stood up i still had only very little idea of what was going on but i could see from his behaviour that it shouldnt be happening that he was doing something wrong the scene did not repeat itself for a very long time on the outside we resumed our normal way and he was as kind and attentive as ever but of course everything had changed i had a first glimpse of my power i knew that i could make him tremble and i practised with my eyes and my gestures and the way i sat and talked i learned how to make him uncomfortable i wasnt aware of what i was doing there was no malice in me but i think i was putting him through the tortures of hell nevertheless one evening when his wife was out at the theatre he could resist me no more it hurt it does you know and i cried he was overcome with remorse and kept stroking my hair and saying how sorry he was and could i forgive him i ended up comforting him and telling him not to worry it didnt matter then he went and sat on the armchair far away from me and looked at me in horror i must not say anything about this to anyone it would be our secret otherwise i wouldnt be allowed to come back here and read books any more so i became a whore at the age of fifteen i would have died rather than give up those books and if that was the necessary payment it was one i was willing to make i assured him i wouldnt say anything and the tone of panic in my voice made him realise that i meant it i was totally in his power and he knew it and that was how my education was completed everything went back to the way it was before i would read and we would talk except that some days normally in the evening i could sense a change of tone in his voice a look in his eye was i paying him or was he paying me it was an exchange both had something the other wanted i did not feel wicked or sinful although i knew i ought to and i could not ask anyone elses opinion had any of the other maids known they would have set me right immediately i am sure but they did not the other thing i learned was how to be absolutely discreet i knew enough to realise that everything that made life worthwhile depended on it he was in his way a good man dr stauffer but he was weak with me he could be the gallant lover and father all in one depending on his mood and i would play whichever part he required of me i was growing and learning fast and i came to despise the stauffers i should not have done so it was not in the play he had written out in his mind there was no scope for me to grow and to change but i saw how husband and wife behaved to each other and to the outside world and learned that this marriage which was so enviable was pretence it worked well enough i suppose but you must remember i had been schooled by novels madame bovary was my best friend rastignac my real lover the barely concealed hatreds that kept the stauffer marriage together began to excite in me disdain and loathing i would love or i would be free the price for my liberty would be high the man willing to pay it would be extraordinary not like dr stauffer with his moustaches and fat belly and smell of cigars and fumbling grunts as he pawed me but there was also a man called wichmann a man i hated more than any man i have ever known he was sly mendacious cruel a dirty man with a dirty soul he found out about me and dr stauffer and set a price for his silence the price was me and dr stauffer paid it i was handed over to him when he wanted me for all his failings dr stauffer was a kindly man wichmann was not he liked to do things and made me do things which were horrible but he taught me as well i learned that i could even control a man like that by doing more than he wanted and allowing him to do as he pleased do you want to hear what i learned to do at his hands i will tell you if it pleases you i will tell you anything you wish to hear i shook my head i think i deserve better than that from you i replied reproachfully she shook her head you are an unusual man she said perhaps i couldnt stand it eventually so i brought it all to an end not deliberately not thought out i didnt really know what i was doing but we were caught and it was my doing dr stauffer became bolder and i encouraged him into taking more and more risks one day his wife was due to go out for a lunch but i heard it had been cancelled so she decided to go for a short walk instead and come back to eat at the house dr stauffer did not know this and i goaded him into wanting me i could do that easily by then so we were surprised in the grossest way imaginable his wife came in stared and walked out again she was a kind but fairly stupid woman given to generosity to orphans but incapable of understanding adults or herself i do not think it ever crossed her mind that her preoccupation with charities and lunches might have left a hole in her husbands life which he would seek to fill elsewhere a more sophisticated woman would have had a blazing row and let the matter drop she would not she wished to separate and then i learned that this for dr stauffer would be cataclysmic he had no money of his own the family fortune was hers and she intended to make him realise it i do not know the details i was naturally packing my things dr stauffer dismissed me within seconds of his wife leaving the room before i had even managed to pull my dress down he was going to throw all the blame on me wiles of a temptress well of course he was i couldnt blame him but it didnt work i only gathered approximately what had happened but i think she was not prepared to take his excuses she was stupid but not that stupid that was all i knew what happened then was not my concern any more i had to leave and leave quickly it was obvious that i would never get another position in lausanne so i left the city and left switzerland you did not murder madame stauffer how do you know about that she had not mentioned it jules had discovered it she was suspicious now and on the brink of closing up on me how do you know about that it was not hard i said and it does not matter you must tell me everything good bad and shameful it is not as if i am in a position to judge she looked coolly at me for a few more seconds then relaxed i suppose youre not she said quietly very well to answer your question no i would never have done that she had been good to me i meant her no harm at all do you believe me i shrugged listen to the rest of my story and decide it seems i am to lay myself bare to you so you might as well know everything very well i was penniless and without even a name i heard about the death of madame stauffer and that i was being blamed i could not call myself elizabeth lemercier any more fortunately girls like i was then are two a penny no one cares who they are or what they are called we can do without papers or anything so i chose a new name for myself virginie as i had read my rousseau and still dreamed of finding my paul there was only myself in the world to rely on i crossed into france and the rest i suppose you can guess i had tasted enough comfort not to want to become a servant once more but i had few abilities and little to recommend me except that i knew how to attract men i realised quite how easy in lyon when i was walking down the street and this man started looking at me i ended up in a brothel where i stayed for about six months before i had to move on i was discovered it was simple enough wichmann found me i do not think he was looking but he was the sort who would visit brothels whenever he travelled and he travelled to lyon when he saw me and recognised me he also saw an opportunity he said i would have to do exactly as he wanted otherwise he would go to the police do you think that is enough to make me panic it was not by then there was nothing anyone might have asked me to do that i would not have managed however much it might make ordinary people blanch i would quite easily have complied with his wishes had i had some assurance that he would keep his word but i knew he would not he was one of the very few people who knew me from lausanne and he would never let me go so you killed him she nodded i did coldbloodedly and deliberately i stabbed him in the heart and sat and watched him die are you horrified i thought then of simon i dont know i said quietly i changed my clothes packed my bag and left locking the door behind me by the time he was discovered i was well away from lyon i had cut my hair changed the way i dressed i changed my name but kept virginie i liked it it was my secret name the one i had given myself and madame stauffer i do not know i imagine it was her husband wichmann all but admitted that he was still blackmailing him but as his dalliance with me was known by that stage there must have been something else something serious that he could hold over him would a man murder his wife over such a thing if the wife threatens separation and is the one who has brought the fortune to the marriage dr stauffer lived well and worked little many people have killed for less not that it matters i think as i freely confess to one murder there would be no reason not to confess to another had i committed it i did not the police did not look for you yes but not very hard a foreigner found dead in a brothel is not going to be a matter of the greatest importance for them and it is easy to escape the attention of the police if you know how tell me firstly do not draw attention to yourself change the way you dress and look and behave it is easy to become a different person entirely if you wish i was very upset when you recognised me in biarritz you know you are the only person to have done so i even met general mercier at a ball a few months back even though he knew every part of my body intimately he did not for a moment make any connection between me and the woman he knew in nancy how did you recognise me i thought back to the moment i dont know exactly certainly there is nothing physical that recalls what you were all your mannerisms are now those of a countess your voice is different the way of walking and moving it has all changed i didnt recognise you at first that i know what can i say i merely knew but not so certainly that i dared introduce myself in anything but the most ambiguous fashion in case i was wrong it says little for your former lovers that they do not recognise you that is because they were never interested in me only in themselves when they were with me they thought how splendid they were to have such a beautiful woman as their companion when they made love to me they were aware only of what wonderful lovers they were and believe me i made sure they felt that all part of the service she nodded then and now i glanced down to examine my fingernails so i did not have to look at her why do you tell me this you asked besides i need your help that does not come for nothing i frowned not everything has a price you know there are few things which do not in this life a depressing way of looking at things no it is liberating once you get used to it and it shields you from disappointment i let out a huge involuntary sigh one of confusion and almost despair she had defeated me every time i felt i knew her the real woman slipped away and put another phantom in her place now there was this cynical cold murderous vulnerable childlike innocent was this finally seeing into the depths of her soul and its real nature and then i knew i glanced up and saw her face it was a plastic face an actors face able to show any emotion any trait of character but she did not see me looking and was not prepared and i caught a glimpse of something i had seen once before in a restaurant in nancy when i had called her a lady you are lying to me again i am not i did not kill madame stauffer i dont mean that i mean you are trying to push me away from you to disgust me and make me say how monstrous you are you are trying to prove to yourself that all men are the same in the end why so you can keep on living your life without changing allowing no one near you stop this please and why would you want to do that i continued remorselessly let me see shut up she said more intently now not because of me obviously i said you like me but so what i have been around for long enough it must be something else or someone else shut up i tell you just shut your mouth her face was transformed her voice was angry furious but her face was one of pure terror for the first time she looked what she was at that moment i justified all her opinions about men i was enjoying myself i was reducing her to nothing crying raging out of control truly out of control not with some fake passion that she sold by the yard to the highest bidder this was the real elizabeth frightened defenceless and totally alone i had pushed through all her defences at last i was not proud of myself but i could not stop i wanted to push her over the edge someone else that must be it someone who does not fit into that ideal of cruelty who does not deserve the way you treat them and youre frightened not a woman obviously so a man oh my god thats it its obvious really you are in love you have finally really fallen in love she had collapsed off the settee and was on her knees on the floor head in her hands her entire body shaking with sobs as she dissolved into tears of misery and hatred then a wave of compassion flowed over me and i regretted what i had said but only a little the feeling of triumph was too strong i hate you i hate you i hate you i hate you she attacked me flailing at me with her fists hitting me on the face and on my shoulders and chest she meant it and knew how to fight i had to grab her by both hands to make her stop and still she struggled to get free and renew the attack so i bound her to me by putting my arms around her so she could scarcely move and then had to lie on top of her squeezing the breath out of her body as she tried to squirm free listen to me i said into her ear when the struggling subsided enough for me to speak you need to understand a few things here i am your friend i dont know why but i am you do not understand much about friendship i know it is time to learn i do not judge you or criticise you i never have i never will for as long as you have known me you have hidden from me that does not matter either but it is time to stop you have fallen in love with someone serve you right you now know it is not merely a word in a book your life will change forever and not before time you will have to make more room for trust and generosity and heartache and disappointment perhaps dont be afraid of it now can i risk letting you go without meeting the fate of herr wichmann she sniffled which i took to be a yes so i cautiously let her go she immediately came towards me again and sobbed into my shoulder for a good ten minutes im sorry i have never behaved like that before and i also am sorry you have never behaved like that before i said with a smile who is this paragon of all the manly virtues who has stolen your heart where all others have failed there was a long long pause before she finally lifted her face sniffled she even managed to make that attractive and stared at me with defiance mr stone i just stopped myself from laughing are you i mean really dont laugh im not i said really im not although i was its just that i imagined that russian count now hes a handsome rich fellow hes also married besides i do not wish to live in russia but stone is you know middling height a tendency to the plump gruff unforthcoming and old she replied with a watery smile yes so he is the only man apart from you who does not look at me as a potential possession he is kind and has asked nothing in return he likes me i think and dislikes everything that others find fascinating he is completely gauche and uncomfortable but seems to want nothing more than to be with me he is not a shareholder and never will be i really do love him i knew it the first time i met him i have never known anyone like him never felt like that for anyone else does he know about about me no nothing and he must not i want to be loved really loved and by him are you ashamed of course im ashamed i want to be what he thinks i am promise me you will never say anything please i nodded i met you for the first time a few months back i know nothing else about you at all but i am not the problem at the moment drennan is she pulled up her legs and wrapped her arms around them then laid her head on her arms she looked as she should have been a young girl innocent and naïve im so tired she said and i dont know what to do i have to stay here hoping he will come to see me every time the doorbell rings i hope it is him every time a letter comes i hope it will be from him there is nothing i can do about it for the first time in my life i cannot do anything at all except hope classic symptoms you should know surely youve read the books i never thought it would be like this it is so painful i am more afraid than i have ever been always in the past i have been able to take control and think my way through now i can do nothing and he will find out about me i know he will and then i will never see him again well i said that is not necessarily the case i have not walked out in outrage but you mr cort are a liar and a criminal with the morals of the gutter oh thats true i had forgotten that i took her hand and smiled and we guttersnipes must stick together so you can count on me at least and what about you what do you mean you lecture me about love but who do you love about friendship and trust but who do you trust i shrugged your world is as cold as mine the only difference is that i didnt choose my world and now i want to get out of it i have to go i have a lot to do tomorrow stay with me i was tempted believe me i was but i shook my head i think it would be better if i had the singular honour of being the only man in the world ever to refuse you twice now so it is take it as a mark of my esteem she leaned over and kissed me very gently on the forehead then i saw her swiftly brush a tear from her eye good luck my friend i kissed her on the cheek and left i felt utterly exhausted i should have been preoccupied with the fate of empires and the fortunes of the mighty instead the only image in my mind was of a beautiful young woman crying her eyes out chapter the next day i went as soon as it was polite to see sir edward merson her majestys ambassador to france i was fairly certain it would be a waste of time but i had been close to british civil servants long enough to realise that it is necessary to cover all possibilities to stop up all routes by which blame can come and attach itself should everything end badly and i thought it might well a failure on my part to alert the british embassy would undoubtedly become the reason why everything went wrong a strange morning as it turned out an island of tranquillity in the midst of the chaos that was surrounding me sir edward was not there it was the hunting season and he was not a man to allow business to get between him and a quail so i left a message then feeling unsure of what to do next wandered into the nearby english church where all the english expatriates except me gathered as a matter of course every sunday to listen to the word of god and breathe in the aroma of the home counties it was like stepping into a different world the church was a perfect imitation of an english gothic building as reinterpreted by people like my own father in the past fifty years i sat through the entire service the first time i had done such a thing in many years my father may have rebuilt the odd church but he had only rarely gone into them for other than professional reasons the campbells were dutiful in their religion and took me along to st marys bayswater every sunday but were hardly exuberant in their religiosity and school chapel twenty minutes of prayer hymn lecture every morning was such a commonplace that i think most of the boys there were entirely unaware that it had any religious significance whatsoever it was just part of the day a moment where you could drift off in your thoughts and dream of other things but i found that i relaxed the rolling sound of a good hymn badly sung is particularly evocative the sermon had just the right blend of comic irrelevance and tedium to make it pleasurable and the very smell of the place reminded me of england in a manner that quite took me by surprise and to see all those men in their sunday best the women who had taken pains with their clothes but still looked slightly askew in comparison to their french counterparts the rebellious children struggling to remain still so that the whole service was punctuated by the quiet reassuring noise of hand against trouser bottom was strangely calming it was a very long way from the pews to the fate of the buenos aires water supply per cent but they were intimately connected and finally it was all over the last hymn sung the collection plate full the blessings given a cheerful chatter broke out and the organist started showing off his command of the instrument as the congregation began to file out i waited a few moments the vicar was coming in the opposite direction and stopped me you looked troubled young man oh reverend you would not believe i nodded and walked on what could i have said anyway which would have been the better one to start with the coming attack on british finance or should i have said how i was trying to think of a way that a whore whose pimp i had once been shortly after she had committed murder could marry an english industrialist and get away with it or should i have mentioned how i had murdered a man in cold blood a few days previously all i hoped were a little outside the experience of a church of england cleric i walked out of the church feeling bemused i had done everything i could if the world collapsed because no one would listen it was hardly my fault now i had so i believed uncovered this great plot and passed the information on and yet i felt i should do more it was pride if you like no one likes to be powerless and it was patriotism strangely enhanced by my visit to that oddly english church for a moment one of the few such moments of my career i knew why i was doing my job and out of that came a desire to do more to step definitively out of my role as a gatherer of information into something different and very much more difficult but how to go about it i had netscher as a means of access to the french so i thought and i had contacted the russians but the difficulty was how to persuade them to take me seriously i had no official status whatsoever what did i propose to do open negotiations on my own account claim to be the personal spokesman of the empire why would anyone believe me the only thing i had at the moment to claim special status was knowledge and in a very few days when the markets opened on thursday morning everybody in the world would have that knowledge i needed more authority and i would have to go to london to get it so i took the night train yet again and arrived at victoria on monday morning then drove directly to the foreign office to see wilkinson i did not sleep as the train rumbled onwards and the boat gently swung as it ploughed across the channel all the figures all the facts kept on dancing in my head as i tried to work out some way that i was wrong that this wasnt happening i could see no alternative but still i could not quite believe it i had not the slightest idea what sort of reception my sudden unannounced arrival would get would my report have even been read would anyone pay the slightest bit of attention to it would i be laughed at oh dear boy this happens all the time dont worry the bank knows what it is doing or even lord revelstoke is furious that you ruined his weekend and has demanded your instant dismissal all such possibilities had passed through my mind as the train and boat had brought me ever closer to london the foreign office itself is not a place to inspire selfconfidence it was built to intimidate and does its job very well its walls and marble colonnades are designed for eternity the product of a nation which will never fail which will never make mistakes the inhabitants of such a building would never allow the colossal blunder i thought i had uncovered i must be wrong i almost began my meeting with wilkinson by apologising but when i looked at him when he lifted his face from his desk i could see he had not slept he had lines of tiredness across his face the pasty shade that only anxiety or exhaustion can produce cort he said wearily gesturing to my seat good i had hoped you might show up but as you didnt mention it in your letter i didnt think of it until afterwards then i realised there was little i could do in paris without further instructions so yes well im glad you are here although as the bearer of ill tidings you cannot expect many others to be pleased to see you was i correct you doubted it no but that doesnt mean i was right true enough he stood up and stretched at seventhirty this morning a french bank informed barings by letter they would no longer trade in argentinian or uruguayan securities at eight another two did so all the indications are that no continental banks will touch them any more what is the significance of that then it is beginning and will get very much worse the price of south american securities will drop so when barings needs to raise serious money on thursday it will be able to offer little as collateral so in that respect you are so far correct i hope i do not see a look of pleasure at your cleverness how much does it need at the moment at eleven oclock assuming there are no hitches it will be given a credit for by glyn mills which is standing as proxy for the bank of england to prevent matters becoming public that will get it through today i understand exactly how much it will need over the coming week we do not know barings has more than enough assets at the moment true and here you must remember that i know little of finance but i understand they have also received a letter from the russian government asking to withdraw bullion on deposit how much a million on top of that you may have noticed that argentina is in a virtual state of war the value of argentine bonds and securities was falling even before the french banks pulled their little surprise all that is required is that the failure of this bond issue becomes public knowledge and the deluge will begin which is only a matter of time i presume so the bank has had a word with the newspaper editors here and they will say nothing but we cannot influence the french newspapers who may well be already primed come with me please he stood up and put on his thick winter coat which made him look suddenly small and shrunken with worry i have a meeting he said i would like you to listen in and if asked give your opinion you organised that quickly i said as we walked into whitehall wilkinson bundled up as though he was about to go looking for the north pole me less well dressed and much colder my dear boy you have no idea the chaos you have caused i dined with the governor of the bank on saturday and gave him your letter to read he almost choked there have been people running around like headless chickens ever since revelstoke was almost forcibly dragged from his bed the chancellor had to interrupt his shooting weekend the prime minister is sulking and beginning to look menacing not to put too fine a point on it lord salisbury sees himself as a wizard of foreign policy and never considered for a moment that mere money might have any bearing on it whatsoever he is managing to be alarmed and indignant simultaneously and heads will roll unless it is sorted out quickly unless of course his rolls first my heart sank as the gravity of what i had started began to sink in where are we going i asked just round the corner just round the corner was downing street and the house of the chancellor it was still quiet even though it was past nine and the policeman on duty who had been there all night paid us no attention at all as we strolled up the street past the prime ministers house and knocked on the door of number no one answered so wilkinson turned the knob and walked in eventually someone did appear though looking annoyed at being disturbed so early and wilkinson announced himself i believe the chancellor is waiting for us we were led up the stairs to a meeting room on the first floor a surprisingly shabby place decorated with little more than a large table some chairs and dreary portraits of past chancellors all of whom were striving for gravitas and gazing into eternity like statesmen rather than the politicians they were three men were already there lord revelstoke william lidderdale the governor of the bank and george goschen the chancellor of the exchequer a secretary hovered in the background taking notes i was introduced the governor and the chancellor acknowledged me with a nod revelstoke looked as though he had no idea who i was well lets get on goschen said lidderdale the governor of the bank looked up well he said as of this morning we are surviving however it is becoming increasingly clear that this is merely a temporary respite the full news is not yet in the market when it is it will sweep over the city like a tidal wave as far as i understand it barings has shortterm obligations of near seven million that is what revelstoke here has been able to discover it is quite unbelievable no one at present knows what its assets are only that they are falling in value and largely illiquid the management has been haphazard in a way which would bring any firm to grief i expected revelstoke used to plaudits and not to criticism who took praise of his business acumen as a matter of course to protest at this comment the fact that he said nothing at all brought home the seriousness of the situation even more fully to sum it up unless barings manages to borrow a very large sum of money it will stop lidderdale concluded and it will not be able to borrow without a government guarantee to back the loan impossible the chancellor interrupted quite impossible and you know it pledge the national credit to a private firm one which has got itself into such a situation through incompetence it would not survive the commons and in any case public subsidy of the city of london would do as much damage as it was supposed to prevent no absolutely not the city must get itself out of this mess and more importantly must be seen to do so then we are lost lidderdale exclaimed in a tone of melodrama not normally associated with a banker i didnt say the government would not give assistance goschen said tartly merely that it could not be seen to be doing so i can pledge that anything that can be done will be of course but not if it costs you anything precisely lidderdale lapsed into silence and revelstoke who i thought might have taken leave of his senses under the pressure continued to stare out of the window the strange blank smile still fixed on his face he had not said a word and did not even seem to be paying any attention to the proceedings it appeared that he could not accept what was happening that he had concluded he was in the middle of a nightmare and the best course was to do nothing until he woke up it would have been a help lidderdale said if we had known about this in advance here he glared at me being alerted only a few days in advance is all but useless arent you paid for this no i snapped back this is not what i am paid for at all and i informed the foreign office of what i knew some time ago my knowledge then was incomplete but it gave a reasonable warning had anyone paid attention to it that was the memorandum passed on to you nearly six weeks ago wilkinson murmured you know the one you never got around to reading lidderdale glared revelstoke dreamed and goschen drummed his fingers on the table surely a rescue fund could be organised for barings i asked wondering whether it was my place to say anything at all it could be lidderdale said but banks will only subscribe if they are sure that they will not need reserves to defend their own position and they wont be able to do that unless the bank of england can reassure them that it has the resources to maintain convertibility which is the problem precisely at present we have scraped together reserves of twelve million in bullion which has been damnedly difficult let me tell you the bank of france wishes to withdraw three million and has another three on deposit it could demand at any moment that leaves us with a reliable six million and six million of bills are drawn and expire daily if investors panic and decide they want gold we could run out in hours literally hours so the bank is the problem goschen said no lidderdale snapped barings is the problem but barings cannot be shored up unless people have confidence in the bank yes but excuse me i said there was a sudden silence as the bickering grandees stopped and turned to me yes you are forgetting the main point i said which is that this is deliberate that certain people in france are deliberately exploiting this situation to destroy the credibility of london barings has played into their hands and created their opportunity but this situation would not have arisen without a conscious policy as things stand there is nothing you can do you know it the only possible option is to surrender on the best terms you can get a terrible silence greeted these remarks it was as though i had thrown a bucket of ice over the meeting i beg your pardon barings will stop unless it is saved the banks could club together and put up enough money but darent there will be a run on gold because the french and russians are withdrawing large amounts just for that purpose so at present barings will go down taking londons credibility and the entire funding structure of world trade with it the iciness persisted you need more gold and you need it by thursday morning at the very latest and there are only two places you can get it from the bank of france and the bank of russia berlin vienna asked wilkinson it is the standard policy of britain always to ally with the opponents of those attacking us here goschen stirred impossible i think even if they wished to help us which i strongly doubt the bank of berlin was set up to make it impossible illegal for it to operate in the international market if it was done it would take weeks to organise the same goes for austria and the italians have so little gold that they have none to lend mr cort is correct in his judgement there are then two possibilities i went on either france and russia are determined to push this to the end in which case there is nothing we can do we simply have to accept our fate or they can be persuaded to change their minds in which case we have to discuss what they want and give it to them goschen turned to wilkinson your area i think what might they want wilkinson sucked in his breath if this is as serious as you all seem to think they can ask for anything the russians could demand a free hand in the black sea and in afghanistan the french could demand similar independence in egypt the sudan thailand goschen looked faintly sick lidderdale turned ashen revelstoke smiled sweetly and all we have in return i said is the samson option which is to say the certainty that while a catastrophe might destroy us it would also bring calamity to french banking and industry as well and starve russia of credit when it is in desperate need of it i assume in fact i know that there are people in france who do not want such a thing we need to talk to them and get them on to our side swiftly and we need to bring in the rothschilds at the mere mention of the name the atmosphere lightened however much barings had temporarily it turned out eclipsed the rothschilds in recent decades their name was still magical their wealth acumen and the fervent belief that they knew and saw everything through their vast private network of informants and correspondents made them figures to be admired or reviled in equal measure with the rothschilds on your side anything was possible with them as an enemy disaster was certain the head of the english branch at the time was natty rothschild a stout fellow who had been running affairs in this country for more than ten years he had wide political interests although he had never got on with gladstone and had demonstrated on many occasions his patriotism it was rothschilds not barings which had stumped up the cash for disraeli to buy the suez canal rothschilds again who intervened in the eighties to stabilise egypts finances and then to float a loan from which it derived little profit a bizarre combination of the jewish banker and the catholic cardinal manning had acted together to resolve the crippling dockers strike in all in all natty rothschild had demonstrated a solid appreciation of his duties and how to merge these with the need for personal profit in only two areas did emotion get in the way natty rothschild hated the russians but he detested barings more he arrived after lunch and it was remarkable to see how even the governor of the bank and the chancellor deferred to his opinions he was not a warm fellow although i had heard that he could be gregarious and charming in company rather his manner was taciturn with an aloof ness it was hard not to see as disdainful and arrogant certainly poor lord revelstoke withered even more when he walked into the room so he should the battle for supremacy between the two houses was now over for ever and barings had lost all that remained to discover was whether rothschild would react with magnanimity or vindictiveness first goschen briefed him on the details then lidderdale and then i was asked to present my interpretation throughout rothschild listened absolutely silently stroking his closely cropped beard every now and then but otherwise barely moving as i finished he poured another cup of tea and stirred methodically fascinating he said eventually in his thick deep voice quite fascinating are you quite sure of all this i am sure of the facts i replied naturally the interpretation is my own but it fits what has been happening in the markets this morning he nodded but at the moment the urgent problem is how to stabilise the situation here mr cort advocates surrender goschen said sourly i blushed if i am correct you would destroy britains strategic position throughout the world if the stakes are so high then surely the government must intervene i have already explained why that is impossible goschen said and why it would be counterproductive this must be resolved within the city of london itself mr cort rothschild said ignoring the chorus of protest from the others at some stage you must tell me a little more about who you are and why you are here for the time being these others here seem to think you have a right to speak tell me in your own words what you recommend the city must organise a fund to rescue barings or at least to get it through the next few weeks until it can realise its assets and stop in an orderly fashion that can only be done you would only have the time to do that if the bank of france reversed its policy of withdrawing bullion from london and if the russians stopped pulling gold out of barings better still if they signalled their intention of depositing some more in the circumstances the rate of interest they might demand could be high and not payable solely in money but at the very least we need to know their terms may i ask if your bank has heard anything about this nothing has been communicated to me but that is no surprise there are no close relations at the moment between us and the bank of france there are many in france who detest the rothschilds as much as they detest the english the question is what to do about it as it seems the british empire is insufficiently important for the government to risk its own reputation then i like you feel we have no alternative but to explore other possibilities and so it was settled i was to return to paris as soon as possible with a letter to alphonse de rothschild and instructions to discover what if any price the french would accept at the same time i was to organise a veritable insurrection amongst the moneyed elite of france have them storming the barricades of the banque de france demanding calm in the markets and i was to do this without citing the authority of the british government in any way this was to be a deal between bankers it must not have anything to do with foreign policy there would be no concessions there whatsoever my chances i put them at about none i had a matter of days to reverse what seemed to be a major move in french foreign policy and cobble together an unprecedented alliance amongst people i did not know even natty rothschild seemed pessimistic he walked out with wilkinson and me then asked if i would take a turn with him around green park before i headed back for victoria a thankless task mr cort he rumbled as we walked in the direction of green park it was chilly and getting dark and there were few people around except for the occasional office worker and governesses pushing prams if you succeed no one will know if you fail you will undoubtedly be blamed that is reassuring thank you which brings up the obvious question why do you choose to do this it is a strange life you lead evidently he knew more about me than i thought i shrugged i dont know i wasnt a good banker a very inadequate answer i like it then i like making people do things they do not wish to do i like discovering things i am not meant to know i think i like taking bad actions and turning them to good ends it is so often the reverse but i can take lies and betrayal and turn them into patriotism not the other way round not for me no i see i think you are going to need all your skills in the next week you will be trying to mix foreign policy and finance and control them through your arts are you skilled enough do you think i dont know my cousin will give you all the help he can and a great deal of advice as well you may trust him i ask only one thing if you fail let him know ill be damned if the house of rothschild is going to be brought to ruin by barings chapter i arrived back in paris at five oclock on tuesday morning i was exhausted i crossed the channel twice in one day had scarcely slept for two days and had been in meetings much of the rest of the time i should properly have launched into action but i could not i did manage to get someone to take the message to alphonse de rothschild sent another to m netscher but that was all i could do no more without sleep so sleep i did and dare i add i slept well quite extraordinarily well in the circumstances the meeting with rothschild and netscher began after lunch i very nearly disgraced myself by being late but i arrived at the rothschild mansion in the eighth arrondissement with a few minutes to spare there were four people there the committee for the defence or so i came to call them in my mind all people who wished to resolve this if only they could do so without bringing national opprobrium down on their heads all were fatalistic and had a low opinion of their many colleagues of politicians and of the people of france in general they were fools was the general opinion who understood nothing of money who had no conception of how delicate and refined were the financial structures which so efficiently delivered the comforts and necessities on which all people increasingly depended had it been left to politicians said netscher then the bulk of mankind would still be scraping a living in the fields dressed in rags and prone to starvation and disease they needed to be saved from themselves so far so much agreement it was clear that all present who represented some of the most powerful financial institutions in france were prepared to put their weight behind the request that france assist the bank of england but it was equally clear that none of them would do so unless that request was going to be accepted for myself said alphonse de rothschild i am prepared to commit half a million of gold to the general defence of the banking system i have already cabled my cousin to inform him that i will transfer the money to his house today netscher smiled that safeguards the rothschild family my dear alphonse he observed it does little else you cannot expect any more of me as yet rothschild retorted not until there is an overall agreement remember if there is a run on the banks in england it could well trigger a panic here as well we cannot afford to dismantle our own defences bank of france or nothing is that right i commented they all nodded i do not know the governor i said m magnin netscher said a good man started as an ironmaster curiously enough still a bit of the peasant about him but solid he is a man who fully appreciates the value of sound money and he understands how weakness in the credit markets can affect industry that is the trouble in fact why because i would have expected him to have responded already all his instincts i feel sure would be to bolster london it is neighbourly and it is good business he has not done so which suggests he is acting under instruction he is not a free man you know the bank of france is not a private company like the bank of england its sole shareholder is the government and ultimately m magnin must do as he is told so we are talking about government policy here are we netscher sighed i do not think so believe me mr cort i am we all are i am sure trying to find out but so far i have discovered nothing here rothschild smiled in a superior fashion fortunately the magic of the house of rothschild still has some life in it he said quietly in fact i do believe i can say what is taking place this policy was sold to rouvier about six months ago the foreign ministry is standing by as it considers it foolish not to take advantage of any weakness which britain might display the trouble at barings has been brewing for several months and the foreign ministry has been quietly preparing the ground it all developed out of the blunder by bismarck three years ago when he denied russia access to the berlin credit markets paris took up the role and has advanced large sums of money to the russian government this naturally has created a bond of friendship not to say a common interest i would even venture to surmise that some sort of military understanding might come to pass in due course obviously in that case a weakening of great britain would be mutually beneficial but russia needs investment desperately unless it gets credit its army is back in the seventeenth century how can destroying the credit markets help a question so good i am afraid i cannot answer it i have approached the russian embassy but they refused to speak to me the pained surprise was obvious no one refused to talk to a rothschild however they have agreed to talk to the british government which in itself indicates how very much is riding on this matter and how well prepared they are but that would be sir edward merson i did point this out and they have no desire to talk to sir edward at all as he would not understand what was being said no you have to produce someone more senior and authoritative than that i would suggest goschen he can make a deal and he has the authority to persuade the prime minister to accept you expect the chancellor of the exchequer to grovel in public i would expect him to arrive so silently and quietly that no one is ever aware of his presence in paris to talk to the head of the bank of france obviously by merest coincidence no doubt the deputy head of the bank of moscow is in paris visiting his relations and rouvier of course i and m netscher would be happy to attend as well i am sure where somewhere they will not be noticed chapter i had not forgotten the matter of elizabeth and her diaries but the rest of tuesday and much of wednesday morning was used up preparing stones telegraph operator was back in business so i was at least able to communicate faster and if my own entreaties had not been enough the state of the markets proved more persuasive hour by hour the news had been getting worse more and more people suspected some hideous crisis was in the making credit was drying up suspicion was already beginning to focus on barings which was publicly giving assurances that nothing was amiss while privately panicking and trying to raise as much money as possible members of the family pledged their houses horses works of art debts and favours were called in assets were offered at knockdown prices but all that did was stoke the speculation that something was going very badly wrong bit by bit panic began to spread interest rates rose volumes in the markets began to oscillate wildly prices followed time was running out goschen decided to come to paris he had no alternative the meeting would be in the last place anyone would ever suspect that an event of such importance would happen when i asked elizabeth agreed without hesitation and immediately went into high activity laying in food drink and everything else that might be needed it was only a little different from a meeting of her salon the topics of discussion would merely be more serious and after many hours of labour i checked my watch my appointment with drennan was coming close it was time to go it was a long shot admittedly but it was worth a try certainly i did not wish to risk confronting drennan directly i knew him too well he had beaten me last time we met and i had no confidence that he would not do so again it would have been good to know exactly what he was up to but i had concluded this was a luxury i could do without the last thing britain needed was an espionage scandal inflaming french public opinion against all things english just at the moment when france was being asked for assistance indeed i was more and more sure the two were connected i arrived in the rue daru about half an hour early approaching from the boulevard de courcelles and then down the rue pierrelegrand and went into an apartment block on the corner facing me over the road was the alexandre nevskii cathedral eastern and entirely out of place in that strict and regimented quarter of apartment buildings the differentsized domes and gold mosaics looking as though they had been dropped from the sky by accident it had been built a few decades previously for the russian community in paris as a sign of their presence and to give a focus for their social activities and had proved a singular success even though the local residents apparently did not entirely approve i climbed up the servants staircase at the back of the lobby all seven flights of scrubbed cheap wood set against poorly painted walls in contrast to the richly polished carpeted appearance of the residents staircase until i reached the corridor at the top which led to the tiny cubicles that the servants slept in under the eaves halfway along there was a skylight which i opened it was noisy but i knew there would be no one to hear and i levered myself out onto the roof and manoeuvred into a position where i had a clear view of the cathedral i kept my head low and scanned the small square in front of the entrance with my binoculars a faint sound of singing told me there was a service going on a few people were hanging about and i thought i saw what i was looking for a man well dressed sitting on a bench reading a paper another by the door looking at the order of service pinned up in a small glass case two more talking by a tree to the left my heart sank it was all so amateurish drennan was too old to fall for that a man reading a newspaper in the semidark people idly chatting in the cold he wouldnt go near the place one glance and hed take fright and then i saw him he too was coming early walking along the street bundled up hat pulled down over his head dressed anonymously not scruffily not respectable like a shopkeeper or clerk only his walk long and loping gave him away he also wanted to get there first to be able to see me before i saw him hed taught me that i had anticipated him he took no precautions all the methods and techniques he had so painstakingly and painfully drilled into me he didnt use he didnt look around didnt pause to check the landscape did nothing he just crossed the street walked across the little square began to climb the steps i was puzzled he was coming to see me but he was taking no precautions almost as though we were on the same side as though he considered me no threat the man by the order of service moved to intercept him going close taking him by the arm i saw the bench man drop his newspaper and begin moving forward the conversationalists started to spread out one to each side forming a circle behind his back drennan turned his hand went into his pocket i heard nothing it was too far away but he fell onto his knees looked up the newspaper man came up close behind him stretched out his arm to point at his head and drennan collapsed onto the stone steps of the cathedral it was done one problem at least had been taken care of i was back at elizabeths house washed and changed in time to welcome wilkinson and goschen when they arrived in john stones coach from the gare du nord at eight oclock chapter it was a soirée to remember one by one they arrived and i was only sorry that it had to remain entirely confidential it would have had more of an impact on elizabeths reputation than the arrival of the prince of wales had done not that many streetwalkers entertain the chancellor of the exchequer the british and russian ambassadors the french foreign and finance ministers the governor of the bank of france and a smattering of rothschilds and other bankers at one go not that it was a social occasion these were men of affairs and it was what they were good at i might even hazard a guess and say they all enjoyed themselves from nine in the evening to five the next morning they huddled in corners disappeared in pairs or groups into side rooms shouted at each other looked tense angry worried elated relaxed and made jokes then began the cycle of meetings anew those who were not engaged gathered round elizabeth like chickens round a hen and she distracted them with her conversation and charm creating an atmosphere of the possible in a way only she could manage her chef the incomparable m favre excelled himself and her wine cellar impressed even m de rothschild i am firmly of the opinion that the slow onset of calm she generated did more to ensure an agreement than any other factor for my part i had little to do but i was given the liberty of attending the private meetings of the english delegation and the rare occasions when the meeting more or less by chance became more general it was however made clear that i was to offer no opinions of my own and i rarely had the opportunity of talking to any of the russian or french party count gurunjiev did however take my arm shortly after he arrived a word mr cort he said quietly it seems you were right he said a man was shot this evening as he was about to go into the russian cathedral he had no papers or identification of any sort on him but he answers your description perfectly well and he had a loaded revolver he caused no harm i hope no after your warning we were not prepared to take any chances he was accosted tried to run and was killed we are currently persuading the police it was a murder among thieves and best forgotten about im sure they will agree there have been too many of these incidents recently for them to want more publicity what is puzzling is what he planned to do he went off to pay his compliments to elizabeth leaving me with only a deep sense of relief all i had to do now was discover where drennan had lived and then collect the diaries and i had time enough for that now the urgency had gone out of one part of my life at least and now the meeting proper was under way the english were in elizabeths salon the french took over her library the russians were closeted in the sitting room the dining room served as neutral territory where all could talk freely a ridiculous amount of time was lost in small talk enquiries about the voyage from london earnest entreaties that good wishes be communicated to everyone from the president to the tsar to wives and sons and daughters there was talk about hunting and politics as they slowly got the measure of each other sidled towards the main subject which all knew must arise sooner or later then backed away again it was necessary all this it set the tone gauged emotions and nerves then all of a sudden as though some hidden decision had been taken some sign given count gurunjiev began i fear mr cort was trying to pull the wool over my eyes when we met the other day he began i discover that what he so skilfully described as a small matter of accounting is nothing of the sort and how is that goschen asked i do not understand finance in that mr cort was quite correct but you make a mistake in thinking i do not understand politics or diplomacy his little matter of accounting seems to involve a fundamental shift in russian foreign policy and of french i think that is an exaggeration here it comes i thought theyve been talking about it theyve agreed a joint strategy rouvier i knew had been bombarded by the rothschilds all day one banker after another presenting the case for intervention for reversing the policy and offering who knew what inducements he was the only senior french figure who wasnt there delayed by the chambre des députés someone said will be along when he can leave no doubt those who wished to pursue the matter and go ahead had also been putting their case as well the count was about to give the first hint of which side had triumphed i imagine the interest rate that the bank of france would charge for lending gold to the bank of england will be very high naturally you cannot expect the russian government to accept a lower reward better than saying there could be no deal at all but he could still set the price so high that it would be unpayable i never expected for a moment that would be the case goschen said a little grumpily of course your assistance would be rewarded and acknowledged in public if you so wish can you give me any reason why we should in any way give assistance to great britain from our point of view or from yours i can think of many really it is in russias interests to weaken britain as much as possible surely india the ottoman empire the mediterranean the balkans in all these areas our policies are diametrically opposed that is true but i do not think your government believes that afghanistan is the major problem you face at the moment and what would you say that is bismarck has gone the treaty you had with germany went with him you have no allies no friends and you have a gigantic border facing the most powerful army in the world and england will come to our aid in exchange for a few bars of gold no no more than it will help france recover alsace but you as a military man know that the russian army is woefully unprepared for modern war it has no railways to ferry troops and supplies not enough factories to produce armaments a navy which would scarcely trouble nelson even if the sailors were well trained you are a vast empire and a military pygmy you have the men but lack the more important aspect of modern warfare which is money good point i thought and nicely put goschen was revealing a combative streak i had not suspected he possessed what we offer is to let the french assist you they seem open to the proposal you want to buy us with other peoples money britains banks are supreme in the world for the past twenty years they have made a fortune out of south america that as you know has now come to an abrupt end so they will be looking for new markets they will crowd france out of any they choose to concentrate on we offer the french a free hand in russia we will offer only a token competition for forms sake france will be able to grow its banking sector strengthen it in ways it could not otherwise do and you will get all the money you desperately need the point is goschen continued if there is a general financial crisis france will not be in a position to lend you a single centime if the banks of london are crippled so will many french banks be capital will evaporate loans vanish like morning mist if you want a modern army or navy then you must leave your money in barings vaults what is more you know this perfectly well the russian frowned i have been told similar things by my advisers the doctrine that you must strengthen your enemy in order to defeat him i find a bizarre one it is nonetheless the case i could name you at least six french banks which would be badly wounded if barings fails all hold barings paper all have loaned russia money there must be more than that you paint me a picture of paradox where it becomes logical for us to help our worst enemy but in return our worst enemy must help us go on here it comes here comes the bill i thought you are afraid of russian influence you must help us increase that influence you fear our interference in the ottoman empire you must make our interference more effective you fear we want to build a fleet to challenge you in the black sea the straits the mediterranean itself you must help us build a fleet that can defeat you that is the price mr goschen the russian navy needs a shipyard on the black sea coast capable of building and maintaining everything that floats the latest weapons the best facilities if you agree to that then i will believe you are serious and we can then discuss barings im afraid that would be impossible goschen replied instantly even were we minded to do so it could not be done no government would survive such a thing any which tried would fall within weeks and be replaced by one who promised to oppose it absolutely in that case i fear we have difficulties said the count sadly i have tried to be reasonable you are no doubt as aware as i that we could have asked for very much more if such a small thing cannot be done then i can offer no more i too have people to satisfy i cannot propose something which seems like a humiliating failure i pulled wilkinson aside keep him talking i said quietly whatever you do do not let him leave i have an idea just make sure hes here when i get back i took elizabeths carriage which clattered through the streets at a breakneck pace hurtling through the streets at the sort of speed which had pedestrians cursing me and the poor horses sweating profusely by the time we pulled up at the hôtel du louvre i didnt bother with announcing myself just ran up the stairs all four floors and along the corridor to stones suite and hammered on the door you must come youre needed we were back in the carriage a few moments later back at her house twenty minutes after that we had been gone an hour and the russians were losing their tempers by the time we arrived so it must be said were goschen and wilkinson who felt like fools having to make polite and meaningless conversation all that time a private word please i said and the russians nodded as we trooped out this is john stone chancellor i said i think he might be able to help goschen nodded how is your objection to a russian naval base fundamental that is to say is the problem the base or the consequences of people knowing about it both it would dramatically shift the balance of power in the near east i suppose we could live with that but the public would not wear it wed be massacred and if no one knew how could anyone not know dont be absurd i nodded to stone who i now saw for the first time working as a businessman and by heavens he was impressive he had only had a rapid account from me and even with that he managed to take over and dominate the meeting with extraordinary speed if the russians want a base then they have to get it from britain practically speaking he said we are the only country which could mobilise the resources for the sort of thing they must have in mind enough to maintain a fleet here goschen grimaced supplies equipment engineering shops clearly a major project they dont have the capital the workforce or the expertise to design build and run it nor i must say do the french have enough spare capacity to provide it the germans do but wont nor can we he went on or cannot appear to and there would be outrage in britain against any country france say which did is that correct goschen nodded it would be tantamount to an act of war if the french built the russians such a thing well stone continued thoughtfully it could be done im sure that french banks would float the bonds to raise the money on behalf of the russian government it could be a general fund for development there would be no need to specify what it is for if the interest rate was high enough i could form a new construction company registered in somewhere like belgium with shareholdings held in trust by banks across the continent as for the workforce the crucial personnel would come from yards across europe directed at a distance by my companies it would be perfectly possible to set up a structure so impenetrable that no one could ever find out who owned it and the russians could hail it as a triumph of russian engineering a sign of their industrial progress i cannot speak about the strategic consequences of course that is outside my area of expertise but if you are prepared to allow a base to be built then it could be done without anyone knowing who was responsible that was a summary the actual discussion was much longer and far more technical goschen was both a money man and a politician and wanted to know exactly what stone was suggesting the more he heard the more stone dealt with his objections the more i could see him regaining confidence and determination eventually goschen sat back any further comments wilkinson shook his head and there was silence then i suggest we talk to the russians once more mr stone if you would be so good as to come with us i was left out of that one the deal was done the french and the russians had both got what they wanted and the end of the crisis was in sight all they had to do was send the telegrams to deposit money in the bank of england and it would be over i could still hardly believe it britain had got off lightly astonishingly lightly you look tired my friend elizabeth said she had come when she heard the others marching down the corridor im afraid youve been a guest in your own house this evening yes and my chef might resign tomorrow the amount these people eat and drink is astonishing it all seems quite goodtempered though i think theyve been thoroughly enjoying themselves i said its what they love more than anything i dont think it would suit me at all i yawned lord but im tired ill sleep well tonight there was a ring at the doorbell and a few moments later a footman came in with a card on a tray please show m rouvier into the sitting room she said then turned back to me that is where the french are just in time to hear what has been agreed good i gather you visited count gurunjiev a few days ago yes and i apologise for mentioning your name i did it very discreetly though i gave no hint at all of knowing anything about you other than saying i was your friend thank you but please dont do it again i promise fateful words a few moments later the door opened and goschen and wilkinson came in followed by stone and rothschild who looked worried problem i asked m rouvier is apparently shouting at the governor of the bank of france telling him he had no right to agree to anything without his approval and that he does not give his approval to put it another way he wont take the deal and if the french wont the russians wont either come gentlemen let us go and talk this over they trooped out again leaving me with stone and elizabeth he went and sat opposite her and smiled gently well this is a problem he said you mean you didnt foresee it what do you mean i shook my head and frowned thinking furiously a whole host of little details previously unconnected seemingly random seeming to be sticking themselves together into new and troubling patterns and then there it was undeniable this is all you isnt it i said from the start i dont think i understand when did you come up with this scheme to create a crisis and force a solution that allowed you to do as you wanted he smiled you overestimate me mr cort that does not happen often im not used to it what do you mean my scheme the first time i met you you mentioned that the government had forbidden you from working for the russians now you will be able to do so with their blessing and appear a selfless patriot at the same time the banks to organise all this they will be same as the ones leading the assault on london credit international banque de bruges this whole business could not possibly have taken place without you knowing about it long in advance stone who had been examining a chinese bowl on the mantelpiece turned around i havent broken it yet you see she said and i have given it a place of honour i am flattered he said with a gentle smile stone put it carefully back in its place then stood back anxiously to make sure it wasnt about to crash to the floor im sorry mr cort you were saying the russians and the french could have destroyed london but they are settling for a shipyard and a few bond issues and by pure coincidence the owner of britains biggest arms company is in a hotel down the road ready to oblige and you came up with this staggeringly complex scheme in the time it took to take a cab from the louvre to here how could anybody think of something that complicated in a matter of minutes im very good at my job not that good not without thinking it out in advance i did not create this situation he said quietly barings was going to fail anyway that has been obvious for months i merely made sure that i benefited and that my country benefits as well what do you care about your country it may surprise you if i say i care a great deal the russians were going to get a shipyard it was merely a matter of who built it and profited from it they will be bound ever tighter to france and that will make germany i held up my hand that was wilkinsons argument as well does this come from him as well was this his doing a civil service plot to rewrite britains foreign policy against the wishes of the government and the electorate you sound very pompous for such a young man we merely agree on certain matters and you will discover there are many people who will be well satisfied how things have turned out he said goschen no not him nor the prime minister but this is how britain governs itself and how its empire prospers and how governments take decisions the electorate does not wish to know about business needs to be protected from politicians i could say that the country does as well and you make a lot of money out of it i do that is my job but how did you get the french to agree the russians everybody benefits you know and the russians do like their bribes count gurunjiev required prodigious amounts of money of course he also has a fine triumph to take back with him to st petersburg i came very close then to saying what the count had done with stones money but stopped myself and me i didnt even need bribing no but you played your part very well do not think that your skills and intelligence are not appreciated there is little point continuing this you know i like to get things clear the government had to be panicked into realising that this was a plot that had its price rather than the random chaos of the market and i did that i was essential for that it had to be noticed in time so you got me to do it with just a little hint here and there from people like netscher to point me in the right direction so i would work out what was going on frighten the life out of the government stone nodded you deserve everybodys thanks but i wasnt finished yet there was something else as well it niggled me so thats the russians the french are a different matter how did you plan to control them the banks could be bought off with the promise of a free run at russia but whats going on now what about rouvier i paused and looked at him and finally understood oh my god its out of control isnt it rouvier isnt part of the plan and hes about to wreck everything it does seem that m rouvier is acting unreasonably at the moment stone said quietly you assumed that rouvier would do what the banks and the governor of the bank of france told him what they told him was in the best interests of the country yes and it is anyone but an idiot could see that unfortunately hes an idiot it does seem that he dreams of some grand personal triumph he blocks the bank of france the russians will follow suit and the deal is off do you have any idea what you have done not all gambles pay off unfortunately is that all you can say he shrugged perfectly calmly i couldnt believe it it was his calm emotionless way of confronting what was happening that bowled me over mingled with that was my fury at what he had done to me that was a weakness i know but he had deceived and manipulated me from beginning to end was that even why wilkinson had sent me to paris was that in his mind even then did he plan this so very far in advance i did not get the chance to ask the door opened and rouvier came in already wearing his winter coat and carrying his hat and gloves dear countess i come to take my leave of you and to thank you once again for your hospitality he said as she rose from the sofa to have her hand kissed alas i wish the conversation had been as agreeable this evening as is customary in your house i am sorry you were disappointed minister she replied can i not persuade you to stay a little longer rouvier had a look of such selfsatisfaction that it was almost intolerable it is very late and i think everything that can be said has been more importantly i believe i will have a busy day tomorrow a very busy day one moment minister i said i still did not know precisely what i was going to say but i knew that the moment he was out of the door all was lost mr cort sir henry cort i work for the times newspaper he looked puzzled by that as well he might what could you possibly say of interest to me i was completely without emotion the fury at stone was so intense that i didnt even notice it it was suffusing my being so much that it was all i was i had a choice and i took it fully aware of what i was doing i can offer no excuse and no explanation which would not be false i wanted to beat stone and hurt him i wanted to show i could retrieve a situation when he had failed whatever the price whatever was necessary to do it and there was only one way may god forgive me i did not hesitate minister you are a politician you have been prime minister once you may very well have the honour of that great position once more i wish you well i do not wish anything to stand in your way public spirit is a fine thing and you have demonstrated over the years that you are a highly competent administrator thank you young man replied rouvier with a look of amused surprise on his face unfortunately i will ensure that your career comes to an end unless you consider what i have to say the bank of france and most of the banking community of paris desire to stave off a dreadful crisis which will plunge the whole of europe into a terrible slump the bank cannot do so unless you give it permission you will give that permission and why should i do that he asked in mocking astonishment you want something else the evacuation of egypt the withdrawal of the royal navy from the waters off siam and a free hand in the lebanon i am afraid bankers have poor vision and think only of money i can see further than they i am saving them from their smallmindedness that will not be possible in that case we have no more to talk about im afraid we do i said we must also talk about the countess von futak elizabeth froze she did not move but i could see her eyes widening and she took up that position unnoticeably to anyone who did not know her as well as i did that signified tension watchfulness fear stone did not react at all not yet rouvier smiled ah dear elizabeth i do hope you are not going to threaten to expose me i really do not think that it would do my career any harm at all only the puritanical english could think of such a thing in france we yes yes i know all about that having conquered the countess von futak would indeed be a fine thing but having paid for her out of government funds is another matter she is a very expensive woman as count gurunjiev and many others will tell you you didnt think you were the only person she was skinning do you surely not a man of the world like you you must have realised you were only one of heaven knows how many people she whats the word entertains he shot her a look of growing alarm stone still did nothing but stood hands in pockets looking at elizabeth as he listened to my words unable to take his eyes off her i wanted to see the disgust and the revulsion spread into his face he had everything i was damned if he was going to have her as well rouvier shrugged dismissively a small scandal which will be forgotten if i become known as the man who restored france to preeminence shes not a countess of course youve been spending fifty thousand a month on a common streetwalker from nancy didnt you realise what you paid ten thousand a night for any soldier on the eastern frontier who wanted her has had for a franc she is also a murderer wanted for the coldblooded slaughter of a client in lyon he was pale now but still undecided elizabeth was sitting with her hands in her lap quite unmoving her selfcontrol still total except that i could feel the numbness spreading through her the chill of despair as she heard her life her reputation dissolving as someone she trusted perhaps the only person she had dared to trust tore her life to shreds it was a numbness that was in me as well do you know of a man called drumont i said quietly he stared at me he is a journalist a detestable man twisted violent hateful i must say i cannot even be in the same room as him without feeling sick but he has extraordinary ability he hates all republicans all politicians the delight he will get from grinding you into the dust will be very great destroying people is more than duty for him it is a pleasure can you imagine the headlines how he will enjoy himself how your enemies will delight in hounding you from office france may triumph minister but you will not taste any of the fruits of victory m drumont will see to that there is nothing that can be discovered he said airily do you think i gave her receipts she keeps a diary i said wearily it is very detailed in every respect and she was a foreign spy i can prove that also i have details of payments made to her by the german military via the bank of hamburg she passed on pillow talk for whatever price she could get you will soon be able to read about it yourself in his paper in a couple of days i imagine what do you want three million sterling in gold bullion to be deposited with the bank of england immediately you may if you wish make an announcement via the bank about international responsibilities how france has decided to act to guarantee the stability of the money markets say whatever you wish to gain the maximum advantage from the situation but the money will be deposited or the diaries will be published you are asking the impossible i think not a word to the governor of the bank of france next door is all that is needed you cannot possibly think i will reverse myself like that even to save my own skin my reputation will be enhanced you will have pulled off a masterstroke enhancing frances international standing with one small gesture and at no cost at all it cant be done it can be so what is your decision minister ridicule and possible prosecution for corruption or a quiet but powerful reputation as the most skilful treasury minister the republic has ever had i need time to reflect you dont have time you will go next door to your colleagues and agree to the deal they have so carefully worked out you will go now he was calculating fast not even able to look at elizabeth then threw down his hat and gloves and strode out of the room i thought i had won but wasnt sure that was not what was on my mind in any case i did not really care i wanted to beat stone that was all show him i was as clever as he and take away from him something he wanted at the same time and i didnt care how i did it elizabeth sat looking suddenly so tired so reduced trembling at what i had done but unable to show any other emotion she was in shock at the speed and ease with which i had torn her world to shreds and trampled it into the dust because i had not hesitated not tried to spare her in any way she was merely a weapon in negotiations which i had used without hesitation her worst enemy had never betrayed her on such a scale she couldnt even look at me could not raise her eyes to look at stone standing still by the fireplace eventually she lifted her head but to stone not me i imagine you will want to leave now mr stone she said so quietly i could only just hear her you realise i am sure that everything mr cort said is true stone put his face in his hands and breathed deeply i was no longer in the room for them i didnt exist i stood up neither of them noticed when i got to the door i turned one more thing go away cort he said wearily leave this house i will but i need to say this elizabeth i am sorry i did what i had to but at least i have taken care of drennan for you he is dead i will recover the diaries and deliver them to you unread and here stone whirled round what it is not something that concerns you mr stone i think it is you say drennan is dead i frowned in puzzlement you know him what happened he was shot this afternoon stone turned pale oh my god what have you done you killed him i didnt kill him the russians did it was part of the deal you wanted part of the price it made them trust me enough to listen to me why you told me your servant had robbed you he said to her ignoring me you didnt say what had been taken i assumed it was some jewellery i asked drennan if he could help ive known him for years it was to be a surprise to show you he looked at me in total disbelief you killed him he repeated just trying to make the world safe for business i said its what everybody wanted i left leaving the final part unsaid the bit about why stone seemed almost relieved when i had tackled rouvier almost as though he was glad he did not have to i couldnt put the pieces together i am still not sure besides it was nearly three in the morning i was tired perhaps i was imagining things it really was over rouvier concluded that a small guaranteed triumph was a better bet than a bigger prize that might be torn from his grasp three hours later the cables started going out to newspapers and agencies that the bank of france and the bank of russia in a spirit of international solidarity and to ensure the smooth operation of markets had agreed to deposit extra gold at the bank of england it turned the tide barings collapsed and the family was all but ruined but it resurfaced in a new guise soon enough although it was only ever a shadow of its former self the markets recovered from their nasty fright and settled down to normal business after a month or so the citys reputation was damaged the prestige of france and russia climbed but londons position remained unchallenged and the beginnings of a mutual understanding began to emerge russia and france signed a secret alliance and french money began pouring in to build up the russian economy and army london banks often enough didnt even compete john stone got to work the construction of the port of nicolaieff on the black sea produced only token and ineffectual protest from britain surprising considering that such a thing might ordinarily have been enough to start a war it proved that russia was not as backward as everyone had thought considering that it was able to mobilise the resources and technology to construct such a vast enterprise without outside help and in the spring of john stone married the countess elizabeth hadikbarkoczy von futak uns szala at st oswalds church in malpas shropshire i was not invited to the wedding i scarcely came across them for years although now i have finally returned to england because of mr wilkinsons death we inevitably meet occasionally we are formal and polite we never talk about his wife part three venice chapter i was not intended by family education or natural instinct for a life of or in industry i still know surprisingly little about it even though my companies own some forty factories across europe and the empire i have little real idea how the best steel is smelted and have no more notion of how a submarine works my skill lies in comprehending the nature of people and the evolution of money the dance of capital the harmony of a balance sheet and the way these abstractions interact with people their characters and desires either as individuals or in a mass understand that one is the other that they are two separate ways of expressing the same thing and you understand the whole nature of business a few months ago i read a book by karl marx on capital elizabeth gave it to me with a smile on her face a strange experience as the authors awe exceeds even my own he is the first to understand the complexity of capital and its subtlety his account is that of a lover describing his beloved but after describing her beauty and the sensuality of her power he turns away from her embrace and insists that his love should be destroyed he could gaze clearly into the nature of capital but not into his own character desire is written in every line and paragraph of his book but he does not see it in my case i surrendered to the excitement that came over me when i glimpsed the extraordinary process by which food turned into labour into goods into capital it was akin to a vision a moment of epiphany all the more surprising because it was so unexpected it was a strange process this metamorphosis of a curates son into a businessman and deserves some description not least because it involved events now completely unknown i am considered a secretive man although i do not see myself in this fashion i do not guard my privacy with any unusual jealousy but feel no need for all the world to know my affairs only one thing have i hidden which is of any importance this account will i hope explain some elements of my life and may give the information needed for fulfilling the requirements of my will it is an aidememoire and i put down here all the details i can remember while i conduct my search for a definitive answer i write sitting in my office in st jamess square and all is quiet downstairs my elizabeth is curled up in front of the fire reading a book as she usually does in the evening before going to bed i can imagine her yawning her face illuminated by the firelight entirely beautiful and calm as there is no one there she will be wearing her reading glasses when she hears me coming down the stairs she will whip them off and hide them it is her vanity i would tell her it means nothing to me but having to use them so annoys her that i do not wish to trespass on her little secret for the rest she is at peace i have given her that and it is the best and most worthwhile thing i have ever done worth more to me than all the factories and money i have accumulated over the years i will not have it disturbed but i must settle this other business once and for all it has been gnawing at me for some time and i am no longer young enough to afford any delay i will find the truth and will settle my mind i do not fear that it will disturb elizabeth greatly as likely as not the story ended long ago i wish to know that is all i will write as my researches progress i have begun my enquiries they will bear fruit sooner or later i am i am sorry to say unused to not getting what i want in that lies my reputation for arrogance and i suppose it is probably deserved it is necessary a humble businessman is about as much use as an arrogant priest and if you are not by nature selfconfident then you must appear so or you will fail it is not a quality that will ever be sung about by poets but like all the darkness within us such characteristics shame guilt despair hypocrisy have their uses this pensiveness is foolish i know it began simply because of the death of william cort he asked me to come and see him in his wasting state and i went travelling down to dorset where he had lived for the past forty years a mournful meeting but he was resigned to his end and not unhappy life had been a burden to him and he was looking forward to being rid of it he gave me his message it weighed on him i made some remark changed the subject as quickly as possible then i dismissed it from my mind but it would not go the thought came back to me nestling in the back of my mind ambushing me at the strangest of moments and when i was sitting with tom baring trying to come up with an insurance policy to safeguard my companies in case of accident the thought came into my mind once more it would be an appropriate denigration i thought to tame my unease by using it so cynically a block on opening the books so that the great hole in the finances is not revealed to shareholders not watertight nothing can be but enough to enable an ingenious solicitor to tie everything up in knots for as long as is necessary my beloved shareholders would be alarmed and panic if all was open but then shareholders are sheep which is why they invest in little bits of paper rather than in something real why they whinge and moan if something goes wrong but would never test their own mettle against the markets why they congratulate themselves on their acumen if their bits of paper rise in value due to the labour of others it is the great unspoken passion of all businessmen they may battle against their workers criticise bungling governments try their hardest to bankrupt and ruin their competitors but they all invariably have some respect if only small for each of these but shareholders disgust them and if they could find a way of ruining them all they would do so with pleasure and satisfaction managers of public companies are like slaves as much as the workers they in turn employ they may serve their masters well be obsequious and conscientious but deep in their hearts there is loathing i feel it in myself and i see it in others i can detect it in theodore xanthos as resentment and greed take hold of him he will test himself against me sooner or later i have expected it for years at the moment i have committed my entire fortune to one extraordinary operation to build battleships which no one has ordered for a government which has not enough courage to tell the truth to safeguard a people which does not want to pay for them i have calculated that they will change their minds and i am prepared to back my judgement and if they dont i can ruin them all they are corrupt greedy little men and their grasping nature gives me the power to bend them to my will should they thwart me it is exciting what business should be when it rises above mere production and strives for grandeur naturally the shareholders would take fright if they knew what i was doing although i have long believed that people who are not prepared to risk their money should not be allowed to keep it so i would protect myself from my shareholders with my niggling concern turn it to my advantage show it who was the master i visited henderson had a sentence put into my will to my child whom i have never acknowledged the sum had to be big so that it would affect all the other legacies make it impossible to wind up the estate unacknowledged because nonexistent i did not even mention it to elizabeth whom i tell most things because i never considered it would be necessary dying has never been something which has struck me as even a remote possibility that is for others even visiting cort at his last did not make me think that sooner or later i would become like him all i felt when i looked at him on his bed so thin and weak hardly able even to speak was a distant interest concern a little sadness for him but no identification with his plight no in due course the provision would become redundant the will would be recast that would be the end of the matter writing down the words did not make me the master of the thought though instead i found i had given it life it preyed on me even more old memories came back jumbled and confused some all too real some no doubt imaginary it distracted me and i hate distractions i have never sat and waited for a problem to resolve itself on its own i issued my instructions began enquiries and started to jot down these notes to order the past sort out what was real and what was not the source of my concern lay in venice then and now the city in europe which has the least interest in anything industrial or commercial despite the fact that its wealth was built on trade every bit as much as its buildings rest on wooden piles driven deep into the mud of the lagoons like a grand english family fallen on hard times it has turned its back on commerce preferring genteel decay to a vigorous restoration of its fortunes at the time i visited it i almost admired the old lady if ever a city could be so described venice in the late s merited such a title for her refusal to compromise with the modern world i was there on a tour my first and only holiday until elizabeth began her futile attempts to convert me to the pleasures of idleness i had had a certain good fortune a year or so before my uncle had died childless and unmarried and rather than leave his small fortune to my father whom he utterly despised he left it to me certainly this showed a desire on his part to sow dissent in our family as my father lived only on a small stipend and my sisters he pretended did not exist not a penny to them and the entire amount of to me with strict instructions that i was in no way to distribute give or otherwise alienate any part of the said sum to any other member of my family nasty of him and had my father been less gentle than he was uncle tobias might have had his way and begun a family feud possession in this fashion gave me no pleasure so i resolved to dispose of the money in a way which would have the old man rolling in his grave gnashing his teeth in rage why did he despise my father so much that story like that of so many family disputes went back a long way my father had married poorly scandalously poorly in fact for he had married a woman of no family or wealth she was even worse the daughter of people who had arrived on these shores from somewhere in spain only a few decades before and had even been born in argentina herself she was to my eyes fabulously exotic and to uncle tobiass totally unacceptable how he knew this i do not know as they never met he refused ever to come anywhere near her a pity as old rogue that he was he could not have failed to be charmed by her but she was not english of that there was no doubt and to the end of her life spoke with a noticeably foreign accent although of such a mixture it was impossible to discern what it was this made her all the more charming to those who liked her all the more repugnant to those who did not i am quite well aware that the memory of her predisposed me to elizabeth when we met she also communicated to me a tendency to be different because of her i have never fitted in quite comfortably to this country of mine much as i love it i could i suppose have become totally conventional in response but some of the fiery defiance of the mother transferred itself to the child and i instead did the opposite i have in my life followed my own course wherever it might lead and thus have been able to grasp opportunities others have not even noticed when i received uncle tobiass money i realised that the usual options available to a young man of small fortune were not open to me wine women and gambling would not do because uncle tobias had dissipated a far greater fortune on such things in his youth and would have thoroughly approved of my recklessness it would have meant the triumph of his side of the family donating the money to a worthy cause was also out because although he loathed my fathers gentle brand of christianity he was a resolute high tory himself and would have held that at least the money was helping to keep the lower classes in their place then one day in london lunching with a friend i hit on the perfect solution if there was one thing uncle tobias hated more than the common people it was the commercial ones the traders the industrialists the factory owners the bankers the upstart new orders the jews with their crassness and breathtaking wealth ruining the country with their gaudy vulgarity their contempt for everything that was proper and decent and ordered and now taking over the country in politics as in money it was his defeat at the election by a liberal factory owner if only of gloves that finished him off england was ruined all that was good in the country had been destroyed there was no point in continuing six months later he expired in the midst of sexual congress with the parlourmaid on a billiard table at the age of seventynine at which point it was discovered that his fortune net of debts was very much less than anyone anticipated and that i was the sole beneficiary after a certain amount of thought i gave all the money to precisely one of these upstarts so they could continue the labour of reducing uncle tobiass england to rack and ruin in brief a highly speculative and utterly hopeless early venture in imperial mining that was being run by an associate of my mothers family who was not only jewish but had a reputation for highly doubtful honesty in this popular report was only part accurate joseph cardano whom i knew ever better for a quarter of a century until his death in was indeed jewish but he was also perhaps the most honest person i have ever met had i known this about him at the time of course i would never have entrusted uncle tobiass money to him at this point i thought the matter was taken care of and resumed my life as it had been before then at the beginning of i received a letter from mr cardano informing me of certain important developments concerning my investment it had quite literally struck gold and uncle tobiass legacy was now worth many times what it had been i was in fact tolerably wealthy and as most of my money was earned in a fashion by myself i felt quite free to give a sum equivalent to the legacy to my parents and to my sisters thus causing i hope uncle tobiass mortal remains to give a few more spins in their coffin in the meantime i had turned my thoughts to dissipation but found it did not suit me overmuch my parents had brought me up too well and besides my head was illsuited to it i found the life of pleasureseeking frivolity too dull to endure i visited joseph cardano once more this time to place my money in the most advantageous but safe fashion and prepared to leave england for a tour of the continent in the hope that this would provide inspiration for some suitable way of filling in my days by that stage i had spent considerable time with his assistance and often enough in his offices studying money and its infinite variety i had started with the times but found the daily reports of stock prices and interest rates of insufficient interest so i became something of an apprentice to mr cardano in whose company i discovered the great secret that multiplying money is remarkably easy once you have some to begin with the first five thousand is the most difficult the second less so and so on as uncle tobias had got me over the difficult stage there was little to stop me the only thing i have never understood is how others are blind to this obvious fact although i suppose i must be grateful that they are on the whole i stick firm to the conclusions i formed then the stock exchange is merely an elaborate means for the wealthy to extract money from the less well off it is not those who buy and sell shares who prosper it is those who insert themselves in between the two sides who grow rich once i realised this and tutored by mr cardano grasped the poetry of capital formation of share issuance and flotation of how to make capital be in two three or four places simultaneously so that all profit accrues to you and the losses to someone else only then did my interest begin to be aroused even so i found this all too abstract it has never been my desire to amass money i find possession a dull business rather i had the desire to do something with it in england commerce is divided strictly into three parts the world of money the world of industry and the world of trade while i was at mr cardanos side i began to ponder how vast fortunes might be made by blending those three worlds into one i should also mention that i was married by that stage my wife was good and kind we did not love each other and we never had but she did her duty and i mine and i held firmly to the belief that this was all that was required i can say that nothing i did harmed her and so were i to be strictly rational i would say that my behaviour was unobjectionable to all but the religious moralist but i am aware that religious moralists can make a good case and i accept that my behaviour fell short we married when i was twenty and she eighteen she died six years later of pneumonia shortly after my return from my travels i cannot even remember why i chose her except that i accepted that i should my mother disapproved although she did not say so perhaps she was offended that i married someone with a nature so very different from hers quiet docile polite dutiful obedient she would have approved very much more of elizabeth had they ever met but then i thought mary was everything a wife should be so she was she was not alas everything a woman could be after only a short while i could find little to say to her and found little in what she said interesting but i did not expect anything else and i do not believe i ever made her aware of this i spent more time with my fellows less at home i lived two lives and treated my home as little more than a place to sleep my wife accepted this and was not discontented she did not wish to accompany me when i decided to travel around europe the idea of leaving her home or london or england filled her with dismay she begged me not to go and when she saw i was displeased urged me to go on my own and so eventually i did although my attempts to persuade her of the joys and pleasures we would have together were quite genuine i do not believe she missed me in the slightest her daily routine was slightly disrupted to be sure but my place in it was so small she easily adjusted during the eight months i was away we corresponded once a fortnight and neither of us said anything which was more than formal considerate and polite we got along perfectly well and i considered myself happily married chapter i was not a very good tourist travelling alone i found wearisome and when solitude is broken only by statue after statue painting after painting the joy of contemplating the great masterpieces of the human spirit begins to dissipate quite quickly i was not one of those hermitlike creatures who needs no man besides mr baedeker for company although i do not need to be surrounded by others in order to feel alive i do need some conversation and distraction otherwise all becomes too much like study pleasure becomes duty and dare i say it one church begins very rapidly to look pretty much like another in this way i passed down one side of italy and back up the other again travelling by train when i could and by coach and horse when i had to i enjoyed it although my memories have little to do with the great walled cities or the many acres of canvas i viewed noted and sketched in those few months i cannot remember a single painting although i do remember trying hard to be deeply impressed by them at the time venice was different not least because on my first day there i made the acquaintance of william cort whose sad life has intersected with mine on and off ever since i came in from florence on one of those wretched trains which arrive at somewhere close to dawn i had had little sleep during the night but it was too late to go to bed especially as i was wide awake by the time my trunk had been recovered loaded onto a boat and taken off to the hotel europa where i had booked a room i should say that at this stage the city had made next to no impression on me not least because the weather was unusually for september grey and drab it had canals well and good i had heard about those and birmingham has canals as well but the sense of wonder and amazement which one is meant to feel did not come to me all i wanted was somewhere to eat a little breakfast venice is or was then decidedly short on such places it was not long since the austrian occupation had ended and the city had finally become a part of the new italy hope for a new dawn was in the air no doubt but the effects of more than half a century of occupation and neglect were manifest it was a dull place which had still not thrown off the simmering resentments of the past many had befriended the austrians and were shunned for it others had become too close to revolutionaries and had suffered for it society had been disrupted many of the best had left others had become impoverished trade had dwindled the legendary riches of the past were mere memory this was the place i had dutifully come to visit thinking more of the images of canaletto than of the present reality i wandered off in quite the wrong direction and passed by those few eating places i saw too befuddled to make up my mind and enter so i walked on turning this way and that but not a shop or coffee house or restaurant or taverna was there now to be seen few people either it seemed to be a ghost town eventually i rounded a corner and came across a perplexing sight in a small but pretty enough square by an old wooden door some twenty feet high in an ancient ivycovered wall i saw a young man well dressed in a dark suit and with a hat in his hand he was rhythmically and with some force bashing his head on the door occasionally producing an almost musical staccato sound by slapping his hand on it as well at the same time i heard an incantation that came from his lips damnit damnit damnit damnit an englishman i stopped and looked at him from a distance trying to figure out a reasonable explanation for his behaviour rejecting the idea of an escaped lunatic as being both too easy and insufficiently interesting after a while and when he reached some sort of internal resolution simply resting his head on the door and sighing deeply all passion spent i ventured to speak are you all right can i be of any assistance he looked round at me his head still resting on the wood of the door are you a plumber he asked no a bricklayer alas do you have any knowledge at all of carpentry or stone masonry all subjects that have passed me by to think that i wasted my time at school on virgil when i could have been preparing myself for a life of gainful labour youre useless to me then he sighed once more turned round then slid down the door to sit disconsolately on the ground the he glanced up the builders havent shown up he said again were two months behind schedule autumns come on and the roofs come off theyre impossible a nightmare time is a concept they simply do not understand this is your house palazzo and no its not im an architect of sorts im supervising its restoration i had a choice this or building a prison in sunderland i thought this would be more fun wrong wrong and wrong again have you ever felt suicidal a chatty fellow but i did wish he wasnt sitting on the ground like that i didnt feel like joining him in the dirt and it was awkward talking down onto the top of his head he had fair sandy hair which already showed signs of thinning on top a small man slightly built but neat of movement and quite engaging in his manner with a broad mouth and easy open smile how long have you been waiting about an hour dont know why i bother theyre not going to show up today i might as well go home if you could tell me of somewhere to eat i would be delighted to offer you breakfast if that would help to ease the pain he jumped up instantly and held out his hand my dear fellow i take it all back about your being useless come along william cort by the way thats my name call me william call me cort call me whatever you want and he shot off left down a dark alley right at the end across a small square moving as fast as a ferret i had barely time to introduce myself before he started talking again trouble is im stuck here until the place is finished and at the rate were going i might well die of old age before i see england again i dont reckon they had any idea what sort of condition the place was in when they bought it they i asked panting a little in my effort to keep up the albemarles you know albemarle and crombie i nodded had he asked i could have told him the magnitude of the banks capital the names and connections of all the directors it was not a serious challenger to houses like rothschild or barings but it had a reputation as a good solid family bank of the oldfashioned variety entirely wrongly as it turned out it stopped in and the family was ruined bought this place without even looking at it and sent me off to do what was necessary lord only knows what they want it for but the client is always right my uncle wants to build their country house ysee so he couldnt displease them and say it wasnt a job for us besides it was supposedly good for me my first solo job its enough to make me want to go into the church i dont recommend it i replied i think you need more patience than you have shown so far probably doesnt matter anyway im going to die here i know it so you are an incurable optimist as well as an architect i suppose the two go together he didnt answer but turned into a dank and unwelcoming doorway which i would never have guessed was some sort of public eating place inside there were just two tables one bench to sit on and no people at all elegant i commented he smiled and by far the best eating place around this quarter he said i take it youve not been here long a few hours well then you will soon discover that the magnificence of the city conceals the utter degradation of the inhabitants there are few restaurants and those are poor and hideously expensive the wine generally tastes like vinegar the people are lazy and the accommodation horribly overpriced and uncomfortable i long for a good piece of roast beef sometimes venice seems to have won a place in your heart then he laughed it has no i mean it i can complain about it for hours list all its faults in relentless detail grumble incessantly about every facet of life here but as you notice i have come to love the place why ah it is magic his eyes lit up with something of a twinkle thats all i can say i think it is probably something to do with the light which you have not yet witnessed so there is no point in trying to persuade you in a short while tomorrow maybe when the weather picks up maybe this evening you will see maybe so but in the meantime id like some breakfast ah yes ill see what i can do and he disappeared into a back room from which there came after a while the sound of banging pots and shouting all sorted he said cheerfully when he returned but they were quite reluctant to serve us you have to plead with them luckily i come here quite often and so do the builders when they show up the thought put him into a mood of melancholy again do they often do this to you i asked oh goodness yes i will have a meeting with the foreman one evening he will look me in the eye and swear blind they will all be there at eight sharp the next morning we will shake hands and that will be the last i see of any of them for a week and when i complain the reaction is generally astonishment that i should expect anyone to show up on st sylvias day or the morning of a regatta or something like that you get used to it after a while you dont seem very used to it this morning no today is special not least because there is no roof on the place and i have an engineer coming to advise on strengthening the walls that sort of thing isnt an area i know much about im afraid i can design buildings but what exactly keeps them up is quite beyond me the coffee and bread arrived both equally grey and unappetising i looked at them doubtfully not one of the great culinary capitals venice mr cort commented dipping bread in cup with enthusiasm you can get decent food but you have to look hard and pay high they probably have fresh bread out there somewhere but they dont think highly enough of me yet to let me have any they keep it for their own he swallowed a lump of bread then waved his hand enough what are you doing here passing through staying a while i am without plans i said airily i go hither and thither as i wish lucky man for a while anyway i was thinking of staying here for a few weeks at least but i cannot say you are the best salesman for the city ten minutes of you and any reasonable man would pack his bags and head for the railway station he laughed you will find we like to keep the place to ourselves we the ragbag of drifters idlers and adventurers who wash up in this place there are few foreigners in venice you will notice the railway and the end of the occupation is beginning to change that but as there are few places for visitors to stay when they get here there is a limit to how many people will ever come an interesting comment which i placed in the back of my mind for the future as i wandered the streets over the next few weeks i realised that cort was right there was an immense market for decent accommodation of the sort that would shield the traveller from the beastliness of venetian life the french i knew were well ahead in this area constructing gigantic palaces in the centre of cities which offered every luxury to travellers prepared to pay well to avoid any real contact with the place they were visiting fed by the railways organised by thomas cook any hotel placed at the end of a line in an appealing destination could hardly fail to prosper even at that stage i turned down in my mind the idea of involving myself with mr cort in any commercial way i learned early that liking someone trusting someone and employing someone are three very different things mr cort was going to stay firmly in the first category i have always had the tendency to pick people up from all manner of places my fortune and my judgement are one and the same being agreeable and being of use are not necessarily incompatible but they are not identical either cort was an amiable man intelligent and amusing honest and decent as well but to give him any position of authority would have been foolish he was too prone to despair too easily discouraged he could not even control a dozen or so recalcitrant workmen he had some desire to be successful but it did not burn so strongly in him that he was prepared to overcome his character to achieve it he desired peace more alas he achieved little of either nonetheless we passed a pleasant half hour together and i found his company charming he was a good raconteur and a mine of information about the city so much so that i invited him to dinner that evening an offer he accepted until he remembered that it was wednesday wednesday dottore marangonis at home in the café at home in a café he laughed venetians do not often entertain in their home in six months i have scarcely passed the front door of a venetians abode when they do entertain most do so in public tonight is marangonis entertainment why not come i will happily introduce you to my limited acquaintance such as it is i accepted and cort looked guiltily at his watch goodness i shall be late he said jumping up from his seat macintyre will be furious come and meet him i expect you will hate each other on sight he shouted a farewell through the door jammed his hat on his head and headed off i followed saying why should i not like him or he me i consider myself quite amiable normally you are a human being cort replied and thus to be detested if you were made of steel were you something that could be honed to perfection on a mechanical lathe were your movements capable of accurate measurement to onethousandth of an inch then macintyre might approve of you otherwise im afraid not he hates all of humanity except for his daughter whom he built himself out of gun metal and ballbearings yet he is assisting you simply because there is a problem to be solved he offered i would never have asked even though he is the only person i know of here who is qualified to assist oh lord hes there already we had turned the corner into the little street which contained the palazzos entrance and outside the heavy wooden doors which some fortyfive minutes ago had been battered by corts frustrated head stood a man with a ferocious scowl on his red face certainly friendly was not a word that sprang to mind he had immensely broad shoulders so wide that he barely fitted into his suit he stood with legs apart heavilybooted feet planted like trees in the mud hands thrust deeply into his pockets he stamped a foot in frustration turned and battered on the door with his fist before he saw us cort open this door dye think ive no better things to do today cort sighed nervously as we approached good of you to show up macintyre continued acidly so kind of you to plan an amusement for me this morning to fill my idle hours sorry sorry cort muttered the workers didnt show up again you see and that has something to do with me no sorry may i introduce mr stone i have newly made his acquaintance i held out a hand macintyre ignored it gave me a cursory nod and renewed his assault on poor cort who stood there wanly im conducting an important test this morning and i postponed it just to assist you i would have thought the very least you could do would be stop complaining i interjected suddenly or the rest of your morning will be lost as well very rude of me but not half as offensive as macintyre was being i calculated that he simply liked bullying people when he was in a foul mood and that matching him rude for rude was the best way of dealing with the situation poor cort was too cowed to do much to protect himself and that was his choice but i did not see why i had to endure it as well macintyres flow of eloquence dried up immediately his mouth snapped shut and he turned his gaze remarkably blue eyes i noted clear and large on me there was a heavy pause and then he let out a loud pfah and thrust his hands back into his pockets again very well he grumbled let us get on everything about him suggested a man of strength and character certainly he was uncouth but england owns an excessive supply of the well bred and polite macintyre was a man to get things done and they are much harder to find he was not one to waste time on flattery or to cover over awkward situations with a finely turned phrase a man to avoid at a soirée but invaluable in a battle or a factory cort meanwhile had fished out a huge key from his pocket and had unlocked the great and ancient door pushing it open by leaning his whole frame against it it gave way with a screech that sounded like the dead in torment and macintyre and i followed him in as in many venetian palazzi so i discovered the entrance way gave onto a small courtyard this was where the domestic business of the place had been conducted on the other façade giving directly onto the rio di cannaregio was all the architectural finery to impress the passerby what that looked like i did not as yet know but the sight from the courtyard was terrifying i could just see that it was a building of a sort although it looked as though it had been hit by several cannon shells rubble lay all around piles of brick and stone lumps of wood a rickety frame of wood had been erected around the structure presumably to allow the workmen access but it hardly looked capable of supporting the weight of more than one or two at a time half a dozen cats eyed us suspiciously from atop a pile of wood that was the only sign of life cort surveyed the mess sadly i looked astonished macintyre paid it no attention whatsoever he marched straight over to the scaffolding scooping up a ladder as he went and began climbing cort reluctantly followed and i watched from the ground macintyre was remarkably agile and fearless some sixty or seventy feet in the air skipping over crumbling masonry occasionally bending down or kicking a lump of brickwork with his boot sending fragments cascading down to the ground i was about to go up and join them when he returned back to earth looking only a little less grumpy than when he started cort followed a few moments later somewhat more gingerly well asked cort knock it down what the whole thing flatten it start again never seen such rubbish in my life im surprised its still standing cort looked alarmed im commissioned to restore it not demolish it he said the owners bought a sixteenthcentury palazzo and that is what they want when i am finished theyre idiots then maybe so but the customer is always right macintyre snorted the customer is never right ignore them give them what they need not what they think they want nobody needs a palazzo in venice cort said a little pettishly and when i am wellenough established i might take your advice for the moment i have one client only and cannot afford to lose him by demolishing his house wait then and it will fall down anyway or if you prefer i could come back this evening he paused and surveyed the scene carefully one small charge in that corner where the two central loadbearing walls meet he pointed and there would be nothing left in the morning at all then you could show what sort of architect you really are cort blanched at the idea then looked at him carefully i never realised you had a sense of humour i dont its the most sensible course of action macintyre said gruffly as though offended at the very idea of whimsy but if you are resolved to waste your clients money for them i am quite determined then what you need is a supporting framework of girders three by six should do it inches i mean tapering to two and a half by four on the upper floors perhaps less ill have to do the calculations extending up the back and side walls to form a framework inside the structure that will take the weight of the roof not the walls which are too weak to support it youll have to build down to dissipate the weight under the level of the foundations he paused and looked thoughtful i suppose it does have foundations cort shook his head doubt it he replied for the most part these buildings rest on wooden piles and mud thats why the walls are so thin if they were too heavy theyd sink macintyre pursed his lips and rocked forwards and backwards in thought he was enjoying himself i observed in that case youll need to sink some but at an angle to the vertical to take the weight of the girders and roof and spread it outwards otherwise youll just push the walls out instead what you need ysee is an internal frame so that the walls can be little more than a curtain covering the real business will it be strong enough of course it will be strong enough i could balance a battleship on top of a properly strutted framework that wont be necessary macintyre grunted once more and drifted off into his own train of thought muttering periodically as he whipped a pad of paper from his pocket and began jotting down hieroglyphics look he said eventually thrusting the notes under corts nose what do you think the architect studied it carefully desperate to understand what the older man was proposing eventually his face cleared and he smiled thats very clever he said appreciatively you want me to build another building inside the existing one precisely lightweight efficient and fifty times as strong you wont knock down the old one but you do get to build a new one best of both worlds expensive irons not expensive even here sottinis in mestre will supply it putting it up wont be cheap and you wont be able to rely on the halfwits you employ at the moment best get rid of them and find a new team again i can make suggestions if you wish corts look of gratitude was overwhelming macintyre pretended not to notice thought id suggest it thats the trouble with architects know everything about the right sort of gothic window nothing about loadbearing walls pathetic good day to you and he marched off not responding to our farewells goodness i said something of a force of nature there cort wasnt listening he was glancing up at the crumbling walls and back down to the notes macintyre had thrust into his hand before leaving back and forth went his eyes which narrowed as he calculated this is clever he said really clever itll be cheaper stronger and quicker in principle oh dear what i wish i could claim it was my own idea that would really make my uncle take notice of me i noted the remark the wistfulness of it in my experience i commented it is finding the best advice and using it which counts not coming up with the ideas yourself not in architecture he replied or with my uncle he sighed i just hope macintyre can keep his mind on it once hes solved a problem in his head he tends to lose interest besides he does tend to drink a little he was rapidly adopting the air of someone who wanted to be left alone although what he had to do was unclear not wanting to impose myself any further i thanked him for his company and the unusual introduction to venice he had afforded after requesting directions i left him standing in the rubble and made my way back to my hotel chapter i slept for many hours a dreamless sleep although it was far from my habit to be so idle during the day i put my head on my pillow at around ten in the morning and did not awake until early evening which annoyed me greatly i had missed an entire day and now faced a bad nights sleep into the bargain i forgot completely corts invitation to join him and his friends for dinner which didnt matter too much i had neglected to discover where the event was to take place and in any case had no desire that evening for company rather i wanted to view the place i had travelled so far to visit as so far i had seen little except the railway station a few streets and a pile of rubble pretending to be a house so i walked and was captivated as never before or since in my life i am not by nature a romantic person considering my small reputation in the world it is surprising i even bother to say this i do not skip a heartbeat over a sunset however striking it may be rather i see the light of a star refracting in particular ways through the atmosphere and giving off predictable if pleasing light effects cities have even less impact they are machines for generating money that is their entire function created for the exchange of goods and labour they either work or do not work well london was and still is the most perfect city the world has ever seen efficient and directed to this one aim not diverting unnecessary energy or resources into public finery as paris does even london though may soon surrender its crown to one even more singleminded and ruthless in its pursuit of wealth if my impressions of new york are accurate venice in contrast is without purpose there is no exchange of goods there no generation of capital what remains is a shell of a past manufactory which has long since become obsolete it too was created by trade it is nothing more than capital petrified but the capital had fled leaving only a corpse whose soul has departed it should have been abandoned left to rot into picturesque ruin as the venetians themselves abandoned torcello cathedral and all once they had no further use for it so i believe and i have argued my case with many a sentimentalist who waxes eloquent about the glories of the past and how human life has degenerated under the impact of the modern age nonsense we are living at the highest point human civilisation has ever reached and it is people like me who are responsible for it yet i still have my venice problem everything i say about it is true and yet that first evening i walked without a break for food or drink or rest for near seven hours forgetting my map not caring where i was or what i was looking at i was hypnotised overwhelmed nor did i understand why it was not what most people find attractive the vistas and palaces churches and works of art these i appreciate well enough but not to the point of passion i would talk of the spirit of the place although to do so would risk seeming foolish and as i have indicated the most obvious examples of its spirit were degenerate and corrupt nor was it the light as for much of the time i marched in darkness nor the sound as it is the quietest habitation i have ever visited the average english village of a few hundred people is a noisier place i cannot offer a convincing explanation of my own although when i told elizabeth of my reaction she suggested that it was because i did not wish to resist its charms that having been disappointed by florence and naples and all the other places i visited i wished to be seduced that i fell not for what it was but what i needed it to be at that particular moment and that having generated such feelings in me it became associated with that feeling for ever after i had tried to be dissipated and failed tried to be an aesthete and failed and now i was attempting no project at all and succeeding beyond my expectations it is as good an explanation as any other although had i given her a more detailed account she might have come up with a different interpretation i ended back near the campo san stin which contained corts palazzo and there had a most unusual experience i had what i took to be an hallucination brought on by tiredness and irregular food i am minded to mention it at some risk of arousing amusement in any who might read this because it has a bearing on the rest of my stay in the city i hope it is clear already that i am not of an hysterical disposition i am not susceptible to delusions and have never had any time for the mystical or supernatural even in this particular case i was sure both before and after that i was witnessing only a phantasm nonetheless i could not fault it could not discover any proof that it was merely an illusion playing out before me in brief it was this at i believe somewhere after midnight i was on a bridge over what i later discovered to be the rio di cannaregio it was handsome enough the canal curving away to my left the looming shapes of the buildings rising up and reflected on the still surface of the water it was very dark as there was no lighting at all not even from the windows of the houses which for the most part were shuttered i stopped to admire the scene and to consider yet again whether i was going in the right direction to get back to my hotel which in fact i was not as i wondered i stared idly back towards the grand canal leaning on the iron balustrade then i heard a noise a sound of laughter and sensed at the same time an immensely powerful feeling of not being alone i turned around swiftly venice is an exceptionally safe city but i did not know that at the time and saw a most peculiar sight there was a torch burning in a socket on the wall of a palazzo some thirty yards away from me although i swear it had not been there before and underneath there was a small boat which contained one man standing amidships and singing i could not see clearly in the flickering light but he seemed short wiry and almost ethereal as though you could see the stucco of the building through his dress coat and breeches his song was not one i had ever heard before but it sounded at one and the same time like a lullaby a lament and a love song delivered in a soft but slightly reedy voice extraordinarily beautiful and affecting although circumstance perhaps made it seem more so than it was i did not know to whom he was singing one window i now noticed was unshuttered and slightly open but there was no light within and no figure to be discerned the only human being in sight was this man who was dressed in a manner more suited to the eighteenth century than to the present age i saw this without any sense of it being unusual or strange all i knew was that i desperately wanted to know what the song was who was the singer and whether the woman being so serenaded surely that was what was taking place was receptive to his song who was she was she young and beautiful she must be to produce such a wistful sadness in the mans voice i moved to get a better view making enough noise to carry over the water the man stopped singing not abruptly but rather as though he had finished his tune and turned to look at me making the slightest of bows in my direction my first impression of age was correct he had no beauty his features were not horrible but they were terribly old he seemed as old as the city itself i watched immobile as he settled down in the boat picked up the oars and began to row away from me and then the spell broke i walked then ran after him over the bridge and left up an alleyway which ran parallel to the canal hoping to overtake him he was not rowing very fast and get a better look after a hundred feet or so another turn took me down to a small jetty and i ran there and began looking up and down there was nothing the boat had vanished and as i stood there wondering where he had gone i heard faint laughter echoing over the water i was shaken by this by my own reaction as much as anything and turned round to retrace my steps when i got back to the bridge the windows of the palace were now firmly shuttered and looked as though they had not been opened for years there was nothing else to do but to leave and make my way back to my hotel which i reached after many false turns about an hour later i slept finally at about four in the morning and slumbered until ten but it was not an easy sleep the atmosphere of that place had suffused my mind and like some childish and irritating tune that lodges itself and will not be shaken out the images of those few moments repeated themselves in my head all night chapter why do i write this i have spent many an hour many an evening at these notes now it has no real purpose and i am not used to doing anything without a purpose only elizabeth can manage to make me waste time although with her nothing is a waste it is worth any sort of nonsense or frivolity to make her happy see her smile to have her turn and say thank you for putting up with that for her i even learned to dance although never well but i am content to behave like an elephant to see her graceful to feel her body move as i hold her in my arms i am not even aware of others i can honestly say that not once have i thought of how others might admire her and envy me although surely they do but my happiness with her has been different from the sort i found in venice we have never experienced together the sort of irresponsible carelessness that i tasted that one time inevitably i am sure when i met her i was too old to make a fool of myself in the way that only the young can manage and her life had been too hard too much of a struggle ever to be carefree no we have made something very different a world that is safe and warm we have done grand things exciting things pleasurable things together but never foolish ones such things are not truly in my nature and she knows too well the dangers of them although perhaps a side of her misses the excitement the need to live on her wits she gave something up when she married me in a way that i did not i still have the pleasure of taking risks she put aside a part of her character and it may have been a greater loss than either i or she realised perhaps that is why she is now disobeying me i refused absolutely her suggestion that she help me track down where this money was going to identify the people being paid through these strange disbursements in newcastle she pointed out that i could hardly use anyone from inside the company itself i said no absurd idea and so it was for the wife of a man like myself but not for the woman she had been whom i thought was long since dead she went ahead anyway took herself off to germany and returned to live off her wits disguising herself as someone else returning to a way of life i thought was gone for ever i was so angry so furious when she told me that i completely lost control of myself and as often happened when her iron will collided with my equally strong determination we fought why should she not help me she was my wife did i really know anyone who could do it better could i think of any better way all of which was irrelevant what troubled me most was the light in her eyes as she confronted me the light of excitement of adventure that old side of her the one i had always feared the one which could not possibly be satisfied with the company of an old man she has never given me the slightest cause to distrust her she has had the occasional lover i have no doubt but she has never hurt me they were nothing more than passing amusements moments of distraction this was different it appealed to her sense of danger and her need for real excitement she said it was for me but it was for herself as much giving way was one of the most difficult things i have ever done and one of the best i quelled my jealousy subdued my fears and let her do as she wished i let her help me although our life together has been built on my helping her but it was hard i knew could distantly feel the pleasure she had in acting thus because i also had once been free to do anything i wanted without having to look forward more than a day or backwards more than an hour and that is why i write about venice because by seeing how much i remember those days i can judge better how powerfully her own past draws her now i was sombre and illhumoured when i finally descended for breakfast after my bizarre night with my apparition only to discover a great reluctance on the part of the hotel to supply me with anything to eat at all eventually they condescended to provide some watery coffee and stale bread the sight of which reminded me that i had eaten nothing of substance for nearly a day and a half that in itself went a long way towards explaining my bad mood headache and also the delusional nonsense of a few hours previously i needed a purpose and had none so decided i might as well take care of business registering myself with the british consul and picking up any mail that he might be holding for me that at least was easy enough francis longman lived in a small apartment with an office attached a few streets away from san marco and welcomed me in with enthusiasm he was a short fat man with a squeaky voice which gave him an air of perpetual excitement his chins wobbled dramatically every time he became agitated and as i learned over the coming weeks he was agitated quite frequently and on the least pretext his abode did not embody the gravity i expected of one of her majestys diplomatic representatives being dark and disordered and covered in books and papers his situation seemed somewhat sad and while i was gratified to be received with such warmth i did find it somewhat peculiar my dear sir he exclaimed come in come in i thought initially that he must be mistaking me for someone else but no longman was merely bored to tears and had little enough to do as he told me at some length once i had signed the book to confirm my presence and cast myself officially under his and the government of her britannic majestys care while in the city nothing to do here you see he explained once i had been settled down quite against my will into an elaborately carved chair in his office its virtually the life of a recluse i enquired about his duties none to speak of he said and a salary commensurate with the responsibility i keep a fatherly eye on british subjects here and once a quarter compile a report on economic activity for the board of trade but there are few enough visitors and little enough trade a useful task i said drily indeed venice is not as interesting as it was ive noticed how many people are there here british people that is never more than a hundred at the moment he paused to glance at his register i have sixtythree on the books most of those are merely passing through only about twenty have been here more than a couple of months and thats including women and children i met a mr william cort yesterday i ventured and a mr macintyre whom i found quite interesting longman chuckled ah yes macintyre is one of our more difficult residents northern bluffness you know he can be quite overbearing on occasion cort on the other hand is a very gentle fellow you must meet his wife she is in the kitchen talking with mrs longman at the moment i will introduce you before you leave i didnt really want to meet her but nodded politely and cort mr cort yes hes been here about four months now from the way he talks hell be around for another decade at least he comes from a good family in suffolk i believe although both his parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his uncle spellman the architect you know i shook my head i did not know he is being trained to take over his uncles practice as there are no direct heirs but i fear it is not a good idea i prompted as required no business sense at all it may be his designs are all very well but the workmen here run rings round him i found him crying can you believe it crying a week or so back they bully him terribly and he does not possess the strength of character to impose himself not entirely his fault of course he is much too young to take on such a task but its ruining him poor boy his wife even asked marangoni about him she was so worried marangoni is he the physician of choice among exiles not precisely but he is willing to lend such expertise as he has and he speaks good english delightful man delightful you must meet him about the only italian whose society is tolerable he is an alienist sent by the government to reorganise the asylum he is from milan and so is in exile like all of us anyway mrs cort asked him about her husbands state of mind and longman sighed alas no one could understand the answer these doctors do talk in a peculiar fashion nonetheless it accomplished one purpose marangoni is alerted and cort is being watched to make sure no harm comes to him im surprised there are so few people in venice english people i mean longman shrugged not so surprising really it is ferociously expensive as you will soon enough discover and terribly unhealthy the miasmas arising from the canals are poisonous and sap the vitality few people wish to stay for long the sensible go to turin and you have been here far too long he smiled sadly i dont suppose i shall ever leave now there was a note in his voice of disappointment of hopes frustrated of someone who had expected more from life now tell me about yourself sir here he hesitated you are english i take it you doubt it no no not at all but every now and then some fraud and charlatan does try to hurl himself on our good offices you know i do not i suppose look like an englishman i inherited far more of my mothers looks than my fathers and that side of my ancestry is very much more obvious it is another of the things that have always set me aside from my countrymen the difference is always noticed even if unconsciously others have always been slightly suspicious of me i had already sized up mr longman as an incorrigible gossip and had the distinct feeling that everything i told him would not only be noted but also relayed to any interested party in due course such people can oil the wheels of society but too great an interest in the doings of others i find is often accompanied by a degree of malice which is dangerous so i replied in as brief a fashion as was commensurate with good manners then you are rich must be he cried far from it that depends on your point of reference it may be that three hundred yards from threadneedle street you are a pauper among your fellows but here you will be rich few people here have any money especially among the venetians it is why society is so drab but one can live a rich life with little money do you not agree of course i replied you should be careful though it is dangerous to have a reputation for wealth you will be amazed by how many people wish to borrow money from you or forget their wallets when you dine with them then it would be better if they do not develop a false impression i replied with a slight tone of warning in my voice i could not tell if he took the hint i prepared to leave and longman bustled around me to show me to the door mrs cort he called you must meet another resident before he goes he has already met your husband and has only been here a few hours i turned to present myself to the woman and got the shock of my life when the door to the little salon opened louise cort was beautiful in her early thirties a few years older than i was with beautiful skin and eyes and a delightful rounded figure about as different from her husband as could be imagined she looked directly at me and i felt a soft stirring as my eyes met hers she never looked at longman barely acknowledged his existence as she shook my hand i bowed to her and she nodded i expressed my pleasure in meeting her and she did not reply i said i hoped to meet her again and my husband she said with the faintest tone of mockery in her voice naturally i said chapter i had a dream that night which i remembered this was so strange that it unsettled me for days not that i had a dream but that i should remember it that it should come back to me indeed it has come back to me ever since sometimes for no reason that i can think of this insubstantial fragment of memory will well up in my mind not very often only perhaps once every couple of years although more often of late it is so very perplexing great events that i have witnessed taken part in momentous events i should say i can scarcely recall at all but a fevered imagining of no reality and less importance still stays with me the images as fresh as if they were brand new i was standing by an open window and could feel the wind blowing over my skin it was dark outside and i felt the terror of indecision i did not know what to do about what i do not know that was part of the dream the indecision was independent of all cause then i heard a footfall behind me and a soft voice i told you it said then i felt the pressure of a hand on my back pushing and that was the dream nothing more what was it about i do not know why was it so vivid it stuck in my mind there is no answer to that either and nothing to be done about it dreams have no reason or explanation or meaning the strange thing is that from then on i began to have a vague fear of heights nothing too extreme i did not become one of those poor souls who feel faint if they are more than a few feet off the ground or who clutch at the railings halfway up the eiffel tower and become dizzy no i merely developed a tendency to feel uncomfortable wary whenever i was say on a balcony or by an open window it was a very annoying weakness which i tried not to indulge the more so because it was so obviously foolish but i could never shake it off and ended up by simply ensuring i was never in a position to make it appear the incident was all of a piece with how my life developed over the next few weeks i became increasingly introspective my life slowed down markedly the urge to move on which had afflicted me wherever i had been so far quite left me i still do not know why i think it was the hypnotic effect of the sun on the water such a constant feature of life in venice that slowly befuddled my mind and sapped my will it is hard to think of normal life when it is so easy to watch the twinkling reflections of sunlight instead remarkably easy to spend a few seconds then minutes then even longer studying without thought or conscious awareness the effect of light and shade on a wall of peeling stucco or listen to the mixtures of sounds people waves birds that make venice the strangest city in the world a week went past then two then more and i would only occasionally stir myself to do anything in retrospect it is all very clear i was uncertain of myself i wished to do something grand in my life and had prepared myself well for it but the days of apprenticeship under cardano were at an end he had no more to teach me and i was now faced with a choice i could very easily make more than enough money to keep me and mine in perfect comfort it is as i have said not hard but what was the point of that such a way of life did no more than fill out the space between cradle and grave agreeable and with its own little satisfactions no doubt but ultimately purposeless i did not want power or wealth for themselves and i did not in the slightest desire fame but i wanted on my death to be able to expire feeling that my existence had made the world a different place preferably a better one but even that at the time was not uppermost in my mind i have never had any great desire to abolish poverty or save fallen women i am and always have been deeply suspicious of those who do wish to do these things they normally cause more harm than good and in my experience their desire for power to control others is very much greater than that of any businessman when i began to weary of my own company i decided to take up longmans invitation made as i was leaving to join him at dinner i did not quite grasp what sort of an occasion this would be but in effect longman had been offering to induct me into his particular group of english exiles for the men all ate together almost every night this is common in venice where there is really only one meal a day eaten in the evening breakfast consists of little more than bread and coffee lunch of a bowl of broth bought from a cookshop and so come dinnertime the entire population is both exceptionally hungry and often quite illtempered usually people eat in the same place every evening and then go on to the same caffè also every evening there is a unchanging rhythm to venetian life which all foreigners eventually adopt if they stay long enough there are advantages to being a regular customer you tend to get better food always get served more swiftly and most importantly the owner will set aside a table for you so you are not disappointed and have to go away hungry longman and his group ate at paolinos not as grand as the establishments in the piazza san marco which already earned their living mainly from visitors as they had previously from the austrian soldiers occupying the city with its simple wooden chairs cheap cutlery and roughly painted walls paolinos was for the poorer bracket of the respectable ranks and longmans friends were all of this type i could dine in style or i could dine in company that was the choice that the city presented to me i liked have always liked to eat well but as there was no refined cooking in the city or none that i had yet heard of then i was prepared to compromise besides there is a comradely sense among the genteelly impoverished which is often lacking among the wealthy it was not a great sacrifice when i greeted the consul there were only two others sitting at a table prepared for six or more periodically others drifted in as the evening wore on there was in fact a group of ten or more who came there but not every night each evening there was a different combination some of whom liked each other others who plainly did not cort was one of those present that night and he greeted me warmly a quiet softly spoken american was the other this man spoke with the gentle drawling tones of the south of his country a strange accent and quite foreign until you got used to it it is a way of speaking wellsuited to a dry and lazysounding humour which mr arnsley drennan possessed in fine degree he was rugged in appearance and a few years older than i was and spoke little until he was ready when he did he could be an entertaining conversationalist delivering pithy observations in a voice which sounded as though he was half asleep feigning a lack of interest in his own words that added greatly to the delivery he was decidedly difficult to figure out even mr longman far more adept than i was had failed to breach his walls of discretion and discover much about him this of course added an air of mystery to his person which made him all the more cultivated by others and is your wife to join us later i asked longman oh good heavens no he replied she is at home if you look around you will see there are no women here you will find few in any dining place except for those in san marcos mrs cort also eats at home they must find that a little tedious i remarked longman nodded perhaps but what is to be done now i might have remarked that he could have eaten at home himself or that perhaps the company of his wife might be preferable to that of friends but i did not and at the time it never occurred to me a man must eat and a man must have friends or what of humanity is left in us longmans dilemma i found as insoluble as he did but nevertheless my thoughts strayed briefly to consider how much his wife must pine for company then they paused briefly on the thought of corts wife in a similar purdah they did not however then move on to considering how my own wife was faring without me where do you live mr drennan do you have a lonely wife tending the hearth for you it was a lighthearted question but did not receive an equally facetious reply i am a widower he said softly my wife died some years back i am sorry for you i said genuinely contrite at my faux pas and i live on the giudecca some half hours walk from here mr drennan has found the only inexpensive lodging in venice longman remarked it is one room only with no water and no maidservant he said with a smile i live like most venetians you are a long way from home then i observed he regarded me intently that i am sir he did not seem to find this line of conversation at all interesting so he switched his gaze to the window and left matters to longman who was the impresario of dinnertable conversation do you intend to continue living in a hotel throughout your stay mr stone unless something better offers itself yes i would happily move somewhere more commodious and less annoying but on the other hand i do not intend to spend my time here househunting longman clapped his hands in joy at being so useful then there is a perfect solution he cried you must take rooms with the marchesa darpagno must i yes yes a delightful woman desperately in need of cash with a vast tumblingdown palazzo begging for occupants she would never be so coarse as to solicit lodgers but i can tell she would not be displeased with an enquiry it would be central and charming i will happily send a letter around for you if you like the idea why not i thought i had no plans to stay long and no plans to leave either i should have realised this haziness of intention was indicative of a strange state of mind but no such thought occurred to me i did not find the cost of the hotel onerous but the discrepancy between how much you paid and what you got for it i found offensive so i said it would be interesting to look who is this lady i noticed that the other two did not look so delighted at the mention of her name but had no chance to pursue the subject as macintyre the engineer was stumping over towards the table he was clearly in something of a social bind as he wished to dine with the company but manifestly found it quite unreasonable to admit the fact he resolved the matter by looking exceptionally illhumoured and growling his greetings in a manner which escaped being impolite only by a whisker the effect of his sitting down was to stifle all conversation for several minutes longman looked faintly displeased cort somewhat frightened only drennan nodded in greeting and appeared unperturbed by his appearance food arrived yet macintyre said after we had sat in uncomfortable silence for a while he snapped his fingers at the waiter to call for wine and downed two glasses one after the other in swift succession what is it this evening fish cort said macintyre laughed of course its fish its fish every bloody night what sort of fish cort shrugged does it matter i suppose not it all tastes the same to me anyway he scowled ferociously at cort as he pulled a roll of paper from under his coat there you are i had my draughtsman do it up properly did the costings myself as i said sottini has the proper lengths in stock good sheffield bars wont let you down ive set him up to give you a fair price get in touch with him quickly though otherwise hell forget dont give him more than twentyseven shillings a length but i think you will have a problem with the foundations i looked again the central pillar is buried deep down and must be taken out if this is to work it will be expensive how expensive very you will have to support the entire building then remove it to give space to put in the new structure best thing to do frankly would be to blow it out what are you mad no no its a very simple not dangerous at all if you know what youre doing a very small charge placed low down just to knock a few of the bigger stones out of place then the entire pillar will come down leaving the rest of the building standing if you have buttressed it properly ill think about it cort said uncertainly its the only way of doing it ive got the explosives in my workshop when you see that im right let me know then macintyre turned to me a refilled glass in his hand and you what are you doing here certainly no one could accuse macintyre of an excessive courtesy his flat northern accent i placed him as a native of lancashire despite the scottish name added to the general impression of rudeness something which as longman noted northerners deliberately accentuate merely a traveller from london where i have lived much of my life i replied and your profession if you have one there was a hint of hostility in his tone i looked like a gentleman i suppose and it appeared mr macintyre did not like gentlemen i suppose you might call me a man of business if you wish to know whether i live off the money of my family and idle my days away on the labour of others then the answer is that i do not although i freely admit i would do so happily if the opportunity came my way you dont look english my mother is of spanish origin i said evenly my father on the other hand is a vicar of impeccable englishness so youre a mongrel i suppose you could say that hmm now now macintyre said longman jovially none of your bluntness if you please not until mr stone is used to you i was just recommending the marchesa to him as a potential landlady what do you think macintyres reaction was peculiar it was a remark of no importance so i thought designed merely to divert the conversation into safer waters but it accomplished the exact opposite macintyre snorted bloody madwoman he said and youd be mad to go anywhere near her what was that about i asked drennan later once macintyre had wolfed down his food tossed his napkin on the table and left again all in all he was there for less than fifteen minutes he was not a man to waste time on inessentials i have no idea he replied it seems macintyre does not like the lady he tried to get rooms there once she wouldnt have him and he was offended cort said that explains it longman said cheerfully i wondered how he might have come across her not through me at any rate i didnt think he took enough time off to sleep he works on that machine of his from dawn to dusk machine i asked what machine is this nobody knows said drennan with a smile it is macintyres secret obsession he has so he says been working on it for years and has poured his entire fortune into it he has a fortune not any more he is or was until he settled here a few years back a travelling engineer hiring himself to the highest bidder a shipyard in france railway project in turin a bridge in switzerland a very skilled man personally i prefer the life of the mind of study and reflection and as you may have noticed he is not best suited for getting on with others he never stays anywhere long longman commented is he married his wife died in childbirth poor man so he is left with a daughter who is about eight a most unfeminine creature longman continued even though i had asked for no elaboration utterly uneducated with the looks of her father he can just about get away with it but what is almost tolerable in a man he did not finish he had successfully painted a picture of what was to come a lonely old spinster fending for herself cut off from good or any proper company he shook his head slowly to indicate his distress i think shes a sweet kid drennan said nice smile not much to smile about though and so the conversation proceeded it improved in tone and temper once the effects of macintyre faded and cort to my surprise proved the most entertaining he was perhaps the person most like myself in temperament if not in character and i found his wit congenial i had known many like him at school he blossomed under my appreciation and was in a rare good humour by the time the meal was finished and the small party began to break up longman and drennan decided to head to florians for brandy cort and i declined the idea and were left standing by the doorway as the others disappeared i turned to thank him for his company and as i did so a most remarkable change came over him he grew tense and pale his jaw clenched tightly in distress and he gripped me by the elbow as we shook hands in farewell he seemed to be looking aghast at something behind me so i turned round swiftly to see what had so grabbed his attention there was nothing the street which contained the restaurant was dark but entirely empty at the end a broader street crossed over it and this was lit by the faint flicker of torch flame but that too was deserted cort what is it i asked its him hes there again i looked at him blankly but cort did not respond he continued staring as though frightened out of his wits i touched him gently on the arm to stir him he did not react immediately but eventually his eyes moved away from the blank point they were staring at and he looked at me he seemed dazed and confused whatever is the matter i asked feeling a quite genuine concern as much as a very real curiosity my mind went back to what longman had said about cort having a breakdown from the strain of his task at the palazzo was this a manifestation of his troubles i had little enough experience of such things i do beg your pardon he said eventually in a faltering voice quite absurd of me please forget it i must go now certainly not i replied i have no idea what is distressing you but i could not possibly leave you alone just yet come i will walk with you it is no trouble and i feel like a stroll in any case if you do not wish to talk we will pace the streets together in solemn silence and enjoy the night air have no fear that i wish to pry into your affairs although i do of course he smiled at that and allowed me to lead him towards the alleys end then he pointed to the left away from san marco and indicated that we should head in that direction he said nothing for a long while we had passed the rialto before he groaned loudly and scratched his head furiously with both hands you must forgive that performance he said with an effort to return to normal i must have seemed absurd not at all i replied in what i hoped was a reassuring manner but you did alarm me do you wish to tell me what it was that so distressed you i would were i not afraid that longman would hear of it he is a terrible gossip and i do not wish to become an object of ridicule have no fear of that i replied i would not tell mr longman anything of importance should you come to know me better you will realise that any confidence consigned to my care is perfectly safe which was true a natural tendency on my part had been confirmed by my experiences in the city where knowledge is all exclusive possession of a fact is worth far more than money money you can borrow knowledge has a higher price say for example that you hear a company has struck gold in south africa it is easy enough to borrow some money to buy shares in it before they rise and make a profit all the money in the world will not help you if you do not discover this fact before everyone else i have never in my life traded without advance knowledge and i do not know of anyone with sense who has done so either well then i would like to relate my experiences if you are prepared to listen and also promise to stop me should you find my story ridiculous or dull i promise he took a deep breath and began i mentioned that i was sent here by my uncle to fulfil a contract with the albemarle family i arrived some five months ago with my family and took up operations as best i could it has not been easy and would have strained even a native speaker with more experience than i possess the house is in far worse shape than i was led to believe the workforce is erratic and finding the right materials difficult and expensive my wife did not want to come and is deeply unhappy poor woman you might not believe it from what you have seen but i have made progress although every advance is matched by some setback everything is way behind schedule and far above the budget of course but that is because the family had no conception whatsoever of the task they had taken on that is not what is giving me such concern although i am quite prepared to countenance the idea that the strain makes me more susceptible i have always been of a nervous disposition i do not imagine for a moment that someone like you who seem very sound and sensible let alone a man like macintyre would be subject to the torments i have endured in the past few weeks in brief i have become the victim of hallucinations of the most terrible kind except that i cannot fully accept that this is what they are they are too real to be fictitious yet too bizarre to be real i should tell you that i am an orphan my mother died giving birth to me and my father shortly thereafter that is why i was brought up by my mothers sister and her husband the architect my mother died in venice they had been travelling europe on an extended honeymoon and stopped here for a few months while they prepared for my birth i lived she died there is nothing else to add except to say that my father was heartbroken i was sent back to england to my aunt and he continued his travels to recover alas he caught a fever in paris while on the verge of returning to england and died as well i was two years old at the time i remember nothing of either of them and know only what i have been told please do not think i am talking off the point when i mention this i was perfectly healthy in mind and body until i came here i was brought up properly and well i am not certain i was suited by nature to be an architect but i may in time turn out to be perfectly competent there is nothing in my past at all to foreshadow what has been happening to me here the place of my mothers death it all began when i was walking along a street going to a masons yard as i recall and i saw an old man walking towards me there was nothing about him to excite any interest and yet i found myself looking at him in the way you do when you see something that fascinates yet know you should not look you look away and find your eyes straying back again and again as he drew near he bowed and then we passed each going on his separate way i turned round to look at him again and he was gone that was it i asked in some surprise as he seemed to think that nothing more needed to be said the first time yes as your tone suggests there was nothing to cause any concern indeed it was not even clear why i should have noticed him nonetheless it disturbed me and i found my mind going back to the moment then it happened again i was walking along the riva this time it was midafternoon and the loafers and wastrels were all there sitting on the ground cluttering up the steps of the bridges idling away the hours as is the custom i was in a hurry i had an appointment and i was late i was walking up the steps of a bridge and looked up and there he was again i slowed down just a little when i saw him and he reached inside his coat pulled out a watch and looked at it then he smiled at me as if to say youre late i hurried past feeling almost stung by the implied reproach and determinedly kept on my way this time i didnt look back he knew i was late you see he knows about me he must be watching me finding out about me but you know nothing about him no and this person you were going to visit he couldnt have said something did you ask impossible he said shortly describe this man to me we were walking slowly and as far as i was concerned aimlessly i assumed that cort knew where he was going certainly he turned left and right as though he was following some course rather than wandering lost in thought as he talked walking the silent deserted streets our footfalls echoing between the buildings accompanied by the lap of water and the occasional reflection of moonlight in the canals when the clouds cleared created a strange and wonderful atmosphere that corts tale enhanced rather than dissipated he was quite short dressed in an oldfashioned manner slightly stooped there was nothing particularly remarkable about his gait although he can travel quickly and silently when he wishes it is his face that grabs the attention old but nothing in it weakened or enfeebled tell me he is as old as the city and i would believe you it is the face of generations paper pale tired beyond belief and filled with sadness see it and you must keep looking at it dottore marangoni practises hypnotism on his patients sometimes he believes that the personality of the operator is more important than any technique that what he does is an imposition of his will on the subject that is what i felt like that this man was trying to take over my mind i let his words evaporate in the night air for a while as i considered whether cort was being melodramatic deliberately trying to create some sort of impression for his own ends certainly my inclination was to believe that i was hearing a manifestation of the breakdown that longman considered imminent but i was aware of my own vision shortly after i arrived in the city of the old man and the serenade that also had wrought a strange effect on me either we were both mad or neither of us was and i held firm to a belief in my own sanity that seems a grand claim to make on the basis of two momentary encounters when you didnt even speak i said in a reasonable tone they werent the only ones he answered anxious to allay my suspicions over the next few weeks i saw him more and more often he is following me everywhere i go his voice was becoming more highpitched and hysterical so i endeavoured to calm him he offers you no injury does not threaten you from your description he could do no harm even if he wanted no in that respect he does me no harm has he ever spoken to you once once only i saw him in a crowd last week as i was walking home from work he was coming towards me and nodded in greeting as i approached i could take it no more so i tried to grab him by the arm to stop him but i could not i reached out for his arm but it was as though it wasnt there almost as if my hand passed right through him he kept on walking and i called out to him who are you he stopped and turned round and answered in english as i had spoken to him i am venice he said that was all then he hurried off again and in a few seconds was lost to sight he was italian he spoke in venetian but you see he is following me for some purpose of his own why else would he say such a thing who can he be why is he doing this to me i feel i am going mad mr stone the panic was back rising higher in his voice i gripped his arm tightly trying to inflict pain on him to bring him back to his senses before he lost control i dared not say that i considered it more likely that this encounter was yet another hallucination that he should seek medical advice before it turned into a full hysteria but neither did i mention my own vision i do not know why i think that i was slightly revolted by his show of weakness i saw myself as a man of strength and rationality and wished to keep my distance calm my friend calm i said gently still gripping tightly slowly he relaxed and obeyed then i realised he was shaking with sobs as his efforts at selfcontrol at manly dignity crumbled i could say nothing i was deeply embarrassed by the spectacle it was undignified we were in a public place and i hardly knew the man my better self said that cort must be in dreadful straits to so unburden himself to me the rest of me wished fervently he had not i am most dreadfully sorry he said eventually when he regained control of himself this has been a nightmare and i do not know where to turn and what does your wife think oh i dont want to bother louise he said hesitantly poor thing she has so much to concern herself with what with henry being so small besides he didnt finish but lapsed into a moody silence instead forgive me for asking i said as delicately as i could but are you certain this man is real you think i am imagining it he was not angry at my question believe me i have considered it am i going mad is this man a figment of my imagination of course i wonder i almost hope he is then at least i could go to marangoni and he could do whatever such people do with the insane but his feet make a distinct sound on the pavements he speaks and smiles he smells a very distinct smell like an old cupboard that hasnt been opened for years slightly damp musty but you failed to touch him you said he nodded but i felt his breath on me as he spoke he was as real to me as you are now he gripped my arm as if to reassure himself on that point i do not know what to say i answered if this man exists we must accost him and make him answer questions if not then i am insane there you go beyond my knowledge i am a practical man i will assume for the time being that you are not about to foam at the mouth he laughed for the first time since dinner that is good of you he said and can i rely on you not to say a word to anyone i give you my word i assume you have said nothing of this to anyone else who could i tell we had reached his lodging a grim tumbledown place in what i later learned had been the ghetto where the jews of venice had been corralled by the city until napoleon liberated them whatever good that new freedom might have done the jews it had little benefited that part of town which was as malodorous and depressing as any grim industrial town of england worse i should say for the buildings were rank and collapsing a positive rabbit warren of tiny little rooms where once thousands had been crammed in exposed to every unhealthy miasma that huge numbers and unsanitary conditions might create cort lived here because it was cheap i could well imagine it i would have insisted on hefty payment even to enter his building it seems that his uncle though dutiful in the matter of his upbringing and training was known for a certain parsimony that came from the belief that pleasure was offensive to god cort was therefore kept on a tight leash and had barely enough to house his family as well as live and eat although their conditions were poor his lodging was a necessary economy to put aside some small surplus for diversion he saw my look as we stopped by his doorway i do not live in luxury he said apologetically but my neighbours are good people and even poorer than i in contrast to them i am nobilissimi it would not have served me but his remarks reminded me that i had engaged to visit longmans marchesa i asked cort about her a charming woman he said by all means go she is worth meeting louise knows her and speaks highly of her they have become quite close he gave me the address and then shook my hand my apologies for the display and my thanks for the company he said i told him to think nothing of it and turned to walk back to the hotel cort and his troubles were wafted away on the night air almost before he was out of sight chapter by six the next evening i was established in my new accommodation the palazzo bollani on the rio di san trovaso in dorsoduro and the property of the marchesa darpagno i had sent my card at ten that morning and was instantly ushered in to see her in my minds eye i had seen an old lady decorously dressed with the signs of departed beauty all about her a little stout perhaps but in diminished circumstances dreaming perpetually of the glitter of youth a pleasing if melancholy vision which lasted until the moment i entered the salon she was quite ugly but strikingly so in her late forties i guessed from the fine lines that could just be seen beneath the thick powder around her eyes and mouth tall and imperial in manner with a long nose black hair which was plainly dyed hanging down her back in a thick plait she was wearing a dress with an overskirt in white satin trimmed with green which was far too fashionable for one of her age around her neck was a necklace of emeralds that drew attention to her extraordinary eyes which were of exactly the same hue on her bony fingers were several excessively large rings and she wore a perfume so strong and overpowering that even now more than forty years later i can still smell it it is not often that i am lost for words but the contrast between expectation and reality in this case was so strong that i couldnt find anything to say at all i hope you do not mind speaking in french said the lady as she approached my english is terrible and i imagine that your venetian is worse unless you prefer german she had a harsh voice and the slight smile she gave as she spoke was grotesque in its girlishness i replied that i could manage french and quietly thanked my mother for having had the wisdom all those years ago to engage a french governess for me and my siblings they could not afford much at the time and with governesses you get what you pay for in this case a lazy coarse wretch but she spoke french and once inside our home was dislodged only with difficulty she stayed long enough to teach me the language although far too much of its nether reaches and not very much of its higher flights only with elizabeth did i ever properly master it she is one of those annoying people who pick up languages quickly by merely listening i have to study hard but elizabeth has always preferred french to english so study i did to please her the marchesa sat down indicating that i could do the same offered coffee and fell silent looking at me with a faint smile i understand from mr longman that you occasionally consider allowing people to stay in your house i began a little hesitatingly that was why i was there and the subject would have to come up sooner or later that is true maria will take you to see the rooms a little later if i decide i can bear to have you under my roof ah i do not do this for money you understand quite quite but i find it interesting to have people around me the venetians are such bores they drive me to distraction you are not venetian yourself no she offered no more information and much as i would have liked to i felt unable to continue the questioning she was not an easy conversationalist rather she was one of those who command through silence contributing little but looking with a faint smile that affected her mouth more than her eyes summoning the other on to fill the void so i told her of my journey around italy my current stay in the hotel europa my decision to stay and my desire for slightly more comfortable accommodation i see you leave out much in your account i think i was astonished by the remark i dont believe so no response to that one either i sipped my coffee and she sat quietly watching me and how do you find venice mr stone i replied that i found it perfectly agreeable so far although i had seen little and you have done as everyone does here and hired a gondola to think sad thoughts in not yet you surprise me are you not disappointed in love recovering from a broken heart that is why people come here for the most part they find the city a perfect place to indulge in selfpity a sudden sharpness in her tone all the more strange for being so unexpected i looked at her curiously but could see nothing in her face she had said it as a matter of fact an observation only perhaps not in my case madam i replied i am perfectly unencumbered if she desired to make me ill at ease and put me on the defensive then she was succeeding i was not used to such conversations she saw that and was enjoying my discomfort which made me fight back then you are here to have your heart broken you will become like the others what others those who cannot leave there are many here the city traps the weak and never lets them go be careful if you stay here for long i shook my head i had no idea what she was talking about foreigners especially from northern countries make a mistake when they come here they do not take venice seriously they come from their lands full of machinery and money and feel pity for it they think it is a harmless relic of the past once glorious now beyond hope they walk and admire but never rid themselves of a feeling of contempt and superiority you are the masters now no again i said nothing and venice waits bides its time most come and see and go away again but the weak are its prey it sucks the life out of them bit by bit robs them of their will their autonomy they stay they stay a little longer and then they cannot even imagine leaving their life has had its purpose removed they become mere shadows walking the streets eating at the same place every day walking the same routes every day for what reason they cannot recall this is a dangerous place mr stone it is cursed beware of it it is alive and its spirit feeds on the weak and unwary i think it unlikely that this is to be my fate she laughed softly a beguiling laugh but disturbing in the context of her words which had nothing humorous about them perhaps not but you came for a few days and now you are taking an apartment for a longer stay i sense you are searching for something mr stone although i do not know what it is nor do you i think but be careful you will only find sadness here i feel that in you you thrive in adversity you think yourself strong but your weakest place is your heart one day it will destroy you you know that do you not this melodrama completely reduced me to silence obviously she was trying to fascinate me put me offbalance and if you wish dominate the conversation by the bizarre nature of her words and equally obviously she was succeeding i felt an air of foreboding descend over me and realised it was the same feeling i had experienced the day before the feeling of sadness as i walked the streets the sense of the inexplicable i had had that first night watching the palazzo these were all part of the same sentiment that she had expressed in words the desire to taste the recklessness of extreme emotions throw off the usual cautious careful way of life i had developed for myself that was why i had left england was it not why i had roamed italy for three months in search of precisely that but had not yet found it i caught myself at that very moment thinking of my brief introduction to mrs cort the way her eyes had met mine it was mere absurdity a combination of the light and the tiredness the strangeness of the surroundings the water quite soothing and relaxing in its way all the more so because it was so foreign to my normal life i looked up at the marchesa and smiled almost grinned it was a challenge to her silently countering that i was not to be fooled by her words try as she might i was a tougher nut than a man like cort she smiled back accepting the challenge and clapped her hands maria she called out please show mr stone the apartment so you can bear to have me in your house i am flattered i said you should be but you have the aura of an honest man a good man she replied seriously i beg your pardon your aura it radiates around you revealing the nature of the spirit which animates the machinery of your body yours is gentle blue and yellow you are divided in spirit between the desire for peace and for adventure for power and for tranquillity you desire much but i feel that you have a sense of fairness you are divided between the masculine and the feminine but in you the attributes are wrongly apportioned it is your feminine which is adventurous the masculine which desires peace you will have trouble reconciling these mr stone but they make you interesting she gave the distinct impression that she wanted me in her house so she could study me like some grotesque entomologist but she nonetheless had described the battle between my fiery mother and my peaceable father remarkably well disconcertingly so and she saw that i was impressed despite the fact that she was talking nonsense the business of packing was delayed by an encounter i had in the hotel on my return as i walked into the lobby and asked for my key i noticed a small man get up from his chair and come towards me my dear stone this person said in a thick italian accent as he grabbed me by the hand and pulled me round to face him i hardly expected it to be true remarkable im so pleased to see you i looked at him blankly for a moment then it dawned on me who he was i believe i mentioned that several years previously i had tried my hand at dissipation i am not ashamed of this period of my life i believe it is inevitable in young men whose energies are not wasted by manual labour and as i say i found that the pleasures of such a life faded quickly and have never returned i have not spent my older years wondering what it would have been like to have done certain things nor did i have any temptation in middle age to try and recapture my youth and thus make myself into a laughing stock during that period i made the acquaintance of a group of young men some were the useless sprigs of nobility well on their way to illness and early death from excess thus weakening a class of society and fending off the likelihood of revolution for why trouble to overthrow people who are doing such a good job of rendering themselves powerless some were simple idlers spending an inheritance pretending to be poets or painters and a couple were medical students who had a wildness of such severity that i would hesitate ever to place myself under their care one of these however is now a personal physician to his majesty which goes to show that even the greatest sinners are capable of redemption of the others one became a high court judge and one shot himself in the aftermath of the dunbury scandal a foolishly conceived scheme to dun the public by proposing vast profits from a railway built across a twohundredmile swamp in russia my friend a man for whom i continued to have affection to the end went vastly into debt to buy shares in the hope of recovering a dire financial situation and was ruined the man who now greeted me was one of the medical students i never paid him much attention and never even knew his name something foreign i knew but everyone always called him joe a nickname more insulting than friendly for it assumed an informality more suited to a pet or native bearer than an equal joe or dottore giuseppe marangoni as he was now called had changed over the past few years that was clear previously he had had the sort of personality that could lead you to overlook him entirely one of those who waited to be spoken to and appeared grateful to be included in any conversation only his eyes suggested there might be something more to him for he was always watching always interested for what purpose never seemed clear and this was the person now beaming at me and shaking my hand leading me to a table in the corner for a chat it is disconcerting to encounter someone once known but not seen for several years at that stage the shock was limited but still real now it is positively a heartache to meet a person i have not seen for thirty or forty years to see the thinning hair the stoop the lines when you expect no matter how much you realise it cannot be so the person to look exactly as they did when last seen and to realise they are as shocked by your appearance as you by theirs as we had swapped country so we also exchanged roles my surprise at marangonis sudden reappearance in my life was so great that i said little he in contrast never stopped talking we remembered things very differently he talked of the good fellowship of his days in london the fine friends he had made asked about the members of that little group of apprentice rakes which information i could not provide as apart from campbell i had cast them off as i had abandoned that way of life and i have never cared for gossip in any case then he began to surprise me i wish id liked london more he said it is such a dull place in comparison with venice he groaned ah no professionally venice is interesting but hardly glittering alas no in comparison to a place like paris for example the english do forgive me my friend are so respectable i was halfminded to be insulted by this but looked enquiringly instead take my fellow medical students for example in paris they live together and eat together and all have their shopgirls for mistresses and housekeepers until they qualify or find someone suitable to marry their life is their own in london everyone lives with a landlady eats every evening some hideous meal she has cooked and goes to church on sunday riotous living consists of getting drunk and little else im sorry you were disappointed i wasnt there to enjoy myself merely to learn and observe which i did with great profit to learn and observe what medicine as you know particularly the science of alienism i am a doctor of the mind and so it is my business to study people in all their variety i learned much there although less than i did in paris the group you were attached to was full of instruction i was as may be imagined a little offended by this remark the idea that all the time we were ignoring him treating him as some insignificant little foreigner he was in fact watching and assessing us a bit like the marchesa only more scientific i hoped he saw my discomfort and laughed do not be perturbed you were the least interesting person there i do not find that reassuring but who knows what lurks beneath the surface i joke you were by far the most normal of my companions the others mind you were quite fascinating in their many different ways he mentioned one man clear degenerate tendencies with a pronounced swelling indicating distorted cranial lobes certainly a tendency to insanity erratic judgement and a pronounced attraction to violence he has just become a queens counsel i commented dryly proves my point does it not i said nothing a few weeks ago as i write i discovered my erstwhile acquaintance has been confined to an asylum after a murderous attack on his wife of thirty years the matter has been kept quiet lest the idea of a complete lunatic in charge of criminal cases as a judge he became notorious for his infliction of the death penalty lessens the awful majesty of the law in the publics mind alas i rarely have the opportunity to deal with such intricate cases now he said almost wistfully i was not hugely interested but asked him of his progress since we had last met it appeared that marangoni his studies in paris ended had returned to milan where he had briefly worked in an asylum trying to introduce the best french practices he had done so well this was his account not mine that he had then been transferred to the veneto to embody there the new ideas that unification with italy represented he was the emissary of the state sent to organise the asylums of the city and to corral bully persuade and intimidate the insane back to health using the most uptodate methods he was not overoptimistic about his prospects although gratified by the salary his new employment provided and lest you think i am being rude about england i must assure you that in comparison with venice it was like being in paradise here the insane are still in the hands of the priests who intone their mumbojumbo over them and pray they will get better and beat them when their prayers are not answered so you see i have a big job on my hands i must fight the insane and the church simultaneously which is worse he waved his hand do you know sometimes i cant tell them apart degenerates he said as he sipped his drink little to be done for them except identify isolate and eliminate the city is inbred generation after generation has never even left the lagoon what you see as a city of unparalleled beauty and untold richness is in fact a festering seeping sore of mental illness a people weakened and debilitated incapable of fending for themselves you have read the history of the city no doubt about how it finally fell to napoleon it was not napoleon who conquered this city it was the steady eating away of the population by degeneration which stripped it of all ability to resist and you recommend what exactly oh if i had my way id ship everyone out everyone you mean the whole city i asked slightly incredulously he nodded if there is a house with plague in it you dont adopt half measures do you that is what venice is a plague city spreading corruption to all who are in contact with it we are at last trying to build a nation here in italy we need a forceful healthy population that will multiply and meet the challenges of modern life we cannot take the risk of having a place like this undermining all our efforts sapping our vitality with contaminated stock he smiled as he saw my surprise at his remarks i say that so forcefully because i know no one is going to listen to me no one has the will to take the necessary measures so instead i do what i can and must case by case i hate to challenge the opinion of a scientist but i have seen many idlers in london and paris and noted no tendency here to violence he nodded sagely there are degenerates everywhere particularly in europe which is crumbling do you know one eminent doctor has estimated that up to a third of the entire population might be afflicted and you would like to get rid of all of them not possible he replied clearly suggesting he would like nothing better what i am trying to do is identify them if they could be stopped from breeding for example then eventually the problem would diminish on its own as for the violence dont be fooled their natural lassitude makes them seem passive enough but when something snaps they behave like beasts what is more the city attracts more such people every day they arrive and find the place congenial there is a man called cort for example i have met mr cort i said no doubt a little stiffly i found him very pleasant marangoni smiled in a slightly superior fashion that is why there are alienists he said to spot things the untrained eye cannot perceive mr cort is a man on the edge and could topple over into the ravine of madness at any moment he should never have been sent here but thats you english all over he was sent here to toughen him up i believe the saying is it may well do the exact opposite and finish him off he is having hallucinations you know he thinks there is a man following him and not just any man oh dear me no he is being followed by the city itself how do you know that ah marangoni smiled touching his nose there is little secret here as you will discover you would consider him insane cort or the spectral venetian both if the venetian exists at all then both naturally thinking yourself immortal is not unusual of course and persuading yourself that you are someone else is common enough i have encountered napoleon on many occasions as well as princes and children of popes all snatched away at infancy persuading yourself you are a city is most odd i have never encountered such a thing i rather hope he does exist i would love to meet him and cort a hypersensitive young man in my opinion he is picking up the unhealthiness of the city but instead of responding in a rational manner he embodies it in his fantasies this venetian is the degenerate city which killed his mother and it exerts an unhealthy fascination for him he should leave immediately i have told him this but he refuses to listen he says it would be cowardly that he has a job to do here but it will cost him his sanity if he is not careful especially if he continues to keep his wife with him marangoni was no gentleman it was bad enough surely for a doctor to discuss a man who was a patient in such terms but to cast aspersions on mrs cort as well i found deeply offensive i think he saw the look on my face oh you chivalrous english he said with a very faint air of contempt very well i should not have said that but mrs cort i find to be that is no doubt because you do not appreciate refinement and character in women i said being used only to italians still the wretched man did not take offence that may be so certainly they are very different in manner though not so different in nature you have met the lady i think you must have i found her charming so she is so she is well i stand corrected you no doubt know her better than i a mere italian ever could i found his conversation somewhat alarming i am used now to capitalists such as myself being detested for their pitiless fixity of purpose their ruthlessness at the exploitation of others perhaps we are so but i must say that i have never encountered a capitalist half as pitiless as one of those doctors of the mind should they ever be allowed to put their ideas into practice they would be fearsome the conviction that their method makes them unchallengeable that their conclusions are always correct leads them to lay claim to a remarkable authority over others capitalists want the money of their customers the bodies of the workers psychiatrists want their souls fortunately marangoni was tiring of the subject as well as i and out of politeness turned to questioning me about my trip you have met some people already i believe it was mr longman who mentioned you to me a few i said and i am about to move to new accommodation in the palazzo of the marchesa darpagno oh ho he said with a smile then you must be a special person she is fussy in her choice what did you say or do to win her over its my aura apparently or the size of my wallet marangoni laughed oh yes id forgotten the marchesa is a seer i looked at him really she is the spirits positively queue up to chat to her it must be like bedlam in her sitting room sometimes she has the gift the eye that certain spiritual something which means she is totally crazy another one you alarm me oh shes harmless enough remarkably so naturally i scented a customer when i first came across her but i was disappointed you will note that apart from a few matteroffact comments she is entirely normal and that means clearly she is insane it is only a matter of time before the madness bursts forth and becomes more explicit at the moment though she is quite normal in her behaviour apart from the spirits of course you will i imagine be summoned to take part in a séance at some stage everyone is but you wont have any excuse for not attending so youll have to go do you believe in spirits ghosts auras things that go bump in the night or under the table i dont think so i said a shame but she wont mind if you express your doubts all she does is smile at you in a pitying manner blind fools who do not see the obvious even when it is in front of their very eyes it is your loss not hers if you cut yourself off from the pleasures of the astral planes and the higher wisdom they offer a bit like alienists then i said with some relief exactly like alienists he agreed jovially what is more the marchesa doesnt talk like some charlatan this is what makes her so fascinating her madness is entirely logical and reasonable so much so that she is very convincing mrs cort seems to have fallen under her spell for example i use the word spell metaphorically you understand do you believe all women are insane you must know some who are not so marangoni considered the question then shook his head taking all things as equal no all women are insane at one level or another it is merely a question of when or if the insanity will manifest itself so if i come across a woman who is entirely normal and balanced then she merely has not yet manifested the signs of madness the longer she remains in a state of apparent normality the more violent is the underlying insanity i have wards full of them clearly some women hide the symptoms all their lives and the insanity never rises to the surface but it is always latent so being sane is a proof of insanity in women i mean i fear so alas but i am not dogmatic on the subject unlike some of my colleagues tell me he continued abruptly changing the subject is money still your main occupation in life why do you say that he shrugged it was always obvious that you were never going to be one of the poor of this world he replied with a smile you were always too watchful if i said calculating you would take it as an insult which i do not intend so let us say too aware and too intelligent yes let us say that then i do have some financial interests which you are not pursuing here no i see he smiled again which i found annoying there is something acutely irritating about men whose expressions depict a sort of omniscience who pretend to be able to read the minds of others i never thought of you as a man for holidays it is time to think again then although you are right in general my inactivity does weigh on me a little but you are staying here i nodded perhaps there are other things to do in venice than look at buildings such as i shrugged i was beginning to find him irritating build them i see you are not minded to say more he said after he had considered my face for a few moments you leave me to work it out for myself precisely very well give me a week and a few meals together and we will see if i guess your purpose you buy me a meal if i fail i buy you one agreed i said with a faint smile and if you will excuse me i must see to my packing the marchesa expects me by six willingly i must go as well i have a new patient who was brought in this morning interesting he sighed not in the slightest chapter until i made that response to marangoni about building i had not thought at all seriously about the vague ideas that had passed through my mind it was only because of this chance conversation that it became a fixed purpose a small project that might give me occupation and end the purposeless wandering that i was beginning to find disturbing to that end i needed to find an appropriate site a preferred option would have been to buy some ground in the centre of the city and demolish all the buildings to make way for a modern and efficient structure i soon learned however that such a proposal was unlikely to come to anything permission had to be gained from the council for any work of that nature and the local government had the instinct to oppose anything which smacked of the modern permission to demolish half a dozen palaces on the grand canal however magnificent the result was unlikely and in any case the initial cost of purchasing the site would have been prohibitive nonetheless i hired a gondola for the next morning and instructed the rower to go wherever he wished it was a pleasant enough pastime idling along broad canals and narrow ones watching the water carriers fill the wells the faggot vendors selling wood all the business of the city carried out in the strange way that must evolve in a city drowned in water listening to the echoes of voices against tall narrow buildings made slightly sharper and more diffuse by the effect of the water began to bring back to me the mood of odd peacefulness that had overcome me my first evening and which was so opposite to my supposed purpose in brief i indulged in all sorts of fantastical notions this happened time and again during my stay my wonder was not that the citizens of venice were now so idle but rather that they had once been sufficiently energetic to raise themselves from the lagoon and turn their wooden huts on mud flats into the great metropolis that had once ruled the mediterranean had the venetians of old been more like me in mood then they would still be paddling about in silt up to their knees i write as i remember and give some sense of my mood that fine september morning as the gondola slowly turned a corner and i saw mrs cort walking along the side of the canal we had now entered it was easy to recognise her she looked and walked in a way which meant she could only be english more upright and with more bearing than venetian women who do not discipline their bodies into deportment on top of that she was dressed in the same manner as when i had met her eschewing a top coat in honour of the fine weather and wearing only a hat to guard her fine white skin from the sun i called out to her and gestured to the gondolier to pull over to the side where there were some landing steps i have been to the pharmacist for some cough medicine she said once we had exchanged greetings it did not matter what she said i noticed that her eyes were bright and met mine when we spoke she stood closer to me than i would have expected from a woman i hardly knew and is this your son i asked gesturing at an infant in the arms of a stocky peasant woman standing a few feet away the child looked sick and was whimpering the other woman a nurse or nanny of some sort rocked it gently in her arms and sang a crooning song in its ears yes that is henry she said scarcely giving him a glance he is very like his father the conversation faltered i was pleased to see her but had nothing to say that easy talk which passes between men or couples of long acquaintance was not possible neither of us wanted to go on our way but neither could think how to prolong the interview and you are seeing the sights she said eventually after a fashion although i do believe i have been down this canal three times already or perhaps not they all begin to look the same after a while she laughed lightly i can see you have not benefited from mr longmans expertise she said otherwise you would know that that house on the corner she gestured behind me and i turned to look at a nondescript pile that looked long deserted was once the home of the lady with the skull she smiled at me as i looked again do you want to hear the story as he told it to me by all means i do not know when it happened she said most stories in venice have no date to them but a long time ago a man was walking down an alley a short way from here he was thinking of the woman he was about to marry and his happy thoughts were disturbed by a beggar asking for money he was angry and kicked the man for his insolence and caught him on the head with his boot the beggar rolled over into the canal struck dead and the young man ran off the wedding day came and eventually the bride and groom were alone in their bedchamber there was knock on the door the man cursing opened it and saw a horrible apparition a corpse flesh dropping from its bones eyes staring from their sockets teeth protruding where the flesh had been eaten away by fish the man screamed as you might expect who are you what do you want the man cried i am the beggar you killed i want burial the apparition replied again the man ignored the request he slammed the door and bolted it when he had recovered enough he went back upstairs to the bedchamber but when he walked in the room he turned pale and fainted what is the matter my love cried the wife she got up and began to walk towards him but as she passed a mirror she turned to look at herself her face was white and skulllike the hair torn out the eyes staring from their sockets the teeth protruding where the fish had eaten away the flesh she was talking ever more softly and i found myself moving closer to her as she told this hideous fascinating fairy story when she ended i was close enough to feel her breath on my face she looked openly and frankly at me and the moral of the story is never be unkind to beggars i said no she replied softly the moral is do not marry a man who is cruel and heartless i came to myself and stepped back what had just taken place i did not know but it was as though a charge of energy had surged through me i was in a state of shock not the story but the teller and the manner of the telling it was the way her eyes fixed on me that caused the true shock so far beyond what was correct and to which i responded or didnt i initiated it perhaps perhaps she responded to me now i feel dissatisfied to travel so ignorantly i said perhaps you need a guide perhaps i do you should ask my husband she said and registered the disappointment in my face im sure he would allow me to show you the sights of the city again those eyes do i need to ask his permission no she said with a touch of contempt in her voice i do not wish to trouble you im sure you are very busy i could spare you some time im sure i would enjoy it my husband is always telling me i should do more out of the house he knows there is little of my own here not that he does anything except apologise i could not get the encounter out of my mind then or later it grew in me like my feeling for the city itself without me even noticing but i was aware that what i saw and did was blending with my thoughts almost to the point of not being able to tell one from the other although i wished to clear my head i also wished the strange state to continue it was luxurious to surrender to the least impulse to allow any thought to pass through my head to abandon that careful discipline i had steadily cultivated to be other than myself in fact i needed company for distraction but i also wished to discover more about louise cort what was her history her nature why had she talked to me in such a fashion what sort of person was she i had only met her on two occasions by this point and only for a few minutes in all not enough to explain her place in my thoughts certainly no other woman and by then i had met many more charming more beautiful more notable in all respects had such a rapid effect on me for the most part i had forgotten them the moment they had passed from my sight i found my way to the restaurant a few days later as i again needed company to fill my hours the marchesa was perfectly happy to provide food at an extravagant extra cost but her cook was dreadful and she insisted on dining in state in the old dining room just her and me at opposite ends of a very long table conversation was difficult to say the least and the predominant sound was of clinking cutlery and the noise she made as she ate for she had false teeth which did not fit very well and which needed to be sucked back into place after every bite she would also at least once every mealtime get a dreamy look on her face which i soon enough learned was the sign of a imminent visitation from the other side on top of that there was no gas lighting the only illumination after dusk came from candles and the great multicoloured chandelier in my sitting room though large enough to hold several dozen candles had not i thought been lit since long before the extinction of the serenissima it was blackened with use and covered with dust from disuse it was dark and impossible to read after dinner strangely the person i most looked forward to meeting again was macintyre i found him curious and my interest was heightened by the desire to discover what exactly a lancashire engineer was doing in a city so far away from any industry so i engaged him in conversation ignoring cort and drennan who were the only other people there that evening it was not easy as conversation was a skill macintyre had not mastered either he did not reply at all or answered in monosyllables and as he ate he drank which made his words difficult to understand all my attempts to indicate an interest to ask careful questions met with grunts or noncommittal replies eventually i lost patience with him what are you doing in this city i asked bluntly and quite rudely macintyre looked at me and gave a faint smile thats better he said if you want to know something ask cant stand these manners skirting round things all the time i didnt wish to be rude whats rude about curiosity about things or people if you want to know something ask if i dont want to say ill tell you straight out why should i find that rude he pulled a pipe from his pocket disregarding the fact that no one else had finished their meal filled it swiftly and lit it blowing thick clouds of pungent choking smoke into their air like a steam train preparing for a long journey then he pushed his plate away and put both elbows on the table so how did you end up here by chance i work for hire shipyards mainly i served my apprenticeship with lairds in liverpool doing everything eventually i worked with a little group of people designing different sorts of propellers by the time i left i was in charge of the entire design office he said this with pride almost defiance he must have been used to expressions of blank indifference from the sort of people he encountered in venice who considered designing a propeller as an accomplishment of no significance whatsoever i wished to ask more lairds was an impressive company its ships set the standards for others to match but he was already standing up thats too long a story for tonight he said gruffly if youre interested i might tell you come to my workshop sometime if youve a mind to hear it but i must go and see to my daughter i would like that very much i replied perhaps i could take you for lunch no restaurants where i work he said but he was easier in his speech now the roughness of resentment had eased off him his final parting was almost civil well you are the privileged one drennan drawled as we both stood to put on our coats after the meal the days were still lovely but the evening air was now getting steadily cooler what have you done to win his favour no one has ever been allowed in that workshop of his maybe i just showed interest or perhaps i was just as rude as he and he was drawn to a kindred spirit drennan laughed a pleasant laugh easy and warm maybe so nor should i have been surprised by macintyres workshop when i arrived there the next day somewhat late due to the difficulty of finding its location the part of venice where he had settled was not only unfashionable among the venetians i am prepared to wager that not one tourist in a thousand has ever ventured into it he had rented a workshop in the boatyards around san nicolo da tolentino a quarter in which all pretensions to elegance fade away to nothing this is not the poorest part of the city but it is one of the roughest many of the inhabitants i am told have never wandered even as far as san marco and live in their quarter as though it is a world of its own entirely independent of the rest of humanity i gather though my own lack of skill prevented verification that they even speak in a way which is distinctly different from their fellow citizens and that the forces of law and order rarely penetrate and then only with some trepidation their business is boats not the grand seafaring vessels which were once the pride of venice and which were constructed on the other side of the city but the vast numbers of small craft on which the entire lagoon depends need has produced whole species of boats and in a manner which would have satisfied darwin specialised to the point where they can do one thing and one thing only dependent absolutely on their conditions of existence for their survival vulnerable to changes which can wipe out an entire class of construction some prosper some fail thus it is in life in business and in venetian shipping as well the galley has gone vanquished by the sailing ship just as the sailing ship is inevitably falling victim to the superiority of the steamer many have vanished even in my lifetime but their names live on the gondola but also the gondolino the fregatta the felucca the trabaccolo the costanza all of these still survive but their days doubtless are numbered their passing will be a loss only to the aesthetic sense of those who do not have to operate them for how much better is a steamer at nearly all things macintyre worked and lived among the sounds and smells of timber and pitch and was as alien in his operations as he was in his nature and nationality for he was a man of iron and steel in his domain the screech of metal replaced the softer sounds of wood being worked lathes had displaced saws finely calibrated instrumentation had seen off the rule of thumb calculation had vanquished the accumulated experience of the generations he was not waiting for me he never waited for anyone he always had something to do and used every moment to get on with it i never knew a man so unable to be at rest even when forced to sit still his fingers would drum on the table his foot would tap on the floor he would grimace and make odd noises how anyone had ever consented to live with him was one of lifes little mysteries and books i do not believe he had read a single book except for a technical manual since he left school he could see no point in them poetry and prose he found in the juxtaposition of metal the flow of oil and the subtle interaction of carefully designed component parts they were his art and his history his religion even when i arrived he was as still as he ever became lost in a temporary reverie as he contemplated a large metal tube lying on the bench before him it was about fifteen foot long rounded at one end with a host of smaller tubes coming from the rear which spoiled the neatness of the whole by disintegrating into a formless tangled mass at the end of all this was a metal stanchion to which was attached even i could recognise it a propeller of shiny brass about a foot in diameter i didnt feel like disturbing him he was so obviously at peace almost a smile on his usually dour face the years which normally showed through in frowns and lines had fallen away and he seemed boyish in complexion he was a man who took delight in reducing complexity to order in his mind the tangled mass of pipes and wires made sense with each part having its allotted task and with no surplus or waste it had its own elegance not the learned scholarly elegance of architecture to be sure this was stripped of the past a new order if you wish justified only by itself and its purpose in that tangle of brass and steel whatever it was lay the reason for his contempt for venice for people like cort he felt he could do better he did not feel the need to live in old buildings and worship dead artists imitating and preserving he felt he could surpass them all this stumpy lancastrian was a revolutionary in his way it disturbed me for some reason perhaps an echo of my upbringing came back to me then those many hours spent in church or being lectured by my father and others some of it sticks it cannot fail man is justified by faith and submission macintyre would have none of it and was putting his disagreement into solid form man was justified by his ingenuity and his machines only by whether they performed their allotted tasks not that i thought or felt any of that i was simply aware that i could not share his absorption that i was an observer aware of myself standing there looking at the concentration of others but even before i could pin that feeling down he gave a sigh of contentment turned and saw me instantly the dour northerner returned to life the joyful boy banished youre late cant abide people being late and what are you looking at he scowled i could have taken offence at his lack of civility but i had seen into him glimpsed his secret he could offend me no more i liked him i was admiring your ah i gestured at the contraption on the worktable your plumbing he peered at me intently plumbing dyou call it you scoundrel it is surely a means of heating water for a gentlemans bathroom i continued in an even tone it was so easy to reduce him to a state of apoplexy but it was unfair to do so he turned bright red and spluttered incoherently until he realised i was making fun of him then he calmed himself and smiled but it was an effort tell me what it is then i continued you will have to because i can make neither head nor tail of it maybe he said maybe i will i could barely hear him the noise in the workshop was considerable and came from the three people who seemed to be his assistants all i could see from their dress were italians all young all of them concentrating hard on their tasks except for the girl who was obviously his daughter she was about eight i would imagine and was going to be the same shape in female form as her father broad of shoulder with a square face and strong jaw her fair short hair was curly and could have been an advantage had it been tended in any way at all but as it was it resembled an overgrown bramble patch she was dressed also in a way utterly unbecoming a mans oversized sweater almost disguised the fact that she was a girl at all but her face was open her glance intelligent and she seemed like a pleasant creature although the frown as she concentrated on the job of producing some technical drawing in the corner took away most of the small prettiness she possessed macintyre seemed to ignore her completely it was only as our interview continued that i realised his glance stole away every few minutes to that corner of the room where she sat lost in concentration this was the mans weakness the only person he loved come and look around he said abruptly when he noticed me looking at her and led me across the open space to where most of the machinery was installed i find it astonishing that any man can regard fine machinery without admiration the machines our age has produced can induce an awe in me that is as powerful as the impulse to religion in other men again perhaps this is a legacy from my upbringing with a natural piety diverted and deformed into other channels but i find i look on such things rather in the way a medieval peasant must have looked on the looming mass of a cathedral stunned into reverence without comprehension in these great halls of production there are marvels to behold go to the great ironworks of sheffield and see the forges or the new steel presses that have sprung up around birmingham see the gigantic monsters that can crush and bend many tons of metal in one swipe of a press machines so vast that it would seem arrogant even to have dreamed of them or to the vast turbine halls that turn water into steam and then electricity in rooms so big clouds can form in their upper levels and in all of these look at the men who work there are the floors clean the men well dressed and proud of their appearance do they work with willingness is there a sense of purpose in their eyes do the employers seek out the best or the cheapest five minutes is enough to tell me if an enterprise will rise or fall prosper or diminish it is all in the eyes of labour macintyres operation was on a much smaller scale but the principles were the same and the signs were good although ramshackle on the outside inside the shed was spotless all the tools were neatly ordered the floors swept the benches well organised the brass on the instruments gleamed the steel was well oiled each machine was cared for and well situated it had all been thought through and those he employed went about their business with a quiet resolve talking rarely and then quietly they knew what they were doing i found them he said when i asked here and there giacomo over there was supposed to be a boatbuilder but his father died and he could find no master i noticed him carving a piece of driftwood to sell to passersby he had such fine control of his hands i knew he was intelligent he made himself indispensable inside a week he can set up a machine faster and more accurately than any man i have come across if he had the technical knowledge to go with his skill he would be formidable he gestured to another luigi is another he has more training i found him in an artists studio being trained as a restorer he has no talent for painting so he had not much of a career ahead of him his talent is for drawing he is an immensely skilled draughtsman and can take my sketches and turn them into plans he and giacomo can then turn them into precise settings on the machinery and that one ah signor bartoli a man of all tasks he is the general allpurpose worker he helps one or other of the two and knows how to follow his instructions perfectly if something needs doing he will do it faster and better than you hoped you are more fortunate than mr cort in your choice of labour then i am a better judge of men more like and more able to command them when i see mr cort at work i feel like grabbing him by the neck and giving him a good shake he snorted in disgust in a way which spoke volumes macintyre was thinking what he would have accomplished if he had had the advantages of corts birth and opportunities there are many such men in our industries i have made it my business to find them and give them their chance yet you assisted him the other week oh that that was nothing it took no time at all and i was getting heartily sick of listening to his despair at least he has decided to take my advice he is even prepared to contemplate blowing the column out with explosives there may be a man of sense in there after all his trouble is that he has been trained to do things the way they are done not the way they should be done are you going to tell me what that great thing is over there i called out to him he had wandered over to luigi and was discussing some problem my presence perfectly forgotten a strange way of talking he had as well a sort of pidgin english with smatterings of italian thrown in it was the lingua franca of the workshop where conversations were conducted half in words half in gestures and mime all the technical words were in english not surprisingly perhaps as none of the three italians knew any of them before they came to macintyre and he did not know the italian equivalents even when they existed the grammar was italian and the rest was a mixture of the two with a lot of grunting thrown in to fill up space i had to wait for an answer whatever the problem was it took some sorting and ended with macintyre on his knees before the machine some sort of drill as far as i could discern like a penitent at prayer slowly twisting knobs to make fine adjustments measuring distances with calipers repeating the operation several times before an outburst of grunting suggested the problem was resolved what was that he asked when he returned to my side your plumbing ha he turned and led the way back to the lone machine lying clamped on a solitary workbench what do you think it is i looked carefully at the machine before me it was a thing of some elegance essentially a steel tube with winglike projections along its length tapering at the back and ending with a small threewinged propeller in shiny brass at the other end it stopped abruptly and open to the air but a little way away was a continuation which obviously bolted on to the end to give a rounded shape it obviously is designed to go through the water i said i walked around and peered into the nose of the machine it was empty and this clearly holds something most of its length is taken up with machinery which i take to be the engine although there is no funnel and no boiler this empty piece must hold the cargo i shook my head it looks a bit like a very big shell with a propeller attached macintyre laughed very good very good a shell with a propeller that is precisely what it is a torpedo to be precise i was puzzled a torpedo i knew was a long pole pushed from the front of a ship to impale an opponent then explode hardly useful in the days of ironclads and teninch guns of course he continued i merely borrow the word as i could think of nothing better this is an automobile torpedo a charge of explosive there he pointed at the nose and an engine capable of propelling it in a straight line there aim it at the opposing ship set it off and thats that so the front will be full of gunpowder oh no gunpowder is too susceptible to damp and something which goes underneath the surface of the water is liable to get wet however well it is made so i will use guncotton and of course i can make it myself one part cotton wool in fifteen parts of sulphuric and nitric acids then you wash it dry it look he gestured to a series of boxes in the corner that rested on top of several vats thats the guncotton yes over the past few months ive made several hundredweight of the stuff isnt it dangerous to have it lying around no no its quite safe if its prepared properly if its not cleaned and dried as it should be then it can easily go off all on its own but this is perfectly safe to make it explode it will have to be compressed then set off with a detonator made of mercuric fulminate at the moment you could jump up and down on it all day and come to no harm thats the dangerous stuff over there he pointed to another corner whats that gunpowder i bought it before i realised it wouldnt do its useless now im going to use it on corts pillar if he can make up his mind what he wants so the explosive is in the front it hits the ship and bang bang precisely he said approvingly what size bang i mean how much explosive will you need to sink a battleship that will be determined by experiments youre going to fire off torpedoes at passing battleships until one sinks i dont think that will be necessary he said with the air of one who would have loved nothing more detonating explosives against plates of armour will do im almost disappointed i said but isnt a gun more reliable less chance of something going wrong and less chance of the other ship getting out of the way and cheaper possibly so but to send a shell of equivalent power on its way you need a gun weighing some sixty tons and for that you need a very large ship which has to be armourplated and carry a large crew with a few of these a corvette of three hundred tons and a crew of sixty will be a match for the largest battleship in the world the royal navy will thank you for that im sure i said ironically macintyre laughed they wont this will neutralise every navy in the world no one will dare send their capital ships to sea for fear of losing them war will come to an end i found his optimism touching if misplaced that would kill off demand for your invention would it not how many of these could you sell i have no idea i did if it worked and he could persuade one navy to buy them then he would sell them to every navy in the world admirals are as discerning as housewives in a department store they must have what everyone else is having does it work of course at least it will work when one or two problems are ironed out such as it has to go in a straight line as i say that is quite straightforward but it also has to propel itself at a constant depth not rising and falling through the water not over the top of it why because ships are plated above the waterline but not so heavily below it shells burst when they hit the water so there is rarely direct damage under sea level and so little need to protect the hulls so far down how much does it cost to make these ive no idea and how much will you try to sell them for i havent thought about that where would you manufacture them you could hardly do it here i dont know how much have you spent on developing it so far all of a sudden the boyish look of enthusiasm which had animated his face since he began talking about his machine faded he looked his age and more so careworn and anxious everything i have or had and more you are in debt he professed to like direct questions normally i do not except where money is concerned there i desire absolute and unambiguous precision he nodded how much three hundred pounds i think at what rate of interest i dont know i was appalled however skilled macintyre was as an engineer he was no businessman in that department he was a naïve as a newborn babe and someone i could tell was taking advantage of that i do not object to such practices macintyre was an adult and far from stupid he had entered into an agreement fully conscious of what he was doing if he did so that was his fault not the fault of the person who was so exploiting his unworldly nature it turned out so he told me that he had needed money both to pay the wages of his men and to buy the material necessary for his great machine and had assumed he would be able to pay it off with a job he had taken on designing the metal work for a new bridge to be thrown across the grand canal but that project had collapsed so no payment was forthcoming and the debts had mounted up i arrived in venice with enough money so i thought to live indefinitely but this machine has been more difficult than i could ever have imagined the problems to be solved you cannot believe it building the case and ensuring it is watertight designing the engine the detonator coming up with an entirely new device to regulate depth it takes time and money more money than i have so you are heavily in debt with no assets to draw on paying what i imagine is a high rate of interest how long before you are unable to continue not long my creditors are pressing they are insisting that the torpedo be tried out and quickly otherwise they will call in their debts can you do that im going to give a demonstration soon if it works i will be allowed to borrow more but it is too early much too early he did not continue and had no need to i think you need a bookkeeper as much as you do a draughtsman or a machinist i said money is as important a component as steel he shrugged plainly uninterested theyre thieves he said theyd steal my invention and leave me with nothing unless i was careful i hate to say it but you are not being careful oh everything will be just fine next week when the test is done are you sure he looked weary any sort of calculation in engineering i can do but show me a contract or a page of accounts with me it is the precise opposite listen if you wish i could look through that side of things see what the situation is precisely and tell you in words even an engineer could understand how you stand at the moment only if you wish i do not want to interfere in any way i was very reluctant to make this offer as it is generally unwise to give financial advice unbidden but the look of hopelessness on his face as he talked of his debts was beguiling and my mind was racing an entirely new class of weapon could be formidably profitable witness mr maxims rapidfire gun which from small beginnings rapidly became more or less obligatory equipment for every army in the world and the beauty of macintyres machine was that it was so wasteful unlike a cannon which was so to speak a fixed investment with the cost of employment quite low only the amount needed to buy the shell and the gunpowder the torpedo could be employed once only once sent on its way the whole thing would have to be replaced the potential for replacement orders was considerable and if i knew my sailors in a conflict they would fire them off like rockets on guy fawkes night regular orders from an organisation with bottomless pockets the prospect was enticing not least because i was fairly certain that macintyres aim of eliminating war by making destruction certain was as unlikely as it was noble no weapon has ever made war less likely they merely end wars more quickly by killing people at higher speeds until the mind of man invents something capable of killing everyone that will not change but it seemed that the chances of macintyre ever succeeding with his device were small to nonexistent he barely had the resources to finish one so what chance had he of producing them in bulk who would provide the capital to fit out a factory hire a workforce who would run it ensure that the machines were properly made sold and delivered macintyre had no idea of any of this nor did he even know how to find those who did the whole situation was full of possibilities if the machine worked chapter he did not buy me lunch or even share a meal with me but i was quite content as i walked back to my apartment taking diversions here and there so that it was early evening by the time i finally returned it had been a most interesting day and my spirits were further buoyed by three messages that awaited my return one from the marchesa saying that i should dine with her the following week as she had a delightful entertainment for me the next from mr macintyre containing a bundle of papers and a curt note saying that here were his accounts if i wished to look at them and the last was from mrs cort saying that her husband had given his permission for her to guide me around the city we could begin tomorrow if i wished my stay in venice was settling down to being remarkably enjoyable and no small part of it was due to the surroundings the quiet of the place has a wonderful appeal if you are receptive to it the more so because it is so unnoticed the effect of the light also really cannot be put into words it is not the peace of an english sunday for example when the quiet is almost total but there is always the knowledge of what came before and what will come the next day there is always the faintest haze in venice suggesting to the mind that the moment will continue forever that there never will be a tomorrow it is hard to occupy yourself with the concerns of the world for concerns are always about what will happen in the future and in venice the future will never come and the past will never disappear i find that i have only a small recollection of buildings and scenery from that time i have no strong memories of views or vistas i had reached a stage where i hardly noticed any of it some of the greatest works of art and architecture made no conscious impression on me at all the effect however was total and overwhelming it was like being in a different world where everything fitted together an old woman sitting on a step a palace a waiter setting out tables washing on a line boats crossing the lagoon islands hazy in the morning mist seagulls in the sky all of these were part of this whole relating perfectly to each other and to my mood which moved rapidly from dream to purposeful activity seamlessly i became a venetian that afternoon walking to a spot on the riva with a book i had intended to view something but i do not even remember what as i never got there i sat down on the steps of a bridge and watched the boats go by a pretty girl was selling pears fresh from the tree i wanted one but had no money on me but they were so luscious so fat and juicy looking some bruised already and oozing sweet sticky liquid in the basket and eventually i leaned over and took one biting into it before she even noticed what i had done then she turned and i shook my head i couldnt help it my glance said the girl dark haired and bright eyed smiled at my pleasure then laughed and offered me another take take she said take what you want and i did i took another bowing in acknowledgement and not feeling in the slightest bit embarrassed about offering nothing in return she waved her hand anyway dont worry you will pay later was the sense of her smile everything is paid for eventually that evening i settled down to read mr macintyres accounts some may consider this a dull way of spending time even an anticlimax after a day such as i had just enjoyed i know that it is an unusual pleasure and that account books are a byword for spiritless mechanical drabness but that is said by those who do not understand them in truth a set of accounts can be as full of drama and passion as any novel a whole year more than that of human endeavour is abbreviated compressed down into a page of hieroglyphics add understanding and the story bursts forth rather as dried fruit expands when water is added to it macintyres accounts were a particular challenge because they were so sloppy and did not conform to any rules of accountancy that i had ever come across what italians consider expenditure or income is very different for some items there seemed to be no fixed definitions at all had they been deliberately designed to confuse then they could not have been better constructed but eventually i teased out their secrets macintyre had run out of money about a year previously and had had to prepare approximate accounts of the previous few years endeavours to back his application for a loan these showed that he had started with and he had spent it at about a year since taking the loan he had spent a further which with accumulated and unpaid interest meant he was now in debt that is he was paying interest at about per cent a year which was quite enough to sink any project most of the money had gone on machinery part of which was recoverable if necessary wages and materials for building his machine his net position was in fact not as bad as it looked at first sight if all the machinery had been sold at a reasonable price he would be able to pay off most of his debts but not all he would be left with nothing at all for his efforts except for his invention at this point we entered the land of fantasy macintyre had essayed a guess about bringing his torpedo into production but it was so devoid of any commonsense or knowledge that it was almost laughable i swiftly enough made my own calculations purchase of a suitable premises would cost around the necessary machine tools about a workforce of about forty to begin with would mean running costs of about a year which would have to be borne out of initial investment as it was unlikely to produce any revenue for at least that time plus the cost of material which would be about for each machine say another for the first year a required initial investment therefore of before a single torpedo was carried onto its first ship or the first request for payment sent out and macintyre could not even manage a debt of without sinking into near bankruptcy what was worse he had been obliged to offer security for the loan and had nothing to give instead he had in effect handed over the patent not outright for cash but merely for permission to borrow possibly the most foolish thoughtless bargain any man has ever made he no longer owned his own invention this part of the paperwork took me some time to get through as it involved a considerable amount of legal jargon with which i was unfamiliar besides i could not initially believe it even when i had managed to make it out but it was all too true if the torpedo failed macintyre would suffer as his debt would be called in if it succeeded he would not benefit as the machine was not his i could only conclude that he did not care that he was so unworldly that all he wanted was to perfect his invention to show the world his ability macintyre did not want to manufacture his torpedo or make money out of it once it was finished he would probably lose interest judging by how he had talked about ending war it was quite possible he would be almost pleased not to have anything more to do with it he wanted to show it could be done that was all but why why so obsessed why so careless here the limitations of accounts come into play they can tell of the movements of men of their money but rarely give much of an insight into their motives although macintyres fanaticism was written into every column of payments he bought the best of everything the highest quality steel the most expensive german precision instruments materials he had imported from sweden or england when i was sure perfectly reasonable local substitutes were available at a fraction of the price he had paid bills were settled promptly when he had the money he could not be bothered with the minor savings a delay of a week or a month might bring i sat on a chair on my balcony looking down at the quiet of the canal below dreaming peacefully i was calculating fast something i can do without the need for actual thought numbers money take shape in my head and flow into new forms without the need to consider it at all actively a woman was slowly propelling a barge down the canal talking loudly to a little girl perched in the front of the boat they were cheerful even though it was the end of what had probably been for them a day of long labour she was in no hurry would give the oar a twitch enough to make the boat spurt forward then rest as it slid along and almost stopped before twitching it again by the time she had rounded the corner halfway down into a tiny side canal i had not noticed before i had the entire plan laid out in my head macintyre needed to be rescued from himself in effect his foolishness had done me a great favour i would have never even considered trying to wrest control of his invention from him of forcing my assistance on him against his will or without his knowledge but it was no longer his he had sold it and i had no qualms about taking on his bankers they were opponents for whom one needed to feel little sympathy if i could triumph over them cardano would help i felt sure he would be able to back a private loan so that i would retain absolute control and be able to pay off the debt when profits began to rise i knew exactly the man who could help me set up the enterprise could put me in touch with land agents to find a site i would put in six perhaps five thousand of my own money depending on the terms that cardano could get a limited company to protect myself by carefully not paying any bills unless forced to do so it would be a simple matter to make the suppliers in effect pay for the loan itself they would get their money eventually or we would all sink with the torpedo i found it all very relaxing although i knew i would have to revisit my figures the next day to see whether they were still realistic or whether i had constructed too optimistic an outlook underestimated costs overestimated possible revenues and i would wander down to the foreign library near san marco to see what if any information could be had on the worlds navies i emerged from the library the next day feeling even more cheerful the main navies of the world were the royal navy everyone knew that with the french next after these two came austria italy the united states russia after them a few south american countries had ideas and ambition as did japan all in all the world could boast if that is the right word some capital ships mediumsized vessels which could be used for fighting and another used for coastal protection and so on say fifteen torpedoes for the first category five for the second one for the third a possible world market of more than torpedoes and i reckoned i could charge each possible revenues of more than six million pounds assume only half of the potential was turned into orders over a period of ten years and replacement orders of th part of the total per year that would suggest recurrent orders of about a year and revenue when properly under way of more than possible profits per year of about for an initial investment of assuming the business would be valued at fifteen years purchase then that would create an enterprise of about one and a half million pounds navies would order if it worked but would it macintyre was confident and i was sure his acumen as an engineer was greater than his skill as a businessman but even so obsession and he was surely a man obsessed leads to cloudy judgement then there was the issue of wresting control from his creditors who i was sure had a better notion of his machines financial potential than he did they would not give it up for a paltry sum and i did not wish to pay high the whole point of the game is to get a bargain anyone can pay a full price how was this to be done first know your opponent and here much to my surprise my landlady proved to be a fount of useful information ambrosian the head of the bank that had made the loan was she told me highly respected as a man who had stayed in venice during the austrian occupation but who had refused to have many dealings with vienna he had done most of his business with venetians and forged contacts with banking families in italy france anywhere but austria like most patriotic citizens he had refused all invitations to official functions refused to go to the theatre or opera refused to sit in a café where an austrian was sitting and so it was said subsidised forbidden groups of nationalists to annoy the foreign oppressors he was something of a hero whether he was any good as a banker was another matter entirely such information as i could gather from newspapers suggested a wellbottomed but somewhat unimaginative operation which was good such people do not like risks but newspapers are often wrong i did wish communications were better i had sent off a letter to cardano shortly after i arrived and had mentioned macintyre and also cort but had received no reply even going by express mail it would take a week for a letter to arrive in london a week for the reply to come back better than it had been only a few years previously no doubt but in london i could have found all the information i needed in a morning now the telegraph crisscrosses the world telephones are becoming common and people take instantaneous communication for granted they should try to imagine a world where a letter to california or australia or india could take up to a month even at speed chapter the next day was a dream of such perfection that i have never approached the like again it was of course all illusion but i like to think of it still in isolation from what came after as a moment of bliss one of those days when one is no longer oneself but becomes bigger and better able to overcome the normal preoccupations of life and breathe more freely should anyone read this who knows me only from my reputation i have no doubt that this narrative of idleness and dreaminess will occasion nothing but incredulity if business and romance do not mix how very much more incompatible are finance and passion one requires a personality that is purely cold and rational the other must give way to the impetuous such feelings cannot coexist in the same individual to which i must reply that anyone who thinks this knows nothing of money finance is every bit as much an art as painting or music it is very similar to musical performance for while much does depend on skill a musician who cannot play is not a musician a financier who cannot understand a balance sheet will soon be a beggar skill can only take you so far beyond that point lies poetry many find this difficult to believe but it is true some people are so much in tune with the markets that they do not need to manipulate a stock price or break a law to profit they can feel the ebbs and flows of capital in the way a horse rider understands his steed and can make it obey him without use of whip or stirrup money is merely another term for people a representation of their desires and personalities if you do not understand one you cannot hope to understand the other take the matter of giving an inducement to win a contract this is frowned on called bribery and in some cases is even considered criminal but it is an area in which rational calculation and emotional empathy are the most perfectly fused it is an art form a russian expects an envelope full of money an english civil servant would be outraged at the idea but is no less corrupt or greedy he desires employment for his nephew which is often a more generous gift it is diplomacy carried over to the world of affairs and both require delicacy and judgement i acknowledge no equal in the art not even mr xanthos for he is too cynical too ready to hold the person he persuades in contempt as i write i have before me a sheet of paper listing the shares in my companies owned by some of the greatest politicians in england i arranged it all some six years ago as a precaution and have never asked for anything in return nor will i but these people will in due course do what is necessary in their own interests and mine not that anyone else knows of this it is why my managers are becoming nervous and are unable to understand my calm belief that all will be well they fear i have lost my touch my venice that day was a city full of tremulous anticipation i wished to spend the day with mrs cort even more than i wished to travel in a gondola around the canals we met by a landing stage not far from the rialto where gondola gondolier and a hamper of food already awaited it was eight in the morning and brilliantly clear warm already with the promise of more to come the city itself was sparkling and mrs cort i hope i do not give away too much if at this point i begin to call her louise was standing waiting for me and smiled as i approached a smile of such warmth and promise that my heart skipped a beat gondolas are not a place for any sort of intimate conversation although we sat side by side rather than opposite each other the boats are arranged for those who do not know with the gondolier standing at the back so he had a clear view not only of the waters ahead but also of his passengers they miss nothing and a flimsy construction over our heads provided only limited privacy a brushing of hand against hand the faint pressure of bodies touching in the cramped confines of the hull it was almost unbearable and i could sense she was under a similar pressure i could feel the tension within her longing for some outlet and so the morning passed in delicious frustration the conversation edging towards intimacy then pulling back before moving closer once more how long have you lived in venice i asked this being an example of a conversation that proceeded in fits and starts punctuated by long silences as we were both calmed by the soft splashing of the water against the side of the boat about five months she replied you met mr cort in england yes in london where i was working as a governess she said this with a slight defiance as if to see whether my attitude to her would change as a result of learning of her situation how did you come to that position my father died when i was young leaving my mother to look after us two boys and two girls i was the eldest when i was fourteen my mother fell ill so i had to work eventually i was engaged by a family in chelsea not rich by many standards but well enough off to afford me i cared for their two children until i left to marry they were delightful children i miss them still true love no he desired a wife to look after him and i craved the certainty of marriage it was an arrangement suitable to us both she sighed and broke off to look over the lagoon towards the lido which was slowly coming closer i did not wish to intrude so asked no further but i understood all too well that she lived in a loveless marriage deprived of that affection that all human beings must have it is the situation of many perhaps it is the normal circumstance of most and she did not complain of a contract freely entered into but it is not in our nature to remember how much worse things might have been we only dream of the better that slips through our fingers and he brought you here yes but i find this dreary conversation for such a day tell me about yourself instead you must have had a more interesting life than i have so far enjoyed i doubt that what can i say are you married yes happily which is the moment i stepped closer to the edge yes happily my adored wife i miss her so much words acting like an impregnable fortress able to keep her out me inside both separated for ever i said nothing and she understood my meaning but your wife is not here why is that she does not like to travel does she have a name she was probing teasing me betrayal mounted on betrayal as i turned aside and did not answer once more then turned back and met her eyes as they looked calmly straight into mine communicating endlessly whole volumes about us both and what do you do i spend my time investing money for gain it takes up much of my life she looked curious i understand nothing about money she said this is not the time to start learning i said i find it fascinating and can discuss it for hours but i also think there must be other topics to talk about when one is in a gondola on a fine morning in the company of a beautiful woman she smiled faintly and looked away i wondered how long it had been since anyone had spoken thus to her if anyone ever had i like that she said softly there then followed the longest silence of the day our closeness had already grown too great to require words instead we both sat quietly watching the flat strip of land growing closer i so aware of her it was almost painful the lido has changed greatly since then now the hotels i once imagined in my minds eye have sprung up along its length then it was all but deserted the main road was little more than a track that led out of the tiny settlement on the city side of the strip within a few hundred yards all habitation ceased and there were instead only cows and a few sheep occupying an island near fifteen miles long and a mile wide at the time i was somewhat disappointed i had anticipated a voyage in the inner lagoon seeing the sights i thought every visitor should see murano torcello and all of those i had not yet seen much even of the main city let alone its outlying regions so coming to a place which was virtually deserted and which had no features of note was not what i desired at all why have you brought me here i asked somewhat petulantly wait and see she said i love this place it is the only place where you can be alone come she directed the gondolier to pick up the hamper of food and carry it over the island to the other side she later told me she had discovered this spot many weeks before and had kept it secret from everyone treasuring it as a place she alone in the world knew about to show it to me was the greatest compliment the other side was not far although a mile or more wide at its tip the lido narrows down along its length until it is only a few hundred yards across it is not one island rather it is a whole string of them artificially joined over the centuries to form a barrier protecting the city from the adriatic it was all but deserted offering nothing to the population except uncertain weather in winter and a place to walk in summer and to swim i had learned to swim as a boy when i stayed for the summers at the house of a relative in hampshire this family possessed a large garden with a fine pond surrounded by reeds once you waded through them you had the finest swimming place imaginable with clear fresh water that warmed pleasantly in the sun there my cousins had taught me to swim and although i was not expert i had learned also to love the feel of water to see the rolling waves of the adriatic basking in the sunshine of late summer gave me one thought only which was to wade into the water as quickly as possible again the thought occurred to me i had been sent to school at a boarding establishment in brighton until i was thirteen and had seen the bathing houses and the women ponderously wading into the icy water for their health i imagine as it is difficult to see how it could have been for their pleasure dressed in voluminous costumes so heavy they could not possibly have swum without sinking i remembered also the habitually leaden skies and the chill that hit you as you emerged from the water dripping wet only to be frozen by the frigid winds of an english summer and here was something close to paradise on earth men now go to the south seas to search for such an unspoilt landscape back in it could be found much closer to home only a short boat ride from san marco its beautiful i said as we walked down a little path that led to a copse of trees she smiled listen she said pausing for a moment and holding up a finger i listened what nothing she replied nothing at all there is only the sound of the sea and the birds that is why i like it we had arrived at her special place a clearing inside the copse surrounded on three sides by thick foliage that prevented any passerby from seeing us and open on the other to the sea like the most glorious theatre set in the world it was dark and cool in the shade and i spread out our blanket on the ground while louise opened the hamper and took out the simple food she had prepared a cold chicken some bread and a bottle of water how do you like the architecture of palladio she asked coyly as we finished our meal which for all its simplicity was delicious i like it very much or would do no doubt if i had seen any why because that is what you are admiring at the moment really yes mr cort gave me permission to spend the day showing you the city i believe he felt that it was improper for me to be alone with you otherwise in the middle of venice there could be little scandal and you disobeyed his orders she nodded are you shocked dreadfully and then i leaned over and kissed her very clumsily even aggressively but i could stand the tension no more i was well aware that she might pull back that the moment might be ruined by my behaviour but i did not care i was a venetian i could take what i wanted i had to know and had to show my intentions however dishonourable and however much i might risk losing her esteem had i made a mistake it was appalling behaviour to try and take advantage of a married woman in an isolated spot when she had trusted me i can only say that i was overtaken by a sort of madness the impetuosity that comes from being in a foreign land where the usual demands of behaviour are relaxed combined with the special magic of a place which encourages emotional display normally kept hidden from view she did not pull back instead she responded to my advance with a ferocity that encouraged still more from me and we lay back on the the ground bodies entwined and unable to get sufficient of each other groans being the only communication between us apart from the eloquent conversation of our bodies how it happened i do not know i cannot recall whose initiative it was but i felt her hands exploring my body so firmly that i was roused to a pitch of excitement greater than anything i had ever experienced before and i scrabbled vainly at her clothes oh the clothes of that period like medieval castles they were designed to repel all assault until she pulled back again i was surprised for i expected her to come to her senses then and realise the peril of her situation but she did not all she said was not like that and slowly began unbuttoning her blouse then her skirts until she was revealed to me in all her beauty and lay back on the blanket and held out her arms for me an expression of desperation and longing on her face it was not good that first time perhaps it never is between two people so uncertain of each other so unknowing of the others needs and desires but she cried out almost in pain towards the end and i could feel the tension seeping from her body as it ebbed slowly from mine then we lay together i slowly caressing her belly still unable truly to believe that such a thing had happened what was this woman what sort of person gives herself up in such a fashion but again i did not care i had had such thoughts before with others and in each case the result had been a sort of disgust a separation of lust from respect and an inability to reconcile the two feelings there was no such difficulty now i was merely content blissful and desired nothing more than to hold her close for ever i felt whole for the first time in my life but as i turned to look on her face i saw tears trickling slowly down her cheek and was startled into sitting up oh my dear i am so sorry so very sorry i said genuinely convinced that she had at last realised the folly of her actions she laughed through her tears and shook her head no i am not crying for that she said what then she said nothing but reached across and found her blouse which she put without any underclothes across her shoulders tell me i insisted i dont know if i can she said it is not easy to say it try she looked out to sea for a long while gathering her thoughts i was twentyseven when i married mr cort she began softly an old maid i had all but given up thought of marrying and believed i would have to make shift as best i could on my own then he appeared and proposed i accepted even though i knew there would never be any love between us he made me no promises nor i him he wanted a housekeeper he has no notion of love or romance besides i was giving nothing up and i thought we would make do together i would have children and they would provide affection enough i learned soon enough that was simply a dream as well he cannot do what you do what do you mean we do not have the intimacy of the sort that is usual between man and wife she continued stiffly nor has he any interest in women in that way i thought to begin with it was just the shyness of a habitual bachelor but i soon realised that it was more than that no i must say no more as you wish but do not keep silent for my sake i could see what she meant by this being difficult it was hard to listen to but once she had started she could not stop it was as though all her words had been blocked in her for years and took the first opportunity to come bursting out into the open to the first sympathetic listener i said nothing at all merely listening cemented our intimacy and drew our lives closer together made us lovers in the soul as well as the body he has other tastes terrible perverted disgusting ones he did his duty and we had our son but that was all when i discovered what he was i could no longer go near him i will not have him touch me if i have the choice do you understand i nodded but only hesitantly that is why he likes venice there is opportunity for people like him you think of him as a mild gentle man do you not foolish ineffectual but goodnatured i suppose that is my general impression yes you do not know him you do not know what he is like i find this all difficult to believe i know much of the time he is as you know him but then the madness comes on him and he changes he is violent cruel do you want me to tell you the things he does the things he makes me do when i dont run away or lock myself in a room so he cannot come to me him and the people he finds he likes pain you see it excites him it is the only thing which does he is not manly in the world and he takes his revenge on me i shook my head dont tell me i reached out and took her hand horrified by what she was saying how could anyone treat such a woman any woman in the fashion she hinted at it was beyond all understanding you do not seem like someone who has been so abused i said i do not have bruises or cuts at the moment she said do you doubt me wait a little and soon enough i will have marks to satisfy you i did not mean that i replied quickly i meant that you do not have the air of a woman mistreated neglected unloved perhaps i have grown used to it she said it was not always so in the beginning i rebelled but how could i do so successfully i have no money of my own no position he is my husband if i ran away where would i run he would find me again or i would starve i tried once but i was discovered before i could leave so i have learned i think to myself that perhaps not all men are like that i tell myself that it will pass once the madness passes he is perfectly agreeable for weeks before it starts again he has allowed me to show you around is that the decision of a monster the man you have met is he cruel and violent no to the outside world he is meek and mild only i know the truth of what he is like but who would ever believe me if i said anything it is i who would be called mad not him here she broke down completely her head in her hands sobbing silently she could not go on and even turned her back on me when i tried to comfort her i insisted and eventually she gave way throwing herself into my arms and crying without restraint i could not yet see my course of action all i knew was that i would eventually have one you must leave i said leave venice and your husband i cannot she said scornfully how could i do such a thing where would i go i could no she said really frightened now no you must say nothing do nothing you must promise me but i must do something you must not do you think of yourself as a knight in shining armour rescuing the damsel in distress we do not live in an age when such things happen he has rights i am his property what would happen he would deny it all of course he would say i was inventing things he would get someone like marangoni to say that i was a habitual liar that i was mad do you think that if i told the truth said that he beats me to become excited she broke off horrified at what she had said that she had let out more than she wished about her hellish existence please she said pleading with me please do not take matters into your own hands do not intervene there is nothing you can do for me except to love me a little show me that there are men who are not monsters that there is more to love than pain and tears i shook my head in confusion what do you want i need to think to clear my head meeting you was i cannot describe it the moment i saw you i felt something i have never known before i do not ask you for help there is nothing you can do for me i ask you simply for your presence a little that is more soothing and comforting than anything you can say or do you ask for too little i ask for more than any person has ever given me she replied stroking my cheek and if i asked for more i might not get it you doubt me she did not reply but threw herself on me once more no more words she said not for a while she was ferocious it was as though having unburdened herself to me shown me her secrets she had no need left of any modesty or caution she was violent with me just as others had been violent in their hatred of her it was her defence i thought to respond to her tormentors in such a way afterwards she lay once more on the ground stretched out with a total lack of caution or care i wish i could die now she said as she ran her fingers through my hair do you not agree to end your life in this place with the sound of the sea and the trees the light twinkling through the branches will you kill me it would make me happy you know please kill me now i would like to die at your hands i laughed but her face was serious then i would never see you again or talk to you or hold you i said and i am a selfish man now i have you i will not let you go so easily whatever your wishes oh if only i had known men such as you existed i might have made different choices listen i said beginning to pull on my clothes time was passing far quicker than i wished and one of us had to remember the outside world continued to exist how do you wish to proceed now i need hardly say that i want to repeat this afternoon do you want that also if you do not then tell me now because i could not stand to be repulsed what would you do if i refused you i would leave and quickly there is no vital reason to stay here do not leave i really would die if you did so what do we do now we cannot come all the way to the lido every afternoon and we cannot meet either in your lodging or mine i have had no experience in arranging secret meetings with a lover she said and i could hear in her voice a faint tremor of excitement as though the very idea was bringing her spirits back to life nor i i replied truthfully but i believe it is usual in such circumstances to rent a room generally in some poor part of the city it would not be elegant and would offer few conveniences except privacy such things are normally for women of low quality though and i would hesitate no let us do that that is what i am nothing more than that and i will be that for you with pleasure i looked closely at her she was serious it was settled and in the most businesslike terms there was no need for delicacy of language for in our acts we had already passed beyond the point of dissimulation secrecy was of the essence i would acquire a room for our meetings we would be conspicuous to some no doubt but not to anyone who might care as long as we were safe from the prying eyes of other foreigners we could be safe the venetians see all and say nothing and so we made our way back as the evening light was beginning to settle over the city the gondolier rowed methodically making us feel safe by his knowing silence we sat together side by side until we were close in and said not a word to each other the evening shadows were our conversation the softness of the light and the calm of the water were our emotions made tangible venice is quiet in comparison to most cities yet it seemed noisy and raucous to my ears as we came in to land the people walked too fast had too many reasons for what they did and said unlike me as i no longer had any reason or desire to do anything i touched her only as i helped her out of the gondola and our eyes met briefly before the collusion and dissimulation that was to be our life from now on intervened it was an electric moment as we both realised how much we were now bound to each other conspirators together living a secret life of lies and deceit i consider myself a moral man who upholds the laws of god and man as best as he is able i was married and in all the time since i wed my wife i had never deceived or betrayed her in any way i hold to my contracts and keep my word i considered that louise had been absolved from whatever vows she had sworn by the treatment she had received she had said too much and regretted her words but i now had some idea of the hellish life she endured with her husband no one owes loyalty to such a person i had no such excuse and i try to make none except to say that excitement is a drug and venice is a treacherous place which sucks people down i wanted her and for the first time in my life all the arguments and reasons which would have stopped me were of no effect i didnt even consider what i was doing did not feel guilty for a single moment all objections i brushed aside venice had taken hold of me and i had rushed into its embrace as willingly as i had rushed into hers the rest of the world would not have viewed it with such indulgence of course i had seduced another mans wife and what had begun in hot blood i intended to continue in a spirit of calculation the life of deception started that moment i must thank you mrs cort for your assistance today i trust you did not find it too dull on the contrary she replied and if you wish me to accompany you again then please do not hesitate to say so i am sure mr cort will not object and then we bade each other farewell in a stiff and formal fashion and i turned to leave my heart pounding with excitement my liaison demanded secrecy and what better way of ensuring that than to act entirely normally i might have wandered the streets soaking up the atmosphere of the place which was already coiling itself around my being venice is the most dangerous place on earth or was then until the tourists came and swamped the air of threat which existed in its very stones with the futile frivolity of the sightseer and converted the inhabitants into supplicants of the transient why so moody such might have been the question had any acquaintance encountered me and it was far too soon to run such risks so i resolved to shut off that part of my thoughts and switch my attention to other things there was a part of me an everdiminishing weakening part it is true which fought against the seductions of the city although only halfheartedly i walked to the offices of the banca di santo spirito and left my card for signor ambrosian i wished to meet a man who knew about the city knew how it worked that is rather than knew about its buildings which is always the easiest thing to discover and who also knew about macintyre i have always found it strange that people are willing to travel to a place and devote some considerable energy to doing so yet leave with not the slightest knowledge or interest in the lives of the inhabitants an old friend of mine travelled through the balkans a few years ago and spent months in those countries yet came back knowledgeable only about landscapes and the architecture of orthodox monasteries how was capital accumulated how were the cities run was the system of taxation efficient or no what levels of literacy and discipline could you count on among the population what in other words about the stuff of their lives not only did he have no knowledge of these things he had no interest in them seeming to think that monasteries merely pop out of the ground like mushrooms without any application of either money or labour and that cities are simply wished into existence for no reason other than to delight the eye of the visitor the same applies to venice but on a grander scale what were these people doing living in the middle of the sea like that why in their days of greatness did they not migrate to the land how now that those days of grandeur were past did they intend to adapt themselves to a new world signor ambrosian seemed the best fitted to answer such questions no one else i had yet met was likely to do so i wrote a note on the back of my calling card asking him to send a message to my accommodation and then returned there for a rest before dinner i was hungry the day had been long and the food not plentiful and the excitement had worked up a fine appetite in me i was looking forward to dinner and my own company for i resolved that that evening i would eat alone it was natural even necessary to place myself in the way of english society but i was not that evening willing to converse with the likes of longman in a fashion of easy conviviality and i knew that such a manner was utterly vital if my deception was to be successful besides i was not yet ready to meet cort again for the next few days a certain watchful peace descended on me all thoughts of leaving and moving on to new sights and places fell away so softly i did not even realise they had departed i could not even keep myself fixed on reality through business as i received a letter from signor ambrosians secretary to say the banker was away for a few days but that he would be happy to make my acquaintance on his return i was in love for the first time in my life so i thought when i had taken her i had abandoned all my caution and any doubts she was irresistible and i did not want to resist her vulnerability which hid so well a terrible animality fascinated me i could see nothing but perfection i wanted her more than anything else in my entire life i was not a passionate man in my habits not romantic in my behaviour i imagine this is obvious already i had disciplined myself carefully and thoroughly but nature will out venice and louise cort broke the dam and a torrent of emotion burst through the more i possessed her the more i was prepared to lose myself in that glorious unmatched feeling and prove it through recklessness i thought i was in love because i knew so little i thought i loved my wife but louise showed me that was mere affection with not even much respect to solidify it and then i thought i loved louise not realising it was simply passion untrammelled by knowledge only when i came to elizabeth did i finally understand and by then i was getting old it was almost too late she saved me from a dry and empty life i had looked for someone perfect but did not realise until then that was not the point only when you can know someones every fault failing and weakness and not care do you truly know what love is elizabeth certainly has her failings every single one of them makes me smile with affection or feel sad for her sufferings i have known her now for nearly two decades and every day i know her better love her more she is my love and more than that but then louise cort the image and remembrance of her filled my days and my mind and tinted the city i daily grew to know ever better i became lover and saviour my pride and vanity grew as my association with her contrasted my nature all the more powerfully with that of cort the practical matters were easily disposed of there was a man who worked at the hotel i had initially stayed in signor fanzano spoke english and had struck me as a robust commonsensical fellow worldly and discreet i have a certain requirement for accommodation i said when i discovered him near the kitchens of the hotel i need some rooms that are comfortable but private he did not ask what i wanted such a thing for merely applied himself to the matter do i take it you do not wish anyone to know you have these rooms he asked yes that is the main necessity so not in the centre not in san marco but presumably not too far away either precisely do you have any particular price in mind none and how long would you need this for i do not know i will happily pay for three months to begin with they must be furnished and clean he nodded leave it to me mr stone i will send a message when i have come up with something two days later i received a message to apply to a signora murtano in a small street close to san giovanni è paolo near the fondamenta nuova she turned out to be one of fanzanos relations although everyone in venice seems to be a relation of everyone else with a sitting room and bedroom to rent in a dingy house which had fallen far from its days of glory if it had ever had any but it had a fireplace wood extra as usual a separate entrance and only the cruellest luck might have caused me to encounter anyone i knew as i was entering or leaving the price was exorbitant not least because i had decided to give fanzano a handsome reward both for his dispatch and for his discretion it was a good bargain as it turned out it acquired the loyalty of a man who served me well for the next three decades but nonetheless i felt at the time that the price of love in venice was steep still it was done and the day after i had made the arrangement i arranged for louise to accompany me on another tour of the city we visited san giovanni together and then i showed her my find she knew exactly what i intended as we approached the front door and i was afraid that the practicality of it might affect her sensibilities and so it did but only to make her more wild and passionate dont open the shutters she said as i moved to let some light into the rooms so she could see it better we spent the next two hours exploring a new land far more exotic than a mere city of brick and marble could ever be even if it does float in the ocean like some fading flower she was the most exciting woman i had known she brought out a recklessness in me that i had never believed existed only very occasionally did things go awry between us then and every time thereafter that she could steal away for an afternoon an hour even on one occasion a fumbling desperate encounter of less than fifteen minutes when she tore at me as her husband waited below that excited me thinking of her returning to her duties as a wife clothes immaculately in order face calm and showing no sign of the way i had only a few moments before pushed her against the wall and pulled up her dress to make her cry out with pleasure he could not do that i half wanted him to know once she pulled away as i was reaching for her i grabbed her arm and she turned angrily away but not before i caught sight of a red weal across her upper arm whats that how did that happen she shook her head and would not answer tell me i insisted my husband she said quietly he thought i had misbehaved does he suspect that oh no he is too stupid i had not done anything amiss it does not matter he gets the desire to hurt that is all that is all i replied hotly all what did he do to you tell me again a shake of the head i cannot tell you why not there was a long pause because i am afraid that you might wish to do the same chapter and so it went on we found time to meet more and more often sometimes every day she became expert at slipping away unnoticed we talked little she became sad when we did and in any case we had little enough to say then i did not think that mattered i had forgotten the marchesas salon and groaned with disappointment when i remembered it nonetheless i did my duty and presented myself on the following friday evening at seven i was bathed as well as is possible in a house with no running water and no easy means of heating what there was shaved changed and felt moderately satisfied with my appearance i imagined an evening such as one might encounter in london or paris alas it was very different remarkably dull for the first part deeply disturbing for the second a soirée in venice is a dreary weary affair with about as much joy in it as a scottish funeral and a good deal less to drink the spirit of carnevale has so deserted the city that it requires real effort to remember that it was once famed for its dissolution and carefree addiction to pleasure that pleasure is now well watered and joy rationed as though in short supply i attended few such events in my time in the city and when i left them i felt i had been there for hours though my pocket watch said it was less than half an hour on each occasion you enter are presented with a dry biscuit and a very little wine then you sit in a respectful circle around your hostess until decorum says it is time to leave i freely admit i understood little of the conversation as even the elevated talk in dialect but the seriousness of the faces the lack of laughter the ponderousness of the speech all indicated i was missing little and it was cold always even if a small fire burned bravely away in a far corner its feeble heat did little but tantalise the women were allowed to tuck earthenware pots of hot ashes about their persons to give some minimal warmth but such things were not allowed to men who had to freeze and try to forget the slow progress of icy numbness up the fingers and arms decline had expelled merriment which belongs to greatness the feebler venice had become the more humourless were its inhabitants they were in mourning perhaps the marchesa was venetian by marriage only but had embraced dullness with the enthusiasm of a convert she dressed for the occasion in black with acres of lace and a headdress which almost completely covered her face then sat on the settee quietly greeting those who arrived conversing briefly with them and as far as i could tell waiting pointedly until they got up bowed and left at least i was being introduced to venetian society although i later learned that the most respectable had long since refused to enter her door and she had equally long ago ceased to invite them there had been something of a scandal the marchesa as i have mentioned was not venetian and even worse was penniless when she married her husband which was done against the wishes of his family and that was the source of the scandal especially as the good gentleman many years her senior had died not long after without successfully providing an heir this was such a complete failure of responsibility that the marchesa was held to be somehow to blame because someone had to be at fault for such a lapse in a family which however impecunious of late had successfully negotiated disease war and ill fortune to survive in an unbroken line for seven centuries now it was all over a great name was on the verge of extinction already was extinct in the opinion of many bad fortune attends all families eventually england itself sees regular snuffings out of great names for my part i care not one jot nor would i if they all disappeared although i grant the utility of aristocracy in holding land for unless that is stable the country cannot be but for the most part three generations is more than enough to complete the ruin of any line one generation to make the fortune a second to enjoy it and a third to dissipate it in my case of course unless my current quest produces an answer i do not expect not even that is allotted to me i have no heir it is something we could not do all wish to leave something behind them and the vast organisation i have created is not enough i would have liked a child as i buried my father so he should have buried me and looked after elizabeth when i was dead it is our only chance of any immortality for i do not delude myself that my creations will outlive me for long the life of companies is very much shorter than the life of families that in truth was the greatest sadness of our lives together we were so close elizabeth was transformed by joy when she told me she was to have a baby and tasted true uncomplicated happiness for the first time but it was snatched away in the most horrible fashion imaginable the child was a monster i can say it now although for years i banished all thought of him he had to die would have anyway she never saw it never knew what had really happened but the sorrow was overwhelming for her we buried him and mourned for him and for what might have been it was not her fault of course it wasnt but she took it on herself thought that her life had somehow been responsible that the degradation she had known had suffused her being to such an extent that even the product of her body was corrupted i thought for a while she might never recover worried she might go back to those terrible drugs that she had once used so readily when strain and nervousness overtook her her life had been hard and dangerous the syringe of liquid made her forget just enough to keep going she came through of course she is so very brave but there were no more children the doctors said another pregnancy might kill her i think she would have embraced such a death gladly she is more precious than all the heirs all the children in the world let everything turn to dust blow away on the winds but let me have her by my side until the end if she left me i would die myself i do hope you enjoyed my little evening the marchesa said when all was at last over it was charming madam i replied most interesting she laughed the first lighthearted sound to have filled the room all evening it was terrible you mean she said you english are so polite you are ridiculous i smiled in an uncertain fashion yet you behaved yourself and made a good impression i thank you for that you have solidified the reputation of your country as a place of seriousness and dignity by sitting and saying nothing for such a long time you may even receive an invitation to some evenings from one or two of my guests she noticed the look of dismay which passed over my face dont worry on that they are easy enough they will be quite happy if you do not go she stood up and let her dress fall about her i got up as well and now she said we may begin on the more interesting part of the evening my spirits lifted at the very idea we will eat first of all and then then what ah for that you must wait and see but there will be people you know so you will not be lonely have you encountered mrs cort for example i trust that i did not give myself away but in some ways she was excessively perceptive i said i had met mrs cort poor woman why do you say that it is not hard to see that she is unhappy she said softly we have become friends in a fashion and she has told me much of her life the cruel way she was treated by employers in england the failings of her husband she put a painted nail to a painted lip to indicate the need for discretion she is drawn to the beyond i could have said that in my experience her interest in more earthly matters was rather more notable and that i had no need to be told about discretion but said nothing but then this life has little to offer her she continued she has a husband and a child she shook her head in a melodramatic fashion if you knew what i know she said but i must not gossip let us go in and welcome the guests she allowed me to take her arm and we finally left the cold draughty salon i did feel slightly aggrieved that what i had taken to be louises confidences to me she had also divulged to the marchesa but accepted that desperation does make women tell each other secrets i put it out of my mind and felt my mood improving with every step towards the dining room merely moving began to unfreeze my flesh although feeling her so close was a little uncomfortable she wore her usual overpowering perfume and pressed herself against my arm in a manner which was perhaps more intimate than her age made respectable in the dining room the candles were lit and a fire blazed to take off the evening chill it was warm outside but the houses are so permanently damp they are never truly comfortable at night and food was waiting to be served we ate and as we ate others entered marangoni first of all then mr and mrs cort and my heart leapt as i saw her and we exchanged a brief glance of complicity she held my gaze for only a fraction of a second no one could have seen it but it was enough i wish to be with you now she told me as plainly as anything could not with him i greeted cort as ordinarily as i could but my feelings towards him had changed utterly as much as possible i had taken to avoiding those places where i was likely to run into him i did not trust myself not to betray some hint of my contempt as i could not now think of him without remembering louises description of what he was truly like he noticed i am sure and was bemused by it as well he might be and the temptation to explain welled up in me for her sake only i controlled myself and made polite conversation for a few moments although his replies were vague and slow macintyre was not there of course he was too solid a man to consider attending such an event even had he not been offended by the marchesas rejection of his wish for rooms that might have made his daughter more comfortable longman and drennan made up the party so we were seven in all by the time the meal was done not a venetian amongst us i noted then the marchesa began to talk all about auras and journeys souls and spirits this side and the other side the room was darkened the atmosphere became more tense even though not a single guest was anything other than sceptical about the entire business except perhaps louise who seemed quite nervous about cort i could not tell he seemed almost drunk unresponsive to what was going on all around him we were going to have to pay for our meal with a visit to the other side it was absurd of course but in comparison to a more orthodox venetian at home it was positively enticing certainly it was different and i was interested to see how it might be done what stagecraft was to be deployed how convincing it would all seem to begin with it was hard to stop laughing i noticed that even drennan not a man to give way to raucous amusement was working hard to prevent his mouth twitching into a grin the marchesa adopted an ethereal tone of voice and waved her arms around so the folds of her sleeves billowed out is anybody there do you wish to communicate with anyone in this room she put her hands to her forehead to indicate concentration stared wildeyed at the ceiling to hint at the awesome nature of what was happening sighed heavily to show spiritual disappointment groaned softly to prove how hard she was having to work be not afraid o spirits come and deliver thy message in fact it was very like a parody of a spiritualist meeting and hard to avoid giving the table a kick just to see how she would react but then the atmosphere changed a message for the american amongst us she moaned quietly yes speak and we all looked at drennan who seemed not best pleased to be singled out in this fashion do you know someone called rose it is a message from someone called rose she intoned oddly businesslike now talking in a normal voice which was much more frightening than the obviously fake ethereal tone she had employed up to now she wishes to talk to you she says she loves you still this was when the amused air of the audience truly vanished and utter silence descended for we were all aware that drennans face had turned ashen and he had stiffened in his chair as though he had received a terrible shock but we said nothing she says she forgives you really what for longman asked his plummy voice quizzical and normal sounding entirely out of place and almost shocking alas the spirit was talking to itself not indulging in a conversation we got no answer to his question whether or not it made any sense to drennan was unclear his face was frozen and he was gripping the arms of his chair so tightly that his knuckles had turned white ah she is gone the marchesa said she cannot stay then a long sigh and theatricality took over once more we had another five minutes of little smiles and frowns and ohs and ahs then more of the come to me o spirits nonsense before she got down to business again this time it was cort who was being contacted and i knew the moment she began that this was going to cause trouble drennan was tough unemotional sensible but even he had been rattled how cort so much more fragile would react was fairly predictable he was already looking pale his gaze glassy had complained of a headache during the meal had eaten little he did however drink prodigious quantities of water the marchesa spun it out as well the spirits coming and going starting to speak then hesitating having to be cajoled into giving their message the buildup of tension was remarkably well done and it was all too evident that cort now bolt upright and sweating was succumbing to a bad case of nerves is there someone called william here she asked which did not impress me overmuch as she knew perfectly well that there was there is someone here who wishes to talk to him cort looking pale but trying to maintain an expression of manly scepticism put up his hand her name is annabelle said the marchesa reverting to her usual voice she is in great distress cort did not reply but the marchesa took silence as assent it is one who loves you she said she is sad and distressed she says you know full well what she means cort again said nothing but was breathing heavily sweating profusely then the marchesa began speaking in voices a girlish squeak that was quite terrifying to hear even for me the effect on cort was indescribable william you are cruel you dishonour your name stop or he will take your soul i am the one who gave my life that you might live a savage cry came from corts throat at this statement and he screamed pushing over his chair and backing wildeyed to the wall the noise brought the marchesa from her reverie and she stared around in confusion very convincingly i must say i do not think she was faking she clearly did go into some sort of trance even i sceptic though i was was prepared to grant her this then she focused on the scene her words had created peering with alarm at the mayhem she had let loose cort hard against the wall sobbing and moaning chairs tumbled over the floor as he had struck out at imagined apparitions drennan the only one of us to maintain some selfpossession moving to pick up the candelabrum that had tumbled on the floor and which threatened to burn the place down louise leaping back from the table and standing stock still staring at her husband cort my dear fellow longman began advancing towards him cort stared in terror at him rushed to a side table where the sweetmeats and brandies had been placed and grabbed a sharp knife used for peeling fruit get away from me get away leave me alone the tears flowed down his cheeks as he spoke but underneath them there was anger as well even though he had certainly never used a knife for such a purpose before he looked dangerous to me and i was quite prepared to follow his instructions longman was made of braver or more foolish stuff even though drennan called out a warning he advanced on the young man hands held out calm yourself dear boy he said in a kindly fashion theres nothing he did not finish cort backed away towards his wife and began lashing out violently it was obvious from his expression that he was not feinting louise fell back just in time a long red scratch showing through the sleeve of her green dress she fell to her knees with a piercing cry gripping her wounded arm dear god stop him are you mad all these conventional phrases burst from peoples lips as cort turned threw the knife on the floor and ran for the door just as drennan hurled himself forward and brought him to the ground there was no struggle cort made no resistance but broke down completely sobbing on the floor as all around looked on at the scene horrified appalled disgusted embarrassed according to their temperaments then people reverted to type longman started moaning as though he had been stabbed not louise marangoni became medical and started to treat her examining her wound with remarkable gentleness the marchesa collapsed in a fit of vapours and drennan reassured that the violence had gone out of the man coaxed cort to his feet and over to a chair only i not victim not healer not a hunter had no natural role to adopt i went to louise to assist but was pushed back by marangoni and i noticed an interested knowing look on his face as he did so so i pretended surveyed the scene escorted the marchesa to a chair and poured her and myself a large brandy louise was still kneeling on the ground trembling with fear and shock but her eyes puzzled me they were wide but not with the horror and fear of what had just happened the wound was not severe the knife had penetrated flesh but the damage was more dramatic than real marangoni swiftly bound it up with a napkin and sat her down with a brandy as well his pronouncement that she would live it was obvious but it is always good to have an expert opinion lightened the atmosphere considerably then he turned his attention to cort who had collapsed and was sitting on the floor by the wall hunched up his arms around his legs his head on his knees i felt at that moment total loathing for him he needs to be sedated he said and he needs to sleep then we can see what is to be done with him i assume no one wishes to involve the authorities there was a chorus agreeing that this would be a bad idea marangoni looked almost satisfied as though his predictions about cort had come spectacularly true but at least he knew what to do could propose some course of action he was suddenly a commanding presence and i realised for the first time why he was in a position of authority he was good at it he gave his orders cort would be taken to his hospital for the night drennan would accompany him there to make sure there were no further problems in the morning he would begin a proper examination and mrs cort someone must escort her home of course you must not you must stay with us my dear mrs cort longman said kindly or here i have more room the marchesa interrupted seemingly a little annoyed at longmans offer louise nodded thank you she whispered you are all very kind everybody was attempting to comfort her only marangoni said nothing but watched her carefully i could see his eyes flickering to me as well that annoyed me even at a moment like that all he could do was diagnose watch and interpret and your son he said eventually louise looked at him and hesitated for a moment he is at home with the nurse no harm will come to him she said and so it was arranged longman offered to come back if any further assistance was needed and took his leave i also made my excuses and retired to my rooms an hour later louise came to me i was waiting for her by the time she slipped away at dawn i had told her i would never leave her that i wanted her for ever that i loved her would protect her chapter i met signor ambrosian on his return the meeting was arranged swiftly and i waited on him at his bank close to the piazza san marco not at all like the palaces of london where rothschilds and barings hold court to europe and the world the banco di santo spirito quite a charming name i thought implying that all this usury was to serve god the better rather than to enrich a few families could not be compared to one of the great houses of london nonetheless it showed ambition in the way it had cleaned out a renaissance palace and refitted it in the dark wood and heavy veined marble that was the necessary indicator of solidity in every serious financial centre ambrosian matched his building venetians of all italians are the most difficult to read they do not show their emotions easily life is a serious business for them and many have a natural melancholy which makes social intercourse quite difficult ambrosian was very reserved perfectly polite but with no openness or welcome about him he was a handsome man immaculately dressed with a shock of silver grey hair which was matched by a grey necktie and a foreign touch large pearl cufflinks and a vase of silvery flowers on his desk he was a fine fellow a shrewd businessman more than ready to exploit the gullibility of others as was only proper for a man in his position i hoped very much that he would be quite merciless in his dealings with me a great deal depended on it i expressed my pleasure in meeting him and explained my current circumstances i have identified several possibilities for investment in venice and wish to consult you as to their practicality i said once the preliminaries were disposed of these were the usual sort of thing questions and answers so that he could determine whether i was someone to take seriously the name of joseph cardano served me well here he was known amongst financiers throughout much of europe even if only by name or reputation but not outside that circle the fact that i realised mentioning his name meant something was enough to make ambrosian accept i was a man of purpose he slowly became more attentive more careful in his speech he was too vain to think he was talking to an equal but intelligent enough to realise that some consideration was required that at present was exactly as i desired his triumph at exploiting me would be all the greater and thus less easy to resist for the next hour we discussed the possibility of building a grand hotel in venice i laid out my ideas he explained all the difficulties of finding the right land of getting the workforce the managers of raising the necessary capital at the appropriate price for such a venture who after all wanted to come to venice to each problem i proposed an answer build on the lido not in the centre of venice bring in all the architects engineers and surveyors from france and england if necessary make use of my skills i exaggerated a little here and cardanos contacts to form a company that could raise the money in london i had thought it all through my answers were considered and thorough and why do you need me then he asked with a smile because it couldnt be done without you i said entirely truthfully the money must flow into venice and payments must be made here it would need established banking facilities i have been here long enough to suspect that dealing with the authorities is a quagmire suitable land cannot be found without local knowledge and influence and i have discovered that you are the most highlyregarded man of finance in the region he acknowledged my discernment he was genuinely interested interested enough to start questioning what precisely there was of profit in this project for him that i pointed out rather depended on how much money his bank was prepared to put in this was going to be expensive and the profits would be several years down the road ah you english he said you do like to think on a grand scale do you not now we venetians would naturally think of several dozen small establishments each one to be erected when the previous one was paid off it is an interesting idea even more interesting is why you dont worry that i might go ahead without you you need me but do i need you build something on this scale without being able to raise capital in london find the skilled workforce scattered across europe persuade companies like cooks to run excursions to venice and stay in your hotel true enough if you can do all of these things i have learned that the english promise more than they deliver sometimes for example we have lent a substantial amount of money to an englishman he said who like you promised wonderful things but so far has delivered none of them i have met mr macintyre i said if that is who you refer to he is a scoundrel and a rogue really i find him to be very straightforward far from it we learned this was only after he took our money that the only reason he is in venice is because he would be thrown into gaol should he ever have the temerity to return to england you astound me and that was a genuine statement i found it momentarily difficult to believe we could be talking about the same person i would have wagered a very considerable amount of money that macintyre was entirely honest it seems that he embezzled a very substantial sum from his employers and absconded with it it is only the fact that he owes us money which stops us from sending him packing are you sure of this quite sure naturally once we learned of it we declined to advance him any more and i now have grave doubts whether we will ever see our money returned so you see a proposal from an unknown englishman i quite understand naturally any collaboration between us would require total trust but i am confident i would be able to satisfy your concerns with no difficulty and as it is a matter of patriotic pride i will willingly offer to provide assistance over the matter of mr macintyre how much does he owe you i believe about five hundred pounds sterling interesting i thought to myself i knew quite well he had put in considerably less than that this was very hopeful very imaginative i must say i continued few people would have been prepared to take such a risk he waved a hand if his machine works then it has obvious possibilities if it doesnt of course then that is different and the constant delays and excuses make me concerned consequently another proposal from another englishman does not fill your heart with gladness he smiled in that case i continued i will make a down payment to acquire your trust let me buy mr macintyres debt from you pay it off on his behalf should we come to a later agreement on this project for a hotel we will be able i am sure to adjust the matter then i cannot have you thinking that all the english are scoundrels even if some undoubtedly are if you wish i will reach an agreement now ambrosian was much too cautious a man to accept he looked almost shocked well not quite but he did have the air of someone who is being taken for a simpleton he did not object to me trying of course and he knew perfectly well that i knew he would not accept the offer i can see no reason to sell what may turn out to be a fine stream of future profits he said reproachfully particularly as my investment gives me complete rights to the machine well i cannot blame you i said with a smile to indicate i understood perfectly well none the less my interest remains should you change your mind i left feeling very thoughtful my offer to acquire macintyres debt had had the desired effect i thought ambrosian was prepared to take me seriously it would have been a different matter had he suddenly accepted the proposal the last thing i wanted was to spend money on a machine that might well be useless if that was the case he could keep it but if it did work he would keep it should the trials be a success he would certainly refuse to put in any more money call in the debt and take full possession of the patent macintyre would have nothing more to do with it except perhaps as an employee a declared bankrupt who would have to work for whatever pittance he was paid a pity the machine wasnt a complete disaster i thought that would not be good for macintyre but at least he would have the pleasure of realising that ambrosian had lost its money as well small compensation and i didnt think it would give him much joy only financiers think like that but it made me think though and as i walked across the piazza san marco i ran through all the possibilities in my mind i stopped and smiled happily at a group of urchins throwing stones at a washing line seeing if they could knock a sparrow off it that was it of course the only problem was how to organise it chapter anyone reading this might be surprised that i was not more concerned at ambrosians assertion that macintyre was some sort of crook often enough such characteristics are something of an impediment to good business but not always and not if the scoundrel is in no position to do you harm i had not the slightest intention of giving macintyre any money in a manner i could not control he could not abscond with what he did not have besides such people can be useful if they are working for you rather than against you the past life of xanthos for example is not something i would wish to know too much about although when he came knocking at my door i did discover that it would be unwise ever to send him anywhere controlled by the sultan as it would be a long time before he was let out of gaol but now his devious skills are employed to my advantage and he has been a good and loyal employee up until recently so ambrosians beliefs about macintyre did not worry me much but it would be wrong to say i was not intrigued and i was impatient that my dear friend cardano to whom i had written some time previously had not yet replied until he did there was very little i could do i could find old newspapers in venice some basic reference books but little more the sort of information i required could only be found in the dining rooms and board rooms of the city of london and then it would be available only to those who knew how to ask so i had to wait and become a proper tourist for once and indulge my evergrowing passion four more days in fact before the letter finally reached me wonderful days spent in the autumnal warmth and often enough with louise for the more rendezvous i had with her the more i wanted after the events at the marchesas salon we threw off all caution and discretion i began buying her presents we walked together in the city were seen together it made me proud and uncomfortable at the same time i once had to tell her to be more discreet with her husband i will leave him now because of you now i know what it is really to love someone i cannot stay any more we can be together for ever then she said turning to look me in the eyes we can be like this forever just you and me what about your son she made a gesture of disgust he can have him he is not my child i merely bore him there is nothing of me in him at all he will be like his father weak useless hes only four she had spoken with a harshness i had never heard in her before there was real cruelty in her words and they disturbed me i must have reacted for she instantly changed oh i love him of course i do but i am no good for him i dont understand him then she put her arms around me once more and changed the subject totally for an hour but i left our rooms with an uneasy feeling that afternoon it faded soon enough but did not disappear entirely it also changed the way we were together louise did not refer to leaving her husband again but more and more often the conversation came round to her desire to be with me i could understand why her life was hellish and why she so desperately sought a means of escaping when i considered the weals and cuts corts behaviour at the séance his hallucinations the indignities and humiliations she endured when no one was there to see it was hardly surprising she clung to me and i was besotted with her so why did i not leap at the chance to capture her forever it could have been done a separation of some sort from my wife was possible messy and unpleasant though it might be but louise and venice were linked too closely together love and city were intermingled i could not imagine one without the other and i think my hesitations and doubts were linked to my sluggish awareness of my growing immobility the marchesa was right venice was like an octopus which slowly and stealthily entangled the unwary in its tentacles until it was too late longman would never leave cort might not either in other englishmen i met in that period i learned to recognise the slightly vacant look of the entranced the people hypnotised by the light who had lost their willpower voluntarily given it up like the followers of odysseus on the island of the lotuseaters they did not enter a state of bliss by so doing venice does not offer happiness in exchange for servitude the opposite rather melancholy and sadness are its gifts it allows the sufferers to be all too aware of their lassitude and inability to leave it taunts them with their weakness but still will not let them go some were immune drennan seemed unaffected for example nor did it have any effect on macintyre because he scarcely knew where he was for him venice was merely the place where his workshop was he had sacrificed his will to his machinery already there was nothing for the city to take and some were driven into madness cort deteriorated rapidly after his explosion at the séance i saw little enough of him indeed i tried to avoid him but could not but notice how he looked more haggard by the day heard reports that he was receiving visitations from his phantom more often he worked obsessively but got nothing done until then he had actually been making progress macintyres internal buttressing was all but complete but now most of his workforce abandoned him as his behaviour became so erratic they did not want to come near him so he worked alone furiously making drawings that no one would execute ordering materials that lay in the courtyard untouched until he sent them back and began an argument with the supplier is cort insane i asked marangoni i fully anticipated his reply and was astonished by what he in fact said well do you know the doctor replied in his heavy accent putting the tips of his fingers together to look more professional i do not think he is unbalanced certainly but i do not think he is insane his mothers name was annabelle he said in total breach of the normal notions of discretion she died when he was born and he worships her memory the idea that she was displeased with him shook him to the core he told me this a couple of days ago youre still seeing him oh yes it is vital considering his state of mind he was in the hospital for the better part of a week and i thought it a good idea to get him to come for a regular chat he finds it peaceful just to sit in the sun looking at the lagoon undisturbed he goes away calm and contented normally sometimes we find him a bed here we have a guest house you know a strange arrangement but the monks were very hospitable and for some reason we keep up the tradition have you worked out what happened at the séance do you think the marchesa did it deliberately im sure she is entirely genuine in her beliefs he said with an indulgent smile at the foolishness of women unaccustomed to the rigours of the scientific method the trouble is she is in many ways a very stupid woman she will hear something then forget it entirely she has a very poor memory but it remains in her mind and when it pops up again she believes it is a spirit which has told her im sure she was told that corts mothers name was annabelle but forgot it then it came back to her you seem to think he will recover marangoni shrugged that depends on what you mean by recovery of course if all matters which might disturb him were removed i dare say he would soldier on the trouble is that this is unlikely he should return to england immediately if he stays here then perhaps not but is he safe his behaviour is the behaviour of a madman i grant you that but does that mean he is insane i have already told you how many people women especially are mad while showing none of the symptoms of madness so we must equally consider the possibility that someone who behaves as though he were mad might in fact not be he smiled i stared quite uncomprehendingly at him perhaps his behaviour is a perfectly reasonable response to his current situation marangoni suggested quietly i knew exactly what he meant he stabbed his wife with a knife are you telling me she deserved it oh no i very much doubt anyone deserves to be stabbed he may at that particular moment have considered she deserved it that by striking at her he was warding off the torments he was experiencing of course this was heightened by the drugs what oh you people he said with exasperation you really notice nothing do you did you not see the glassy eyes the sweating the slurred expressions the way his movements became more uncontrolled and exaggerated i thought hed been drinking he drank nothing but water opium my dear stone classic symptoms cort is an opium addict dear me no but he had undoubtedly consumed some of the drug shortly before he arrived it is easy enough to come by you can buy it in most pharmacies he told you this no he denied it absolutely nevertheless he was certainly under its influence so hes lying perhaps he is ashamed perhaps he was unaware of it marangoni said absently not that it matters he will get no more of it while he is in my care what do you think of marangoni i asked when i next saw louise ugh disgusting was her reply do you know he tried to seduce me that dirty little man i was so ashamed i have never told a soul but you i can tell i know you will not hold it against me just dont listen to anything he says about me im sure it would be nasty and cruel of course not i said why should i when i seduced you myself but with you i wanted to be seduced she said i would sacrifice anything for you i even accept she said her voice trembling that you will sacrifice nothing for me but you know it doesnt matter she said with a sigh looking away from me i will be your mistress and one day you will leave me it is enough dont say that but its true you know it is and when you do leave me i will kill myself she said it seriously and looked steadily at me as she spoke why would i want to live without you to spend the rest of my life with a disgusting husband and a snivelling child to be tormented day and night by them if only i could be free of them all i have that is worthwhile is you that cannot be true oh believe that then she said turning away believe that then you will be able to leave me with a clear conscience i do not wish you to suffer as well you do not love me i know not really but i do then prove it she did not say these words she did not need to chapter two days after this encounter cardanos letter his first letter i should say arrived and the last piece of my plan took place his news explained much after the normal sort of chatter about the markets he got onto the subject of mr macintyre here his information was surprising i had asked whether anything was known about macintyres reputation this was not the sort of thing that a man like cardano would know but it was easy enough to discover i thought i would hear merely that macintyre was a decent competent wellrespected engineer of skill until my interview with ambrosian i had expected nothing more cardanos letter was very much more informative than that however fortunately the annual meeting of lairds took place yesterday afternoon and i went to it i have some shares in the company so do you if you recall normally these meetings are worse than useless but it is good to show ones face occasionally i asked mr joseph benson the general manager about your mr macintyre and got a most surprising response he looked rather shocked and disturbed that i should mention the name why was i asking what had i heard he was very worried indeed i found this perplexing of course and kept at him until he was sufficiently reassured to tell me the entire tale one which you had best keep to yourself macintyre was extraordinarily able and remarkably pigheaded it seems he would never listen to advice constantly having disputes with anyone who disagreed with him and was all in all well nigh impossible to work with it seems he was always coming up with novel ideas and would work on them in the companys time using the material and resources which should have been used for something else that is beside the point which is that he was a man who could turn his hand to any engineering problem if there was anything which defeated all others macintyre would be called in and would find the solution he was in other words both impossible and indispensable at the same time i do not know if you remember the alabama it was a lairds ship which ended up in confederate hands as it caused a great deal of damage to northern shipping the yankees were extremely angry about it and are still trying to blame lairds and the british government lairds maintain it was nothing to do with them they sold the ship in good faith and could hardly have guessed it was going to be fitted out with weapons by the owners then sold to the confederates except that the man who fitted the ship out was your mr macintyre who was until he vanished from the face of the earth living proof of lairds complicity or should i say duplicity it doesnt matter in order to avoid recriminations he was given a large amount of money and told to make himself scarce when asked lairds now say officially that he disappeared a few years ago and stole money before he left they are as angry at him as anyone else and in public demand his arrest and return i found all this fascinating and at least it explained how the story of dishonesty had come to hang over macintyres reputation the story of the alabama is little known now but it had a certain currency in its day a woodenhulled ton barque commissioned by the confederacy in the unionists heard of the purchase and tried to stop it lairds was caught between its customer and the wishes however reluctant of the british government to maintain a strict neutrality in the terrible civil war strict but in my opinion foolish for the refusal of britain to allow its industry to supply both sides led to the americans supplying themselves and thus building up the industries which now challenge our own a more enlightened policy would have supplied both evenhandedly thus draining the united states of gold and shackling their industry with a little wisdom and ruthlessness britain could readily have reestablished its predominant interest on that continent and been ready to congratulate whichever side emerged victorious but the moralists triumphed and from that triumph will come eventually the eclipse of britains industrial might be that as it may lairds which was in need of commissions found a way around the problem by using some other company as a gobetween how could we prevent our client reequipping the vessel and selling it on they asked when the matter was raised in parliament we build ships we do not oversee their use as well a clever move but one which the victorious unionists would not accept they began to pursue britain for liability for losses caused by the ship and only settled the matter sometime after i returned to england from venice the government and the insurance companies eventually paid out some four million pounds for by the time she was caught off france in the alabama had sunk a fearsome amount of unionist shipping but in the americans a people prone to extravagance in both speech and action were insisting that anything less than two thousand million pounds compensation would be an insult to their national pride and threatening all manner of reprisals if they didnt get it i was thrust into macintyres company once more a few days after i received this interesting sideline on his past life when he invited me to come along for the first real test of his torpedo i was highly honoured no other english person was even told this great moment in his life was taking place but i had suggested that he try it out secretly first of all rather than with the bankers there what if you try it and there is some small hitch that could ruin everything i suggested best to have a test run away from prying eyes if all goes well then you can repeat the experiment in front of the bankers it was good advice and he realised it the date was set and i was rather shyly invited i was touched by the gesture so one cold morning a few days later i found myself on a wooden barge wrapped up warmly against the mist which hung over the lagoon like a depressing shroud we were far away from land to the north of the city with a couple of his workmen for company the barge owner had been told he was not wanted and the previous evening the torpedo had been loaded in secret onto the deck and covered with tarpaulins it was a sailing barge and there was a flurry of anxiety that there wasnt going to be enough wind but eventually at halfpast four in the morning the bargee declared that we could go and we set off very slowly indeed the boat creeping along at such a pace that an hour later we were still just off the salute by six we were in the dead waters north of murano where the lagoon was shallow and few boats only those with the most shallow of draughts ever ventured it was a magical experience in a way to sit in the prow of the vessel smoking a cigar as the sun rose and wild ducks flew low over the marshes seeing torcello in the distance with its great ruined tower and far away the occasional sail red or yellow of one of the sailing ships that endlessly crisscrossed the lagoon macintyre was not the best company continually fussing over his invention unscrewing panels and peering inside with an old oil lamp held over him by bartoli so he could see what he was doing adding a little oil here tightening a bolt there tapping an instrument and grumbling under his breath nearly ready i asked when i had seen enough of birds and got up to walk back to the middle of the ship he grunted i will take that to mean no it needs to be stripped down and rebuilt entirely i said macintyre the damned thing is either going to work or not bung it in the water and see what happens macintyre glowered at me but its true i protested ive been watching you you arent doing anything important youre not making any real changes its as ready as it will ever be bartoli nodded behind him and lifted his eyes to heaven in despair then macintyre sagged as he accepted that finally he could do no more that it was time to risk his machine in the water more than that to risk his life for everything that made him what he was he had embedded into the metalwork of his torpedo if it failed he failed how does it move anyway i asked i see no funnel or anything there was nothing quite like a stupid remark to rouse him immediately he straightened up and stared at me with withering contempt funnel he snarled funnel you think ive put a boiler and a stack of coal in it or maybe you think i should have put a mast and a sail on as well i was only asking i said it has a propeller what makes it turn air he replied compressed air theres a reservoir with air at three hundred and seventy pounds per square inch pressure just here he tapped the middle of the torpedo there are two eccentric cylinders with a sliding vane to divide the volume into two parts in this fashion the air pressure causes direct rotation of the outer cylinder this is coupled directly to the propeller you see that way it can travel underwater and can be ready for launch at all times at a moments notice if it works i added of course it will work he said scornfully ive had it running dozens of times in the workshop it will work without fail so show me i said chuck it over the side and show me macintyre straightened up very well watch this he summoned bartoli and the others and they began to put ropes round the body of the torpedo which was then rolled carefully to the side of the boat and lowered gently into the water the ropes were then removed and the torpedo floated threequarters submerged occasionally bumping softly against the side of the boat only a single very thin piece of rope held it close by attached to a small pin at the rear that it seemed was the firing mechanism macintyre began rubbing his chin with anxiety no he said its not right i think id better take it out and check it over again just to make sure bartoli began to shake his head in frustration signor macintyre there is nothing left to check everything is just fine no just to be on the safe side it will only take an hour or then i decided to intervene if i may be of assistance i said macintyre turned to look at me i grabbed the thin piece of rope in his hand and gave a sharp tug what the hell do you think youre doing he screamed in shock but it was too late with a quiet ping the pin popped out of the torpedo which immediately gave off a whirring gurgling noise as the propeller began to spin at high speed whoops i said sorry oh look off it goes true enough the torpedo accelerated at an impressive speed in a straight line at a slight angle to the boat damned interfering fool macintyre muttered as he pulled out his watch and started staring at the torpedo as it grew smaller and smaller in the water my god it works it really works look at it go it was true macintyre told me later he spent much of the trip home poring over a piece of paper working out his calculations that his torpedo accelerated to a speed of about seven knots within a minute that it travelled with only a per cent deviation from a perfectly straight line and that it was capable of going at least fourteen hundred yards before running out of power at least yes i had been a little hasty in my desire to force macintyre to get on with the business of testing i should have made sure there was nothing in the way first of all oh my god bartoli said as he looked out appalled the torpedo still clearly visible was now at maximum speed all five hundred pounds of it travelling a few inches underwater heading straight for a felucca one of the little vessels used often enough for fishing or transporting food around the lagoon the crew could be seen quite clearly sitting in the stern by the rudder or leaning on the side admiring the view as the sail billowed in the light wind a peaceful scene one that painters travelled many hundreds of miles to capture on canvas to sell to romantically inclined northerners desperate for a bit of venice on their walls look out macintyre screamed in horror and we all joined in jumping up and down and waving the sailors on the felucca looked up grinned and waved back crazy foreigners still a pleasant morning why not be friendly how much gunpowder is in that thing i asked as i jumped up and down none i put fiftyfour pounds of clay in the head instead and it wont use gunpowder it will use guncotton yes you told me well remember it anyway i cant afford to waste it hats lucky the felucca kept going the torpedo as well it was going to be a closerun thing another quarter of a knot and the boat would pass over the torpedos course entirely and it would miss all would be well if only the boat would go faster or the torpedo would slow down neither obliged it could have been worse so i assured macintyre later had the torpedo hit amidships then something of that weight and that speed would undoubtedly have stove a hole right through the thin planking and it would have been hard to pretend that a fourteenfoot steel tube wedged in their boat was nothing to do with us but we were lucky the boat was almost out of the torpedos path almost but not quite macintyres invention clipped the end of it even at a distance of four hundred yards we heard the cracking breaking sound as the rudder gave way and the boat lurched under the impact the sails lost the wind and began flapping wildly and the crew a moment ago waving cheerfully and idling their time away launched into stunned action trying to bring their vessel back under control and work out what on earth had happened the torpedo meanwhile went silently on its way and it was clear no one on the felucca had seen it bartoli was brilliant i must say naturally we steered towards the stricken boat and he had a quick word with the crew never seen anything like that before bartoli called in venetian amazing what was it what happened a shark he replied sagely really big one travelling fast i saw it clearly it must have clipped the end of your boat bitten the rudder off never seen a beast like that in the lagoon before the crew was delighted this was much better than rotten wood or some ordinary accident they would dine out on this for weeks bartoli after expressing surprise that they hadnt noticed the fin sticking out of the water offered assistance which made macintyre fretful he wanted to go and get his torpedo back he had no real idea what its range was and it could be anywhere by now it was his most treasured possession and he did not want it to fall into the hands of some spy or rival for he was convinced that all the governments and companies of the world were desperately trying to steal his secrets he need not have worried bartoli was too skilled for that he knew quite well that no venetian sailor would submit to being towed ignominiously into harbour by a bunch of foreigners they were duly grateful but turned the offer down then they rigged up a makeshift rudder from an oar poking over the back rather as on a gondola and after half an hour of enjoyable conversation they set off again we all and macintyre in particular breathed a sigh of relief when the felucca disappeared into the early morning mist then we turned to the business of recovering his invention i thought that the time had come to apologise i think i had better find some way of compensating those sailors as well i ended i imagine repairing that rudder will cost something but no apologies were really necessary macintyre was transformed from the anxietyridden fusspot of an hour or so ago he was like a man who had just been told he had inherited a fortune he positively beamed at me his eyes sparkling with excitement did you see it he exclaimed did you see it straight as an arrow it works stone it works exactly as i said if thered only been some explosives in the nose i could have blown that boat to kingdom come i could have sunk a battleship it would have been difficult to blame that on a shark i pointed out but macintyre waved my objections aside and ran up to the prow of the boat with a pair of field glasses we searched for about an hour for although macintyre was convinced it had gone as straight as an arrow in fact it had a tendency to veer to the left a little not by much but over several hundred yards this made quite a difference also it had settled low in the water only just visible on the surface and that also made the search more difficult but we tracked it down eventually embedded in a mudbank in water too shallow for us to approach in the boat now what do we do i asked as we gazed at it some twenty yards away from us off our starboard bow not daring to go any closer lest our boat also got wedged in the mud we spent half an hour throwing a hook tied to a rope towards it hoping to hook the thing and then drag it towards us but with no luck whatsoever there was no point waiting for the tide to change as there was none can anyone swim i asked a general shaking of heads which i found extraordinary it didnt surprise me that macintyre couldnt but i was amazed that none of his employees brought up surrounded by water as they were could either i wondered how many venetians drowned every year if this was normal amongst them why well i said now suddenly reluctant i thought just an idea you know that one of us could try to swim over to it the water might be deep enough if you got stuck in the mud youd never get out again bartoli said i didnt like that you good point i said but macintyre thought my untimely death would be a worthwhile price to pay take two ropes he said one for the torpedo and another for you then we could pull both out you can swim cant you me i said wondering whether my father would have considered lying justifiable in these particular circumstances on the whole he disapproved strongly of the practice well a little excellent macintyre said his worries all over and i am deeply grateful to you my dear sir deeply grateful although as its your fault that the torpedo is there in the first place point taken very reluctantly i began to take off my clothes and peered over the side i would have to let myself into the water very slowly for fear of sinking down and becoming embedded in mud before i even started it was cold and the water looked even colder bartoli tied two ropes around my waist and grinned at me dont worry he said we will not leave you there and then i lowered myself gently into the water it was even colder than i had feared and i began shivering immediately but nothing to be done now using a gentle breast stroke i set off for the torpedo trying to keep my legs as high in the water as possible the only danger came when i got close to the torpedo and had to stop then the water was only about three feet deep and my feet had slid across the mud several times as i manoeuvred into position i had to push down and i felt them slip into the mud properly when i tried to hang onto the torpedo and drag them out i realised they were stuck hard i cant move i shouted to the boat tie the rope on to the torpedo stop pushing it further into the mud macintyre shouted back what about me well pull you out afterwards well thank you i thought bitterly still he was right that was what i was there for i was so cold now that i could barely untie the knot let alone push the rope through the propeller casing and tie it securely my teeth were chattering uncontrollably by the time i was finally done excellent macintyre shouted pull away it took some effort by the people on the boat but eventually the torpedo began to move and once the suction was broken it slipped rapidly past me and into deeper water macintyre was all but dancing up and down in joy now get me out of here i shouted oh very well came the reply and i felt the rope tighten around my chest as they began to tug nothing happened i moved a few inches but the moment the pressure was relaxed i sank back down even deeper than before i was now getting frightened dont stop i shouted im going lower get me out of here nothing happened i glanced round and saw macintyre staring at me and stroking his chin then he talked to bartoli for a fraction of a second i was convinced he was going to abandon me there but no although what he planned was nearly worse as he explained afterwards the suction from the mud was too strong for them all they were doing was pulling the boat itself into danger they needed more power i saw bartoli pulling up the sails and macintyre pulling up the anchor and one of his men manning the oar to turn the ship i realised with horror what they had in mind they were setting sail and were going to use the full power of the boat and the wind to try and dislodge me youll pull me apart i yelled dont do that but macintyre just waved cheerfully the boat began to move and i felt the rope tighten once more until it was as taut as a bowstring and the pressure on my chest the rubbing of the rough cord unbearably painful it was all i could do not to scream i certainly remember thinking that if i was still in one piece at the end of this experiment i would thump macintyre on the nose it got more and more painful i could feel my body stretching as the mud refused to let me go and that seemed to go on forever then with the most disgusting slurping sound it gave me up my legs and feet were belched out of the mud in a huge cloud of foulsmelling water and i floated free trailing behind the boat as it headed towards venice it took another five minutes to haul me in and by then i could not move i was shivering so badly i couldnt control my arms or legs my chest had the beginnings of a bright red weal across it my spine felt as though it was several inches longer than it had been and my legs still smelled unspeakably foul and macintyre paid me not the slightest bit of attention instead he was busily clucking over his lump of iron while bartoli wrapped me in a blanket and brought me some grappa i drank it from the bottle then rolled over in the blanket until i began to recover its fine macintyre said as though certain that his torpedo would be uppermost in my mind no damage at all although the cowling bent from the way you attached the rope to it i ignored him he didnt notice but no matter that can be hammered out apart from that it is in perfect condition all i have to do now is clean it dry it and make a few minor adjustments and it will be ready for the big test next week may i say that i would not have cared had the damnable thing sunk to the bottom of the lagoon never to be seen again macintyre looked at me in astonishment but my dear stone he cried just look at you i am so sorry i havent thanked you enough what you did just now was generous generous and a mark of true kindness thank you from the bottom of my heart i was somewhat mollified by this but only somewhat i kept on drinking the grappa and slowly felt some warmth creep back into my body everyone made a fuss over me said how wonderful i had been that helped if one is to behave selflessly and courageously it is pleasing to have it recognised i wrapped myself in blankets and encomiums all the way home and lay there dreaming of louise by my side i even felt almost content by the time the boat finally docked just by the workshop three hours later but i did not help unload the torpedo i had had enough i left them to it macintyre shouting everyone else working and walked back to my lodgings there i demanded a bath with limitless hot water immediately and would not take no for an answer i had to wait another hour before it was prepared by which time everyone in the house had been told that the idiot englishman had fallen into the lagoon well what do you expect from foreigners chapter the next morning a note was delivered to my room from marangoni of all people i stand corrected he wrote and i could almost see the smile on his face as i read it seems that mr corts venetian really does exist come and meet him if you wish he is a fascinating creature i had as leisurely a breakfast as venetian habits allow and decided that as i had nothing better to do that morning i would take up the invitation and go to san servolo the island lies between san marco and the lido a handsomeenough place from a distance you would never know that it was an asylum for the insane certainly it is very unlike the grim prisons which england was then throwing up all over the country to incarcerate the lunatics which all societies produce in abundance marangoni hated the place and would have preferred a modern scientific establishment but i think his real objection stemmed from his determination to detach his profession from any taint of religiosity otherwise the old benedictine monastery would have been a beautiful place to spend his time apart from the inmates there is something about madness which casts a pall on the loveliest of buildings the clouds always seem to hover above such places no matter how brightly the sun shines and of course no one spends much money on lunatics they get the leftovers after the more astute and agile have taken what they want san servolo was in a pitiable state crumbling overgrown and depressing the sort of place you wish to get away from the sort of place that might easily send even a perfectly healthy person insane marangoni had colonised the best part for himself the abbots lodgings were now his office with remarkable painted ceilings and large windows that opened onto the lagoon it was a room that could make you see the virtues of a contemplative life though not those of a custodian of the insane marangoni was a thief in someones elses property and looked it he would never exude the necessary style to seem as though he belonged there he was a bureaucrat in a dark suit the room hated him and he hated it back pleasant enough now but you should be here in january he said when i admired the frescoes the cold gets into your bones damp no amount of fires make any difference at all i have learned to write with gloves on when november comes i start dreaming of applying for jobs in sicily but then you would fry in summer true enough and there is work that needs to be done here tell me about this man he smiled he was arrested by the police a few days ago and was passed on to me yesterday what had he done nothing really but he was stopped for questioning and asked for his name he was then arrested for insulting a policeman by making frivolous remarks what sort he insisted and keeps on insisting that his name is gian giacamo casanova i snorted marangoni looked serious as he read from his police report he was born so he says in venice in which makes him now what one hundred and fortytwo years old a good age i must say he is in a very good state considering personally i would have guessed him to be no more than seventy possibly nearer sixty i see and you told him that you did not believe this certainly not that is not a very sensible procedure if you do that then the patient insists and you get into a childish game am arent am arent ten times am a hundred times arent you know the sort of thing besides the trick is to win their confidence and that cant be done if they feel you do not believe them what you have to do is institute a healthy regime proper food cold showers exercise and make them feel regulated and safe and while that is going on you listen to them and pick out holes and contradictions in their stories eventually you present those to them and ask them to explain with luck that breaks down their belief with luck how often does it work sometimes but it can only be effective with those who are rationally insane raving lunatics or those subject to catatonia require other methods and signor casanova perfectly coherent in fact it will be a pleasure to treat him i am looking forward to it he is an excellent storyteller highly entertaining and so far i have not spotted a single flaw in what he has said he has given us no clues at all about who he really is apart from telling you his age and name apart from that but if you grant that then everything else so far follows perfectly logically have you asked him about cort he shook his head not yet you may do so if you wish if you want to meet him have you asked cort about him no he is too delicate at the moment but clearly he will benefit from knowing that his hallucinations are nothing of the sort this man is not dangerous not in the slightest a charming old fellow and he couldnt hurt you even if he wanted to he is quite frail does he speak anything but venetian oh yes casanova was quite a linguist and still is if i may put it like that he speaks perfect italian good french and english then i will meet him i dont know why i want to but it will be a curious experience i will take you to him myself but please do not say anything to suggest you do not believe him that is most important he led me out into the courtyard and past a group of buildings that contained the inmates this is for the nonviolent ones he said as we strolled in the warmth the more difficult characters we keep in the block you can see over there alas they get much less generous treatment we dont have the money to do much for hopeless cases theres no point either we can merely stop them harming themselves and others in here it was quite a pleasant surprise i had imagined something like a piranesi print or hogarth at his most despondent but the room was light and airy simply furnished and comfortable only the shadow of a large cross on the wall where a crucifix had once hung hinted at the buildings previous purpose there was one solitary person in it signor casanova there was no other name to give him and in fact marangoni never did find out who he was was sitting in a corner by a large window that looked out towards the lido he was reading a book his head bowed but was undoubtedly the man i had seen singing on the canal on my first night in venice only the clothes were different the hospital had taken away his oldfashioned costume and clothed him in its drab colourless uniform it diminished him that garb made him seem less of a person certainly less disconcerting signor casanova marangoni called a visitor for you please be seated sir he said as though about to offer me a drink in his salon as you see i am well able to pass some time with you im glad of that i replied as courteously as he already i had entered a sort of dream world only later did it seem strange that i talked with such respect to a man who was insane penniless without even a name of his own he set the tone of the conversation i followed him he waited for me to begin smiling benignly at me as i sat down opposite him and how are you i asked very well considering my circumstances he replied i do not like being locked up but it is hardly the first time i was locked in the doges dungeons once and i escaped from there i have no doubt i will leave here soon enough as well really and this was in he said i was accused of occult knowledge and of spying a strange combination i thought but then authorities have never liked things to be hidden from them the only good knowledge is that which they not other people possess he smiled sweetly at me and were you guilty oh good heavens yes of course i had many contacts with foreigners some of them in the highest positions and my explorations into the world of the occult were well advanced even then it is why i am here now i beg your pardon i am over one hundred and forty years old and as you see still in remarkably good health i only wish that i had finished my studies earlier then i might have presented myself as a younger man but still all creatures prefer some sort of life to none at all nobody wishes to die do you a strange remark half statement half query why do you ask that because you will but you are still too young to realise it one day you will wake up and you will know then the rest of your life will be merely preparing for that moment and you will spend your time trying to rectify your mistakes the mistakes you are making now what mistakes are those he smiled elliptically the mistakes that will kill you of course i do not need to tell you what those are you know them well enough yourself im quite sure i do not he shrugged uninterested why do you follow mr cort who is mr cort he asked puzzled you know very well i think the young english architect the palazzo oh him i do not follow him he summons me and is a very great nuisance i must say i do have better things to do than dance attendance on him that is ridiculous i said a little angrily of course he doesnt summon you but he does casanova replied calmly he really does he is a man with many conflicts he wishes to know about this city and impose himself on it he wishes to be here and away he loves a woman who is cruel and heartless and who dreams of his ruin all these things call me to him as they called his mother to me when she lay on her deathbed i know about love and cruelty you see in all their forms and i am venice he wants to know me and his desire summons me to him i could scarcely restrain myself from reacting to this nonsense which he spoke so calmly casanova you see i call him that sighed a little i know about women you know he said their natures i can peer into their souls see what lies beneath the professions of love the lies the demure sweetness no other man in history has studied them as i have i can see her thoughts she thinks of hunting or being hunted there is no kindness in her and she sees only herself never others be quiet i ordered i order you to keep silent you are mad it is of no moment to me whether you believe me or not you know he said you will find out for yourself soon enough i did not ask you to come here my explorations into the occult caused me to drink in the soul of venice to become the city her spirit has extended my life as long as venice exists so shall i wandering her streets remembering her glory we will die together she and i and i see everything that happens here even in small rooms rented for a month or in a copse on the lido you are not wandering the streets now i said with some savage satisfaction deeply disturbed and shocked by what he was saying no for the time being i rest and why should i wish to escape he smiled and looked around him with amusement flickering on his face the good doctor it seems is fully wedded to the best notions of gentleness for his poor inmates i am fed well and have to do little in return for my board and lodging save allow myself to be measured and photographed and to answer questions about my life which i have not yet decided how to do what does that mean they are most interesting questions he continued by way of explanation they are trying to discover contradictions impossibilities in what i say it is excellent fun for they go off to read my memoirs then come back to quiz me about them but i wrote them of course i know the answers better than they do every truth and every little fib i put in the question is do i tell the truth or do i give them what they want they so greatly desire to prove i am insane and not who i am that i am dreadfully sorry to disappoint them perhaps i should drop a few hints and contradictions into my conversation so they can conclude i am someone else entirely it would make them so happy and grateful and i have always desired to please what do you think i think you should tell the truth at all times pish sir you are a bore i suppose you say your prayers every night and ask god to make you virtuous and you are a hypocrite you lie all the time except you do not even realise you are doing it goodness this is a dull time to be living he leaned forward so that his face was close to mine what are you in your dreams when no one is there what do you do in this city which you have persuaded yourself is just a dream how many people are you lying to now i glared at him and he chuckled you forget my friend that i am in your dreams as well i dont know what you mean i said stiffly i found that i could not answer him properly standing by a window you dont understand it why didnt you turn and ask me i could have answered you know i was there you know i was i could have told you everything how do you know about that i told you i see everything that was just a dream he shook his head there are no such things as dreams do you want to know more ask if you wish i can save you but you must ask otherwise you will cause terrible hurt to others no i said abruptly enough for my fear to shine through all too obviously he nodded his head and smiled gently you may change your mind he replied softly and thanks to the good doctor you will know where to find me for the time being but you must hurry i will not be here for long i rose and left without another word he meanwhile sat on his little chair and picked up a book when i closed the door i leaned with my back against it and closed my eyes not in a talking mood or did you think better of it it was marangoni standing exactly where i had left him what no we talked for a long time but you have only been in there a minute or two i stared at him he pointed at the clock it was two minutes past three i had been in that room for slightly more than a minute chapter that evening i had my first proper conversation with arnsley drennan i had talked to him before of course but never alone and he never said very much he was a strange man he seemed to need no one but would frequently dine with us perhaps even his selfsufficiency needed a rest on occasion he was the obvious choice for me at that moment i needed quite badly to talk to someone normal rational and calm who could point out that my afternoon with signor casanova had been all complete nonsense drennan who gave off an air of solid good sense could be relied on not to gossip about it afterwards i hadnt planned a conversation with him it came about by chance as he and i were the only two people to show up for dinner that night longman had one of his rare reports to write as consul cort fortunately hardly ever came nowadays macintyre and marangoni were also absent we ate our fish macintyre was correct there it always was fish and i was starting to get a little tired of it more or less in silence then he suggested a coffee down the road in more salubrious surroundings have you seen cort recently i asked i havent seen him for some time i ran into him yesterday poor man hes in a bad way he really should go back to england it would be quite easy for him to do so but i am afraid he is quite obsessed now he sees it as a matter of honour to finish this job of his then bit by bit as we drank more brandy i told him about signor casanova he was interested or at least i think he was drennan was one of those men whose expression never changed very much but he listened quietly and attentively i cant say i know much about madness he said i have come across men driven mad by fear or by horror but that is a different sort of insanity how so modern warfare he said as you may have guessed already i was a soldier i saw many things i did not wish to see and which will be hard to forget you fought for the confederates yes and we lost he shrugged to dismiss the subject from his mind so you are an exile a strange place to choose if i may say so he glanced at me then smiled slightly so it would be if that was why i was here well he continued maybe i should tell you why not it is all history now have you heard of the alabama i looked at him the warship of course ive heard of it does this have anything to do with macintyre it was his turn to look surprised how do you know that i made enquiries im impressed truly i am what else do you know about mr macintyre that he is not wanted back in england at the moment he stared at me in astonishment the first time i had ever seen any sort of strong emotion pass on his face i felt quite pleased with myself and who else knows of this in venice you mean no one signor ambrosian of the banca di santo spirito seems to think he is here because he stole a lot of money why do you ask because it is my job to protect him from whom yankee lawyers mainly he is the living proof of lairds culpability great britain maintains that the conversion of the alabama was entirely out of its control everyone knows this is a fiction but it will hold as long as there is no proof macintyre is that proof and there are many people who would dearly like a conversation with him and i suspect would pay high for the opportunity he was paid off and told to lie low until the matter was settled and i was hired to make sure that he does which is why i am here who hired you well that i cannot say your government lairds lloyds of london should this lawsuit go badly it would cost a great deal in money and reputation so as i was out of a job at the time what do you mean he shrugged i have no country and do not wish to live amongst my conquerors and i am or was a soldier what should i do herd cows in texas for the rest of my life no when all was lost i came to england to seek work this is what i found it is not the best of jobs but it will do for the moment i see you are a most interesting man mr drennan no but i have had an interesting life if you can call it that and macintyre cannot go back to england not until this is settled i wanted him to go to greece change his name but this is as far as he would travel you can be assured that i and my friend in london will be absolutely discreet on the subject thank you and he doesnt want to leave venice not yet and if he decides to go back to england then it will be my job to stop him how drennan shrugged i will worry about that when it happens at the moment he seems perfectly happy here which is a pleasant change from the corts a disturbed man i observed yes but if i was married to a woman like that so would i be i beg your pardon it was offensive gratuitously so but i looked at him and he stared evenly back he knew exactly what he was saying was saying it deliberately i went on a boat ride with her she invited me we went to the lido although i wanted to tour the inner lagoon i found her behaviour unfortunate did you i did and now it is time for me to leave as you know i have a halfhour walk back to my lodging good evening to you when i left him i walked over to macintyres workshop i could have got there much faster had i hurried but i had much to think about drennan had very carefully given me a warning from someone like longman or marangoni i would have dismissed it out of hand as the remarks of a vulgarian but drennan i took seriously he was not a man to gossip or to invent stories what he said could not possibly be true i was sure of that but i wondered what his reasoning was there was no obvious answer but there were other questions now welling up in my mind as well i found bartoli alone in the workshed and greeted him we talked for a while and i expressed an entirely false disappointment that macintyre wasnt there hes gone to feed his daughter bartoli said speaking english in a thick accent you speak well i replied when did you learn here and there he said i lived in england for a while and then met mr macintyre in toulon i learned much from him it is unusual isnt it to travel like that why did you do it he shrugged i wanted to learn he said and there is not much chance of that here you are venetian no he said scornfully i come from padua i hate it here why is that they are lazy all they want to do is live and die he spoke in short sharp sentences he said what he wanted to then stopped there was no ornament about his words which was refreshing although slightly disconcerting is this second test going to work as well as the first i asked abruptly of course why do you ask because mr macintyre has asked me to look at his books the money and they are in a bad state i am worried for him he nodded i also he said very worried he is a good man a fine engineer but he is not very sensible you know what i mean i do and he is in a very dangerous position you too i suppose as your job depends on this he shrugged there are other jobs but i want mr macintyre to be successful he would die of disappointment it will be a success it will work as well at the next test as it did at the first i am sure of it thats unfortunate i said quietly bartoli looked at me why do you say that i took a deep breath i will tell you i said but you must give me your word you will say nothing to anyone else i do good then listen carefully mr macintyre has borrowed money foolishly if this machine of his fails next week then he will get no more he will be bankrupt he will not be able to continue his work here you understand i know this but it will be even worse if it succeeds he sold the patent for the machine as part of the loan agreement i dont know if he was aware of what he was doing but that is the truth he is busy trying to build something which no longer belongs to him if the machine works he will not see a penny of profit do you understand bartoli nodded slowly if the machine fails it will be unfortunate if it succeeds it will be a disaster bartoli shook his head ah mr stone what foolishness this is we must help him poor man he is too innocent for such people i agree unfortunately he is also too straightforward to get out of this mess he would never stoop to anything underhand or deceitful however justified it may be bartoli looked quizzically at me what do you mean the situation can be retrieved i said quietly how i am prepared to pay off his loans and buy the patent but if the test succeeds there is not a chance they will wish to sell mr macintyres only hope is that it fail then i can approach the creditors and safeguard his invention but i repeat only if the test fails and i imagine mr macintyre is determined it should succeed he is a proud and foolish man bartoli nodded evidently thinking hard are you sure of all this i nodded the question is how to save him thats simple i said bluntly how the torpedo must fail the test bartoli looked at me in total silence i am going to visit the bankers tomorrow about another matter i will repeat my offer to buy his debts but make it seem that i know nothing of the test they will refuse to sell of course but if it fails they will contact me swiftly hoping to get their money back from a foolish englishman who does not know he is buying a heap of scrap metal and you will look after mr macintyre do you promise me that i could hardly build the machines myself i know nothing about engineering he will make the machines i will look after the money he might not choose such a solution but im afraid he must be saved from himself bartoli nodded i must get back to work he said quietly i left him i had won i thought but only time would tell the procedure was exactly the same as the previous week except that this time the torpedo was handled as though it was made of the purest and most expensive porcelain it was important that i was nowhere around but i went down to the workshop to see the preliminaries from a distance and to assure myself that all the arrangements were made there was no need to have done so bartoli nodded at me as i approached as if to say dont worry all will be well so i retreated rapidly when i saw ambrosian and two others presumably people from the bank walk up and view the scene for themselves as the boat pulled away from the side of the canal i could see macintyre in a high state of excitement stroking the sleek side of the torpedo lovingly pointing at this part or that very faintly i heard his voice unusually animated as he described in great detail how his torpedo worked what it would do its revolutionary potential i knew that once in such a mood he could probably carry on without a break for hours and i rather pitied the venetians ears then they were gone and there was nothing for me to do except go to my rendezvous with louise which i had fixed for eleven oclock that morning i was in a state of some nervous excitement myself and she picked up my mood we said hardly a word for the next hour but devoured each other as though it was to be our last meal at the end we lay on the bed intertwined until i remembered macintyre dont go she said stay with me very important business i said i need to go and see macintyre its a big day but tell me before i go tell me some news she shook her head there is nothing good i can say that will please you why whats the matter it is my husband he is worse and worse even more violent than you but not to give me pleasure as you do he doesnt seem like that at all do you doubt me think i am a liar of course not i was only saying youve seen the marks the wounds if he broke my leg blackened my eye would you feel happier its only a matter of time you know im sure youll be satisfied eventually that is not what i meant you do not know him she said furious now i am afraid terribly afraid what he might do when one of his attacks comes on him if only i could run away somewhere but that will never be i know that now there will be no escape for me i sat down on the bed once more and took her in my arms she nestled her head against my neck and stroked my hair just being with you gives me courage she said softly but it fades when youre not there i dream of being with you all the time you know the moment i met you i knew you were all i wanted all i ever wanted in the world but you dont feel the same for me i know i do i replied i do then we must be she cried looking me in the eyes somehow we must be it is our fate i know it please tell me you will do this tell me now i cannot you know i cannot you will not you will leave your husband your life it is no life she said scornfully what sort of life is it do you think living in a hovel with a screaming child and a man like that what sort of life is that in comparison to what we could have together just you and me alone it is easy to suggest when you are here in venice away from the judgement of society i said you might think you had made a poor bargain once you returned to england you are thinking of yourself she said bitterly you are happy to meet me here in this little room as long as no one knows but i am not worth a single disapproving glance from society you take everything you want and i give it i am happy to give it i would die for you very well i will be only your whore to give you your pleasure as you want when you want that is enough for me it gives me the only pleasure i have in the world i want nothing you will not give me she fell silent and i said nothing tell me you will take me from him forever tell me now another long silence then i said no i remember it well there was a total silence broken only by the sound of people faintly heard pushing barrows in the street below she had been lying on the bed i next to her suddenly there was a distance between us she curled away and i sat up and the gap became immense and unbridgeable you are like the others she said softly but coldly you want to get rid of me youve found your excuses ive felt it growing in you ive been expecting it just wondering what reasons you were going to give yourself why not just say it directly why pretend it is for my good what others drennan for example i asked still remarkably calm she laughed why are you laughing she shrugged did you give your husband opium the night of the séance prepare the marchesa by giving her information you knew would come out in her trance a little smile of satisfaction but no answer i expected some story i could believe something that reassured me and made me think i had been foolish ever to doubt her but she gave me nothing you want to leave me she said i know you do why not just say so holiday over so back to your little wife in england she stopped looked at me for a second then said coyly and softly dont you think she deserves to know how youve been spending your time what did you say dear mrs stone i was your husbands mistress until he became bored with me he seduced me on a beach while you were sitting at home im be quiet you dont really think you can leave me here and go back to england as if this never happened do you really think that i will never leave you i will follow you to your dying day are you ashamed im not i dont care who knows about you or what they think of me i said enough why whatevers the matter are you upset oh she said in mock sympathy you feel deceived how sad id forgotten youre the only one who can deceive people and tell lies i think i should leave it would be better if i did not see you again for you perhaps not for me i walked to the door and she began to pull on her clothes do you know what im going to do now she said with a smile what i think its time william knew the truth about everything dont you im looking forward to telling him about the time we made love while he was waiting outside how you particularly enjoyed that it might finish him off for good dont you think and once im free of the boy as well it will be your turn she looked at me with such a glance that i felt a shiver run down my spine you will do nothing at all and you are going to stop me how exactly i was silent how much she was the one who said it not me it was a mistake a complete miscalculation she brought everything back into an area i could understand until then she had been in charge i merely responding and what does that mean a word to my husband a letter to your wife how much and what do you suggest i think that would be about right a hundred pounds a year and then i laughed out loud do you know until you said that a little bit of me still felt sorry for you do you really think i am going to keep you for the rest of your life i have done nothing you have not done yourself i owe you no more than you owe me let me tell you how much your silence is worth nothing not a penny you will do nothing and i will give you nothing in return that is fair payment on both sides otherwise you will regret having threatened me more than anything you will regret that she smiled we shall see i was shaking when i left walking fast and trying to get away from that accursed room as quickly as possible the change from complicity to antagonism love to hatred had been so swift so unforeseen that i was trembling with shock how could it have happened i have been so mistaken how could i have made such a terrible error how did i not see more clearly i who prided myself on my judgement it was a lesson for the future but at that moment i was simply too stunned to think clearly what stuck most forcibly in my mind was her lack of emotion had she raged and screamed behaved like some monster or hysteric had she attacked me or fallen on the floor sobbing it would have been more understandable but she behaved like a man of affairs shed done her best it hadnt worked it was time to cut her losses she behaved like me in fact and it was i who was shocked trembling overcome with emotion only her clumsy attempt at blackmail had saved me had she said nothing at all i might well have offered her something but i have never liked to be threatened that changed everything but i remembered the look in her eyes her threats was she capable of carrying them out i thought she was in fact i was certain of it that did not bother me personally at the most it would cause a temporary embarrassment tiresome no doubt but nothing that could not be shrugged off soon enough i had no fear of anything she might do to me cort was another matter and there i did not know what to do i had justified my behaviour with the thought that his mistreatment of her had been so monstrous that his punishment was deserved i had now seen another dark side of her one i did not wish to be close to but those marks those weals and bruises had been real merely because i now recoiled from louise did not mean i felt so much more sympathetic to her husband perhaps they deserved each other so i did nothing and constructed good reasons for my passivity i did not excuse myself though please do not think that i did not blame anyone say that it was the influence of venice or of strange madmen or the light or the sea which had forced me to behave in such a reckless fashion it was i and i alone who was responsible and i was very lucky to have escaped so lightly had it not been for the hints and warnings of marangoni and drennan and of signor casanova whose words had perhaps the greatest effect of all i could easily have been swept away by the elation of passion sworn to love her forever taken her for my own had i done so i would have lived with my error which soon enough would have become clear of that i was sure it took a long time to calm myself walking through the back streets staring out over the lagoon all sights which once pleased me and i now began to find humiliating i was waking up from my reverie fast it was time to move i wanted to leave venice quickly my dream world with louise what i had thought she was at least and of venice were the same thing and it was time to shake free of both neither had any more power over my mind this decision came over me quickly and unconsciously from a state where i was not even considering the question a short while previously i began to think of packing my bags making arrangements to travel it was time to be off bartoli found me in a quiet determined mood when he walked into the café where we had agreed to meet and it took an effort on my part to pay proper attention to his story but it did me good to do so the more we talked the more louise faded from my mind became a problem to be contained and managed nothing more he also needed attention for he was having very severe second thoughts about what he had just done macintyre was distraught halfcrazed with disappointment inconsolable as he told it all had been as before the boat had sailed slowly out to the northern part of the lagoon where they could be fairly sure there would be no prying eyes the torpedo had been prepared and lowered over the side once more the only difference this time was that macintyre had very carefully removed a pin from the front end of the torpedo and held it up for all to see the safety pin he had announced the torpedo is now armed with fiftyfour pounds of guncotton ready to explode the moment this projecting bolt is depressed by impact the sort of impact you would get if it hit the side of a ship macintyre had tugged gently on a rope to line it up with the outline of an old hulk a fishing boat that had run ashore many years before and been abandoned he thought it would be a nice demonstration of his inventions power if this could be reduced to matchwood when all was ready he took a deep breath and pulled out the pin which allowed the air from the pressurised tank to flow down the pipes into the small turbine which turned the propeller this is where bartolis interventions came into play at first all went well the propeller whirred the machine began to move but it quickly became apparent that instead of heading in a dead straight line towards the hulk it was veering very sharply off to the right and only at about two miles an hour rising and falling in the water like a demented porpoise already the bankers were exchanging glances and macintyre was looking distressed worse was to come for it became obvious something bartoli had not intended at all that the machine was describing an erratic circle in the water so that its course would bring it back more or less to where it had started that it was going to hit the boat with that muchadvertised fiftyfour pounds of guncotton ready to explode on impact something like panic had set in everyone trying to figure out where the machine would hit and get as far away from it as possible only macintyre stood there immediately above the likely spot as it lurched towards them then the motor stopped instead of the supposed fourteen hundred yards range it gurgled to a halt after little more than three hundred which was just as well as another five yards and it would have blown the boat and all in it to kingdom come there was a moments silence then with a loud and apologetic burp it sank fortunately they were in a fairly deep part of the lagoon as the torpedo went down head first and exploded the moment it touched the bottom i had never witnessed such a thing but apparently fiftyfour pounds of explosive makes a tremendous bang it must do if it is enough to sink a battleship there was a muffled roar an eruption of water some forty feet high a small tidal wave which almost turned the boat over and everyone got soaked the demonstration had come to its spectacular conclusion macintyres backers were unimpressed to say the least they had seen the machine fail completely they had been soaked and frightened out of their wits the journey back to venice took place in total silence i looked at bartoli as he finished what did you do to it i asked very little really he replied in a tone which did little to disguise his feelings of guilt just a turn of a screw here and a mismatched connection there a bit of weighting to put the gyroscope out little things of the sort macintyre wouldnt notice he certainly wont now i said as its in little pieces what about the bankers he shrugged they didnt say a word not even goodbye they just marched off the boat when it docked and walked away macintyre tried to talk to them say it worked fine really but they didnt want to listen listen i have to go back to him he is really upset and hes drinking he could do something very foolish if hes not watched are you sure we did the right thing absolutely sure i said robustly i fully expect a letter from ambrosian very soon in their view the only way to recover their money will be to persuade me to buy the debt before i realise that the machine is useless news spreads fast in this city so they will have to move quickly or it will be too late if i hear something i will let you know immediately meanwhile go and find macintyre tell him not to despair that all will be well tell him whatever you want but cheer him up i was right when i returned home there was a letter awaiting me in the florid formal italian normal for such letters it informed the illustrious signore me that my proposal concerning the macintyre project had now been put to the board and had been decided upon favourably if i wished to pursue the matter then i should indicate that i wished to purchase the credit note there was also a handwritten note from ambrosian accompanying this formal missive he had worked hard on this matter on my behalf he said and had only persuaded the board to agree because one member was away he was due to return tomorrow and would undoubtedly try to overturn the decision when he heard about it if at all possible then i should come and conclude the deal as quickly as possible otherwise it would be too late i loved the audacity of the man the smooth and reasonable way he managed to tell such enormous lies a fine fellow indeed astute calculating ruthless mendacious it cheered me up considerably i hurried back to the bank as swiftly as i could then dallied a little in order to make him a little more nervous at sixtwenty in the evening just ten minutes before it was about to close i presented myself and asked to see signor ambrosian you may think that i should have attended to other matters perhaps i should have gone myself to tell macintyre what was happening should have gone to see cort i agree i should have done both of these and if i did not it was not because i did not consider both of them but i believed bartoli could take care of macintyre and as for cort what can i say i was not yet ready to face him i am so glad we can reach agreement on this matter i said once i had sat down and accepted the offer of a glass of cold wine as am i he replied with a warm smile although as i said in my letter it was not easy to accomplish but i felt that really we did not want to get involved in the business of setting up factories however excellent mr macintyres machine any profits that might accrue become greatly postponed and we venetians no longer do this sort of thing we prefer to leave it to the more enterprising english and pursue lesser shortterm profits ourselves it is no doubt why england has an empire and venice has lost hers that may be so certainly i think you do not have a ready supply of the necessary engineers managers and skilled workers that would allow you to set up such an establishment here such people can be found more easily in england you will manufacture there i think so the most obvious customer is the royal navy if it will buy every other navy in the world will have to follow suit and it is a patriotic organisation they will not buy foreign wares if they can avoid it in that case i will watch your progress with the greatest interest he said now perhaps we might get the business dealt with then i would be very happy to invite you to dinner that is kind i replied but i feel i should go and find mr macintyre and tell him the news i was just about to go and see him this afternoon in fact when your letter arrived ambrosian ordered a sheaf of papers on his desk turned them round and proffered them to me then you will no doubt have a great deal to discuss when you see him perhaps you wish to read this i am assuming you can read italian if not i will gladly call someone in to translate i said i could manage and spent twenty minutes sipping my wine and struggling through to make sure there was nothing untoward the language was legal but essentially clear and why should there be any hidden catches it was a deed of sale drawn up in a hurry and the object was to get rid of a useless property as quickly and cleanly and as absolutely as possible yes i said eventually now about the price i would have thought he began with a slight frown i am evidently to buy of debt now we have to agree at what price i shall acquire it ambrosian positively beamed at me and reached for the bottle of wine pouring two more glasses before settling back in his seat this of course was exactly what he wanted nothing is more suspicious than someone prepared to pay a full price besides where was the enjoyment in such a miserable straightforward transaction in view of the longterm risks and the inevitable requirement to raise a large amount of additional capital without which this machine is no use at all to you or anyone else i thought a small discount might be in order to reflect the savings to your bank of divesting itself of this loan but you yourself have said how much potential it has and so it has but at the moment it is without value you do not wish to go further with it and i suspect there is no one else in the world who would be prepared to buy it at any price it is a question of discovering a fair rate for relieving your bank of an unwelcome burden and off we went for an hour of pure entertainment which both of us appreciated and which i in particular needed here deception was open and understood emotion under control it was an antidote to my troubles and concerns i suggested that a per cent discount would be the very least i could possibly accept he expressed surprise that i did not consider a price over and above the nominal sum to reflect the risks that the bank had already absorbed i countered that those risks were more than covered by interest payments already received but all the way through i knew he was thinking that the moment i talked to macintyre the value of his loan would go down to nothing immediately either he reached agreement with me soon or he lost his entire investment i gave him an extra and we settled for i bought the sole and complete rights to the most important new weapon seen for a century it was a simpler world then a gentlemans word especially an english gentlemans word was as good as gold quite literally for payment i wrote out a brief note to my bankers in london asking that be paid into credit of the banco di santo spiritos correspondent in the city and that was payment made for even if i turned out to be a charlatan with not enough money in the bank to cover the amount coutts would have felt obliged to pay and ambrosian knew this quite well although i had no doubt that he had already made enquiries about me he placed all the documents into a large thick folder sealed it with a massive seal using prodigious quantities of wax and handed it over to me shaking my hand my congratulations dear sir he said with a smile and may i say how greatly i admire your trust in your fellow countryman i would not so readily take such a risk on something without knowing whether it would fulfil its inventors promises oh goodness ive done that i said as i paused at the door it worked splendidly last week i gather it didnt perform so well today but that is a matter easily fixed no i have no doubt the torpedo has a great future before it i bowed graciously restrained myself from smiling in triumph and left to his credit his face showed no anger at all indeed i think i even saw just a little twitch of appreciation chapter i thought it was time to put macintyre out of his misery and tell him that his future was assured or as assured as i could make it i had refined my calculations over the past few days and what i planned was well within my financial capabilities although i had no doubt i would have to call on friends such as mr cardano for some support at various stages i was excited more excited than i had ever been and it was a welcome distraction from louise the more i thought of torpedoes of banks and factories the less i thought about her my vision was becoming clearer by the minute it was all very well passing my time as i had done in the past few years but the buying and selling of shares and bonds is a secondhand operation removed from the real source of wealth generation and the prospect of organising an enterprise fascinated me i did not i should make it clear intend to become the manager myself i knew my limitations and the daytoday operation of a factory would quickly have wearied me but setting up the way the managers worked within an elegant balanced efficient structure of my own devising this suffused me with pleasurable anticipation made me look forward not back my eyes turned to england and stopped being dazzled by adriatic light i was in a hurry now this beautiful ridiculous old relic was not where things got done was not where money was made it was a distraction only a pause a place where time was wasted lives ruined i needed to inform macintyre get the workshop packed up into crates and the whole lot transported back to england somewhere on the south coast i thought near to water which was obviously necessary for testing not too far away from the great naval bases close enough to a supply of skilled labour and where land was cheap enough so that a large enough site could be acquired with ease so i was in a confident mood although that did not last long when i arrived once more at macintyres workshop it was dark and abandoned i called out rapped on the doors listened for any sound but there was nothing at all nor was he to be found in the little rooms that he and his daughter called home a scruffy decrepit building a few hundred yards away only the girl was there all alone where is your father she shook her head dont you know no hes out i dont know where how long have you been here on your own all day she said it defiantly as though it was the most normal thing in the world i need to find him quickly i have some good news for him will you tell him its important i have very good news for him she hesitated and looked at me suspiciously some inward tussle was going on inside her tousled head you do know where he is dont you she nodded inside she nodded again please let me in i wont say you told me she frowned seriously bit her lip then stepped aside the little sitting room and kitchen were filthy and smelled of old cooking and unwashed clothes dark and dingy the furniture broken down poor child i thought to be brought up like that she said nothing more but simply looked at me seriously disapproval on her face macintyre i called out where are you its stone i need to talk to you there was a thump from the next room as though something had fallen heavily onto the floor and eventually macintyre appeared he was drunk dead drunk redder of face than usual clothes awry stumbling and leaning against the door to keep upright celebrating your good fortune he didnt even manage to scowl are you able to talk course i am he said and slowly walked to the table and sat down heavily what do you want ive been talking to bartoli ive heard about the test is that the reason you are like this he didnt answer so i laid it out to him simply and clearly stopping and checking that he understood what i was saying so you see i concluded all is well you are delivered from the hands of the italian bankers the torpedo is safe and i would guess in about nine months we will be in a position to begin production all we have to do is get everything back to england id gone into too much detail somewhere along the way i had lost him he stared at me head low on his shoulders looking like a confused dimwitted bullock i could see his mouth moving as he tried to follow what i was saying i dont know what he got from my little speech but he didnt seem grateful you did this behind my back my dear macintyre i cried in surprise and with some annoyance i would have told you truly i would but i was meeting signor ambrosian over quite a separate issue and the topic of your machine came up i mentioned that i would greatly like to invest in it and he turned me down pointblank out of the question he told me i did not mention it because there was nothing to mention and then only this afternoon i received a letter saying that hed changed his mind but that i had to make up my mind as swiftly as possible i had to take a decision then and there otherwise all would have been lost youve stolen my invention from me ive not stolen it from you because of your foolishness it wasnt yours anyway let me buy it back then if youre a man of honour its mine you know it is as long as im alive it will be mine you dont have any money ill get some i shook my head no you wont i did not fortunately have to deal with what i would have done if he had been able to find some and whose business will it be he asked sullenly what if i want to enter into partnership with someone else what if i do not wish to have anything to do with you then you will be free to do so i said evenly if you can raise the money to buy back your patent then find a partner willing to work with you and raise the money to finance production but could you really think of someone better to work with you are hopeless with money and you know it leave that to me but you never told me he had fixed on this it was the one point which had penetrated the alcoholic haze and lodged in his mind well i apologise for that if it offends you but do see reason i am not forcing you to do anything you can stay here in debt if you really want to except that the debt will be to me not to ambrosian do you have any objections to entering into a partnership with me yes what are they i dont want to why not because youve cheated me it was hard to keep patience with him why he wasnt dancing up and down for joy was quite beyond me why could he not see how much this was to his advantage listen macintyre i said firmly and calmly trying to impose myself on him you are drunk in a moment i will leave you alone when you are sober we can talk again but bear this in mind before you drink yourself into an even greater stupor i am in a position to put thousands of pounds behind this machine of yours you will have the finest workshop in the world at your disposal your machine will be perfected and manufactured without you having to bother with anything at all all that i am offering you if you think not consulting you is such a betrayal that you wish to turn my offer down then you may do so i do not need you i can manufacture the torpedo without your help and will do so if necessary he let out a bellow of rage and charged at me but was too drunk to cause me any harm i stepped aside and he fell heavily to the floor his daughter ran into the room shooting me a look of such concern and worry as i had never before seen on such a young face i hesitated feeling that at the very least i should assist her even if i was not so very well disposed to the father at that moment but she made it clear i was not wanted she took her fathers head in her arms and began stroking it gently reassuring him like a mother does an infant macintyre caught my eye go away was what he meant leave me in peace i did not entirely though i sent a message round to longman asking if his wife could do me the great favour of calling on the engineer to check all was well i was not wanted but that did not mean the child could cope on her own and mrs longman was a competent woman the sort who could reassure a frightened child and coax a drunken bitter man into resting so i thought at any rate and then i went back to my apartment and slept i was in a thoroughly bad mood what should have been a day of triumph had turned out to be anything but and i was furious that it had been ruined i know macintyre was proud he was disappointed he was humiliated he was an independent man and i had taken that away from him was presenting him with a fait accompli of course he was angry i understood all that but what did he want ruin he would come round and accept that he was lucky to have me look after his interests or he could drink himself to death those were the only real alternatives open to him as i lay in bed i couldnt really care which one he might choose i suppose i had wanted gratitude thanks a look of relief that was naïve of me you rarely get thanks in business for saving people from themselves chapter there was much to do the next day and it started badly awaiting me along with my morning coffee were two letters one was a long tearstained and emotional letter from louise which gave me pause she apologised wholeheartedly blamed herself begged for a second chance to explain everything she was ashamed of what she had said it was only her love for me her fear of losing me which had made her act the way she had she had been happy for the first time in her life she implored me to meet her and talk to her if only so we could say farewell as friends could i bring myself if so she would be waiting at corts palazzo at eleven she didnt want to go to our apartment any more she couldnt face it but the palazzo would be empty we could talk there i almost crumpled the letter up and threw it into the fireplace dismissing it and the writer from my mind but my better side won out i did owe her that at least otherwise everything would be tarnished by a few last bitter words i had no intention of revising my decision but it would be mean and cruel not to give in to her request she deserved that i would go and that would be the end of it thus my decision until i picked up the second letter it was from cardano my dear stone the letter began after my letter about macintyre i write again with some more information trivial no doubt but as i have managed to find out no more for you this is the only additional news i can provide a day or so after the lairds meeting i dined with john delane the editor of the times and was sitting next to mrs jane nevison a charming lady and the wife of one of his correspondents a very pleasant woman who as is usual valiantly tried to pretend some interest in matters financial to keep the conversation going i in turn cast around for something to say which might engage her interest so i began to tell her about your sojourn in venice she had mentioned wishing to visit the city and your impressions of the place i mentioned that some people were actually buying property there and referred to the albemarles and your friend whom they had employed to restore it i had hardly got started however when her face darkened and her voice became quite icy did she know this mr cort i asked when i saw her reaction i added that you had a positive impression of the man she said she did not but had once employed the woman whom he married it was quite a story and i pass it on to you unadorned when she was engaged as a governess miss louise charlton she said had seemed meek and obedient kindly and thoughtful to their two children they admired her for her fortitude as her previous employer had abused her terribly she even showed them red weals on her forearm made with a rope which he had inflicted when she said she was leaving the post what happened however is that very slowly a contented household descended into malevolent backbiting wife and husband fought because this woman dropped remarks about what one had said about the other the children previously devoted to each other began to be jealous they could not understand this until it became clear that their devoted governess had been telling one child that her parents did not love her and preferred the other she was also terribly cruel to them but in a way which for a long time passed unnoticed the boy was frightened of the dark and enclosed places so he would be punished by being locked in a cupboard for hours if he displeased her the girl was mocked told she was ugly that no one would ever love her the children were terrified and did not dare say anything to their parents the parents meanwhile were worried that the children would be upset if they lost the governess they loved so much it all ended apparently because she began to make eyes at one of nevisons young colleagues and started telling him how cruel and abusive were her employers how they beat her half starved her this was a mistake as the young man was devoted to the family and told them what she was saying then everything came out and she was dismissed immediately but she had lasted in the job for nearly a year and it apparently took some time for them all to recover from the experience the last they heard was that she had ensnared this man cort how she managed that mrs nevinson did not know although she suspected that elaborate tales of their brutality had some influence on the matter she said that in her opinion cort would regret his foolishness very rapidly a pity he had not written this earlier i thought i remember that my mood was one of calm of relief even i dismissed her from my mind forever folded the letters carefully and ate my breakfast thinking instead of macintyre and his torpedo when i was done i prepared to make my way to his workshop where i fully intended to spend the entire day then there was a knock on the door and longman walked in you got my message i asked yes i did mrs longman spent the night there and was happy to help the poor girl she is a very sweet child really and devoted to her father its a great shame and has macintyre sobered up yes and gone to keep an appointment with cort how he manages it considering how drunk he was i dont know he must have the constitution of an elephant he wouldnt be stopped he said he had promised that he kept his word even if others didnt thats partly what ive come to see you about in fact im afraid ive just had a very distressing interview with mr cort why i came across him this morning cort that is and he was in a very bad way he looked quite murderous ive never seen him looking so angry he was really very offensive i asked him how he was you know how you do yes yes i said please get on i am a little preoccupied this morning oh indeed indeed well you see he snapped at me and told me to leave him alone he knew all about me and i was lucky he didnt hit me there in the street he was shouting you know made quite a scene what was it about i have no idea i was too insulted to ask i became very angry and walked away and he just stood in the middle of the street screaming abuse at my back that i was a nasty malevolent gossip and much worse i can tell you i was shocked by his behaviour he looked it too merely recalling the incident made him shake and grow pale he didnt even give a hint what he was talking about no but he was particularly rude about you oh he said that if he ever cast eyes on you again he was going to kill you so i thought id better warn you well im sure he didnt mean it i very much hope not but he looked perfectly capable of it we know he can be violent and if youd seen the look on his face shed done it i knew it shed told him it was all too easy to imagine how much shed enjoyed it i felt an overwhelming tide of guilt sweep over me at the thought of that poor tormented man and how i had not only increased his anguish but enjoyed doing so seen myself almost as meting out deserved punishment i had been louises instrument but i had become like her also the realisation made me grow cold and numb i tried to shake it off with a gratuitous insulting concern for the man i had so wounded you didnt try to stop him reason with him of course i did but he was completely deranged if youd seen him so you have said he frightened me quite a bit i dont mind telling you well what do we do i think we need to call on dr marangoni again ive done that of course that was the first thing that came into my mind i told him to meet us at the palazzo im fairly certain thats where cort was going really yes perhaps we should go there as well will you accompany me i also sent a message to drennan hes the sort whos good in a crisis i think cort might need to be restrained stopped from doing himself harm and we left as quickly as possible once i had prepared myself i took a stout walking stick with me i think because longman had alarmed me with the thought of a murderous cort we walked through the rabbit warren of streets and passageways i wish i could say we ran but longman was quite incapable of it i was glad he was with me even though his barely concealed pleasure at the possibility of some sort of scene irritated me he had lived in venice for years and knew every street for about the first time in my stay i arrived at my destination without getting lost two workmen were standing outside the gate which was closed drennan was also there pushing against the door he looked slightly concerned which was alarming drennan never looked concerned about anything whats going on i dont know apparently a few days ago cort had asked macintyre to come and help him knock down some pillar macintyre showed up about an hour ago and went inside some sort of argument started and cort began screaming at him then he pushed all the workmen out and locked the doors what was it about they didnt really understand it but apparently cort said something about people wanting to take his building as well as well drennan shrugged look he pointed at one of corts workmen who had a reddening swelling eye and a look of fury on his face that was cort i asked incredulously so it appears macintyre went into the building and cort became quite deranged started screaming at the men pushing them and when one protested he hit him then he picked up a sledgehammer and ran at them with it calling them all thieves and traitors so they retreated not surprisingly but theyre worried theyre good people and they like him even though they think hes a bit mad macintyre can look after himself though longman said uncertainly maybe but can cort drennan replied perhaps we should try shouting over the wall longman suggested and so we did but it was no use the entrance to the building was many yards back across the courtyard the wall was high the door thick had either macintyre or cort been outside they would have heard but not if they were inside drennan and i looked at each other what do you think drennan shrugged i dont imagine anything really bad can happen i cant imagine cort really picking a fight with macintyre hes half his size theres several boxes of explosives in there though one of the men said the big englishman brought them two days ago we were told they were dangerous and werent allowed to go near them then drennan took charge he talked to the men and one of them turned and left the other gestured for us both to follow him hes got a boat we can row round to the front of the palace on the canal and see if we can get in through the main door its probably locked though whats the other one doing i sent him to get marangoni to hurry up we walked down the alleyway to the canal and in a few moments the little boat came along rowed by one of the workmen who looked remarkably placid considering how agitated we were he was a good rower and a taciturn one he gestured us to get in then he rowed us swiftly and silently along a tiny inlet and then out into the canal which went past the main entrance of the palazzo i recognised it immediately it was the building the old man had sung below i could see the window the place where the torch had flickered i looked back and saw the bridge that i had been standing on under normal circumstances i would have been impressed seen from water level it seemed huge four storeys high with complex gothic windows on the main floor neglected and imposing even in its decrepit state covered with stucco which had once been painted a rich red but was now blotchy and with weeds growing out of the crevices in the brickwork it loomed over you like some vast polychrome monolith the main door was large and covered in a heavy iron grille which although rusting was more than strong enough to keep us out it would need specialist tools or an expert locksmith to open it drennan pointed at a small hole in the side of the building only about five feet high the place where once supplies had been brought in it was a dark forbidding place only just higher than our heads as we sat in the boat the rower obediently dipped his oars into the water once more and propelled us towards it the ceiling of the corridor which ran along the left side of the house was dank and slimy and the darkness was total until our eyes adjusted but we soon enough made out a little landing stage over to the right beyond it there seemed to be the faintest outline of a door we slipped and stumbled our way out of the boat and onto the slimy stone drennan in the lead and me following he got to the door first and fumbled for a latch a clunking scratching sound told me hed found it then i heard him grunt and the crack of old wood as he put his shoulder against the door and pushed a splinter of light dark by normal standards but almost blinding to our eyes and a great relief as well we were in drennan led the way through and i came after him bumping into his back when he stopped to listen it was all completely quiet not a sound could be heard not even the water lapping against the landing behind us cort i shouted macintyre where are you no reply drennan started moving again his feet on the stone floor making no noise at all and i became preoccupied with the loud clatter of my boots as i followed drennan seemed to know what he was doing he walked a few steps then stopped his head cocked to listen then he walked a few more after one longer pause he turned to me and pointed we crept quietly up a short stone staircase into a huge room which must have been about the same size as the great reception rooms on the floors above there we came across a terrible sight macintyre was lying on the ground one arm above his head blood trickling from a wound in the back of his skull not serious perhaps there was not much blood but the blow had been enough to knock him unconscious cort was sitting on a rickety wooden chair beside him a flame in one hand chin resting on the other in between was a column of masonry reaching perhaps fifteen feet into the air and around it were half a dozen packages with a long string coming out of the side curled round into neat circles and lying on the floor cort i called what the hell is going on here he turned and looked at me ah stone he said in an entirely normal voice about time too ive been waiting for you what are you doing he said nothing what happened to macintyre he tried to take over said i didnt know what i was doing ive had enough of his patronising attitudes will you come outside i think we should have a talk ive nothing to say to you stone i never want to talk to you again i know whats been going on louise told me how could you how could you do that to such a sweet kind woman do what i know everything you thought shed be too ashamed to tell me and she was almost she was in tears crying her eyes out as she told me what youd done to her what are you talking about she showed me the bruises the marks of the rope everything told me what youd done to her i should kill you for it youre a monster a beast even to think of doing something like that to a woman shes been telling you lies she said you would say that but she told me about you stone how you attacked her raped her the poor defenceless sweet woman and its all my fault if only i hadnt brought her here been able to give her the sort of life she wanted but it will be all right ill look after her now i love her so much from the moment i saw her i loved her i must look after her cort dont be absurd i said this is nonsense she told me the same things about you shes a liar cort she says these things oh mr drennan cort said frighteningly conversational again drennan had been moving softly around the column as i talked please stand where i can see you otherwise i will put this match into the gunpowder here it will only take a moment to ignite it would you be so kind as to stand next to mr stone drennan did as he was told listen cort i said urgently and as calmly as i could manage its not true do you understand its not true she does that to herself i know she does ive got proof back at my rooms do you want to see it no one has been beating her whipping her anything shes been saying things like that for years its all invented who would invent a thing like that he snarled reverting to his furious demented state in an instant are you saying my wife is a liar havent you done enough already look at me he did suddenly but only briefly obedient his eyes were glassy wide open and dark as they had been on the night of the marchesas séance cort youve taken opium of course i havent she gives it to you what did she give you to drink or eat youre lying i can always tell when someone is lying he was lying too he said gesturing at the still immobile macintyre he said he was only trying to help only trying to help only trying to help he said in a highpitched childish mimicry which bore no resemblance at all to the way macintyre spoke so you hit him he nodded and these explosives i continued trying to keep his mind focused on the conversation who set those up macintyre did he brought them over a few days ago once theyre prepared the rest is quite straightforward i just added the rest of the boxes the ones he didnt use i dont need help i can do this job on my own wait and see but cort youve used all of it far too much drennan said in alarm listen i know about explosives theres enough there to blow up half of venice no no just enough to bring down that column look ill show you his face cleared and he smiled and he leaned forward and lit the fuse which began sputtering macintyre told me the fuse would last for about ninety seconds dont come any closer mind i can still set off the whole thing ill stay here to make sure it doesnt go out dont worry ill be quite safe macintyre will help im not going without macintyre and you drennan said i could hear that even he was now very worried no cort moved nearer to the explosives the flame now perilously close whats the point of you killing yourself how can you look after her if you die as well ill be fine dont worry about me i know what im doing then ill take care of stone i looked at drennan i didnt know what to do i rather hoped he did hed been a soldier hadnt he i could see him looking carefully his eyes darting from cort to macintyre to the explosives back again measuring calculating and i could see that he was giving up we were about four yards away too far a distance to grab cort and bring him to the ground before he saw what we were doing he only had to move his hand a couple of inches about a minute left i would guess cort said thoughtfully let us take macintyre just in case oh no he has to supervise he insisted on it he said he wouldnt trust me to pull a cork out of a bottle drennan took hold of my arm come on he said quietly we have to get out of here we cant we have to do something what do you suggest macintyre is going to die and so is cort and we will too unless you start moving i wish i had been more heroic i wish i could have seen an opportunity to dash forward and grab corts arm i wish i could have thought of something to say to bring cort to his senses or at least distract him for a moment and give drennan a chance i wish many things now and that is enough to indicate that i managed none of them drennan had to drag me out not because of my determination to stay but because i had frozen could not move he dragged me to the door about thirtyfive seconds left then pushed me down the steps only when i fell on the slippery floor did i come alive again and the panic swept over me i got up stumbled i remember it all and then ran into the darkness heedless of where i was going just following the sound of drennans feet we got back to the boat drennan screaming at the man we had left behind twenty seconds fell into it so hard that it almost capsized the american reaching out at the same time to pull the painter loose and push the boat away from the side fifteen seconds began to row furiously seeing the light of the day outside come closer and closer ten seconds got halfway into the normality of the canal outside the boats laden with fruit clothes wood people calling to each other some singing five seconds then we were clear but still heading across the canal drennan shouting like some lunatic at the other boats telling them to get out of the way keep their heads down two seconds and i looked back and up and saw cort standing by the window the one i had once seen open as an old man had sung below it he rested his elbow on the sill his chin on his hand he looked content there was a tremendous explosion followed by another and another as other charges ignited around the column masonry and plaster and roof tiles began flying through the air and the inside of the building was suddenly lit up by a bright red and orange light something like a tidal wave swept outwards across the canal our boat capsized and so did many others which were on our side of the palazzo fruit and vegetables and washing and people were flung into the water and when i rose gasping to the surface and looked back i could see that the entire roof and upper storeys of the building had vanished the thin walls had collapsed like paper falling inwards with a deafening noise a huge cloud of dust rising above the scene pushed upwards by the blast drennan and i managed to get to our boat which had spun round so completely it was now the right way up again half full of water but floating then the masonry flung into the air by the explosion began crashing down into the canal like some bombardment enormous fountains of water erupted randomly one boat was sunk by a piece of what looked like a chimney windows were smashed and brickwork stoved in people were screaming running lying on the ground with their heads in their hands our oarsman had swum for the far side and i saw him dragging himself out of the water palefaced but apparently unharmed then i looked around the water was littered with debris and people thrown out of the boats men and women alike were panicking and were being rescued i grabbed a woman who was sinking and got her to hang on to the side of our boat drennan and i tried to push her into it but she was too fat her clothes too heavy with water and she started screaming and hitting us instead so we stopped and began pushing her to the side a crowd was gathering by the edge of the canal some were jumping in to assist others were just looking openmouthed at the catastrophe before them we said nothing we were too out of breath too much in shock to say a word but our boat eventually drifted close to the far side of the canal and drennan started kicking with his feet to finish the job i helped then we pulled ourselves round until we were within reach of outstretched arms waiting to pull us out and drop us on the warm stone where we lay panting furiously from terror and exhaustion drennan recovered much faster than i standing up shakily and accepting a thick blanket to wrap around his shoulders i took longer but eventually stood my legs shaking so much i almost sank back to the ground again at least it didnt look as though any passersby had been hurt they had been given a nasty shock and a soaking that was the extent of it but i knew there was no hope for the other two nothing could have survived that anyone inside must surely have died then drennan touched my arm and pointed a body was being dragged from the water and people were shouting for assistance it was cort he was mortally pale and blood had soaked the sleeve of his black coat and matted his hair but he seemed to be alive at least those around him seemed to think so as they were shouting for a doctor to come as quickly as possible laying him with touching gentleness on the ground holding his hand he must have been blown through the window drennan said softly and macintyre you think no hope there none he said no more but i knew he must be right the engineer had been lying only about two feet from the main explosive charge that alone quite apart from the falling masonry and fire would have killed him instantly we will be questioned by the authorities drennan said quietly we need to decide what we will say the truth i imagine but drennan nodded at cort and what about him i looked at corts poor white face and felt suddenly sick i knelt back on the ground and leant my forehead on the stone trying desperately to control the violent heaving of my stomach i failed drennan dragged me upright again and shook me violently pull yourself together he hissed in my ear we have to get away from here before the authorities arrive we can go and talk to them later when we know what were doing follow me quickly no one paid much attention to us as we disappeared into a little side alley then hurried off i took drennan back to the marchesas where i ordered hot water from the maidservant and insisted that it be brought immediately faster than immediately then we went to my rooms stripped off and wrapped ourselves in towels to wait neither of us said a word i slumped in a chair conscious only of the smell of rank mud that was in my nose and my hair and all over my body drennan paced up and down impatiently but was no more capable of speech than i i poured two large tumblers of italian brandy harsh unpleasant stuff but strong and effective and we drank that instead then another until the water arrived and was poured into the tin bath by the servants then we were done and dressed drennan looking slightly baggy in a borrowed suit for he was smaller than i listen drennan i have to tell you something go ahead i do not think that what we witnessed today was cort murdering macintyre no i believe we witnessed louise cort trying to murder her husband i sat down and told him very meticulously and honestly everything that had happened he showed no surprise indeed gave no reaction at all i ended by handing him the letters which had been delivered that morning he looked at them and gave them back i see so you are afraid no i am not afraid of her at the moment i am afraid for the boy the last time i spoke to her she said all she had to do was to free herself of her husband and the boy then she would deal with me i didnt take her seriously then but now it worries me drennan stood up do you want me to go to his lodging and see if youre up to it i would be very grateful more grateful than i can say i do not think my going would help i think that is right he left and i sent word for the marchesa to ask for a few moments of her time she heard me out impassively then sighed sadly that poor man of course i knew such a thing would happen his aura just stop this rubbish about spirits and auras i snapped we havent got time cort has killed a man he might be insane but if so it was your ridiculous séance that set him off how is that going to look when it gets round this city eh the spirits retreated whence they came as the marchesa realised her peril scandal has killed as many people as knives and bullets if it was just your reputation then i wouldnt care too much but macintyre had a daughter cort has a son and there is cort as well who is now likely to spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum if he is lucky well he must be packed off to england immediately she said breezily as for the dreadful accident which claimed the life of poor mr macintyre it wasnt an accident the dreadful accident she repeated which happens when people play with explosives you cannot possibly think anyone will believe i think people believe the simplest explanation she stood up i must talk to signor ambrosian he is a friend and is powerful enough to tell the police how to proceed i dont want what you want is of no importance mr stone you do not know this city nor how it works i do and it sounds to me as if you have caused enough trouble already you will leave it to me to arrange matters as i see fit go and rest and do nothing until i get back i was left alone for the rest of the afternoon until well in the evening it was dark before the marchesa got back under any other circumstances i would have been taken aback by her sudden transformation from ethereal spiritualist to political manipulator but nothing could surprise me any more that day marangoni was with her cort was fine he said hes some burns cuts bruises and a broken collarbone but thats all he was extraordinarily lucky physically that is he continued as for his mental state well that is another matter im afraid he has had a total breakdown not unexpected but unfortunate nonetheless well we shall see how he is in a few days time luckily he is in hospital so he wont bump into his wife what do you mean she was brought to me a few hours ago i am beginning to resent being used as a convenient way of hushing up english scandals you know why for having set fire to her apartment block with her child still in it when they realised there was a blaze all the occupants fled into the street in panic but no one thought to check corts apartment drennan did when he arrived and he was nearly too late he kicked in the door very bravely i must say as the fire was a bad one scooped up the infant and ran down the stairs with it the child has a burn on his left arm and drennan has a bad cut on his cheek from flying glass apart from that they are both fine but many peoples apartments and possessions have been destroyed its a bad mess at that moment i felt more grateful to drennan than i could express he had saved me as well what makes you think she started it she was seen doing it he said and she was later found at the railway station about to board a train to switzerland she had all her money clothes jewellery and passport with her everything but her child and her husband in fact and her reaction when she was told her son had been saved from a fire was not that of a loving mother when i also told her that both her husband and you had had a narrow escape her response was so violent she had to be restrained so what happens to her that is out of my hands of course it will depend on what the authorities think appropriate they will regard it as a terrible misfortune the marchesa said firmly will they yes you are a lucky man mr stone she continued turning her attention to me you have friends with influence signor ambrosian was most concerned about your mishap and will interest himself in the matter the explosion was indeed an accident apparently caused by the carelessness of mr macintyre as for mrs cort she must be dealt with in a manner which causes no embarrassment and thats it well there is of course the question of mr macintyres daughter and corts son there i dont know i suppose we must ask mr longman what is to be done that is his job st jamess square london march pm dear cort you will find with this letter a bundle of papers which i wish you to keep entirely confidential it will explain my current actions as you above all men need to know in the package you will find all the relevant documents concerning the battleships and guidance as to how you should proceed over the coming months you will also find a memoir which to my mind is of greater significance you will see from those pages how my rise to success began and it will also tell you of my involvement with your mother many long years ago you will finally know the circumstances of your fathers breakdown and why you were abandoned it was my doing your mother was a terrible woman i say this frankly i have little sympathy for her but if she was mad then it was i who drew out that madness and turned it from petty cruelty into something much more dangerous marangoni used to say that the madness of the degenerate was latent and needed merely the right circumstances to awaken it perhaps so perhaps such fury builds up over the generations until it bursts out like some festering sore perhaps i was merely the trigger not the underlying cause i do not know i do not excuse myself with such arguments her punishment was harsh but at the time i regarded it as a relief a satisfactory solution to a problem which allowed me to forget all about it i do not claim that i was better than she merely more fortunate your father broke down completely after these events and never properly recovered he was always of an excessively sensitive temper and the duties placed on him in venice were too great he was an easy target for someone like louise who not only tormented him but enjoyed his suffering drennan accompanied him back to england and i ensured that he never wanted for anything in the financial way it was little enough to do he was a kind gentle man who deserved better i also made the necessary arrangements to allow mr and mrs longman to look after esther macintyre and continued paying her an allowance when she married i did this because i knew that although my title to macintyres torpedo was perfectly legal i had in reality all but stolen it by subterfuge it was far more valuable than the sum i paid for it and a more honest person would have admitted this fact and made greater amends in my ambition i did not make any such admission and i clung to a belief in my integrity in the laws of business instead it is now time to give that illusion up i have made provision for signora vincotti in my will but i do not wish her to know the reason behind it now i must proceed to more important matters that is the other provision in my will which i told you was merely to block undue inquisitiveness in case i died that was not its origin which lay more with a last conversation with your father just before he died it was very important for him to see me that one last time i did not know why there was im glad to say no trace of the old bitterness in him even though he was more than justified in hating me louise had told him she was going to have my child she had told him this in their last conversation when her cruelty and taunting sent him mad with despair it was her special way of goading him a way to prove his weakness and failure to demonstrate how completely i had taken her from him i did not take it seriously she was a habitual liar and prepared to say whatever she felt would have the greatest effect but once he had told me i could not let it rest i began making enquiries it took a considerable time to get the asylum in venice to respond and i had to apply considerable pressure to break through the walls of confidentality which surround such places it would have been easy had marangoni still been alive but he died in at the age of only fortyeight his files live on however he did as he was told although with some resentment louise was declared insane incarcerated without a hearing or charge by administrative fiat a simple solution to an awkward problem as the marchesa said i had influential people on my side louise did not she was never released while he was alive and was kept perpetually in that wing given over to the dangerous the raving and the incurable such people are allowed no hearings and no appeal and it sent her truly insane but when he died she won her freedom she apparently gave no more sign of being dangerous and the hospital was overcrowded she never tried to contact me i think she knew quite well what my response would have been had she done so instead she became a medium madame boninska and adopted what she remembered from the marchesa as her only way of making a living she travelled the continent performing tricks of the far beyond eking out a penurious living duping the foolish mixing this in with a little blackmail and emotional torture she was good at that it was if you like her natural calling but there had been a child for once she had told your father the truth even though she did so out of cruelty and a desire to hurt it was taken from her at birth as is usual she was never allowed to touch it or see it marangoni took care of everything he knew her by then he knew what she was capable of and what being the child of such a creature might mean it was tainted by bad blood degenerate the wrong circumstances could bring that out in the next generation and begin the cycle again only an entirely safe environment might counteract the tendency even then i imagine he was not hopeful so the child was hidden from its mother in the forests of bureaucracy with no name and no identity no birth certificate nothing and he destroyed all records of where it had gone adopted by a family one in a town nearby the records were silent i was told his successors told me the truth i could sense it from their letter they did not have to deny me knowledge and did not have to lie they simply did not know but louise looked this was clear from the record she had left the asylum and the notes had recorded her intentions not you she never once asked about you in the twentythree years she spent in that place in her eyes you were your fathers child not hers but the other one the one she gave birth to in the asylum that one she wanted to find that one was hers she knew it felt it in her blood as i had never heard from her again i assumed she had not succeeded or that the child was dead but i found i wanted to know about this infant my child and she was the one person who might be able to tell me something i became almost obsessive in a way that business never affected me you know me there well enough the greatest problems the biggest projects are things i take in my stride even disaster and failure make me lose no sleep this did i became preoccupied it played on my mind elizabeth saw it and worried but i was too ashamed to tell her what concerned me i know all about her life and what it was like but she has never done a cruel thing i did not want to acknowledge how much better a person she was than i so all in secret when i should have been concentrating on other things i looked for louise cort as my one chance of finding the truth eventually i got a lead from germany and instructed xanthos to go and make sure it was really her i would not go myself the idea of seeing her once more frightened me what did he say to her what did she reply i do not know i have not seen him since he always finds a reason to be out of the country plotting away and thinking i am unaware of his ambitions but whatever passed between them it brought her to london and produced several whingeing letters asking for money threatening hinting but empty she knew i wanted something that was all she did not know what a few days ago i went to see her and again this afternoon she never knew the significance of what she told me any feeling of sympathy or remorse for her evaporated on meeting her again she has spread nothing but cruelty in this world and now she is my end as well she will have her final triumph mine is that she will never know what it was oh she was foul rank wheedling disgusting i could hardly bear to talk to her could not sit down in the same room why dont we talk over old times you loved me once no i didnt i never did any more than she ever loved me she never knew the meaning of the word and until i met elizabeth neither did i we deserved each other i have no doubt but neither your father nor macintyre deserved either of us they were better men than that she was too addled in her brain to know what i was asking could not put the pieces together all she wanted was money she could have had it all if she had given me a different answer she got the money much good would it do her oh her lovely little child so cruelly snatched from her mothers arms but a mothers love is insatiable she tracked it down almost had found the woman who had taken it away persuaded her to say such a long way they had sent it so she would never suspect she outwitted them she was clever but fate was cruel she was defeated again it had gone by the time she got there walked out it was working nearby she went to see the child had fled oh she looked certainly she looked a child in trouble needs a mothers love but not a sign nor a trace was there ever again and there were only a few more questions left to ask i didnt expect the answers to be anything but banal uninteresting a tidying up i was perfectly calm almost relaxed just a bit of unfinished business before i could leave i almost didnt bother to ask at all was it a boy or a girl a girl where was this lausanne what was the name of the family stauffer and her name elizabeth i was wrong i thought that i had left venice behind me when i travelled back to england with macintyres machinery but it has been with me all my life i have now made my preparations swiftly and inadequately no doubt but they will serve i must carry out my plans before i weaken and i have a change of heart i am a coward physically i know myself well it will not be easy to take the necessary steps all too easy to find some reason for changing my mind but i must not weaken this is the only entirely satisfactory end many people will be inconvenienced because of what i am about to do but i do not care elizabeth would suffer if i acted differently and that i could not bear i cannot remain with her i cannot ever see her again for fear that i would confess the terrible truth that i learned this afternoon i cannot even say goodbye nothing must suggest anything other than an accident she would work to find out the truth she is a very intelligent determined woman as you know despite my efforts to protect her she might succeed you must know this cort you owe me nothing had i acted differently your father might perhaps have held on to his frail health long enough to be a proper parent i do not apologise for using you in the matter of barings in paris and i imagine you do not expect such an apology these things happen in politics and in business my only mistake there was assuming you were sufficiently worldly wise to expect it equally i do not think that watching you over the years pays off my debt to you in any way had things been otherwise you would not have needed me but you do owe a debt to elizabeth you took it on in paris when you were willing to sacrifice her for the sake of some gold you were her friend she trusted you and you betrayed her to vent your anger at me i did not understand it at the time but i fear the cruelty of your mother lives on in you you enjoyed what you did that night too much i saw it in your eyes and i know that you have tried to justify yourself since by thinking that i too was prepared to do the same if necessary that i had drennan acquire her diaries that i might use them myself you were wrong even then i would have allowed the entire empire to crumble to protect her and you killed the man who saved you from the flames the bill you incurred then is outstanding and i am calling it in it is your only chance of throwing off for ever that terrible inheritance which lies within you you must hide or destroy this memoir of mine ensure louise cort never grasps the truth and watch over your halfsister for the rest of your life enduring her hatred of you never saying a word your father is part of you as well you will comply with my wishes i love elizabeth more than anything else in my life i would gladly and willingly have given up every last penny i possessed for her she could have asked anything and i would have done it she is my love to see her sleep to see her smile to see the way she rests her head on her hand as she sits reading on the settee that is all i have ever needed this is my wife and for every moment of the past twenty years i have loved her as a wife she is the best person i have ever known how that is i do not understand perhaps the cruelty and malice of her parents cancelled each other out and by some miracle produced a woman who has neither i do not know all i know is that i would have laid down my life for her now i will my sins the sins of venice have defiled the one person i have loved the woman i should have protected and nurtured i am married to my own daughter the child i should have held in my arms and loved as a father whom i should have brought up cherished seen married seen holding children in her arms instead i consigned her to a cruel childhood and then a terrible fate i saw with my own eyes what i had done when i was confronted with the hideous product of our union but i did not recognise as such until now it is too great to bear i can no longer live with her and i cannot live without her as long as she knows nothing she will miss me and regret my passing and will be able to build a new life a happy one her husband who was getting on in years tripped on a carpet and fell from a window sad he was a loving husband but he never liked heights she will mourn and i hope forget she is young enough to remarry and will be wealthy beyond care i had wished to grow old with her older i should say and that is no longer possible she will instead carry a fond memory of me rather than the repelled loathing that she must feel if she knew the truth she has done nothing wrong in her entire life except love me you thought i did not know of her past i knew nearly everything but i could find out nothing about her origins her story began at that orphanage in lausanne there was no trace of the identity of her mother or her father no notion where she had been born or even when i looked but came up with nothing she was an orphan and what did it matter who or what her parents were i loved her too much to be bothered by her way of life so why should matters so far beyond her control be of any importance why should i have connected her with the ravings of a monster in venice years before cajoling a man with a tale to bend him to her will in a few moments i will open the window that has been waiting for me for near half a century i do not fear it that old venetian has been patient and will wait a few moments longer all those things of which i was so proud which gave me such satisfaction have fled from my mind as if they had never happened all those businesses those tangled connections of money will unravel when i am dead i leave it to you to salvage what you can if you wish in a few short years everything i have done will fade and be forgotten as i will be and deserve to be very well let it be so with thanks to charlotte bannisterparker felicity bryan véronique cardi dan franklin julie grau kalypso nikolaides lyndal roper nick stargardt
